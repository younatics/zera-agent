"(CNN) -- On the night where one of the club's greats may have played his final game, a new star shone brightly. Ryan Giggs may have appeared in the famous red shirt for the last time in his illustrious career although the 40-year-old has yet to confirm his retirement. Giggs, who has presided over the team as interim manager since the sacking of David Moyes, looked emotional as he spoke to supporters following the 3-1 victory against Hull City. It was a night when Giggs gave youth its chance and was repaid handsomely as 18-year-old James Wilson gave a glimpse of the future. Wilson, who has progressed through the ranks at Old Trafford, scored twice on his debut -- not bad for a player who wasn't even born when Giggs won his first title with United. Giggs' future is unclear with just one match of the season remaining -- and he looked to be feeling the emotion during his short speech. ""I'd just like to say a big thank you from all the players and all the staff for your support this year,"" Giggs said as he addressed the crowd at the end of the game. ""We know it's been tough this season and over the years we've been spoiled with the success we've had, but you've always supported the team and the staff, and I'm sure in the coming years we'll bring you more success. ""I'd just like to say keep supporting us, you've seen a little glimpse of the future, we always play attractive football -- keep supporting us and the good times will come back soon."" Giggs, the most decorated player in the history of British football, has won 13 league titles with United, two Champions League crowns and a host of cups since making his debut as a teenager against Everton in March 1991. A one-club man, the Welshman has become synonymous with the Alex Ferguson era where United dominated English football. He will now await to see who the club bring in to replace Moyes on a permanent basis -- but whoever takes over appears to have found a gem in young Wilson. The striker, who has scored goals for United's younger teams throughout his time at the club, is one of the most highly-rated young English players in the country. A regular for the England under-19 side, Wilson showed his class to net twice before Robin van Persie secured victory. It was also an emotional night for defender Nemanja Vidic. The Serbia defender was given a great send-off by the home crowd following his final appearance in an United shirt at Old Trafford. The 32-year-old, who will join Inter Milan at the end of the season, established himself as one of the best defenders in the Premier League after arriving from Spartak Moscow in 2005. Vidic won five league titles and the 2008 Champions League during his time with the club but will test himself in Italy's Serie A. ""I had so many great times here,"" Vidic told the crowd. ""It is hard to speak because of the emotions. Most importantly I would like to thank the players, the manager and all the coaches. Thank you for everything and especially to the fans, you have been fantastic to me all these years."" Sassuolo shock . Meanwhile, in Italy, minnow Sassuolo produced an astonishing 4-3 victory away at Fiorentina to secure three vital points in its battle against relegation. Domenico Berardi scored a hat-trick for the visiting team and while Giuseppe Rossi managed his first goal since returning from injury, Fiorentina was unable to stave off defeat. That result ends Fiorentina's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League -- which was confirmed by third-place Napoli's win over Cagliari. Dries Mertens, Goran Pandev and Blerim DÅ¾emaili scored the goals to wrap up a comfortable 3-0 win for the home side.","Manchester United defeats Hull City in Premier League .

"(CNN) -- Chabedi Thulo looks at the camera proudly. ""In my mouth, I got stitches. In my legs, I got stitches too,"" he announces. Thulo is one of the subjects featured in ""Staff Riding,"" a five-minute digital documentary by Italian filmmaker Marco Casino about a subculture of train surfers in Katlehong -- one of South Africa's largest and poorest townships (""staff riding"" is the local slang for train surfing). The illegal ""sport"" attracts many of the community's young men, who perform tricks and dance moves on top of moving trains. Casino notes that the trains, which deliver many of the township's workers and students into nearby Johannesburg, plays a pivotal role in the region. ""People from the township use the train every day. There's a really strong connection here to the trains, and I think train surfing is something that came out of that relationship,"" he says. The dangers are numerous for those that practice the activity. Train speeds aside, these young daredevils have to constantly dodge 3,000-volt cables overhead. ""They don't really care about the risks. Some of them figure, 'if I do this dangerous stuff on top of the train, my friends will respect me more,'"" says Casino. After stumbling upon an online video of the world's 10 most dangerous sports that listed train surfing as near the top, Casino became curious about the practice. His inquires led him to Katlehong, where he spent a month getting to know the local community of staff riders. The film recently won Best Short Feature in the 2014 World Press Photo Multimedia Contest. ""I didn't know what to expect, but what I found is that it's really about social redemption,"" he says. It makes sense. Katlehong is hardly a land of opportunity, especially not for young people. Like many townships in East Rand, Katlehong played a prominent role during the anti-apartheid movement, though living conditions have changed little since apartheid ended. According to the 2011 census, the youth unemployment rate in Ekurhuleni (the municipality of which Katlehong is a part) is 37%. ""A lot of these guys are really young, from 15 to 25 years old. Most of them are unemployed and have traumatic family situations. This is a way for them to socially reinvent themselves,"" says Casino. Some seem to use the practice as a vent their frustrations. ""It's a way you can express your feelings,"" Thulo says in the film. ""You want to take out the anger. Instead of beating someone or robbing them, you just express your anger."" Casino notes that many young people have lost one or both parents, either due to AIDS, drugs or general poverty. ""A lot of the guys I met grew up with their grandparents, who are old and don't really have the energy or power to stop them doing this,"" he says. Though Casino shot footage from atop some of the trains, he admits that he was ""gripping the irons."" ""If you make one little mistake, you're dead,"" he says. ""The last day of filming, two guys died while train surfing. I also met a lot of people that got injured and survived, which is not so common, because most of the time, they die."" The film features one such survivor: Sibusiso Linda, a sweet-faced, ambitious youth who dreams of working in advertising, and who unfortunately has suffered multiple amputations following a staff riding accident. ""Most of them don't even realize the value of their own lives,"" says Casino. ""For me, realizing that was one of the worst parts of this project.""","South African train surfers ride on top of moving trains .

"(CNN) -- It wouldn't be a finale to ""The Walking Dead"" without at least a few moments that make you gasp, and Sunday night's season ender certainly delivered. Last week, several survivors, including Glenn and Maggie, arrived at Terminus in what was promised to be a safe haven, but was it really? We caught up this week with Rick, Carl and Michonne -- interspersed with flashbacks to the comparatively idyllic life back at the prison -- and they too had a rough road to Terminus. Here are some of the big moments from this week's episode: . 1. Joe meets Rick again . Just when it almost seemed like Rick's trio had it all figured out (he even created a new way to trap game), they were set upon by Joe and his up-to-no-good crew of ""rule followers"" with Daryl in tow. Despite Daryl begging for mercy, Joe's men started to beat him to death, while others set upon Carl and Michonne. 2. Rick fights back, big time . When Rick saw his son in trouble, he moved his head back and injured Joe, whose gun went off. Rick -- well, there's no other way to put this -- then bit Joe on the neck and went after the rest of his crew, including the man who attacked Carl, repeatedly stabbing him to death. The other survivors couldn't believe what they were seeing. Needless to say, don't mess with Carl. On the bright side, Daryl is back. He and Rick are like brothers now, too. The post-racial revolution will be televised . 3. Welcome to Terminus . Rick, Daryl, Michonne and Carl finally arrived at Terminus -- sneaking in through the back, of course. The moment Rick noticed one of the denizens of Terminus wearing Hershel's watch (now owned by Glenn), he pulled a gun on someone -- and wait, isn't that woman wearing Maggie's poncho, too? It just wouldn't be a finale without a shootout, and we certainly got one as Rick and crew fired against Gareth and the rest from Terminus. 4. What is this place? Entrails seen in a courtyard? A room where the words ""Never again"" are painted on the walls? Something's just not right with Terminus. Unfortunately, we didn't find out too much more about this. ... 5. Reunited . Gareth finally gets the upper hand and orders Rick, Daryl and Michonne (the ""ringleader, archer and samurai"") to enter a train car. An enraged Rick asks about his son, and Gareth tells Carl to walk over to the car. When they make their way in, they soon realize that Glenn, Maggie, Abraham and others in their group are alive. Carol, Tyrese and Judith are still making their way to Terminus, as far as we know, but Beth's whereabouts remain unknown. Rick delivers one of the best lines in the series' history when he tells Glenn, ""They're going to feel really stupid when they find out ... they're screwing with the wrong people."" Rick certainly proved that with his actions this week. He's gone from a lawman to the ""Ricktator"" to something of a go-for-broke violent avenger over the years. Were you happy to see so many of the survivors reunited and find out that no one died in this finale? Share your thoughts in the comments.","Sunday night's episode had some gasp-worthy moments .

"(CNN) -- Voters in North Carolina, Indiana and Ohio on Tuesday kick off five straight weeks of primary contests that could give us a clearer indication of whether establishment Republicans have the upper hand against the tea party movement for control of the party. The results could back up recent tough talk from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who predicted big wins for incumbents facing primary challenges from the right, saying, ""I think we are going to crush them everywhere."" And they may have a major impact in determining whether Republicans retake the majority in the Senate. Since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009, primary challenges from the right have produced major headlines and headaches for the GOP and hurt the party's chances of winning back the Senate from Democrats in the past two election cycles. Candidates backed by the tea party movement and other grass-roots conservatives effectively cost the GOP five winnable Senate elections the last two cycles in Nevada, Delaware, Colorado, Indiana and Missouri. Complete coverage: 2014 midterm elections . Two months ago, McConnell, whom the right sees as part of the problem in Washington, told The New York Times that when it came to tea party challenges, ""I don't think they are going to have a single nominee anywhere in the country."" His prediction might come true. Establishment leaders say they have learned their lessons from the past two elections and are better at counterattacking this time around. So why do incumbents and establishment-backed candidates appear to have the upper hand this time around? ""I don't think we can say that the tea party movement is dead, but there seems to be less enthusiasm among their activists and supporters this year,"" said Jennifer Duffy, senior editor for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, a top campaign handicapper. ""Establishment Republicans and incumbents have learned to run against tea party-backed candidates."" And outside help this time may be making a difference. ""I think the Republican establishment is fighting back more than in previous cycles. There is more organization and involvement from outside groups in some of these primaries. I think in the past, it was too often an incumbent running against an anti-establishment challenger and a host of outside groups,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report. 2014 midterms: Key races to watch . Tea party 'changed the narrative' But leaders of the 5-year-old grass-roots movement disagree with the suggestion that the tide has turned against them. ""I think the establishment is taking its victory lap a little early,"" said Kevin Broughton, spokesman for the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, who added that ""There are more wins to come."" And regardless of the outcome of the primary contests, Amy Kremer says the tea party is already victorious . ""Regardless of the outcome in the primary races, the tea party has already won because we have changed the narrative and the political landscape in Washington. Now, both sides of the aisle express concern about our ballooning national debt,"" said Kremer, who just stepped down as chairwoman of the Tea Party Express and is now helping Matt Bevin in his bid to unseat McConnell in Kentucky. Primary calendar: Who votes when . Vulnerable Democrats put control of the Senate in play . In North Carolina, first-term Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is vulnerable. Flipping her seat and five others held by Democrats would give Republicans control of the Senate. GOP establishment nervously watches North Carolina . The Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate but are defending 21 of the 36 seats up in November, with half of those Democratic seats in red or purple states, such as North Carolina, which will be the first indicator whether things will be different this time. The establishment is rallying around state House Speaker Thom Tillis, the front-runner in a multi-candidate field for the Republican Senate nomination. Tillis was endorsed Monday by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and late last week by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who's seriously considering a bid for president in 2016. The most recent polling indicates Tillis hovering right around the 40% mark, which he needs to crack in order to avoid a July runoff. The two most serious challengers are Greg Brannon, a tea party activist and first-time candidate who enjoys the support of some major tea party groups, as well as other influential conservative organizations and endorsements from the likes of Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky, who joined Brannon on Monday at an rally in Charlotte on the eve of the primary. The other major candidate is Mark Harris, a prominent Baptist minister who helped drive the 2012 passage of a constitutional amendment that strengthened the state's same-sex marriage ban. Harris enjoys the support of a high-profile fellow pastor: former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a 2008 Republican presidential candidate who may run again for the White House in 2016. While none of the candidates, including Tillis, have raised or spent a lot of money in the campaign, the state House speaker enjoys the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Crossroads, two outside groups that combined have spent millions this cycle to run ads backing Tillis and other establishment picks. Last week, in what was described as a major buy, the pro-business Chamber launched a television commercial that described Tillis as ""a bold conservative who balanced our budget and reduced regulations. A businessman who delivered tax relief."" And Crossroads, the big-spending outside group co-founded and steered by Karl Rove, says it's spent nearly $2 million in support of Tillis. That spending dwarfs the money shelled out by outside conservative groups backing Brannon. And in a sign that Tillis is seen as the most feared of the GOP candidates, the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC put out a spot critical of two of his aides. Overall, 90% of all the ad spending in the Senate race in North Carolina has so far come from outside groups rather than the actual campaigns. 'Idol' star seeks congressional seat . While the Senate battle is the marquee race in North Carolina on Tuesday, some House primaries are also grabbing attention. Two-term GOP Rep. Renee Ellmers is facing a primary challenge from a conservative talk radio host because of her being open to consider some limited immigration reform. And in North Carolina's 2nd Congressional District, former ""American Idol"" star Clay Aiken is in a heated primary for the Democratic nomination. Aiken's star power put to test in N.C. primary . In the state's 3rd Congressional District, 10-term Republican Rep. Walter Jones, an anti-war libertarian, is once again fighting for his political life, this time against establishment pick Taylor Griffin, a former George W. Bush administration official who also had a senior role in Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. Can Mr. Jones stay in Washington? More showdowns over coming weeks . Next Tuesday, the tea party could score what could end up its only win in Senate primary showdowns this year. Conservative Ben Sasse of Nebraska, president of Midland University, has been showered with support and endorsements recently from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah, as well as the backing of FreedomWorks, the Senate Conservatives Fund and Club for Growth. Some polling suggests that Sasse is now all tied up with Shane Osborn, the former state treasurer who's considered the establishment favorite. But on the same day, seven-term Rep. Shelley Moore Capito is expected to easily win the GOP Senate nomination in West Virginia, where the party hopes to snatch the seat long held by retiring Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller. Capito's considered a moderate, and while some conservative groups criticized her early in her bid, she's faced no serious opposition from the right for the nomination. A week later, on May 20, the action moves to Kentucky, where McConnell faces a challenge, and Georgia, where there's a wide-open, free-for-all fight to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Republican Reps. Phil Gingrey, Paul Broun and Jack Kingston, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, and businessman David Perdue are the major candidates in the race. Kingston and Perdue, rather than the more conservative Broun and Gingrey, are considered the frontrunners in the contentious Republican primary. The winner will face off against Michelle Nunn, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee and daughter of the longtime Georgia U.S. senator. McConnell faces challenge of his own . McConnell faces a challenge from tea party-backed Bevin. While this race has seen big spending -- both by the campaigns and from outside groups -- the five-term McConnell is expected to cruise to renomination. But he faces a serious challenge in November from rising Democratic star Alison Lundergan Grimes, whom big-name Democrats are already campaigning for. On the same day in Oregon, Portland pediatric neurosurgeon Dr. Monica Wehby is considered the frontrunner over more conservative state Rep. Jason Conger in the race for the GOP Senate nomination. The winner of that contest will face off in November against first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who Republicans think might be vulnerable if 2014 turns into a wave year for the GOP. And in Idaho, there's a high-profile incumbent-vs.-tea party challenge primary in the House, where eight-term Rep. Mike Simpson faces a serious primary challenge from conservative favorite Bryan Smith. A week later, on June 3, the establishment-vs.-tea party contest shifts to Mississippi, which is among eight states holding primaries that day. Six-term Sen. Thad Cochran is facing a serious challenge from state lawmaker Chris McDaniel in Mississippi. Private polling shows Cochran with a comfortable lead, but outside establishment groups are taking nothing for granted.","Establishment Republicans are fighting back more strongly against challenges from the right .

"(CNN) -- As 36,000 marathoners get ready to pound the streets of Boston on Monday, authorities have their own mammoth task ahead: trying to keep all 26.2 miles of the course safe. Officials say they have gone to great lengths to make sure nothing like last year's attacks will happen. For starters, no backpacks or rucksacks will be allowed on the course this year, said Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. The bombs that killed three people and wounded 264 others last year were placed in backpacks. The Boston Athletic Association, which organizes the marathon, said spectators are also encouraged to leave backpacks and handbags at home. Containers with more than 1 liter of liquid, costumes covering the face, and bulky clothes such as vests with pockets won't be allowed. And large flags or signs bigger than 11 inches by 17 inches are also banned from marathon venues. Those venues include the start and finish areas, the course, the athletes' village and areas where official events are held. Unregistered runners and cyclists intending to jump into the race aren't welcome this year, either. ""We are aware that many people want to participate in some way in this year's Boston Marathon as a display of support,"" the BAA said in a statement. ""But we ask that those who are not official participants to refrain from entering the course for the safety of the runners and themselves."" The anniversary scare . At a memorial to mark the one-year anniversary of the bombings, one sight evoked memories of the gruesome attacks: suspicious bags near the Boston Marathon finish line. Police spotted the bags on Boylston Street -- not far from where two pressure-cooker bombs exploded a year ago. The first clue that something was amiss came when an officer spotted a man carrying one of the bags walking barefoot in the rain down Boylston Street. Police said he became very vocal and started yelling. When asked what was in his backpack, the man told the officer it was a rice cooker, Boston Police Superintendent Randy Halstead said. ""We looked into the backpack, saw that it was what appeared to be a rice cooker, had the individual take the knapsack off, drop it on the street, and he was taken into custody,"" Halstead said. The man was identified by prosecutors as Kevin Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson. He was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, disturbing the peace and possession of a hoax device, Halstead said. A bomb squad inspected the bag and deemed it safe. ""In the process of rendering that safe, we noticed a second backpack off to the side,"" Halstead said. ""Nobody claimed ownership of it. At that time, that bag was rendered safe."" Halstead said his officers are ready for this year's marathon. In Tuesday's incident, he said, the ""training kicked in."" ""I have utmost praise for my officer,"" Halstead said. ""That's what he's trained to do, that's what he did, and that's why I'm proud of the guys of this department."" Memorial: 'We are America, we own the finish line' A massive enterprise . This year's marathon will be a massive enterprise. The race will have 9,000 more runners than last year. More spectators than ever before will also line the course, according to the Boston Athletic Association. Keeping that in mind, police will double the number of officers on patrol from last year, with 3,500 scattered among the crowd. They will be aided by 100 additional security cameras and bomb-sniffing dogs. ""In this world, you never eliminate risk; you never bring it down to zero,"" State Police Col. Timothy Alben told reporters last month. ""But we are working very hard at reducing that risk level and managing it to the best of our collective abilities."" Authorities have not disclosed how much the extra security will cost. All they will offer is that it will be ""much greater"" than last year's cost. But this year's race will also reap millions of dollars. According to the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau, the marathon and related events will bring in an estimated $175.8 million -- the highest-ever amount for a Boston Marathon.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A boat carrying illegal migrants sank off the coast of Tripoli on Sunday, killing at least 40 people, the spokesman for Libya's Interior Ministry told CNN. Some 50 others were rescued, and an unspecified number remain missing, Rami Kaal said. Kaal did not have information on the specific nationalities of the migrants on the vessel but said Libya is suffering greatly from the ""huge number"" of illegal migrants in his country. According to the spokesman, most have come from sub-Saharan Africa, neighboring countries like Egypt and Tunisia and, more recently, more have come from Syria. The migrants arrive to board boats headed to European shores, particularly Italy and Malta. Kaal feels that the European countries have an obligation to help Libya deal with this ""serious problem"" but said, so far, they have done little. According to Kaal, the flow of illegal migrants has contributed to the rise in crimes such as killings and armed robberies in Libya. He referred CNN to the statements made by acting Interior Minister Salah Mazeq on Saturday. The minister threatened to ""facilitate"" the passage of migrants and ""flood Europe"" with them unless the countries stepped up and helped Libya. ""I warn the world, especially the European Union, unless they assume their responsibility ... we warn that Libya could facilitate the passage of this flood (of illegal migrants) and fast,"" Mazeq said. He went on to say Libya has paid the price; now it's the EU's turn to pay the price of combating the problem. Libya's porous southern borders have been a favorite launch pad for illegal migrants trying to reach Europe due to its proximity to countries like Malta and Italy. Since Libya's revolution in 2011, the country has been struggling to deal with this growing phenomenon. To give scope to the problem, Kaal told CNN last week more than 400 migrants were caught in one day as they tried to board vessels to Europe. Asked how Europe can offer assistance, he offered the example of the delivery of boats for Libya's coastguard from an unnamed European country that has been stalled for more than 18 months. Following the Interior Minister's comments, the Libyan Interim Government released a statement, saying in part: . ""The government also reaffirms it is continuing to cooperate with all concerned countries, especially Italy, in monitoring the borders to stem the flow of migrants. The Government renews its call to all countries to create development projects in the countries of origin in an effort to cut down on this phenomenon.""

"(CNN) -- Despite the Chinese leadership's austerity measures and recent reports of weak profits from Chinese car makers, the country's biggest car show opened today to much buzz. More than a thousand vehicles are being showcased at the ten-day-long ""Auto China 2014"" Beijing International Automotive Exhibition. Throngs of auto journalists crowded around shiny new supercars, luxury sedans and green vehicles during the media preview on Sunday. International automakers flew in their top brass for the occasion, pushing the newest and best models to Chinese customers. According to a McKinsey report, China may overtake the United States as the largest premium car market as early as 2016. International car giants are looking to cash in on the lucrative but highly competitive market. Industry leaders such as Rolls-Royce are hoping to secure their future with China's moneyed customers. They will open three new dealerships in the country this year. ""China is now one of our leading markets together with the U.S.,"" says CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos who was in Beijing to unveil two new models.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Three men involved in the Moscow subway bombings in March were killed when they fought back during an attempt to arrest them, the director of the Federal Security Service told the Russian president Thursday. The officials' meeting was shown on Russian state television. One of the three killed had accompanied the two female suicide bombers from Dagestan to Moscow and guided one of them to the subway, Alexander Bortnikov told President Dmitry Medvedev. ""They offered a bitter armed resistance and were eliminated,"" Bortnikov said. ""Active measures have been taken to hunt down the other members of the gang."" The twin bombings struck the Moscow metro during morning rush hour March 29, killing 40 people and wounding more than 80. Alexander Bastrykin, the head of the Investigation Committee of the Russian Prosecutor-General's Office, said investigators are trying to pursue the organizers of the twin bombings. ""There are grounds to believe that jointly (with the Federal Security Service) we will be able to find out who specifically organized those terrorist acts in the Moscow subway,"" Bastrykin told Medvedev at the meeting. Medvedev ordered the investigation to continue, adding, ""Those of them who offer resistance should be eliminated. We shouldn't spare them."" Maryam Sharipova and another female bomber, Dzhennet Abdullayeva, detonated their explosives about 40 minutes apart on the day of the bombings.

"Editor's note: Andrey Kurkov is a Ukrainian novelist born in St. Petersburg in 1961. Having graduated from the Kiev Foreign Languages Institute, he worked as a journalist, did his military service as a prison warden in Odessa, then became a cameraman, writer of screenplays and author. His books are published in English by Harvill Secker in the UK and Meville House in the U.S. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. For two nights between the 4th and 6th of March, I barely slept. I was checking the Internet every hour to see if Russia had started war with Ukraine. Then the feeling of imminent danger was replaced by emotional fatigue. Although a war still seemed unavoidable, it didn't inspire the same fear as in the early days of the occupation of Crimea. Ukrainian volunteers started to flow towards Crimea and the Eastern border with Russia, while roads filled up with armored personnel carriers and other military vehicles. Ukraine was making an attempt to flex its military muscles, both to test the condition of the army and to reassure the population that we could protect ourselves. It became clear that since independence in 1991 neither Ukrainian presidents nor the government had taken care of the military. Nobody thought that Ukraine might need an army; it was as simple as that. Nobody thought that until this year and now it's an everyday topic. This, and a war with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeats each day that Russia doesn't plan to occupy eastern and southern Ukraine. But it would be odd if anyone believed him. Russia also didn't plan to annex Crimea. Even Russian President Vladimir Putin said that. On March 5, Putin announced to the world that ""military maneuvers"" were successfully completed and by March 7 all Russian soldiers, together with their equipment, would be back in their usual location, leaving Crimea alone. However, instead of the promised end of these ""maneuvers,"" more than 10,000 Russian troops arrived in Crimea. What to do with Crimea? When it comes to the occupation of Crimea, the Ukrainian government stands firm. Something that must occupy the mind of Putin and others in the Kremlin. This position is without doubt due to the U.S. support of Ukraine. The rest of the world agrees that Crimea is Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia. While Putin continues to show he is not interested in the opinion of the rest of the world, this fact will have rather serious consequences for the occupied peninsula itself. Ukrainian International Airlines stopped all its flights to the Crimean capital Simferopol and Crimean residents are now anxiously waiting for the summer holiday season. A recent law passed in Kiev about occupied territories means that Ukrainians can't enter without prior approval from the authorities. Russian Prime Minister Medvedev, who visited Crimea recently, promised 33 airplanes full of visitors from Russia each day during the summer. Under pressure from the Kremlin, Russian airlines -- the only ones now flying to the peninsula -- have slashed prices on flights. I think Russian oligarchs will soon receive an order from the Kremlin to buy holiday packages to Crimean sanitoriums and resorts for their employees. Otherwise how will the Kremlin get 8 million Russian visitors promised to Crimea this summer? And if all of Russia's citizens do decide to support Crimean hotels and resorts this summer, then who will visit the newly built super-resort of Sochi? But the summer season in Crimea only lasts a little more than three months. And after that, what? Crimea produces wine and grows fruit. They can only export it to Russia, but Russia has enough wine and fruit of its own. Putin will have no other choice but to follow Europe's example and subsidize farmers and winemakers so they don't grow anything and reduce wine production. The impact of this ""acquisition"" on Russia's budget looks scary. No wonder that the pre-referendum promise to quadruple pensions for Crimea's residents has been replaced with one to reconsider it starting from January 2016. Currently tram and trolleybus driver's salaries are frozen, the number of suburban trains had been cut and people are trying to figure out how to keep on living. Building a Soviet 'Jurassic Park' If the self-proclaimed Crimean government asked me the question: ""How can Crimea keep on going?"" I would answer that we should create some kind of theme park there. Something between Disneyland and Jurassic Park, but much bigger and more exotic. For the last 20 years Crimea has been known for its love for everything Soviet. Strictly speaking, Crimea has remained Soviet. Against the background of south Crimea's truly stunning coast, lovingly preserved Soviet monuments look very odd. My favorite one -- a big statue of Lenin in Koreiz, not far from Yalta -- has him standing on the cliff looking sternly in the direction of Turkey. There are times, when I think that Russia occupied this peninsula so that Ukrainian nationalists couldn't demolish these Soviet-era landmarks, just as they did in Kiev and central and western Ukraine. So in my eyes the only possible solution to the complex economical situation in Crimea would be the creation of a theme park of Soviet life. Considering that Putin has often said he considers the collapse of Soviet Union as his own personal tragedy, it wouldn't be too much of a risk to call the park, spread over 27,000 square kilometers, ""Putinland."" A simple, scary scenario . But I know that for Ukrainians this is not the right moment for jokes. Nor for me either; I look towards the near future with anxiety. My main concern is that Russia will start destabilizing southeast Ukraine before the presidential elections on May 25. Putin has already declared that he won't recognize the results of the elections, but what is even more important for him, is that these elections don't take place at all. If they don't then he can keep talking about the illegitimacy of the government, the absence of a legitimate president, and he can move further into Ukraine under the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking population. The scenario of the Russian expansion could look very simple: May 9 will be commemorated as Victory Day -- something of an annual cult holiday for many in Russia. You can expect that this year communists and pro-Russian activists in the south and east of Ukraine will demonstrate, claiming to be commemorating victory over Nazi Germany. The gatherings will follow a familiar pattern: the occupation of local government buildings and the planting of Russian flags on their roofs. It is clear that Ukrainian authorities have got stronger and will use police and the security services to prevent this happening. Riots will start with the first victims coming from the protesters and police. At that point Russia can send in its armed ""peace-keeping"" forces in to bring order. I am afraid that once Russian ''peace-keepers'' enter Ukrainian territory they will not stop until they get to Kiev. That is because the Kremlin's main goal remains to put a pro-Russian government in Ukraine, the kind that will sign an agreement of friendship and cooperation and will recognize to Crimea as a Russian territory. Only when this agreement is reached can Russia finally relax and develop the Crimean peninsula legally and without the fear of political and economic sanctions from the European Union and the U.S. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrey Kurkov .","Talk of war with Russia is on everyone's mind in Ukraine, says novelist Andrey Kurkov .

CNN Living launched the Matrimony series in June, and we've been thrilled to see an exuberant response from readers, eager to see their own experiences reflected, pick up some expert tips and do a little celebrity gawking while they're at it. In 2014, we'll be delving even deeper into the wedding trenches with stories on over-the-top receptions, the evolving etiquette for same-sex ceremonies, the emotional lead-up to getting hitched, planning a wedding with a terminally ill partner and so much more.

Forget the ""have tos"" and ""shoulds"" about nuptials. There are no hard-and-fast rules. Except one: Be a gracious bride and groom while letting your true style shine. 9. Wedding etiquette: To keep or to toss? Good manners are always in style, but points of wedding etiquette can be safely wrapped up and tucked away in the attic without the world crumbling to dust and guests rending their garments and wailing. Matrimony editor Kat Kinsman took a look at traditional wedding practices from which we may now part. 8. I do ... cost a lot: Weddings by the numbers . All you need is love, right?

Kinsman took a look at marriage customs from around the globe. 4. Wedding photos: When snap-happy guests go too far . 2013 was, no doubt, the most documented wedding year yet.

"(CNN) -- Named in 1999 as the male ""athlete of the century"" by the International Association of Athletics Federations, Carl Lewis embodied the Olympic motto -- ""Citius, altius, fortius"" (Faster, higher, stronger). Lewis leaps to gold in Barcelona in 1992. The American twice won gold in the 100 meters, the Olympic blue riband event, but he arguably achieved more in the long jump, a discipline in which he was unbeaten in all competition for a decade and won four straight Olympic gold medals between 1984 and 1996. Lewis collected four gold medals at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, emulating the achievement of Jessie Owens in Munich in 1936. Born in Alabama in the 1960s to parents who were veterans of the civil rights movement, it was a comparison that made Lewis especially proud. Lewis' 9.9-second victory in the 100 meters by eight feet was the biggest winning margin in Olympic history. Unchallenged in the long jump, Lewis jumped 8.54 meters into the wind with his first effort, fouled on his second leap, and passed on his final four jumps. He also won gold in the 200 meters and as part of the U.S. 4x100 meters relay team. Seoul showdown . The 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea, were billed as a showdown between Lewis and Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson who had won the 100 meters at the 1987 world championships in a world record 9.83 seconds. Johnson finished first in 9.79 seconds, but three days later he was sent home in disgrace after failing a doping test. Lewis, second on the track, earned another gold medal and was also awarded the world record for his time of 9.93 seconds. He also became the first athlete ever to successfully defend the 100 meters title, a feat he emulated in the long jump. By 1992 in Barcelona, at the age of 31, Lewis' career seemed to be on the wane. The previous year he had been beaten in the long jump at the world championships by Mike Powell, who had also broken the world record. But Lewis hit back, beating his American rival by three centimeters with a leap of 8.67 meters for his third straight title. Lewis also earned his eighth career gold by anchoring the U.S. relay team's victory in the 4x100 meters. The 1996 Games in Atlanta should have been no more than a farewell appearance in an Olympic career that had also begun on home soil. Lewis had barely qualified for the U.S. team, finishing third in the long jump trials. Yet he somehow rose to the occasion, producing his best jump in four years to claim gold again, 12 years after he had first topped the podium, and retire undefeated in Olympic long jump competitions. It was, wrote Rick Reilly in Sports Illustrated, ""quite possibly his most impossible moment in an impossibly brilliant career.""","Olympic Record: 9 gold medals and 1 silver medal .

"(CNN) -- State officials pledged to help western Massachusetts residents rebuild Thursday, a day after at least two tornadoes tore through the region. ""There was an extraordinary amount of destruction caused by these tornadoes, and yet it is remarkable that we've had four confirmed fatalities ... and not more,"" Gov. Deval Patrick told reporters. Officials said about 200 people in western and central Massachusetts went to hospitals with injuries sustained in the storms, which struck shortly after 4 p.m. Wednesday in and around Springfield, about 90 miles west of Boston. Patrick and other Massachusetts politicians spoke in front of a church in downtown Monson, where a tornado ripped off the steeple and sent it crashing to the ground. No one was injured when the steeple fell, U.S. Sen. John Kerry noted, calling it one of the many ""fortuitous"" aspects of the devastating storm. ""But for being at work, somebody would have been in their basement and crushed to death. ... There are a lot of 'but fors' in this, and I think all of us are really grateful for that,"" he said. But officials also recounted tragic stories Thursday of those who died when the tornadoes struck. A 39-year-old mother in Springfield was killed as she laid on top of her daughter in the bathtub, shielding her from the storm, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. ""The house came down. The daughter lived and the poor mother didn't make it,"" West Springfield Police Chief Thomas Burke told WCVB. Nearby, 23-year-old Sergey Livchin died when a tree fell on the car he was sitting in, WCVB reported. ""I heard somebody was hit by a tree. When I found out it was my brother, it was like the ground disappeared beneath me,"" his sister Irina Livchin told WCVB. Patrick and Kerry said officials touring some of the most heavily damaged areas saw significant damage: homes split in half, a flattened house whose owners had just sent in their final mortgage payment, a staggering row of sheered-off treetops that stretched for 15 miles. The magnitude and sweep of the storm were surprising, officials said. ""In 45 years in public service I have never seen this kind of damage and devastation in Massachusetts,"" Kerry said. Patrick said someone found the checkbook register of a woman who lived in Monson, one of the hardest-hit areas, in Milton, more than 80 miles away. He told WCVB that the woman recounted the story to him as she sat on the front step of her home -- the only thing remaining after the storm. ""We've got a real mess on our hands here, but we are all in this together,"" he said. More than 400 people were staying at shelters statewide -- mostly in the Springfield area, said Craig Cooper of the American Red Cross. ""The devastation is not on the broad scale (seen in) Joplin, but the degree of damage and homes damage are just as severe. The disaster is just as real. We have seen some significant devastation. The way that has affected the families involved is very profound,"" he said. On Thursday, rescue workers went building-to-building searching for survivors. No one had been reported missing by Thursday afternoon, said Peter Judge, a spokesman for the state's emergency management agency. Damage assessment teams that included National Guard troops were still surveying the area, he said. Officials were investigating reports that at least two more tornadoes had touched down in and around Springfield, which is the third-largest city in Massachusetts. As many as 19 communities reported tornado damage, officials said. At least one person was killed in Springfield, two in nearby West Springfield and one in Brimfield, about 20 miles east, Judge said. The governor declared a statewide emergency Wednesday as the storm system that spawned the tornadoes moved east, prompting storm watches all the way to the Atlantic Coast. By Thursday, that state of emergency had been reduced to four heavily impacted counties, Judge said. Veronica Davidovich saw an ominous, dark cloud form in the sky Wednesday as she sat in her car at a bank drive-thru in Westfield. ""It was really strange. There was a thickness in the air, like it shouldn't be happening,"" she said. ""It looked like volcanic ash was just dropping. And I looked at the (bank teller) and said, 'That ain't right.'"" At J.T.'s Sports Pub in Springfield, owner Keith Makarowski said he and 10 or so patrons initially went outside to watch the darkening skies, but then retreated as the storm blew into downtown. ""There was a ton of debris flying around, lots of roof shingles and random siding,"" Makarowski said. Several century-old buildings were damaged -- ""roofs torn off, facades ravaged, trees uprooted,"" he said. Residents were being warned to stay off the streets, many of which were impassable because of downed trees and power lines, overturned cars and debris from damaged and destroyed buildings. About 40,000 people across the state remained without power by Thursday afternoon after the storms downed power lines and blew transformers, Judge said. Hard-hit areas might not have electricity until the end of the week, said Sandra Ahearn, a spokeswoman for Western Massachusetts Electric Co. The damage came amid a wave of heavy thunderstorms that moved through the Northeast on Wednesday. Though not as tornado-prone as much of the Midwest or the South, Massachusetts has averaged two to three twisters per year since 1950, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In 1953, a massive tornado that struck Worcester and nearby towns killed 90 people, according to NOAA. The last tornado to hit the state was in 2008. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Jennifer Westhoven, Anna Gonzalez, Matt Smith, Leigh Remizowski, Julia Talanova and Sean Morris contributed to this report.","Report: A mother was killed protecting her daughter .

"Washington (CNN) -- A shaky video captured only a few moments of William D. Swenson's actions during a brutal, hours-long battle in Afghanistan: Kissing a badly wounded comrade on the forehead as he helped load the soldier into a helicopter. ""This may be the first time we bear witness to a small portion of the action"" of a Medal of Honor recipient, President Barack Obama said Tuesday as he awarded the now-retired Army captain the nation's highest military honor for his actions in the Ganjgal Valley in 2009. Swenson, 34, of Seattle, is the sixth living recipient from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to earn the honor, and this is only the second time in a half-century that two men from the same battle have been awarded the medal. Swenson, who retired from the Army in 2011, is being awarded the medal for his actions on September 8, 2009, in the Battle of the Ganjgal Valley in Afghanistan's Kunar province. The battle claimed the lives of four American soldiers, 10 Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. A fifth soldier, Sgt. First Class Kenneth Westbrook -- the man Swenson helped load onto the helicopter -- later died from his wounds. Swenson was working with Afghan security forces in the volatile Kunar province near Pakistan's border when he and his troops came under fire. Obama recounted to an audience of fellow soldiers and families of the fallen how Swenson braved enemy fire again and again to recover the bodies of the dead Americans and Afghans. ""In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best, a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when it's easy, but also when it's hard,"" Obama said. ""Maybe, especially when it's hard."" Part of Swenson's rescue efforts were recorded by a rescue pilot's helmet camera. In the heat of battle, with bullets flying and dust blocking any clear vision of the surrounding situation, Swenson is seen helping Westbrook, who had been shot in the throat, back to a helicopter. After placing him in the helicopter, Swenson bent down to kiss his forehead before running back to the battle to retrieve other fallen Americans and Afghan fighters. ""I was just trying to keep his spirits up. I wanted him to know it was going to be OK. And I wanted him to know that he had done his job, but it was time for him to go,"" Swenson told CNN recently. The road to this honor has not been easy for Swenson, whose nomination was ""lost"" for a time, prompting questions from lawmakers and an eventual internal Pentagon investigation. Swenson spoke out after the 2009 battle, criticizing his leadership for failing to provide him with adequate air support after multiple radio requests. The Army later backed up his claims, reprimanding two commanding officers. ""What happened that day was a result of clouded judgment,"" Swenson told CNN's Barbara Starr in a recent interview. ""It was a result of clouded judgment on behalf of people who did later receive letters of reprimand."" The nomination statement, once found, was nothing short of glowing for Swenson, saying the soldier ""braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy's main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners."" Army officials confirmed to CNN that Swenson has filed paperwork to return to Army active duty. Dakota Meyer, a Marine, was honored for his actions in the same battle in 2011.

"(CNN) -- Intrepid travelers need not leave the United States to find distinctive cities, spectacular open spaces and wide beaches to explore. Lonely Planet's top 10 U.S. destinations for 2014 are all available without clearing customs, including long-beloved destinations, spots commemorating important events in 2014 and significant regional spots that deserve your attention. ""Lonely Planet's top U.S. destinations is an annual list of places that travelers should add to their wish lists specifically for the coming year. They're not necessarily the must-see places, lest New York City be on the list every year,"" says Emily Wolman, Lonely Planet editor-at-large. ""We dig deeper and shine a light on destinations that are emerging, perhaps historically overlooked, and/or experiencing something wonderful in the coming year. These destinations aren't necessarily where U.S. travelers are going in 2014, but where they should go in 2014."" The list is more art than science. To compile the annual list, Lonely Planet asks its U.S. staff and authors for urban and nature recommendations, well-known and lesser-known spots and locations that have a timely angle for 2014, says Wolman. ""From there, our editors whittle down the list to ten, and a natural order emerges."" Since working Americans don't get as much vacation time as their European counterparts, consider using your limited vacation days to explore Lonely Planet's top destinations right here at home. Here are the 10 spots that came out on top: . 1. Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan's Gold Coast . It's such an overlooked part of the Midwest, says Wolman, and so deserving of attention by travelers who love art, beer and food and the beach. The second-largest city in Michigan, Grand Rapids has beer and food festivals almost year round, perhaps inspired by more than 25 craft breweries in the area. It has a beautiful art scene, including the LEED-certified Grand Rapids Art Museum and Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park. From Grand Rapids, it's an easy 30-mile drive to Michigan's Gold Coast, ""one of the United States' most unexpected beach getaways,"" says Wolman, at least to folks outside the Midwest. Enjoy the sugar white sand beaches, orchards, cider houses and wineries. Take a dip, and have a drink. 2. Yosemite National Park, California . With 3.8 million visitors last year, the third-most visited national park in the country is well-known among park lovers and novices alike. Yet the federal government shutdown and Rim Fire hurt the park and surrounding communities that depend on park visitors for their survival. Add to that a reason to celebrate: the 150th anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's signing of the Yosemite Grant, giving the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to California to be administered. Yosemite was turned into a national park in 1890. The grant is widely seen as a precursor to the creation of the National Park Service in 1916. ""Yosemite is celebrating that with a bunch of preservation efforts,"" says Wolman. ""It's a good time for the nation's and world's gaze to be on Yosemite. It's one of the most majestic parks in the U.S."" 3. Boston, Massachusetts . The eyes of the world will be on Boston next year, as thousands descend upon the historic city to run and support the Boston Marathon come Monday, April 21 -- Patriots' Day in Massachusetts. It will be the first running of the marathon since the Boston bombing on April 15, 2013. Fans of this New England city also know that U.S. history comes alive on the Freedom Trail, and walkers can include a stop at the Bell in Hand Tavern, the nation's oldest tavern, along the way. ""The past in Boston is always very much alive,"" says Wolman. 4. Central Coast, California . While many visitors in the know have experienced the beauty of the area from Santa Cruz to Santa Barbara, it can be ignored as flyover country between San Francisco and Los Angeles. ""It's quintessential California at its best,"" says Wolman. ""The weather is generally gorgeous, and even when it's foggy, it is still romantic."" Check out the Pacific Ocean driving along Highway 1 and stop by the gorgeous inns and restaurants hugging the coast. Stay on the Monterey Peninsula and enjoy the Monterey Bay Aquarium during its 30th anniversary year. Explore Paso Robles wine country -- it rivals Sonoma and Napa, says Wolman. 5. Jersey Shore, New Jersey . With Superstorm Sandy last year and the boardwalk fire this year, the Jersey Shore has been through the wringer. The storm caused monumental damage, but there has been an incredible effort to revitalize. From Sandy Hook to the north and Cape May to the south, you will find kitchy towns, classy towns and everything in between, says Wolman. ""As recovery efforts continue, it's important to have tourism in 2014. We encourage people to go, and there's a lot of family fun. "" Top U.S. travel destinations for 2013 . 6. Kansas City, Missouri . Kansas City has its barbecue, of course -- more than 100 spots to celebrate its culinary accomplishments in that area. Yet there is so much more to Kansas City. ""It's another one of those cities in the central swath of the United States that is often overlooked,"" says Wolman. ""It's really wide open and inviting, with 200 fountains, jazz and barbecue. It also has a very vibrant African-American community."" The city will be in the spotlight in 2014 with the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. The city's National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial, which is getting a $5 million makeover, will shine the spotlight on the Great War. 7.Cumberland Island, Georgia . Cumberland Island is a magical Southern getaway, a national seashore that's part of a collection of sea islands on the Southeast's Atlantic coast. One of the most underdeveloped places in the United States, there's room for backcountry camping among the mossy oaks and wild turkeys. For a bit of history, visit the First African Baptist Church (which dates back to 1893) and the ruins of a Carnegie mansion. ""It's otherworldly,"" says Wolman. ""If you have the opportunity to stay overnight (there's an old inn), you'll have the place to yourself. It's off the beaten path, a magical Southern natural getaway."" 8. Las Vegas, Nevada . Of course Las Vegas is about casinos, but it's not all about casinos. ""We chose Vegas this year because it is reinventing itself,"" says Wolman. There are vibrant art districts popping up and attracting visitors in their own right. On the Vegas Strip itself, the ""High Roller"" Ferris wheel is scheduled to open with great views of the city in 2014. 9. Sun Valley, Idaho . While the crowds travel to Colorado's famed ski slopes, those looking for a less expensive and crowded vacation might want to head to Sun Valley. ""It's a perfect alternative to places that can be more expensive,"" says Wolman. ""It's a gorgeous setting with the Sawtooth Mountains, culinary events, great food and world class skiing and a lot of hiking in summer. It's really mellow, with no crowds or lift lines."" 10. Lanai, Hawaii . An often overlooked, really unique speck of paradise, with old shipwrecks and petroglyphs, most of the island was recently purchased by Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison. ""It will be interesting to see how the island transforms over the next few years, but it's worth seeing now before it transforms,"" says Wolman. ""There's snorkeling and diving without the crowds. It's a real slice of Hawaiian life."" Lonely Planet's top destinations around the world for 2014 . What spots would you add to this top 10 list of U.S. destinations?

"San Francisco (CNN) -- For Microsoft's latest version of its Office suite, the company is betting big that making documents accessible across multiple devices, a cleaned-up design and improved collaboration features will keep the product relevant to today's users. Microsoft announced the Windows 8-friendly products, Office 13 and Office 365, at a press event on Monday. It's a major overhaul meant to help it fight a shrinking PC market, free Web-based competitors and consumer influence in corporate IT departments. ""In a sense, it feels to us a lot like 1995,"" said an excited Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO, at the event. The nostalgia might be for the year Internet Explorer made its public debut, but the much-repeated theme of the new version of Office is that it's the ""modern Office."" Office reigns as Microsoft's most lucrative product and maintains a 90% market share of PCs, according to research firm Gartner. But recent years have seen a slew of inexpensive and free competitors nipping at its heels -- most notably Google Apps, a cloud-based suite of software for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and e-mail. The Google tools lack some of the features found in Microsoft Office, but to many users that simplicity is part of their appeal. ""Keeping the market is always a challenge, especially when you're competing against free or cheap, but Microsoft has been competing against cheaper and free suites for more than a decade and continues to do pretty well,"" said Gartner analyst Michael Silver. Microsoft is still taking Google's encroachment seriously and has even created a special ""Google Compete"" team to prevent corporate Office users from making the jump to Google Apps, according to The Wall Street Journal. In addition to preventing users from switching to other products, Microsoft must persuade them to upgrade from older versions of Office. In the past, a confusing design change or dropped support for plug-ins has been reason enough for users to skip the upgrade and stick with the version they're comfortable with. Turnaround time can also be slow at large companies, where upgrading everyone is a costly and complicated undertaking. ""Organizations are still deploying Windows 7 and Office 2010, and because of the urgency in getting Windows XP out by April 2014 when support ends, both Office 2013 and Windows 8 will likely have to take a back seat for a while,"" said Silver. While large corporations are slow to roll out new versions of software, there has been a recent shift in how they adopt technology. More and more, consumer technology is coming in the front door of businesses, being championed by the people who have to use it rather than the IT department.

"(CNN) -- The outgoing director of the Federal Air Marshal Service told CNN that he bought several guns from an employee under investigation over concerns he may have used his position to get free and discounted firearms. But Robert Bray denied that he did anything wrong or that the probe is behind his decision to retire from the aviation security agency. Bray said in a telephone interview that he bought four Sig Sauer handguns over a four- or five-year period through the air marshal service employee, a decision he now regrets because it has placed him under a cloud of suspicion. ""I've been in law enforcement for 39 years, 39 years. I've never had one allegation of misconduct,"" Bray said. He listed the purchases and said he believed he paid full price. ""I have nothing to hide. I'm not trying to hide anything,"" Bray said. A Transportation Security Administration source told CNN that an employee is under investigation for allegedly buying weapons at a discount and selling them to other employees. TSA said the employee, Daniel Poulos, is on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment. Bray, who previously served with the Secret Service on presidential protection details, said he bought the guns from Poulos. The air marshal service, which places armed, undercover agents on commercial flights, is part of the TSA. Both are under the Homeland Security Department. Allegations that Bray and other top air marshal service officials inappropriately purchased handguns through the agency's point of contact with Sig Sauer have circulated in an anonymous email in recent months. FoxNews.com, citing law enforcement and congressional sources, said Bray's recently announced retirement, effective in June, is directly related to the investigation. It said Bray's house was raided in December in connection with the ongoing probe. But Bray and TSA spokesman David Castelveter told CNN that Bray's house was not raided. Bray said Fairfax County, Virginia, police came to his house following a December burglary during which his TSA-issued gun was stolen. People may have confused that police investigation with a raid, he said. ""I reported that to the Fairfax County Police Department. It was my service weapon. It was in my briefcase. It was locked. It was in a secure (place),"" he said. Castelveter said the TSA is aware of allegations that Bray improperly purchased handguns ""and we're looking into it."" The matter is being investigated by the TSA's Office of Inspections, he said. ""None of it has any basis in fact. It's not true and it's very disturbing to me,"" he said of suggestions he may have done something wrong. Bray said he purchased four guns from SIG Sauer through Poulos, who was then a FAMS supervisory agent in the training division. ""I did buy guns from Dan Poulos. I bought four guns. I believe I paid full market value for them. I wish I had not have done that, but that's the process,"" he said. ""Unfortunately that was standard procedure for a lot of law enforcement. He had the guns and I bought them from him,"" he said. ""Do I wish I had never met the guy? Absolutely,"" Bray said, asking and answering his own question. Bray said that in April 2009 he purchased a SIG Sauer 220 ACP for $589.01; In September 2010, he purchased two SIG Sauer P250 ACPs for $428 and in October 2012, he purchased a SIG Sauer P220 ACP for $901.95. Bray said he has provided documentation to TSA investigators. Asked if he paid full price, Bray answered ""I believe I did."" The cost of guns varies largely by model and accessories, so it was not immediately possible to determine the market value of the weapons. Bray said he chose to buy the guns through Poulos because of the convenience. Bray said he gave one gun to his son, traded one weapon that was not working properly for another weapon, and still has the remaining two guns. On Thursday, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Transportation Security asked the TSA for more details. Rep. Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, said he was concerned ""the director's recently announced retirement may be directly related to an investigation into these activities and that this information was withheld from the Committee on Homeland Security."" ""I am extremely concerned about recent allegations of unethical behavior involving firearms within the Federal Air Marshal Service, dating as far back as 2010,"" Hudson said in a statement to CNN. Bray said his retirement was timed so that he could spend the summer at his vacation home, and not because of the TSA investigation. A federal air marshal supervisory agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there is a widespread belief that Bray is retiring because of the probe despite his protests to the contrary. ""He definitely is. That's my opinion. There's no way to prove it,"" the agent said. Bray got a vote of confidence from Jon Adler, president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, which represents rank-and-file air marshals. ""I respect him. We don't always agree, but I respect him,"" Adler said. Adler said Bray discussed his desire to retire last year. ""It wasn't a well-kept secret,"" Adler said, adding that the timing was unfortunate. ""Bob's not going to bow to pressure.""","Official in charge of undercover agents on commercial flights talks to CNN .

"(CNN) -- Three weeks ago, 276 girls awoke to a nightmare. On the night of April 14, a gang of heavily armed militants attacked their dormitory at the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, a town in Nigeria's Borno state. They shot the guards, loaded the girls into trucks and drove them away into the forest. It has been reported that the girls are being married off or even sold for as little as $12 to be wives to Boko Haram militants. Since then, there has been disturbingly little action to find these girls. Local police say that around 53 of the girls have escaped, but that still leaves at least 223 held hostage in the hands of Boko Haram. That's almost as many people as were aboard Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 -- a horrible tragedy that has been the subject of intense media coverage and a massive international search. In Nigeria, no one seems to know where these girls are, and until this past weekend, no one seemed inclined to do much about it. The most determined pursuit of the kidnappers had come not from the Nigerian military but from the families of the abducted girls. Some of the family members, armed only with bows and arrows to fight terrorists armed with assault rifles, rode into the forest on motorcycles to try to find their girls. Fortunately, after this past week, the world is finally paying attention. With the families reaching out through social media, using the Twitter hashtag '#BringBackOurGirls,' protests have spread across the world calling for the Nigerian government to take stronger action and for the international community to help. The United States should help lead this international effort, and we have to take some immediate actions to help marshal a global response to this heinous crime. First, the United States should seek a resolution from the U.N. Security Council condemning this attack. It should also call for member countries to extend all appropriate assistance to Nigeria and neighboring countries to help locate the victims of Boko Haram's abductions and bring them home. I've joined with 20 women senators to call on the U.N. to designate Boko Haram as a terrorist group -- as the United States has already done -- which would trigger additional international sanctions on the group. Second, we should move as quickly as we can to provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets to contribute to the search for the missing girls. The countries of the region have limited resources, and American support with aerial and satellite surveillance, similar to what we have provided to the hunt for Joseph Kony and his so-called Lord's Resistance Army in central Africa, could make a significant difference in their ability to liberate Boko Haram hostages. I'm encouraged by the administration's announcement that a team from the military, the FBI and other agencies is traveling to Nigeria to advise and assist the government with intelligence, hostage negotiations and other counterterrorism expertise. Finally, we must work to strengthen the capabilities of local authorities in Nigeria and other countries in the region to protect children, particularly girls, and combat human trafficking through civilian law enforcement. Our current security sector assistance programs for these countries remain weighted towards their armed forces rather than building the capacity of civilian law enforcement to protect citizens where they live. We should use the expertise of the Department of State, Department of Justice, and U.S. Agency for International Development to help design and implement robust programs that bolster anti-trafficking efforts in these countries over the long term. Make no mistake, how we respond to the abduction of the girls of Nigeria will be a moral test of our nation's commitment to the fight against modern-day slavery. Human trafficking is a stain on the conscience of the world and is now the world's third-largest criminal enterprise, behind only drug- and gun-trafficking. I recently led a delegation to Mexico to talk about how we can coordinate with other countries to fight sex trafficking around the world. The U.S. can work with local officials to help them crack down on traffickers and support victims. But this isn't only a problem in countries half a world away -- it's happening in our own backyards. In fact, 83% of the victims in the United States are U.S. citizens. I've introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, to fight sex trafficking in America by making sure minors sold for sex aren't prosecuted as criminals but are instead treated as victims. The bill also allows victims of sex trafficking to participate in the Job Corps program to help them get back on their feet, and would create a National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking to encourage cooperation among all the federal, state, and local agencies that work on this problem. We cannot close our eyes to these horrific acts in our own country and across the globe, including the clear evidence of barbarity unfolding before us in Nigeria. Our action or inaction will be felt not only by those schoolgirls being held captive and their families waiting in agony, but by victims and perpetrators of trafficking around the world. Now is the time to act. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Sen. Amy Klobuchar argues that the U.S. must help lead the effort to rescue the kidnapped Nigerian girls .

"(CNN) -- The United States is a Pacific power. Not only do millions of Americans live in states that border or are firmly rooted in the Pacific, more than 300,000 military service members and civilians who support them are stationed throughout the Pacific. Countless American businesses and farmers also rely on access to this expanding market that has become an engine of global economic growth. In addition to reflecting our values, our foreign policy must reflect the fact that our prosperity and security is intimately linked with that of the Asia-Pacific. Having just returned from this critical region, we heard directly from senior U.S. military commanders, along with key leaders in Japan and South Korea, about the desire for bolstering alliances that have been the cornerstone of stability in Asia. We also met senior Chinese officials in Beijing and U.S. business leaders in Shanghai about potential opportunities and challenges accompanying China's dramatic rise. Asia's continued economic growth is not certain, and the region is threatened by a despotic and volatile North Korean regime armed with nuclear weapons. Many nations are concerned that China will use its growing economic and military power to coerce its neighbors. Our allies and adversaries alike have seen how America failed to enforce its ""red line"" in Syria, and they are questioning whether we have the resolve to respond decisively to challenges in Asia. Our partners are watching America's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They fear allowing an assault on Ukraine's territorial integrity to stand will invite challenges to the established international order and fuel already tense maritime territorial disputes that threaten stability in Asia. For decades, America has deterred threats to peace in Asia, and these partners worry America lacks the commitment and capabilities to back threats with action. America cannot lead in the region if it is thousands of miles away. The indispensable symbol of American strength and leadership is the U.S. carrier fleet. Protecting key international shipping lanes -- vital to our own economic stability -- has long been a central mission of the U.S. Navy. But it is a mission that requires the forward basing of significant American naval resources, most importantly aircraft carriers such as the USS George Washington. We were honored to board the George Washington at its forward port facility in Japan and visit its crew. This aircraft carrier is due for a midlife overhaul, but the administration's proposed budget doesn't include funding for this much-needed service, putting the future of it and the 11-carrier fleet in jeopardy. Our military commanders were clear about the need for the unique power projection capabilities provided by our aircraft carrier fleet. These commanders know our allies and adversaries alike are watching to see if America allows its military superiority to wither, and struggle every day to reassure their counterparts throughout the region. America cannot keep the peace alone -- nor have we. Our allies have welcomed American military forces on their soil for decades, allowing the United States to project military power far from our shores and enhancing our security here at home. We are encouraged by the desire of these allies to contribute more to regional security, but much work is needed to help them bolster their defenses, encourage greater coordination among them and reassure our allies and adversaries of our enduring commitment to Asia. The sheer economic dynamism of Asia is impressive, and more than half of the world's population lives there. It is important for America's economy that billions of Asian consumers are able to purchase our goods, services and agricultural products more easily. This is why we support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which is needed not only to facilitate greater trade across the Pacific but also to establish the economic rules of the road firmly for the 21st century. A trade agreement based on mutually beneficial terms will promote real economic growth and real jobs here at home. We saw in China the stunning scope of economic growth that has lifted millions out of poverty and bolstered our own economic fortunes. But we were also struck by the absence of political and religious freedom in China. While in Shanghai, we learned of the plight of a Catholic bishop under house arrest for refusing to be subservient to the Communist Party. And we visited a synagogue that by government edict is only open on High Holy Days, just a few times a year. We believe that with economic freedom there should also be political freedom, and we call upon the Chinese government to respect the universal human rights of its own citizens. America has a bright future in Asia, but only if we seize it. Our trip coincided with President Barack Obama's visit to the region. Both Republicans and Democrats delivered similar messages about the importance of our alliances in Asia and our commitment to the region. Now we must back our words with actions. Unless the United States reinvests in its military, strengthens its alliances and displays strong leadership, we will see increased threats, greater risk of instability and economic turbulence in a region of pivotal importance to America's future.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The countdown to the release of a Michael Jackson posthumous album began Monday with the debut of a song Jackson recorded 15 years ago. ""Chicago,"" which is also known as ""She Was Lovin' Me,"" was a track that didn't make the cut on Jackson's 2001 ""Invincible"" album, but a version updated by producer Timbaland will be on ""Xscape,"" an album to be released next week on Sony's Epic label. ""Jackson had a habit of over-recording for albums; often times this meant outstanding songs were left on the cutting room floor,"" the album liner notes said. Jackson recorded ""Chicago"" at The Hit Factory in New York City after songwriter Cory Rooney sent him a scratch demo in 1999, when Jackson was working on his ""Invincible"" album. Jackson ""fell in love with it"" the first time he heard the demo, according to the liner notes. ""Jackson sings in his lower register in the verses over an ominous beat, slowly painting a story of an illicit affair, before unleashing a torrent of pain and regret in the chorus,"" the album liner notes said about the tune. Fans can hear the full song only on Sony's Music Unlimited streaming service until the official release of all eight tracks on May 13. ""Chicago"" is the first of five songs to be previewed this week, with another single added at each midnight. Another track -- ""Love Never Felt So Good"" -- was released for online downloading after it premiered on the iHeart Radio Awards telecast last week. After Jackson died at age 50 in 2009, while preparing for his ""This Is It"" comeback tour, his estate executors signed a long-term deal with Sony to posthumously release music from the large archives of his recordings. Epic was Jackson's record label for three decades. Epic Chairman L.A. Reid ""was granted unlimited access to the treasures representing four decades of material on which Jackson had completed his vocals,"" the label said. The new album draws from tracks Jackson worked on from 1983 through 1999. Reid chose several producers with the ""gravitas, depth and range to creatively engage with Jackson's work"" to update the recordings for release, Epic said. Timbaland is the lead producer of the album, with contributions from Jerome ""J-Roc"" Harmon, Rodney Jerkins, Stargate and Jackson estate executor John McClain. Each song was ""contemporized"" to make it sound like a current production, but Jackson fans who want to hear the original recordings can purchase a deluxe edition.","Michael Jackson recorded ""Chicago"" at New York's Hit Factory in 1999 .

"(CNN) -- French legend Julien Absalon took his status to new heights when he became the first rider to defend the men's mountain bike Olympic title. Sabine Spitz of Germany celebrates her victory in the women's mountain bike on Saturday. Absalon kept the gold in French hands for the third Olympics in a row -- following Miguel Martinez's victory at Sydney in 2000 -- thanks to a commanding display early in the 36km race which left his rivals trailing. ""The Olympic Games is a massive motivation for every athlete and four years passes quickly, as it has from Athens to Beijing,"" said Absalon, who finished well ahead of compatriot Jean-Christophe Peraud with Nino Schurter pipping world champion and Swiss compatriot Christoph Sauser to the bronze medal. A highly-fancied Swiss trio failed to match Absalon's early pace after he had begun to steadily grind out a lead by the second of the eight scheduled laps. ""It's great to do the double. It feels totally different (from 2004), but this just confirms what I achieved in Athens,"" added Absalon, who denied that he had made his victory look easy. ""I had as tough a race as everyone else. When I saw the chance to make the break I went for it. After that I really gave it everything I had."" In the women's 27km mountain bike race, defending champion Gunn-Rita Dahle from Norway was one of several contenders to fall victim to a course that was finally mastered by Germany's Sabine Spitz. The 36-year-old, who only began racing at the relatively late age of 22, was determined to improve on her bronze medal in Athens. She started fast and was soon racing on her own to gold ahead of Poland's Maja Wloszczowska, who finished with the silver ahead of Russian Irina Kalentieva. ""I feel pure joy at what I have finally achieved after so many years of hard work,"" said Spitz. ""Winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games is the crowning glory."" The first boxing medals were decided on Saturday with Felix Diaz of the Dominican Republic winning his country's first ever Olympic boxing title after beating Thailand's Manus Boonjumnong to take the light-welterweight gold. But Thailand made amends in the flyweight final when Somjit Jongjohor comfortably out-pointing Cuban Andris Laffita 8-2 to claim his first Olympic gold. Vasyl Lomachenko of Ukraine won the featherweight gold medal, capping a spectacular run through the tournament with a first-round stoppage of France's Khedafi Djelkhir. James Degale of Britain won the middleweight gold medal, upsetting Cuba's Emilio Correa in a sloppy bout, while Correa failed to emulate his father's gold medal performance for Cuba in 1972. Rakhim Chakhkiev of Russia gained revenge on Italy's world champion Clemente Russo by claiming heavyweight gold. Chakhkiev was beaten by Russo in the final of the world championships. China's Ma Lin won gold in the men's singles table tennis tournament, defeating teammate Wang Hao to secure a clean sweep of all gold medals on offer to the host nation. World number two Ma fought off world number one Wang in a scorching final strewn with fast and furious rallies to win 4-1 and cement China's status as the superpower of the sport. The victory hands China a clean sweep of all six medals in the singles competition, after teammate Wang Liqin removed the last obstacle to the Chinese Wall -- defeating Sweden's veteran Jorgen Persson for the bronze medal. A goal from Christopher Zeller in the 16th minute gave Germany the men's field hockey gold medal by defeating Spain 1-0 in the final. Australia took the bronze with a 6-2 win over the Netherlands in the play-off between the losing semifinalists. Australian Matthew Mitcham won the men's 10m platform diving title to spoil China's bid for a sweep of all eight diving gold medals. China's Zhou Luxin settled for silver, while Russia's Gleb Galperin claimed the bronze medal. Elsewhere, on the penultimate day of competition, Russia won the team event and swept both gold medals in synchronized swimming for the third consecutive Olympics. Russia finished with a combined 99.500 points after Saturday's free routine. Spain took the silver with 98.251 points and China claimed the bronze with 97.334. Anastasia Ermakova and Anastasia Davydova already won gold in the duet on Wednesday and were also part of Russia's eight-woman squad for the team event. Norway's women's handball team won their first Olympic gold medal, beating Russia 34-27 in the final. Norway rushed to an 8-1 lead after just eight minutes and remained well ahead for the rest of Saturday's match. Neither Norway nor Russia has ever won a gold medal in women's handball. Brazil won their first women's volleyball gold medal after defeating the United States 25-15 18-25 25-13 25-21 in a hard-fought final. Saturday also saw the remaining six disciplines decided in the canoeing, with Ken Wallace of Australia winning the gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak singles. The first-time Olympian won in one minute, 37.252 seconds from Adam van Koeverden of Canada. Briton Tim Brabants took the bronze medal to add to the gold he won in the 1,000m race. Inna Osypenko-Radomska of Ukraine won gold in the women's 500-meter kayak singles, just nipping Italy in a tight finish. Osypenko-Radomska's time of 1:50.673 seconds was enough to just pip Josefa Idem of Italy, with Germany's Katrin Wagner-Augustin taking bronze. Saul Craviotto and Carlos Perez of Spain won gold medal in the men's 500-meter kayak doubles, slipping past the defending Olympic champions for victory. Craviotto and Perez clocked 1:28.736 seconds to edge Ronald Rauhe and Tim Wieskotter into silver in a major shock as the German pair have been world champions since 2001. Raman Piatrushenka and Vadzim Makhneu of Belarus took bronze. Katalin Kovacs and Natasa Janic of Hungary won the gold medal in the women's 500-meter kayak doubles, successfully defending their Olympic triumph in Athens. The two-time world champions saw off Beata Mikolajczyk and Aneta Konieczna of Poland with the French tandem of Marie Delattre and Anne-Laure Viard taking bronze. Maxim Opalev of Russia took gold medal in the men's 500-meter canoe singles, giving him his third medal in the last three Olympics and first gold. Opalev took bronze four years ago in the Athens Games and silver in Sydney. David Cal of Spain won his second silver medal in two days, after also finishing second in the 1,000m. Iurii Cheban of Ukraine took the bronze medal. Meng Guanliang and Yang Wenjun of China took gold in the men's 500-meter canoe doubles, successfully defending their Olympic triumph in Athens. Sergey Ulegin and Alexander Kostoglod of Russia won silver while the German pair of Christian Gille and Thomasz Wylenzek took bronze. Mexico's Maria del Rosario Espinoza won the gold medal in the women's 67kg taekwondo category. Espinoza, the 2007 world champion, easily defeated Norway's Nina Solheim on points after going ahead in the first round and never falling behind. Winning bronze were Britain's Sarah Stevenson, who defeated Egypt's Noha Abd Rabo, and Brazil's Natalia Falavigna, who outscored Sweden's Karolina Kedzierska. Russia's Evgeniya Kanaeva won gold in the rhythmic gymnastics individual all-around competition, posting the highest score in all four rotations of the event. Her final total of 75.500 points was enough to beat Inna Zhukova of Belarus, who gained 71.925 points for the silver. Anna Bessonova of the Ukraine had 71.875 points for her second straight bronze. In women's basketball, Lisa Leslie of the United States capped off her illustrious Olympic career with a fourth straight gold medal, scoring 14 points in a 92-65 victory over Australia. She joined former teammate Teresa Edwards as the only basketball players ever to win four Olympic gold medals. ""It's a blessing for me to be out on this floor, now participating in my fourth Olympics and walking away with a fourth gold medal,"" Leslie told the Associated Press. Russia took the bronze, beating hosts China 94-81 as Becky Hammon scored 22 points. The Australians have now lost to the Americans in the gold medal game in the past three Olympics with all three defeats coming by double-digit margins.","Julien Absalon becomes the first rider to defend the men's mountain bike title .

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's government is facing rising religious violence in the north, a long-simmering separatist movement in the oil-rich south and now a nationwide strike fueled by widespread anger over the end of fuel subsidies seen by many as one of the few benefits of living in the largely impoverished state. The issues, all intertwined in Nigeria's complicated web of political, ethnic and religious relationships and rivalries, add up to a difficult challenge for the government of President Goodluck Jonathan, who just a few days ago promised a renewed focus on economic, fiscal and education reforms in 2012. ""Jonathan is a president under fire. His actions over the last week are that of a desperate president,"" Nigerian political journalist Terfa Tilley-Gyado said. Particularly curious, Nigeria analyst John Campbell said, is why Jonathan would choose now to resurrect the Nigerian government's repeated efforts to scuttle the fuel subsidy, which is highly popular with the country's 155 million residents -- many of whom live on less than $2 a day. ""One would have thought that in an area of heightened religious conflict that the last thing you would want to do is provoke a general strike,"" said Campbell, a senior fellow for Africa Policy Studies with the Council on Foreign Relations. Read more about what is behind Nigeria's fuel protests . Whatever its reasons, finding a way out will be a trick for the government, he said. If the government backs down and restores the subsidy, it may appear weak to northern militants and southern separatists, Campbell said. If it tries to wait out a strike in hopes that the protests will disintegrate, it risks a crippling disruption in the flow of oil, which provides 95 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange and 80 percent of its government's budget. Read more about Nigerian protests over the end of the fuel subsidy . ""The government finds itself, I think, in an extraordinarily difficult situation,"" Campbell said. Until the New Year's Day announcement by Jonathan's government that the country would end fuel subsidies that held down the cost of gasoline for Nigeria's 155 million residents, perhaps the largest immediate crisis facing the administration was the religious violence in the north. More than 30 Christians died in violence last week in Adamawa, prompting a 24-hour curfew in that northwestern Nigerian state to guard against Christian reprisals, a government chaplain said Saturday. Boko Haram, a shadowy militant Islamic group that is said to favor strict Sharia law, is frequently blamed for the sectarian violence. The attacks came several days after the government declared a state of emergency in several areas as Jonathan pledged to continue fighting to quell the violence. ""While we have made progress and overcame most of the challenges on many fields, there have been those amongst us who want to impose their will on the majority of us."" he said in a New Year's message. ""This government will lead Nigeria and Nigerians to resist such imposition."" But Jonathan, who took over as president two years ago after the previous president left the country to be treated for a heart problem, has not earned high marks for his handling of the issue, Tilley-Gyado said. Jonathan's recent revelation that Boko Haram sympathizers may have infiltrated the government is particularly vexing, he said. ""Nigerians find it outrageous to hear him say about his government, which he had a major part in putting together, that there are Boko Haram sympathizers within it,"" Tilley-Gyado said. ""People would like to know who they are and what efforts are being made to prosecute them."" Jonathan has done better at managing the fallout from sporadic attacks on oil facilities in the Niger Delta region, Tilley-Gyado said. A group called the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, or MEND, has claimed responsibility for some of those acts out of frustration with how the country's oil wealth is distributed. Searing anger as Nigerians protests fuel price rise . Nigeria is the world's 10th largest oil producer, according to the CIA. But little of the money oil brings in comes back to residents of the Delta region, Campbell noted. And government plans to embark on a building program in the Muslim-dominated north, along with threats of reprisals against Muslims over the killing of Christians, threaten to inflame tensions in the south and reopen wounds from the country's civil war in the late 1960s, Campbell said. That conflict left as many as 3 million people dead. Such concerns prompted prominent Nigerian authors, including the 1986 Nobel Prize winning playwright Wole Soyinka, to issue a statement urging calm. ""The fears we have all secretly nursed are coming to realisation."" said Soyinka, novelist Chinua Achebe and poet and playwright J.P. Clark. ""Rumblings and veiled threats have given way to eruption, and the first cracks in the wall of patience and forbearance can no longer be wished away. Boko Haram is very likely celebrating its first tactical victory: provoking retaliation in some parts of the nation."" Against the backdrop of these issues, along with Nigeria's staggering poverty and critical infrastructure issues, Jonathan announced last week that the government was ending a fuel subsidy, saving nearly $7 billion a year, according to the government. The money is being redirected to a wide-ranging infrastructure construction program, additional social spending and economic initiatives, the government said. But those plans didn't salve the pain for many Nigerians, who responded explosively to the proposal, which is the latest in a series of failed efforts dating back decades by the Nigerian government to eliminate the popular subsidy. ""We still don't have light,"" travel and tourism business owner Shade Ladipo told CNN last week. ""The roads are terrible. It was already hard to live in Nigeria. This will make life even worse."" Protests quickly morphed into a call for a general strike by trade unions, which have not enjoyed particularly strong support in Nigeria despite low wages and poor working conditions, Campbell said. Those strikes succeeded in shutting down wide swaths of the country, according to union and media accounts. In some places, police clashed with protesters. Much of the anger has to do with a sense that Nigerian elites are not sharing in the sacrifice Jonathan says is necessary to move Nigeria forward, Tilley-Gyado said. In fact, protesters have adopted the ""Occupy"" moniker that has characterized protests against what protesters consider to be greed on the part of corporations and the very rich. ""With the fuel subsidy, he has put the cart before the horse and has not assured Nigerians that the austerity measures that have been imposed on them are being shared by the those who rule the country,"" he said. ""The sheer cost of running the government is draining Nigeria's fortunes."" In a January 7 speech, Jonathan said elimination of the subsidy was a tough but necessary choice for the country's economic future.

"(CNN) -- A Florida judge ruled Thursday that a woman's defamation lawsuit against Casey Anthony can go forward, contending that a jury should make the final decision on several contentious issues critical to the case. Zenaida Gonzalez has filed a civil suit against Casey Anthony, who was acquitted last year of murder and other charges tied to the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee though she was convicted on four counts of providing false information to law enforcement officers. Gonzalez alleges that Anthony defamed her and damaged her reputation when she claimed that a nanny named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez had taken Caylee, who was reported missing in July 2008 -- a month after she was last seen. The girl's remains were found in December of that year. Authorities were never able to find the nanny. But they did find Gonzalez, the plaintiff in this case, who claimed she never met Anthony or her daughter. Anthony's civil attorneys have argued that their client never identified the specific woman suing her as the ""Zenaida Gonzalez,"" the name she gave police. In her judgment Thursday, Circuit Judge Lisa Munyon ruled that the critical issue of whether or not Anthony -- in her statements to police and in a recorded jailhouse conversation with her parents -- fingered Gonzalez, the plaintiff, or effectively exonerated her in her daughter's disappearance ""must be decided by a jury."" ""Both parties agree that the defendant did not implicate (Gonzalez) in the disappearance of the child in the July 16, 2008, statements to law enforcement,"" Munyon wrote in her ruling. ""However, the inferences to be drawn from the July 25, 2008, statement (to her parents) are disputed matters for jury determination."" Moreover, Gonzalez's assertion that Casey's mother Cindy Anthony was ""acting as (an) agent of"" her daughter is likewise ""a disputed matter for jury determination."" Munyon's ruling followed a March 23 hearing in Orlando, Florida, in which Gonzalez's lawyers called for a ""summary judgment"" in their client's favor and Anthony's defense team argued for the lawsuit to be dismissed. The defamation trial is scheduled to begin January 2, 2013. InSession's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report.","Zenaida Gonzalez has sued Casey Anthony for defamation .

"Beijing (CNN) -- When it comes to Russia's annexation of Crimea and possible further expansion in eastern Ukraine, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is taking the long view. ""This isn't a matter of one or two days or one or two weeks,"" Hagel told CNN's Jim Sciutto in an interview Wednesday during a visit to China. ""When Russia has taken the action it has to violate the integrity and sovereignty of a nation, there will be long-term consequences."" Now, he said, ""those long-term consequences are playing out."" Long-term consequences . News headlines chronicle continued political instability in the region, with pro-Russian separatists occupying government buildings in eastern Ukraine while Russian troops are gathered across the border. The unrest follows a similar scenario in the Crimean Peninsula, where pro-Russian forces seized effective military control earlier this year and a hasty referendum chose independence from Ukraine, followed by Crimea's annexation by Russia. Hagel rejected any finality to the Crimea annexation, saying the United States and most of the world didn't accept it. The United Nations overwhelmingly condemned the move, he noted, and the United States and its European allies imposed new economic sanctions with more pending if the situation worsens. ""Russia has done great damage to its standing in the world,"" Hagel said, adding that the sanctions will hurt. ""There may be more consequences so I don't agree that they have gotten away with this,"" he said. ""Yes, they are still in Crimea. Yes, they still have troops on the border, but these are long-term dynamics that need to play out."" Russia isolated . Russia has ""really isolated itself in a global community that Russia needs,"" Hagel argued, adding that ""we all need to be part of a global community for our own economic interests as well as security and stability."" The United States and others have accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest in eastern Ukraine as a pretext for military intervention. Hagel said the United States and NATO remained ""vigilant"" about the Russian troop buildup along the Ukraine border, adding that ""we are always looking at the options that we need to take."" So far, the Western allies have boosted the number of jet fighters patrolling the region and suspended all military cooperation with Russia. Hagel said that Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, has been asked to come up with ""new and additional measures and options."" Secretary of State John Kerry warned Tuesday of increased sanctions targeting Russia's banking, energy, mining and arms sectors if the Russians ""cross over"" into eastern Ukraine. Current sanctions target individuals over the Crimean annexation. Fort Hood shootings . On another issue in the news, Hagel told CNN that the latest shootings at Fort Hood in Texas would be thoroughly investigated to find any problems, but he didn't think it reflected a deeper problem in security at military bases. A soldier who brought a personal handgun onto the base in violation of regulations allegedly killed three people and wounded 16 before taking his own life. Last week's shootings occurred five years after an Army major killed 13 people and wounded 32 in an attack at Fort Hood. Security changes followed that attack, including restrictions on personal firearms on the base. ""If there was an issue here, a procedure or process that wasn't followed, we'll find out,"" Hagel said of the recent Fort Hood shooting. ""If we need to do new things in order to protect that base and all bases, we will do it.."" He noted that security generally is good at the thousands of U.S. military installations, but added that even one attack on soldiers at a base ""is too many."" Hagel becomes the first foreigner to visit Chinese aircraft carrier . Building trust with China . Hagel's visit to China came amid tensions between Beijing and U.S. ally Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea, as well as American concerns over China's role in cyberattacks on U.S. businesses. In the interview, he said that despite differences with China, a series of steps continued to expand contacts and improve cooperation between the armed forces of the the two nations. As an example, he noted eight new military-to-military initiatives he signed with China's defense minister. ""Now, this doesn't resolve every difference, every challenge and question that we have,"" Hagel said. ""But it continues to build a floor, a confidence and trust in each other, opening up more dialogue, opening up more conversation -- direct, clear conversation -- about controversial issues."" In addition, Hagel became the first foreigner allowed to board the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning, an event he called ""a big deal."" At the same time, he reiterated the U.S. commitment to a mutual self-defense treaty with Japan, but emphasized that ""this is not a zero-sum game"" between relations with Tokyo or China. ""We all need to get along in the world through peace, prosperity, stability, security,"" Hagel said. ""It's in China's interests. It's in America's interests. It's in all of our interests.""

"(CNN) -- ""Game of Thrones"" fan Dave Goldblatt is preparing to die -- and by the pen of George R.R. Martin no less. Goldblatt, a Facebook employee, is one of the generous contributors to Martin's recently announced charity auction benefiting the Wild Wolf Sanctuary and the Food Depot of Santa Fe in New Mexico. As announced last week, the author of the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" books -- which have been adapted into HBO's Ã¼ber-popular series ""Game of Thrones"" -- is offering a selection of prizes for fans who donate money to his chosen causes. A donation of $25 would be met with a thank you e-card, while a donation of $100 gets a campaign T-shirt and a thank-you video. And for a contribution of $20,000, Martin offered to create a character in honor of the donor and put him or her in an upcoming ""Song of Ice and Fire"" installment, with a bonus of the character meeting one of Martin's famously ghastly deaths. Only two people could win that prize, and Goldblatt is one of them. As part of the deal, he gets to choose his character's ""station"" in the world of ""Thrones,"" and the 30-year-old really wants to be a Valyrian, because ""for whatever reason, I thought the Valyrians were cool."" ""I'm just lucky enough to be in a position to do this,"" Goldblatt told ABC News of his $20,000 contribution. ""Obviously, the money is going to charity, so it's an added bonus. I didn't immediately seek to help wolf sanctuaries, but the more I read about the charities, I learned it was a worthwhile cause."" According to The Hollywood Reporter, the two $20,000 prizes were gone within hours, much to Martin's surprise. ""The outpouring of love and support has been far greater than I could ever anticipate,"" the writer told the magazine, ""and has left me astonished and at a loss for words."" Perhaps Martin shouldn't be so shocked. ""Game of Thrones"" is now HBO's most-watched series of all time, surpassing even ""The Sopranos."" For the most part, the reclusive author has been happy with how his epic ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" has been translated for TV, although he would make a few changes if he could. For example, instead of just 10 episodes a season, Martin told The New York Times he wishes HBO would grant ""Game of Thrones"" 13, so that ""we could include smaller scenes that we had to cut, scenes that make the story deeper and richer."" As it is, the highly acclaimed ""Game of Thrones"" draws an average of 18.4 million viewers per episode -- and that's even with gruesome scenes such as a recent death by exploding head. ""Despite my sinister repute, I actually find it hard to kill off characters that I've been writing about for some time. Good guys or bad guys, they're all my children,"" Martin told The Hollywood Reporter. But with these two new characters, ""the slaughter should be easy, since the victims will be laying down their lives in a good cause. I will do my best to make their ends memorable."" Goldblatt isn't sure what his character's name will be in Martin's book, or how the character will meet his inevitable grisly fate, but he's nonetheless satisfied with his choice. ""I want to be a Valyrian if at all possible,"" Goldblatt told the magazine. ""But he figures it out himself. I wouldn't want to impinge upon his creative process.""","A fan gave $20,000 to charity to be killed off as character in a George R.R. Martin book .

"(CNN) -- Two separate incidents at coal mines in Southwest China over the weekend left at least three miners dead and 42 trapped, state media reported. Days of heavy rain caused a mine at Niupeng in Guizhou province to flood on Saturday morning; while ""rain-saturated earth on the surface collapsed into a shaft"" at another pit in Guangxi around noon the same day, killing three miners, Xinhua said. The report added that more than 1,000 police, firemen, and paramilitary personnel joined the mission to rescue the trapped workers at Niupeng. By Monday the water level at the mine had dropped but was still 40 meters (131ft) higher than where 23 of the miners are believed trapped, according to reports from China National Radio. Local authorities said the heavy rain may have caused a previously dry river to rise, while possibly increasing the water level in underground rivers around the mines. According to Xinhua, the Niupeng mine's investors have already been detained by the police. At Guangxi, high concentrations of gas prevented workers from using machines to dig out another 19 trapped miners trapped at a depth of 390 meters (1,200ft), China Daily said. 50 other miners were reported to have escaped the cave-in. Continued rain on Sunday further complicated the rescue effort, it added. ""The rescue team is only equipped with shovels and rail track cars"", Meng Qingguan, head of the Heshan Work Safety Bureau, told CCTV on Saturday. Mining accidents are not uncommon in China, as very few of the mines follow the government's safety regulations. According to the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS), almost 2,500 miners were killed in mine accidents in 2010. However, the head of SACMS, Zhao Tiechui, said Tuesday that the number of miners dead or missing from accidents had decreased by 35% from last year, with just 807 dead so far in 2011.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Watch out, America. China is steadily catching up in space. Between June and August this year, China plans to launch its manned Shenzhou-9 spacecraft and then rendezvous and dock with a space lab which has been orbiting the earth since September. Three astronauts will undertake the voyage, but one of them will not board the space lab. He will remain inside the spacecraft as a precautionary measure in case of emergency. It will be China's first crew expedition involving manual docking. If all goes as planned, China will become only the third nation, next to the U.S. and Russia, to dock capsules in space. ""It demonstrates China's continued commitment to becoming a first-class space power with an independent space capability,"" says Taylor Fravel, associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). ""This is very exclusive club."" China's space program goes farther. ""The Chinese manned space program has announced its plan on 20 future space voyages,"" wrote Zhou Erjie of the official Xinhua News Agency. ""China also plans to establish its own space lab around 2016 and assemble a 60-ton manned space station around 2020, when the current International Space Station is estimated to likely retire."" China has also begun efforts to explore the moon using space robotics. The country's eventual goal is a manned lunar landing. The Chinese exploration plans, announced in December, come as the United States has been scaling back its plans and funding for space exploration. China's space program has become a campaign issue in the United States. In recent debates among presidential aspirants in the Republican Party, candidates criticized America's flagging space program. Mitt Romney called for a partnership among ""corporate America as well as the defense network and others"" to ""create a plan that will keep our space program thriving and growing."" Newt Gingrich cited China's soaring ambitions. ""Every serious analyst understands that the Chinese are going all out to dominate space,"" Gingrich said. ""I would like to have an American on the moon before the Chinese get there."" To be sure, China is still decades away from a moon-landing. Chinese officials speak of a three-step manned space flight plan: send man into orbit, dock spacecraft together to form a small space lab, and ultimately build a large space station. ""They are currently in step two,"" says Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. War College. ""For comparative purposes, it's about where the U.S. was during the Gemini program."" China has been striving to put man into orbit since 1992. China has developed its own spaceship, the Shenzhou, or Divine Vessel, which observers say resembles Russia's Soyuz space capsule. Over the years, it has upgraded its launch vehicles, built new spaceflight facilities and trained a stable of astronauts. Still, China did not put a man in space until 2003, 41 years after John Glenn became the first American to orbit earth. That year, Colonel Yang Liwei orbited the Earth 14 times aboard the Shenzhou 5 space capsule. Yang became an instant celebrity, paraded around the country and overseas. Several months later, he was promoted to general. Yang's voyage has enhanced China's image overseas and boosted national pride at home. Only Russia, the United States and China have sent men into space. Before that, China's space program was largely seen as capable but lacking in sophistication. I saw that myself up close. In August 1997, I had the rare chance of visiting the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in rural Sichuan province to observe the launch of Mabuhay, the first Filipino communications satellite. Inside a windowless building, we watched Chinese staff work frenetically behind rows of computers and panels. They struck me as quite unassuming in their white wrinkled robes that made them look MORE like doctors in a hospital ward than aerospace experts. There was palpable anxiety before the launch. Two years earlier, a rocket exploded in this launch site after liftoff and killed several people on the ground. This time, when the Chinese-made rocket rumbled skyward, the crowd in the hall cheered. The glitch-less launch restored China's reputation and self-confidence. Over the years, China has been vying for a bigger slice of the lucrative satellite-launch market. China also looks to harness aerospace technology for trickle-down spinoffs in telecommunications, weather forecasting, agriculture, medicine and navigation. Experts say the upcoming launch will place China close to putting a space station in orbit. Such a station, a la ISS, will enable China to conduct scientific and military research. Experts say the Chinese could use the station to conduct biological, genetic and energy research. At the same time, they could also use it as a platform to spy on potential adversaries or to develop lasers capable of blinding or disabling other satellites. The Chinese space program is largely run by government-owned enterprises or military-affiliated groups. Many of the pilots, scientists and engineers are active or demobilized army officers. China promises to never use space research for military purposes. ""A rapidly developing space industry does not mean China has renounced its commitment to peace,"" says Qi Faren, the chief designer of the Shenzhou spaceship series. ""All China is doing is to pursue a peaceful development of the space industry as planned."" Still, experts say, the U.S. remains concerned about Chinese space activities. ""Over 95% of space technology is dual use, meaning of value to both civil and military communities,"" says Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. War College. ""While the U.S. is still far ahead of China technically, China has something critical that the U.S. does notâ€”the political will to push forward."" If the trajectory remains unchanged, experts say, China's space activities may well surpass those of Russia and the European Space Agency within a decade or so. That will position China just next to the U.S. as a dominant space power.","China plans to launch its first manned flight to dock at space lab in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Nine Peruvian miners emerged into the daylight Wednesday morning after six days trapped in a collapsed mine. State television showed the miners leaving the mine, each supported by two rescuers. They wore sunglasses to protect their eyes from the light, after spending so much time in darkness. For days, a tube snaked down to the collapsed cavern was the only connection the miners had to the surface. It provided them with oxygen, food and water, as well as communication. Peruvian President Ollanta Humala greeted the miners at the mouth of the mine. The group unfurled the red and white Peruvian flag and waved at television cameras. ""We are happy that this high-risk operation was successful,"" said Claudio Saenz, a fire department official with knowledge of the rescue efforts. The miners had been stuck since Thursday in the wildcat Cabeza de Negro mine in southern Peru. A cave-in over the weekend slowed rescue efforts. It was not clear what caused the initial collapse. Humala's government has made a push for illegal mines and miners in Peru to be formalized and regulated so that risks decrease. After the rescue, he made a similar argument. ""This should lead us to reflect that we have to avoid these kind of risks because the results will not always be like today,"" he said. Mining is big business in Peru, which is a major world producer of copper, silver, gold and other minerals. The ordeal stirred memories of a 2010 Chilean mine collapse in which 33 men were trapped underground for 69 days. All those miners were rescued, pulled one by one from hundreds of meters beneath the Earth's surface with a specially designed capsule.","NEW: Humala renews his call to regulate illegal mines .

"(CNN) -- A coalition of news media organizations has filed suit in an effort to get the government investigation into the Crandall Canyon mine accident opened to the public. Rescuers drill into the Crandall Canyon mine on August 16 to try to reach six miners trapped underground. The group -- including CNN, The Associated Press, The Salt Lake Tribune and the Deseret Morning News -- asked a federal court on Monday to stop the proceedings until a judge can rule on whether to open them. The suit also asked that a transcript be provided of any closed hearings that may have already occurred. The coalition noted that the same court ruled after a similar accident more than 20 years ago that the Mine Safety and Health Administration must make its proceedings public. ""Sadly, another mine disaster and more Utah miner (and mine rescuer) deaths have led Defendant here to convene another MSHA panel, this time with a goal of determining MSHA's alleged complicity in the accident,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys wrote. ""This MSHA panel today is basically doing the same types of things that it did 20 some years ago."" The Department of Labor, which includes MSHA, has not allowed the news media access to its investigation into the August 6 cave-in of the mine in central Utah. Six miners were trapped and are presumed dead. On August 16, three other people, including an MSHA inspector, died as they attempted to reach the trapped miners, whose bodies have never been recovered. A call to the Department of Labor was not immediately returned. Also joining the suit is the Utah Media Coalition, representing Utah newspapers, television stations and journalism groups.

"(CNN) -- Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian threw away the bronze medal he won in the Greco-Roman category in disgust in a protest over judging in his semifinal bout. Abrahamian places his medal on the competition mat in protest at a judging decision. Abrahamian was beaten in the 84 kg class by eventual gold medal winner Andrea Minguzzi of Italy but was furious with the verdict, shouting at the referee before confronting the judges. The Athens silver medal winner had to be restrained by teammates and later went on to win a bronze medal match. But the row continued at the medal ceremony as he only grudgingly mounted the podium and after receiving his medal made a point of taking it off and leaving it in the center of the competition mat. Swedish fans in the arena disagreed strongly with the original decision, jeering the judges, while coach Leo Myllari also weighed in. ""It's all politics,"" he said. The medal was later returned to the sport's governing body. In archery, China's Zhang Juanjuan has broken one of the Olympics' tightest strangleholds  by upsetting South Korea's defending champion Park Sung-Hyun to win the women's individual gold medal. Korean women archers have won every Olympic gold since Seo Hyang-Soon first took the title at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. But roared on by a passionate home crowd, Zhang beat Park 110-109 in a tense final on a rain-swept course for a famous victory. The bronze went to second seed Yun Ok-Hee, also of South Korea, who was desperate to win a medal for her coach Moon Hyung-Cgul who is fighting thyroid cancer. Zhang beat all three South Koreans on her way to the title, setting a new Olympic record of 115 in her semifinal victory over world record holder Yun. ""I have won this honor for all archers in China and I believe the future will be brighter,"" said Zhang. ""I dreamed I could win a gold medal every day. I was well prepared. It was a hard journey but I finally made it."" Zhang needed to shoot a nine on her final arrow to win, but said she never doubted she could do it. ""I was quite confident,"" she said. ""I shot the last arrow with no hesitation because I was confident."" South Korea had earlier won both the men's and women's team gold medals. There was another gold for the host nation in the judo hall when Yang Xiuli won the women's 78kg competition -- China's second judo gold. Yang beat Cuban Yalennis Castillo by a contentious judges' decision in the final -- following 10 minutes of gruelling combat. The pair fought to a 1-1 draw at the end of the regulation five minutes, then traded ineffective throws to force a judges' decision, which Yang won amid roaring cheers from the home-country crowd. South Korean Jeong Gyeong Mi claimed bronze as she threw and then pinned down Brazil's Edinaci Silva. Frenchwoman Stephanie Possamai recorded her first victory in four attempts against Spanish veteran Esther San Miguel to win the other bronze medal. Naidan Tuvshinbayar won Mongolia's first ever Olympic gold medal when claiming the men's 100kg title. In the final, Naidan beat Askhat Zhitkeyev, for whom the consolation was winning Kazakhstan's first-ever Olympic medal in the sport. Naidan, who upset Athen's Olympic champion Keiji Suzuki of Japan in his opening bout, scored a waza ari with just under two minutes remaining, then added two yuko to seal the victory . Azerbaijani fighter Movlud Miraliev took bronze by beating Poland's Przemyslaw Matyaszek, before celebrating with an impressive backflip, while European champion Henk Grol of the Netherlands also claimed bronze, beating Georgian Levan Zhorzholiani. Meanwhile, Chiara Cainero of Italy won the gold medal in women's skeet shooting, beating American Kim Rhode and Christine Brinker of Germany in a shoot-off. The three finished tied on 93 targets -- and Cainero hit the first two targets of the shoot-off, with Rhode and Brinker each missing one. The shoot-off continued to determine second place, with Rhode prevailing. Cainero led after qualifying with a score of 72, but she hit only 21 of 25 targets in the final round, enabling Rhode and Brinker to catch up. Rhode won gold in double trap in 1996 and 2004, but that event was eliminated for women before the Beijing Games. China's Du Li rebounded from her defeat in the first medal competition of the Games, to win gold in the women's 50-meter, three-position rifle event. Du led by one point entering the finals and shot a 101.3 to win with an Olympic record 690.3 points. Silver medalist Katerina Emmons finished with 687.7 points, while Cuba's Eglis Yaima Cruz got the bronze. The victory will ease the disappointment of Du's performance in the 10-meter air rifle event, when she was a favorite to claim the honor of winning the first gold medal in Beijing but flopped to finish fifth behind Czech Emmons, admitting the pressure of competing at home got to her. The host nation suffered a rare disappointment when the Chinese trio lost to Ukraine in the final of the women's team saber fencing. Olga Kharlan scored nine of the bout's last 13 points, leading the Ukrainian  team to a surprise 45-44 victory over the China . Ukraine trailed 40-36 when Kharlan entered the strip for the final round against China's Tan Xue. The first team to 45 points wins and, after Kharlan rallied to a 44-all tie, everything was riding on the final point. After both fencers attacked, the official checked video replay but awarded neither athlete a point. Kharlan then scored the winning touch to complete a remarkable comeback. In team fencing, three fencers for each team rotate over nine rounds. In her last two rounds, Kharlan outscored her opponents 21-9. China settled for the silver medal, and the United States took the bronze. The U.S. featured all three individual medalists in women's saber but were upset by Ukraine in the semifinals. Heavy rain disrupted much of Thursday's action and there was no action possible in either the rowing or canoeing events. At the Shunyi Rowing-Canoeing Park, the entire schedule was shifted to Friday, which was to be an off-day for the rowers. The rain also washed out Thursday's canoe-kayak events, including the semifinals and the final of the women's kayak singles and the men's canoe double final. The schedule has also been moved to Friday, when no competition was scheduled. Following the completion of all Thursday's medal events, China lead the way witha massive 22 gold medals. The United States have 10, while South Korea, Italy and Germany all have six.","Swedish wrestler Ara Abrahamian throws away bronze medal in disgust .

"(CNN) -- Police have launched an investigation into the death of a 23-year-old man who was killed in a human cannonball stunt gone awry in England, they said Tuesday. The incident occurred during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at a Kent County showground southeast of London. A man who apparently was fired from a cannon died on Monday after a safety net failed to work, a police statement said. All daredevil stunt shows have been cancelled pending the outcome of the police investigation, the statement said. ""My officers will be looking into this tragic incident to try and establish what happened,"" acting chief inspector Steve Griffith said. Health and safety officials from a local government council also are part of the investigation, Griffith said. ""We need to understand why this poor man died so that we can take the appropriate steps,"" he said. The victim's parents have been notified, police said, but his body has not been formally identified and so authorities are not releasing his identify. The stunt show has been touring since 1991. It features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes. ""Scott and the team are still reeling with shock and grief over the loss of their colleague and fellow stunt performer in the tragic accident at the show yesterday afternoon,"" the show said on its website ""Our thoughts are with his family and friends at this sad time."" David Smith, Jr., who holds the Guinness Book of World Records entry for distance shot from a cannon -- 59.05 meters, or nearly 194 feet -- said he had not before heard the terminology about a safety net's failure to engage. He also said careful planning can make the shots less dangerous. Smith, 33, whose father taught the stunt to his seven children, has been ejected from the barrel of a cannon some 5,000 times. It can be nerve-wracking, the record-holder said, but should not prove disastrous. ""We've never had a cannon not fire or miss a net, and I mean we're talking tens of thousands of cannon shots combined between us all,"" he told CNN. After 14 years of taking his act across around the world, ""I feel that my cannon shots are probably safer than me driving to the next show -- because I control my environment and I control my equipment."" Still, he acknowledged, ""We've had some broken bones and stuff."" He expressed condolences to the family of the man who died.

"Yangon, Myanmar (CNN) -- Residents of the city in central Myanmar where clashes between Buddhists and the Muslim minority killed dozens of people last week struggled to resume their daily lives on Monday with a state of emergency still in place. Even as an uneasy calm prevailed in Meiktila, the city at the heart of the unrest, police reported fresh arson attacks on Muslim properties in other areas, showing the challenges Myanmar authorities face in reining in communal tensions in this nascent democracy. A group of Buddhists on Saturday night torched 65 houses and religious buildings in Yemethin Township, which is about 40 kilometers south of Meiktila and not under a state of emergency, according to Lt. Col. Aung Min, a spokesman for the Myanmar Police Force. And on Sunday night, smaller outbreaks of arson took place in other towns further south, including Okpo and Tatkon, he said. The attacks over the weekend caused property damage, but didn't result in any deaths, Aung Min said. That contrasts with the violence in Meiktila last week, which killed at least 32 people, according to the New Light of Myanmar, a state-run newspaper. In the Meiktila clashes, which were reportedly set off by a dispute between a Muslim gold shop owner and two Buddhist sellers, rioters set fire to houses schools and mosques, prompting thousands of residents to flee their homes. State of emergency . As the violence threatened to spiral out of control, authorities declared a state of emergency on Friday, which allows the military to help reinstate order. Police confiscated weapons such as swords and machetes from groups of Buddhists -- some of them monks -- who were roaming the streets, officials said. As authorities began to clear up after the mayhem, they found more than 20 bodies so badly burned they couldn't be identified, the New Light of Myanmar reported. The newspaper said Sunday the unrest had left 8,707 people living in temporary shelters such as a soccer stadium and a monastery in Meiktila, a lakeside city about 130 kilometers north of the administrative capital, Naypyidaw. But Win Htein, an opposition member of parliament for the area, on Monday gave a higher estimate for the number of people displaced by the unrest, saying 10,000 Muslims and 7,000 Buddhists had been driven from their homes. ""We are facing the problem of not having enough food and blankets,"" he said. At the same time, he said, the overall situation in the city had improved,with shops starting to reopen. Win Htein had said last week that he believed that most of those killed in the violence were Muslims. Police have detained a total of 36 people in relation to the recent clashes in Meiktila and other towns, Aung Min said Monday. Concerns after previous unrest . The United Nations and the United States have both expressed concern about the recent violence in Myanmar, which is emerging from decades of military repression and has taken a number of significant steps toward democracy in recent years under President Thein Sein. The sudden boiling over of tensions between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar follows sectarian troubles that killed scores of people in the west of the country last year. Those clashes, in Rakhine State, took place between the Buddhist majority and the Rohingya, a stateless ethnic Muslim group. Most of the victims in that unrest were Rohingya. Tens of thousands more were left living in makeshift camps, and many of them have since joined those who attempt each year to flee to Thailand and Malaysia in flimsy boats.

"(CNN) -- Five people have now been charged in connection with the vicious mob beating of a Detroit man that some are calling a hate crime. Latrez Cummings, 19, has been arrested and faces the same charges as the other suspects: assault with intent to murder and assault with intent to do great bodily harm, Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy announced Thursday. Bruce Edward Wimbush Jr., 17, Wonzey Saffold, 30, and James Deontae Davis, 24, were arraigned on Tuesday. The fifth suspect -- an unnamed 16-year-old who is being charged as a juvenile -- was also charged Thursday with ethnic intimidation, according to Worthy. About a dozen people attacked Steven Utash, a 54-year-old white man, after he accidentally struck a 10-year-old African-American boy who had stepped into a road, Detroit Police Sgt. Michael Woody said. Utash immediately stopped his vehicle to help the boy and was ""severely beaten"" with ""fists and feet,"" Worthy said in a news release at the time. He's been in a medically induced coma since. All of the alleged assailants are African-American, according to Jennifer Moreno, a police spokeswoman. She said none of the charged suspects is believed to be related to or otherwise linked the boy or his family. She said the beating was ""a spontaneous response."" The state of Michigan's penal code says a person is guilty of ethnic intimidation ""if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, causes physical contact with another person [or] damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person."" It can carry a prison sentence of up to two years. Detroit Police Chief James Craig wouldn't go so far as to call the attack a ""hate crime,"" but, he said, ""the issue of race is being looked at"" as a possible motive. He gave credit to a woman who stepped in as Utash was being attacked, CNN affiliate WDIV reported. ""Just her presence, offering aid to this gentleman, may have saved his life,"" Craig said. That woman, Deborah Hughes, met Utash's son to talk about what happened. ""I went to your dad, and he was unconscious. He wasn't doing anything,"" she said, WDIV reported. ""I go over there and I say, 'Don't nobody else hit him. Don't put your hands on him. Leave him alone!' And everybody backed up and let me go to work on your dad,"" said Hughes, a retired nurse. She told WDIV that Utash regained consciousness at one point and asked, ""Is the boy dead?"" His son, Joe Utash, thanked Hughes for everything she did. ""I know that you saved him and that means so much to us,"" he said, WDIV reported. The prosecutor's office said the boy who was struck by Utash's truck was taken to a local hospital and treated for a leg injury. Woody said that he was unsure of the extent of the boy's injuries but that he is at home recovering from the accident. Some are wondering whether the beating April 2 reflects a state of racial tension in the Motor City. Local defense attorney Cliff Woodards II says the lack of outrage in the African-American community exposes hypocrisy among its leaders. ""Imagine, though, if this happened to a black tree trimmer who was passing through Roseville?"" wrote Woodards, who is African-American, in a Facebook post he titled ""Shame On Us."" Roseville is the suburb Utash hails from. ""Al Sharpton would have been on a plane before the man got out of surgery. Local community leaders and pastors would have taken to the airwaves and the pulpits in search of justice for this fallen hero."" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and City Council President Brenda Jones issued a statement Friday in response to outrage over the incident, asking for calm and patience from all Detroiters but made no mention of race. ""This senseless vigilante-style attack is not the essence of who we are as Detroiters and will not be tolerated,"" the statement said. Utash's daughter, Felicia Utash, told CNN affiliate WXYZ that she doesn't want to believe the assault on her father was a hate crime, but she is pleased that suspects have been apprehended. She, along with her brother and sister, have set up a GoFundMe.com page for their father, who they say does not have health insurance. Donations have exceeded $150,000 in one week. Police are still searching for the remaining suspects. ""By no means are we through with this investigation,"" Woody said.","A fifth suspect is charged in the April 2 beating of Steven Utash, 54 .

"(CNN) -- A family in Saudi Arabia has taken a genie to court, alleging theft and harassment, according to local media. The lawsuit filed in Shariah court accuses the genie of leaving them threatening voicemails, stealing their cell phones and hurling rocks at them when they leave their house at night, said Al-Watan newspaper. An investigation was under way, local court officials said. ""We have to verify the truthfulness of this case despite the difficulty of doing so,"" Sheikh Amr Al Salmi, the head of the court, told Al-Watan. ""What makes this case and complaint more interesting is that it wasn't filed by just one person. Every member of the family is part of this case."" The family, which has lived in the same house near the holy city of Medina for 15 years, said it became aware of the spirit in the past two years. ""We began hearing strange noises,"" the head of the family, who requested anonymity, told Al-Watan. ""In the beginning, we didn't take it seriously, but after that, stranger things started happening and the children got really scared when the genie began throwing stones."" A local charity has moved the family to a temporary residence while a court investigates, the newspaper said. In Islamic cultures, a belief in genies, or jinns, is common. Genies not only appear in pre-Islamic fiction such as ""Arabian Nights,"" but are also mentioned in the Quran.

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- ""Mr. Ambassador, as time goes on we know that the odds of my son and the other relatives on the plane having survived becomes smaller and smaller,"" said a grey-haired man named Wen. As he addressed the Malaysian diplomat seated at a table just a few feet away in the packed Beijing hotel conference room, Wen began sobbing uncontrollably into a microphone. It had been more than 45 days since his son disappeared aboard missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370. ""To know that somebody is alive, you need to see them. To know that somebody is dead, you need to see the body. That's all I ask of you,"" Wen concluded, weeping. Members of the audience sobbed quietly in their seats. Visibly uncomfortable, the representative from Malaysia's embassy in Beijing, could do little more than repeat his government's talking points. ""There's a team coming to answer your questions. Let them come. Let them come,"" he pleaded. But the words from deputy chief of mission Bala Chandran Tharman only angered the relatives. They erupted into fist-waving chants: ""Live up to commitments! No more delays! No more lies!"" Each day seems to bring another disappointment to the hundreds of Chinese relatives waiting for news about missing loved ones. 153 Chinese nationals flew aboard the ill-fated flight. For more than a month, Malaysian Airlines has housed hundreds of their relatives in a number of Beijing hotels. From their improvised headquarters in Beijing's Lido Hotel, the families have set up committees, published press releases, printed T-shirts and hats with the slogan ""Pray for MH370,"" while also coordinating information with the next of kin of passengers from other countries. This agonizing limbo has been punctuated by highly emotional and contentious daily briefings held with Malaysian officials in a windowless conference room in the Lido Hotel. Last week, relatives stormed out of the hall en masse after technical glitches left a panel of Malaysian technical experts mute on a giant screen. The long-awaited video conference with Kuala Lumpur was a complete failure. ""You're all bloody liars, and you're lying to us again now!"" one representative yelled, as relatives marched out of the room. A committee representing passengers' families in Beijing has continued pressing its case, demanding answers to highly technical questions that were translated and submitted in writing to the Malaysian government. To better understand the final moments before Flight MH370 was believed to have crashed into the Indian Ocean, they wanted the audio recording of the crew's last radio communications with air traffic controllers, an explanation of how many emergency locator transmitters [ELT's] the plane was carrying and whether or not the ELT's activated as intended at the moment the aircraft hit the ocean. ""You need to do it yourself,"" explained a young Chinese physicist on the families' technical committee, who had helped draw up the questions. The man asked not to be identified, because he was keeping his father's disappearance a secret for fear of upsetting his elderly grandmother. For several days after the failed video conference, Malaysian diplomats did not appear at daily briefings. Instead a representative of Malaysian airlines addressed increasingly hostile family members. Last Friday, he pledged that a high-level team of technical experts would come to Beijing the following Monday to brief the family members. But that Monday, Malaysia informed family members there had been a last-minute change of plan. ""The authorities in Malaysia would like to move forward in the endeavor to address the missing flight MH370,"" said Tharman, the Malaysian deputy chief of mission. ""While keeping in mind that the family have many questions regarding technical issues, the authorities over the weekend put the view that these important questions should be taken up a little later at an appropriate time and place."" The message was not well received. For nearly three hours, Chinese relatives took turns yelling, begging and cursing at the Malaysian. ""Are you hiding things from us? Are there things you are not willing to tell us?"" said Jack Song, a spokesman for the families whose wife was a passenger. In these highly emotional confrontations, it is clear that many of the Chinese next of kin believe their missing loved ones are still alive. ""We have not given up hope. We dare to hope. We dare to believe,"" said Mr. Wen during his tearful speech on Monday. However, hope has become a dangerous emotion, according to a psychologist who has helped treat some of the next of kin. ""That's a dangerous thing when you artificially manifest hope which in the end cannot be sustained. You are setting them up for a fall,"" said Paul Yin, a counselling psychologist who also treated victims of Asiana Airlines flight 214, which crashed in California in 2013 killing at least three people. But Yin said Malaysian authorities bore some responsibility for the crisis. ""So many of the moves that they have taken are just so wrong,"" Yin said. Malaysian officials sent to brief Chinese families are armed with little to no information on the search for the plane. Meanwhile, in the eyes of many passengers' relatives, contradictory statements from Kuala Lumpur have shaken the credibility of Malaysian officials charged with leading the investigation. Lack of information has led many to suspect a cover-up, an accusation Malaysian authorities have repeatedly denied. While repeatedly challenging the Malaysian government, the passengers' families face clear limits that appear to have been set by the Chinese authorities. On Friday, the family committee announced plans to hold a prayer ceremony for missing spouses in a park near the Lido Hotel. Instead, the service was held in the same conference room. Dozens of men and women sat cross-legged on the floor, weeping in front of a banner that said: ""Honey, it's not home without you."" After the ceremony, the spouses -- many dressed in ""Pray for MH370"" T-shirts and baseball hats, marched out of the hotel to the park. They were closely followed by uniformed and plain-clothed Chinese police. After a short speech in front of the park gates, they drifted back to their hotel. ""It's just like big cage,"" said Steven Wang, when asked about the hotel. The 26 year old has become one of the main international spokespeople for the committee of family members. ""It is full of bad emotion ... we feel sad and angry and exhausted,"" Wang added.","CNN's Ivan Watson: Each day brings another disappointment to relatives waiting for news .

"(CNN) -- America's response to the most dangerous security crisis Europe has faced in decades has been all speeches and symbolism with no actions of substance. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama hosted Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the new interim Ukrainian Prime Minister, for lunch at the White House, supposedly a thumb in the eye of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a sign of America's commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty. On Thursday, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the U.S. will take ""very serious"" steps if Russia does not back down by Monday from its attempt to annex Crimea. But while the White House was serving lunch and the State Department was issuing stern warnings, the President was also refusing to lift a finger to actually deter Putin's aggression. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Obama administration, ""wary of inflaming tensions with Russia,"" has refused to act on Ukraine's emergency request for military aid, including arms and ammunition, except to send military rations. Officials in Kiev estimate that Putin has amassed 80,000 Russian troops on the Ukrainian border, and we are worried about ""inflaming tensions""? When will the administration put its might where its mouth is: When Kiev is in flames? Or never? As for Yatsenyuk, whose visit symbolized our solidarity, well Obama hopes you had a nice dessert, because we're not going to give your country the weapons it needs to defend itself. Theodore Roosevelt is famous for a foreign policy he summarized as ""speak softly and carry a big stick."" Obama's foreign policy is closer to ""scream loudly and carry no stick."" It's no wonder Putin has concluded that he's unlikely to face serious consequences for his imperial adventure. The U.S. did nothing when he invaded Georgia in 2008. More recently, we did nothing after the Syrian regime violated the ""red line"" Obama had established regarding the use of chemical weapons there. (Recall Kerry's offhand reference to inspections became the pretext a day later for backing off the pledge.) Putin doesn't take the words of Obama or Kerry seriously because their words aren't serious. The speeches are gestures -- much like the President's Wednesday luncheon -- and their relationship to action is nonexistent, as the administration's refusal of Ukraine's aid request makes quite clear. The fact is anything short of providing arms and intelligence to the sovereign Ukrainian government is unlikely to deter Putin. Clearly, we do not need American boots on the ground in Ukraine, a step we would both oppose. But if the U.S. wants to stop Russia's dangerous incursion into Eastern Europe, we have to raise the cost. Not just talk about potentially raising the cost at some point in the future once Russia has swallowed half of Ukraine and stationed tens of thousands of troops there. Unless the President is willing to back up his words with military aid, he's not serious about stopping Putin's armed aggression. In addition, the President should immediately issue an executive order approving the export of American natural gas to 20 countries that are awaiting bureaucratic approval. The highest priority should go to approving exports to Europe, where in many places, Russia has a near-monopoly on natural gas. Furthermore, the President should issue an executive order approving 24 pending liquefied natural gas facilities that have been delayed by bureaucratic red tape. This would be a serious blow to the Russian economy that would impose a real cost on Putin's foray into Ukraine. National emergencies justify actions that would not be taken in quiet times. A Russian invasion of Ukraine will create conditions that the President himself in his first executive order about sanctions called a national emergency. No one should doubt the seriousness of the events in Eastern Europe. Russia is threatening to forcibly take over the territory of a sovereign state. Taking over Crimea, which was historically Russian and has a substantial Russian majority, has already been described by Obama and Kerry as unacceptable and very dangerous. Russian occupation of the rest of Ukraine would be a vastly more threatening and more aggressive action. The situation calls for more than talk. If Putin discovers that once again the West will do nothing to stop his aggression, he might be reckless enough to test our resolve in Latvia, Lithuania or Estonia -- NATO members that we are bound to protect with military force. Trouble there could ""reset"" us right back to direct warfare with Russia. That would be a disaster and very, very dangerous. It's past time for the United States to help Ukraine. Indeed, passivity is the path most likely to lead to war. The Obama administration should grant the request for military aid immediately -- before it's too late for deterrence.

"(CNN) -- It's a familiar pose by now: Fresh-faced Olympian grins while pretending to take a bite from the hard-won gold medal hanging around his neck. But why do athletes feign chomping on their prized medallions, anyway? Most likely to satisfy the pose-hungry media, says David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. There are only so many things to do with a medal, and the excited champions are usually appeasing requests from the gallery of Olympic photographers when they bite down on their booty. ""It's become an obsession with the photographers,"" says Wallechinsky, co-author of ""The Complete Book of the Olympics."" ""I think they look at it as an iconic shot, as something that you can probably sell. I don't think it's something the athletes would probably do on their own."" He's seeing the practice more this year than ever before, especially among swimmers -- though he has no idea why.

The amount of gold used to make a medal shrunk after each of the two World Wars, according to Olympic medal collector and expert Jim Greensfelder. Gold medals were made of solid gold at three Olympics -- in 1904, 1908 and 1912 -- but the medals themselves were smaller. Complete coverage: Olympics 2012 .

"(CNN) -- Vanderbilt University on Tuesday dismissed wide receiver Chris Boyd from the football team and athletic program four days after he pleaded guilty to helping cover up an alleged on-campus gang rape. The star athlete accepted a yearlong probation sentence and agreed to testify against four men accused directly in the crime. Vanderbilt's athletic administration conducted a review of the case, including information disclosed at Friday's hearing. ""The review concluded that Mr. Boyd's admitted actions are clearly inconsistent with the high standards of behavior expected of our student-athletes,"" a vice chancellor said in a statement. After prosecutors laid out the case against him, Boyd pleaded guilty to one count of being an accessory after the fact. As part of his plea deal, Boyd said he will willingly pay court costs, face 11 months and 29 days of unsupervised probation and ""testify truthfully"" against the men he helped in June. Friday's court hearing revealed information about the prosecutors' case against the four former Commodores players charged with rape. Chris Boyd indicted in rape case . Davidson County Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman alleged in court that early on June 23, Brandon Vandenburg took an unconscious Vanderbilt student into a building on campus. Thurman said he was joined in his dorm room by three others also charged with rape -- Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie. ""Different individuals"" then sexually assaulted the young woman, the prosecutor said, as captured by CNN affiliate WSMV. Vandenburg texted the 21-year-old Boyd a picture of her, which Boyd promptly erased so his girlfriend wouldn't see it, Thurman said. Soon after that text, Vandenburg called Boyd, ""saying the victim had been messed with in the hall and sexually assaulted in the room, and he needed Mr. Boyd to come over,"" Thurman said. Boyd went over and, with two other people, moved the woman -- who was lying in the hall unconscious, partially clothed -- to a room, put her on a bed and then left, Thurman said. Subsequently, Boyd exchanged texts with Vandenburg and Batey, Thurman said. In one, Boyd said, ""Tell the boys to delete that sh**. I'm looking out for your a**."" Boyd also texted his girlfiend that he ""got everything cleared up"" and ""deleted everything,"" Thurman said. More texts followed the next day, including one in which Boyd detailed how he had helped move the young woman and said ""she doesn't know anything that happened."" Boyd also talked about it with Vandenburg, Batey, Banks and McKenzie at a Popeyes restaurant, Thurman said. ""The defendant was not completely truthful with the police or the district attorney's office in his initial interviews,"" the prosecutor said. ""... He later came forward and gave additional information."" Asked later by a judge whether Thurman's presentation was correct, Boyd replied, ""Yes, sir."" After the hearing, his lawyer, Roger May, described Boyd as ""a 21-year-old young man that was forced with making a decision in a situation that he did not fully understand."" ""He is paying for that decision,"" May added, ""and he will be paying for it the rest of his life."" Two ex-players on California high school football team accused of sex crimes .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it's investigating ""personnel issues"" at a California slaughterhouse after an exclusive CNN investigation detailed how officials believe Rancho Feeding Corporation triggered one of the biggest meat recalls in years. Federal investigators believe that Rancho processed cancerous cows when government inspectors weren't there, triggering a massive recall of nearly 9 million pounds of meat and a criminal investigation, according to sources familiar with the probe. And in the plant where it all went down, a government inspector and a Rancho foreman were involved in an inappropriate romance, according to documents obtained by CNN. How 9M pounds of bad meat got in food supply . A USDA spokesman told CNN the department ""is conducting a thorough investigation into personnel issues related to this case. We are not permitted to discuss the details of the case at this time as doing so could jeopardize the ongoing investigation."" Federal officials familiar with the investigation said that the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco, which is conducting the criminal investigation, is looking into the relationship between the inspector and foreman, but so far officials haven't connected it to the recall. The U.S. attorney's office did not respond to a request for comment. While brief, the USDA statement is somewhat substantive, a departure from the department's practice of referring questions to the U.S. attorney's office without comment. Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut also weighed in, calling CNN's report, ""deeply troubling."" ""Rancho and USDA are going to have to explain themselves to American consumers,"" DeLauro, a member of the House subcommittee on agriculture, said in a statement. ""I am deeply concerned that the Food Safety Inspection Service failed to prevent this deception from happening."" DeLauro's not alone. Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman, whose district included the now-defunct Rancho plant in California, wants answers. Instead, he's gotten only ""crickets"" from the U.S. attorney's office. ""This is radio silence from the federal agency that did something very significant in my district that is affecting lots and lots of people,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything quite like it."" Investigators believe that Rancho was buying diseased dairy cows and processing them when government inspectors weren't there. After the cows were killed, employees would hide the warning signs of cancer by trimming off diseased parts, using a fake stamp of approval or even replacing the heads of sick cows with ones from healthy animals. It's unclear which employees were involved, officials said. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that charges against Rancho's former owners -- the plant has since been sold -- have been decided. But that decision has yet to become public.","Nearly 9 million pounds of meat from one California slaughterhouse was recalled .

"(CNN) -- Justin Rose is looking to repeat the feat of golfing legend Ben Hogan as he defends his U.S. Open title at Pinehurst's No.2 course this week. Rose won his first major title at Merion and will be looking for a rare double success in North Carolina. Hogan won both the 1950 and 1951 U.S. Opens with his initial victory at Merion. Only Curtis Strange, 25 years ago, has completed two wins in two years in the tournament since Hogan's double triumph. Rose admits that the Merion precedent has been on his mind as he contemplates his title defense which begins Thursday. ""I've allowed myself that thought for sure,"" Rose told gathered reporters. ""I feel like the U.S. Open test suits me. ""For me being defending champion, I don't even like that word, defending, because it puts you already behind the eight ball. You don't want to be out there being defensive at all."" Rose heads a strong English contingent, which also includes Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Luke Donald and Paul Casey, all seeking an elusive first major. A keen football fan, he nonetheless rated their collective chances of success at Pinehurst above that of England at the World Cup in Brazil. ""I would say there's probably more chance of one of us winning the major than England winning the World Cup potentially,"" Rose said. ""So sad to say, but."" ""Blind faith that England will get far in the tournament prevails, so we'll see,"" Rose added. Phil Mickelson, runner-up to Rose last year, cruelly occupying that position for the sixth time at the U.S. Open believes he is capable of another strong challenge despite indifferent form this year. ""I feel as good about my game today as I have all year,"" Mickelson said. ""It's not saying a lot, because I haven't played well all year, but last week was a good week for me. I started to slowly put it together."" His 11th placed finish at the St.Jude Classic Sunday was his best of the season, but he went into last year's British Open at Muirfield on a similar run and triumphed in style. Masters winner Bubba Watson is also strongly tipped to challenge for his second major of the season, but believes Pinehurst's domed greens will test his patience. ""I wouldn't say unfair. I would just say they're very difficult,"" he said. ""When I say unfriendly it's because they're trying to beat you,"" he added. Former world number one Tiger Woods is sitting out his second straight major as he rehabilitates after back surgery, with Australian Adam Scott going into the week as the top-ranked player.","Justin Rose defends his U.S. Open title at Pinehurst .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Violence and heavy metal seem to have been inextricably entwined since the dawn of the metal genre. Accusations that the Columbine killers were influenced by Marilyn Manson's music were found to be false. Judas Priest, Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath are just some of the household metal names to have come under public fire for supposedly inciting teenagers to commit murder and suicide. It's a fire the international media has been happy to flame, quick to draw links between various acts of savagery and heavy metal even if, as in the case of the Columbine shootings and Marilyn Manson, evidence points to the contrary. For anthropologist, documentary filmmaker and self-confessed ""Metalhead"" Sam Dunn, heavy metal is often used as a scapegoat to distract from the thoroughly more complicated societal problems surrounding such incidents. ""I think people look at heavy metal and label it for all sorts of things because we need easy answers to complex questions,"" Dunn says. ""I think that it's easy to target a heavy metal band for inciting violence or making kids turn to a cult than it is to actually look at real problems in the real world."" It's easy to see where the journalists, parents and religious groups get their ideas from. A quick scan of the lyrics of any heavy metal band worth its salt will often reveal some gasp-inducing subject matter. For instance in his film ""A Headbanger's Journey,"" Dunn quotes some of his favourite lyrics by a metal band called Autopsy: ""Burning from the inside out, bloody foam spews from your mouth, smell the putrid stench of flesh, as it burns you to your death."" Not the sort of poetry to be quoting to grandmother over lunch, but can such ludicrous gore really incite people to violence, not to mention murder? As one young Norwegian metal fan told the UK's Guardian newspaper: ""It's all fantasy, none of this is real, you can't take this seriously, it's just like a movie."" But compared to some of the images filling our cinema screens -- The Devil's Rejects, Wolf Creek, The Passion of the Christ to name a few -- even Autopsy's lyrics seem a little tame. ""I have listened to enough metal for me to essentially be a serial killer,"" says James McMahon from UK music magazine NME. ""But there's something in me that says no, that's not what I believe life is about. Serial killers existed before Slayer, you know."" ""I'm a big fan of horror movies but Hostel, Saw, those torture porn films, I found myself repulsed -- metal is pantomime comparatively."" As Alice Cooper quips: ""There's more blood in 'Macbeth' than in my shows and that's required school reading."" For metal musicians, death, blood and mayhem, in its various guises, are all simply part of the act, part of ""the show."" ""I think it comes from being a child of the '70s,"" says Iron Maiden's lead singer Bruce Dickinson. ""I was brought up on Hammer horror movies and things like ""The Devil Rides Out,"" classics like that."" ""So while we do the devil type things, it's done... I wouldn't always say in a tongue-in-cheek way, but there is an element of it. It's done with a view to storytelling and drama, with a bit of dressing-up going on."" Iron Maiden has also endured its fair share of controversy. The title of its 1982 album, ""The Number of the Beast,"" and repeated use of ""666"" in the titular track's chorus had America's religious right up in arms. They accused the band of being devil worshippers, Satanists and of ""trying to pervert our kids."" ""When I play that song I think, well, ok, this isn't glorifying the devil, because that's certainly not what I would do,"" says Iron Maiden drummer Nicko McBrain, a born-again Christian. ""It's making an awareness that yes he's out there, and you've got to be aware. There is a man with 666 tattooed on his noggin somewhere."" Ironically, the fundamentalist reaction to ""The Number of the Beast"" packed out Iron Maiden tour gigs in every American town they visited. Kids squeezed into arenas desperate to see what was scaring their parents so badly. Despite this marketing draw, Dickinson is keen to distance Iron Maiden from the violence for violence's sake approach practiced by some of his contemporaries, such as musicians from the extreme Black Metal and Death Metal sub-genres. ""We're not interested in being extreme,"" he says. ""We're interested in being interesting and in animating people's imaginations with the stories that we tell and the songs."" It's an approach that chimes with what one female Iron Maiden fan, Ruth, tells us, ""I really don't see any violence in the fans and I have been to loads of their gigs,"" she says. ""I am in a tiny minority of women, in a room full of men wearing black -- which should seem scary, but it totally isn't. The men hold doors open for me and apologize if they bash into me. They are basically really meek and polite."" So while upside-down crucifixes, homicidal zombies and lashings of blood might continue to fuel our preconceptions about heavy metal music, it's worth remembering, appearances and reality can be very different beasts indeed.","Heavy metal used as a scapegoat according to anthropologist .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Conservative columnist and former CNN host Robert Novak said Monday that he will retire immediately to focus on treatment of a malignant brain tumor. Journalist Robert Novak said he will retire to focus on treatment for a brain tumor. The longtime Chicago Sun-Times commentator told the newspaper that his prognosis is ""dire."" ""The details are being worked out with the doctors this week, but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy,"" he said. Novak hit a pedestrian with his car in Washington on July 23 and was cited for failing to yield right of way. He said he did not see the man crossing the road and continued driving until he was stopped by a cyclist who saw the incident. The pedestrian was treated for shoulder injuries. Novak's tumor was diagnosed last week at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston after he became ill while on a family trip to Cape Cod, Massachusetts. After the initial diagnosis, but before a biopsy revealed the tumor was malignant, Novak said he was suspending his ""journalistic work for an indefinite but, God willing, not too lengthy period."" Novak's widely syndicated ""Inside Report"" began in 1963 at the New York Herald-Tribune. The column was co-written by Novak and longtime collaborator Rowland Evans until Evans' retirement in 1993. ""Inside Report"" appeared four times a week in the Herald-Tribune and other publications of the Publishers Newspaper Syndicate for three years until the paper folded and the Sun-Times became its home newspaper. The two also launched ""The Evans-Novak Political Report,"" a twice-monthly newsletter that Novak continued after Evans' death in 2001. Novak, 77, was also a regular commentator on CNN for 25 years, beginning when the station launched in 1980. He and Evans hosted ""Evans and Novak"" (later ""Evans, Novak, Hunt and Shields""), and Novak was a regular commentator on several other CNN political offerings, including ""The Capital Gang"" and ""Inside Politics."" He was host of CNN's ""Crossfire"" during much of its 25-year run. Novak was at the center of the scandal over the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame Wilson in 2003, ultimately leading to the resignation of Vice President Dick Cheney's chief of staff, I. Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby. Novak published a column revealing her CIA status days after her husband debunked a key Bush administration justification for the invasion of Iraq. Intentionally revealing the identity of an undercover CIA agent can be a crime. No one was prosecuted for the leak itself -- which turned out to have come from former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Libby was convicted of obstructing an investigation into the leak. Novak cooperated with special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and was not charged.","Robert Novak says he will undergo chemotherapy for malignant brain tumor .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man released on parole last month pleaded not guilty Wednesday in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn, one of whom died, authorities said. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was indicted on charges of second-degree murder, second-degree attempted murder, first-degree assault and criminal possession of a weapon. He faces 50 years to life in prison if convicted. Police believe Hubert was out on parole on June 1 when he allegedly stabbed the two children -- killing one of them -- inside an elevator. ""These two innocent children were subjected to unimaginable violence and terror in that elevator,"" Kings County District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said in a statement. Prince Joshua ""PJ"" Avitto, 6, died from his injuries, and his friend, Mikayla Capers, 7, was wounded. St. Hubert was arrested one week ago around the same time that New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified him by name publicly for the first time as the suspect in the attack. St. Hubert has at least nine prior arrests, though police did not specify all the outcomes. The most recent outcome was May 23, when, Boyce said, St. Hubert was released on parole in connection with a domestic assault case. Nine days later, police believe he encountered PJ and Mikayla inside an elevator at a public housing complex in Brooklyn. Mayor Bill de Blasio said last week that the two children were ""on their way to get ice cream"" at the time. For reasons authorities haven't yet explained, both children were stabbed in the torso. PJ was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. ""These parents are in such pain now,"" de Blasio said. Police initially said Mikayla was in critical condition. But the mayor last week said: ""She's doing much better. She's a strong young lady."" A spokesman for New York-Presbyterian Hospitals has refused to comment on her condition. Mikayla was treated for abdominal bleeding and a lacerated spleen, prosecutors said. A knife believed to have been used in the attacks was recovered at the scene. The bloody knife later tested positive for the defendant's DNA, authorities said. Avitto was related to Taj Gibson, a forward for the Chicago Bulls. Gibson tweeted last week: ""They killed my lil super man. #rippj only two more weeks until your 7 birthday. Tears forever."" Gibson also posted a picture of Avitto to his Instagram account. 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing friend .","Daniel St. Hubert pleaded not guilty Wednesday in stabbing case .

"(CNN) -- Mega Millions jackpot winners and Washington state residents Jim and Carolyn McCullar stepped forward on Thursday to claim their half of a $380 million prize during a Washington State Lottery news conference. ""I had faith one day that we were going to hit it,"" she said. ""You got to have faith."" Jim McCullar, 68, had previously worked as a real estate agent from Ephrata, with a population of just more than 6,000 in central Washington. He said that he was initially scared to come forward, saying he felt like ""a field mouse"" as hawks circled overhead. ""All we saw were predators and we were afraid to do anything until we got down here with police protection,"" McCullar said. He then opened his wallet and counted the money inside. ""I got eight dollars,"" he said, raising the oversized check for $190 million dollars over his head. ""I couldn't get this in my wallet."" The other winner, with whom the family will split the $380 million jackpot, has yet to come forward. That person is from Idaho. The McCullars' ticket was sold at a Safeway store in Ephrata, lottery officials said. Store manager Geoff Bell told CNN affiliate KREM that the phones began to ring off the hook when news surfaced that the store had sold one of the two winning tickets. ""It's great for the community. It's nice that Safeway can be a part of helping somebody make some dreams come true for them,"" Bell told the affiliate. The ticket in Idaho was sold in Post Falls, near the border with Washington state. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). As days went by without a winner, residents in the 42 states that take part in the Mega Millions drawing rushed to stores to buy more and more tickets, pushing the jackpot to $380 million, the second-highest in the drawing's history. The highest was $390 million in 2007.","Washington state couple Jim, Carolyn McCullar claim $190 million lottery jackpot .

"Rome (CNN) -- Angry protesters threw rocks and bottles and police lobbed tear gas canisters Tuesday in Rome's streets after Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi narrowly survived lawmakers' confidence votes. A crowd of several hundred protesters smashed motorcycles and police vehicles as they erupted in violence and clashed with authorities following the votes. Small fires were burning in various spots, and loud explosions could be heard from firecrackers or flash-bang devices. Police charging down the Via del Corso -- one of Rome's main shopping areas -- were pushing back protesters ""slowly but surely,"" said CNN's Dan Rivers, but he noted the protesters were ""clearly very angry."" Berlusconi retained his position Tuesday after the nation's upper and lower houses of parliament voted in his favor. The vote in the upper house, or Senate, was 162-135 with 11 abstentions. The lower house, or Chamber of Deputies, turned in a much narrower margin -- 314-311, with two abstentions. The vote was the latest in a series on the prime minister's leadership. The last confidence vote for the three-term prime minister was in September. With so many lawmakers aligned against Berlusconi, however, it may be difficult for him to carry on with his legislative program, said Rivers. ""There is going to have to be a bit of horse-trading,"" he noted. Police earlier had shut down the area of central Rome where the lawmakers met to vote. There was no immediate reaction to the votes or the violence from Berlusconi. In a speech Monday to lawmakers, he made a last-ditch bid to save his political life. ""He who votes against us is betraying the mandate received from the electorate,"" Berlusconi said in his half-hour discourse. ""In these particularly hard times for our country, we all have to find a way to be united and do what is best for the country,"" he said, adding that ""a crisis"" was the last thing Italy needed now. Berlusconi said he needed a mandate to complete judicial and institutional reforms and deal with the country's economic problems. And he called on supporters of his rival, Gianfranco Fini, not to support the left by voting against him, saying they must not ""subtract"" votes from the right ""in order to add them to the opposition."" Both Berlusconi's and Fini's parties are on the center-right. The prime minister threw Fini out of his party over the summer, and Fini took about 40 lawmakers with him to form the Future and Liberty Party. On Monday, Berlusconi accused Fini, a co-founder of Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, of betraying him. And he reached out to the Christian Democratic Union, which is allied with Fini, for support. Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, who has the authority to dissolve parliament, has said he opposes new elections because they would create instability at a time of economic crisis. Last month, Fini accused Berlusconi of a lack of attention to the economic crisis and structural reforms that Italy needs. Forbes magazine ranked Berlusconi last year as the world's 70th richest man, estimating his net worth at $6.5 billion. He amassed much of his wealth as a self-made media mogul, largely through the company Fininvest, and he also owns AC Milan, one of the world's most famous soccer teams. He's known political instability before, having served twice as prime minister (1994-95 and 2001-06) before his election in 2008. Yet, especially in recent years, the 74-year-old has been dogged by scandal and legal troubles, in addition to his political challenges. Those challenges include a bitter divorce from Veronica Lario, his wife of 19 years, after allegations that a businessman hired escorts for the prime minister and that Berlusconi attended a birthday party for an 18-year-old girl. Videos released this fall showed Berlusconi joking about the Holocaust and calling a female opposition politician ""Pig God."" The Vatican's official newspaper blasted the remarks, calling them ""deplorable"" and calling the jokes blasphemous, anti-Semitic and sexist. Shortly afterward, in October, Italian prosecutors expanded their tax fraud investigation into Berlusconi's Mediaset company, the nation's largest commercial broadcaster. The prime minister has dismissed the fraud charges as politically motivated. Beyond his personal travails, there are the stark political challenges. Foremost among them, Berlusconi faces a difficult economic picture as he looks ahead to the rest of his term, which expires in 2013. Italian unemployment is running at 8.5 percent, the highest level since 2003, according to the Italian statistical office, and public debt is 120 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the Bank of Italy says.

"(CNN)  -- Federal and state police raided an evangelist's compound in Arkansas late Saturday to investigate whether any children have been physically or sexually abused, officials said. The raid is part of a two-year investigation into a compound near Texarkana, Arkansas, owned by Tony Alamo Christian Ministries, said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police. About 100 agents were on the 10- to 15-acre site late Saturday and met with no resistance, he said. Alamo, reached by phone in Los Angeles, California, denied any wrongdoing. ""It's a hoax,"" Alamo said. ""They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will.""  Watch Alamo deny the allegations » . Asked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ. ""Why were they after Jesus?"" he asked. ""It's the same reason. Jesus is living within me."" It was not known how many children may live at the compound and whether Alamo would be arrested, Sadler said. Federal and state agents were executing two search warrants, Sadler said late Saturday, and no arrest warrants had been issued. ""Children were interviewed and continue to be interviewed at this hour and likely will continue to be interviewed tomorrow,"" Sadler told CNN. In addition to FBI agents and Arkansas state police, officials with the state Department of Human Services participated in the raid at the church property in the town of Fouke, about 12 miles from Texarkana. Alamo, who turned 74 Saturday, is an evangelist who also has dabbled as a singer and entrepreneur. Critics regard his ministry as a cult. The group has faced lawsuits and government actions, and Alamo has been arrested several times, publications have reported over the years. Alamo is well-known in Arkansas, said Lynn LaRowe, a reporter with the Texarkana Gazette. ""It's not very rare to come out of any baseball game to find Alamo literature on your car,"" LaRowe said. ""Around here, he is an extremely controversial character."" Alamo denied the existence of a compound, saying there are just houses ""for miles"" around his church.","FBI, state police raid headquarters in southwest Arkansas .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spanish police arrested eight suspected Islamic militants in Madrid in predawn raids Monday, for allegedly recruiting and sending radical fighters to aid the terrorist group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The arrests come just ahead of the proclamation of Spain's new King Felipe VI on Thursday in parliament, and the ministry last week raised the terror alert level from 2 to 3, to tighten security in the capital during the festivities. The suspected leader of the cell broken up Monday had been detained in Afghanistan in 2001 and later was a prisoner at the U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the ministry said. Just last month, police arrested six Spanish men in the Spanish enclave of Melilla, on Morocco's north coast, on suspicion of recruiting and sending 26 radical Islamic fighters for terrorist groups in Syria, Mali and Libya. Also in Melilla, last March, a Spaniard and two Frenchmen were arrested on similar charges. The movement of Islamic militants from Europe and North Africa to conflict zones such as Syria, Mali and Libya -- and their eventual return to Spain to potentially carry out terrorist attacks -- has been a prime concern for authorities battling terrorism. This week, thousands of police and security forces will be on alert throughout Madrid; King Juan Carlos, 76, Spain's head of state and commander in chief, formalizes his abdication Wednesday, leading to the proclamation of his son, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, as the new King, in a nation where the elected government runs the country. The new King and his wife, Princess Letizia, who will become queen of Spain, are due to ride through the streets, from Parliament to the royal palace, and city officials have urged Spaniards to turn out for the parade and to hang Spanish flags from their homes.","They're accused of recruiting, sending fighters to aid the ISIS terrorist group .

"(CNN) -- Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi may have won the small matter of 30 grand slam singles titles between them but for the most famous couple in tennis their Olympic gold medals are the most cherished moments of legendary playing careers. Graf won singles gold for Germany when tennis was an exhibition event in Los Angeles in 1984 then followed it up with ""official"" gold at Seoul four years years later. Agassi topped the podium for the United States at the Atlanta Games in 1996 and in an exclusive interview for CNN's Open Court leaves no doubt where it stands in his list of achievements. ""Being on that podium was a boyhood dream,"" he said. ""The medal around the neck, the national anthem, tears in my eyes. It's an out of body experience."" Graf's 1988 triumph was even more significant because it came in the same year she won all four grand slam tournaments. Sports Illustrated first coined the phrase ""Golden Slam"" and it stuck. Unique experience . Graf can also wax lyrical about the uniqueness of the Olympic experience. ""To me this was bigger than a grand slam, it was more special,"" the 43-year-old said. ""It's a different feeling, it's very unique and definitely more special."" Given she was only 19 at the time, Graf's achievements are all the more remarkable. When she arrived in South Korea she was feeling the effects of an arduous season, not to mention a grueling three-set victory over Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina in the U.S. Open final. Tsonga makes Olympic tennis history after marathon match . ""I was a bit tired emotionally, probably physically as well,"" Graf said. ""I just remember arriving at the airport and all the attention that I was getting, I just think I wasn't quite prepared for it at that point."" But Graf was able to concentrate on the task in hand and it was Sabatini who was again her victim in the singles final, this time in straight sets. The German also won a bronze in the women's doubles and completed a full set of Olympic medals after losing the gold medal match against Jennifer Capriati of the United States on the clay of Barcelona in the 1992 Olympics. Home soil . Agassi was only 18 at the time of the Seoul Games and he also missed Barcelona. But inspired by his father Mike, who had boxed for Iran at the 1948 and 1952 Olympics -- losing in the early rounds both times -- Agassi was determined to take his chance on home soil. ""For me to be playing for my country and on top of it to be playing to achieve what my father had hoped for but had not accomplished in his Olympic experience, I just felt like I was playing for something larger than just me,"" said the American, now 42. Agassi had endured a generally below-par year by his high standards and it was to prove a tough battle for gold, but as the memories flooded back he reeled off in quick succession how he did it. ""Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6 7-6. Karol Kucera, 6-3 6-4. Gaudenzi (Andrea), I was down a set and a break and beat him 6-3 in the third. Quarterfinals, Wayne Ferreira. He served for the match at 5-4 in the third and I ended up beating him 7-5 in the third. Leander Paes, who I beat in two rough sets, 7-6 6-4. And then Sergi Bruguera."" Playing in 102 degrees Fahrenheit with high humidity at Stone Mountain, Agassi made light of the conditions to dispatch the Spaniard -- a two-time French Open champion -- in straight sets. He openly shed tears of joy during the medal ceremony that followed. ""I remember being on that podium and I remember that feeling of seeing it so many times over the years, what someone might be feeling when that gold medal is put round their neck,"" Agassi said. ""Tears came to my eyes and my father was in the crowd so I was enjoying it on so many levels."" Olympic disappointment . While her future husband was winning gold, Graf had the disappointment of sitting out the 1996 Olympics with a knee injury she aggravated while winning her seventh Wimbledon title earlier in the summer. While other top players had often been lukewarm about having tennis in the Olympics, Graf was almost evangelical in her support, feeding off her incredible experiences in Los Angeles, where as a 15-year-old she first made her golden mark in that exhibition event. Four years later Graf enthusiastically embraced the true spirit of the Games. ""I stayed in the village for quite a few days until it got too loud and noisy and then I had to move back to the hotel,"" she said. Venus crashes out of Wimbledon . ""I was out at the boxing, I went to see some of the track and field, some of the swimming competitions, so I was really trying to take it all in, but also trying to play. ""To get through the first few rounds and then playing for the gold medal was extraordinary."" By the time the 2000 Olympics in Sydney came around, Graf had retired from tennis and a year later she married Agassi. They now have two children, Jaden Gil and Jaz Elle. Agassi continued playing until 2006, winning his final two grand slam titles at the Australian Open in 2001 and 2003. It was his French Open triumph in 1999 that enabled Agassi to complete his own ""Golden Grand Slam"" -- one of only two men, Rafael Nadal is the other -- to win all the four majors and Olympic gold. Proud parents . As proud parents -- on a nominated ""professions day"" once a year -- Agassi and Graf visit the Las Vegas school where they send their children to talk about their careers. ""We bring some trophies and all the children just want to take that gold medal, they want to hold it, they want to touch it. 'Is it real gold?' they ask,"" Agassi said. So who will win that ""real gold"" when Olympic tennis comes to Wimbledon, just 20 days after the finish of the All England Championships, won by Federer? ""I look at the favorites being Djokovic and Federer,"" Agassi predicted. As he speaks it is clear that he is envious of the current generation of greats getting the chance to have a double dose of glory at Wimbledon. ""It's our Masters, it's our Augusta, it's our pillar, the one if you could win one, most athletes, most tennis players would tell you, separate from the Olympics, that Wimbledon is the one they want to win,"" he said. ""So you combine that with the Olympics, that's got to be sensory overload. I don't know even how to put that into perspective of what that's going to feel like."" Federer, should he repeat his Wimbledon heroics, would also complete the ""Golden Grand Slam"" but Graf's record of winning them all in one year may never be equaled. Big highlight . With three different winners of women's grand slams this season it will certainly stand for another four years. ""I think this is a big highlight of anybody's career and I'm pretty sure for anybody that you ask it's a main goal,"" Graf said. Serena Williams has already spoken of her desire to win a third Olympic gold medal in the women's doubles with her elder sister Venus. After her fifth Wimbledon victory last month, the American is a hot favorite to double up -- as Venus did in 2000. Meanwhile tennis' golden couple will surely be keeping a keen eye on the action, finding time in between their busy schedule -- with their respective foundations and charities -- not to mention a busy family life with two very active children. ""A lot of different interests, very active. They keep us on our toes,"" said Graf. ""We're professional babysitters,"" joked Agassi. ""The best job in the world,"" his wife chimed in.","Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi both won Olympic gold medals in singles .

"(CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is not just angering travelers at airports. The TSA also does buses, trucks, subways and trains. Guess what? The none-too-popular agency appears to have had the same kind of unimpressive performance issues on the rails as it has in the aviation industry. Since 2005, the TSA's Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams have been spot-checking for terrorism threats in the nation's massive network of highways and rail systems -- a seemingly overwhelming task. By many reliable accounts, VIPR began life as a modern version of the Keystone Kops. Now, more than six years later, there's still a lot of room for improvement. Considering the blunders at the beginning, VIPR teams are greatly improved today, and probably already are better than their airport counterparts. But considering the TSA's record of passenger treatment -- and its level of popularity -- among air travelers, of course, that is not high praise. The possibility that the TSA would disband VIPR is remote. Perhaps the best solution is to have Amtrak and the railroads continue what they've been doing: training VIPR teams, keeping them under control and letting them know there will be trouble if they do anything dumb. A great deal of credit for VIPR improvement should go to Amtrak's police chief, John O'Connor, who was so outraged about an incident in Savannah, Georgia, in February 2011 that he angrily threw VIPR teams off Amtrak property until they learned how not to make fools of themselves. ""When I saw it, I didn't believe it was real,"" O'Connor said of a posting on an anti-TSA blog site. When he learned it was not a joke, ""I hit the ceiling,"" he said. TSA rail, subway spot-checks raise privacy issues . What happened in Savannah? A Visible Intermodal Protection and Response team became far too visible. For reasons that have never been publicly explained, a squad of VIPR agents showed up at a Savannah Amtrak station one day and literally took over without the knowledge or approval of the Amtrak Police Department. Everyone who entered the station was thoroughly searched. It didn't seem to matter whether people were getting on trains or getting off trains, or just looking for a place to go to the bathroom. The ""rules,"" if there were any, seemed to be that if you entered the station, you went through a full search. If you walked around the station to get to a train or to get off a train -- quite an easy thing to do at the Savannah station -- no one bothered you. Clearly, no security issue was involved. The TSA apologized repeatedly to the chief and promised never to do it again, but the version of the incident on its website was more arrogant than apologetic. O'Connor said apologies were irrelevant and the TSA website version was filled with inaccuracies. The TSA must promise to never go beyond the policies of the Amtrak Police Department, he said, and to be certain that Amtrak police are present whenever VIPR teams take any action on Amtrak property or trains. The embarrassed TSA readily agreed to every requirement. Amtrak's policies are quite specific: Amtrak police (and therefore VIPR) do most of their security behind the scenes. They do a lot, which I have agreed to keep off the record. That's too bad, because some of their methods are fascinating. Occasionally, however, Amtrak will go public and set up a table at a boarding gate for one train. Perhaps one in nine passengers will be quickly pulled aside. Their luggage will be swabbed for explosives. They are never personally searched or put through any other kind of screening. And O'Connor's rules say passengers are always to be treated with courtesy. If passengers refuse the search, an Amtrak police officer is to courteously take them to the ticket counter and be certain they get a full refund. Meanwhile, over at the yards, freight railroads were having their own problems with the VIPR teams. The TSA demanded that VIPR agents be allowed to enter yards at any hour of the day or night without notice and to watch employees from hidden positions. The railroads told the TSA to go to hell. Yards are dangerous places for amateurs, they said. It is easy to lose a leg or be crushed between couplers, not to mention that many yard employees unofficially carry guns to kill rats, and they could kill a rat in the weeds that turned out to be a human being. Again, the TSA had no choice. It is not well known, but the TSA must have permission to go onto private property. That makes no difference at airports because the TSA must approve any new airport security arrangements if the agency is ordered to leave. The TSA has made it known that it will immediately move its equipment out of any airport that tells it to leave, and it will take weeks or months to approve any new security arrangements and equipment. At railroads, however, all the security equipment is owned by the railroads. Why did the railroads even put up with the TSA? As one top railroad official put it, ""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer."" As for the TSA's side of the story, it usually doesn't comment publicly on general criticism of VIPR. But TSA officials often do react to with specific incidents. For instance, when there were widespread reports that VIPR agents were pulling over trucks and searching trucks in Tennessee, a TSA spokesman said VIPR was only passing out informational brochures at truck stops for one day. Reporters confirmed that was correct. But the funniest thing happened to VIPR teams, according to railroad officials. They became fascinated with railroads even though most of them had come out of aviation security, and they follow the rules. O'Connor says he is pleased with their progress. Freight railroad officials also were surprised and pleased. One top freight rail security official, who did not want to be named, said many of the VIPR members have become rail fans and show a growing fascination with railroads. A major question remains: Are such searches constitutional under the Fourth Amendment? The courts have allowed the TSA to operate in airports because the threat has been judged to be sufficiently serious. But is the threat sufficient on railroads to allow warrantless searches of people who have stirred no obvious suspicions? That case has yet to be heard. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter.

"(CNN) -- Cesc Fabregas is returning to London and the English Premier League after the Spain international signed for Chelsea from Barcelona Thursday. The midfielder, who started his career with Barcelona, spent eight years with Chelsea's London rivals Arsenal between 2003 and 2011, before rejoining the Catalan club. ""Firstly I'd like to thank everyone at Barcelona where I enjoyed three wonderful years,"" said Fabregas, who has joined Chelsea on a five-year contract, in a statement on the club's website. ""It was my childhood club and I'll always be proud and honored that I had a chance to play for such a great team,"" added the 27-year-old, who is on World Cup duty with Spain in Brazil. Chelsea finished third last season, securing the EPL's third European Champions League automatic qualifying spot. In manager Jose Mourinho's first season back in charge at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea also reached the Champions League semifinals before being knocked out by Atletico Madrid. Fabregas' arrival gives Mourinho a wealth of midfield talent, given Chelsea's Portuguese manager already has Eden Hazard, Oscar, Ramires, Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel at his disposal. ""I do feel that I have unfinished business in the Premier League and now is the right time to return,"" said Fabregas, who played over 300 games for Arsenal during his first spell in England but won just one trophy -- the FA Cup in 2005. ""I considered all the other offers very carefully and I firmly believe that Chelsea is the best choice. They match my footballing ambitions with their hunger and desire to win trophies. ""They have an amazing squad of players and an incredible manager. I'm fully committed to this team and I can't wait to start playing."" Barcelona, which failed to retain the Spanish title last season, issued a statement thanking Fabregas for his ""professionalism and dedication"" during his time at the Nou Camp. The Spanish club will reportedly receive an upfront payment of $45.4 million for Fabregas, though the transfer fee could rise with contractual add-ons. Chelsea are also reportedly keen to sign another La Liga player -- Atletico Madrid's Spain international striker Diego Costa.","Cesc Fabregas signs five-year contract with Chelsea .

"(CNN) -- The president of one of the world's most famous football clubs has decided not to appeal a jail sentence for tax evasion as he stepped down from key roles at the reigning German and European champions Bayern Munich. Germany and Bayern legend, Uli Hoeness, who resigned from his post as president and board chairman, was found guilty by a German court Thursday and sentenced to three years and six months. ""After discussing the matter with my family I have decided to accept the judgment passed by Munich District Court (Landgericht) II regarding my tax affairs,"" he said in a statement released on the Bayern Munich website. ""Evading tax was the biggest mistake of my life. I accept the consequences of this mistake,"" he continued. ""Furthermore I hereby resign the offices of president of FC Bayern München e.V. and chairman of the FC Bayern München AG supervisory board with immediate effect."" Hoeness' lawyer had initially intimated that the 62-year-old would appeal the sentence. During the trial, Hoeness admitted to evading €28.4 million ($39.6 million) in taxes on income earned in secret Swiss bank accounts. He was originally charged with evading €3.5 million ($4.87 million) but that amount increased to $39.6 million during the court process. State prosecutor Achim von Engel had called for a prison sentence of five-and-a-half years for Hoeness on seven counts of tax evasion. Hoeness thanked friends and colleagues for their backing, before pledging his continued support for Bayern. ""FC Bayern München is my life's work and will always remain so. I will continue to be associated with this magnificent club and its people in other ways for as long as I live."" ""I wish to thank from the heart my personal friends and all followers of FC Bayern München for your support."" Hoeness played for Bayern from 1970-1979 before retiring through injury aged 27. Despite that truncated playing career, he won the 1972 European Championship and the 1974 World Cup with West Germany and three successive European Cups with Bayern. Subsequently he was appointed general manager of Bayern, who won last year's Champions League final at Wembley after beating German rivals Borussia Dortmund.","Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness has said he won't appeal tax evasion sentence .

"(CNN) -- A refugee and mother of three young boys who is being held in indefinite detention in Australia has two days to convince the country's highest court why she should be freed. It's her last shot at overturning a government policy which was recently condemned by a United Nations Human Right Committee report as ""cruel, inhuman and degrading."" Failure will mean that Ranjini, a 34-year-old Sri Lankan refugee, will continue to be held without trial for the foreseeable future, for reasons that remain a national secret. And she's not the only one. ""The core issues in Ranjini's case are common to more than 50 other refugees deemed a security risk and has serious implications for their liberty too,"" said her lawyer David Manne, who as the executive director of Australia's Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, is representing most of the refugees involved. Ranjini is seeking to be released into the community to live with her family, the two young boys she fled with who are now aged seven and nine, her new husband and their eight-month-old child. ""It has caused Ranjini, her boys and her husband profound distress and harm,"" Manne said. ""Every day of detention is another day of damage."" CNN is unable to verify details of Ranjini's story with the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC) because it will not comment on individual cases. Ranjini's supporters say they suspect her detention has something to do with her former husband, a Tamil who was killed during fighting in Sri Lanka, though that is unable to be confirmed. Fleeing Sri Lanka . Ranjini fled Sri Lanka in 2008 with her two sons Pirai and Kathir -- then aged four and two -- two years after her husband and their father was killed in the civil war. They're from the Vanni region, where the United Nations has alleged both the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) targeted civilians, according to a report released in March 2011. They first went to India, but Ranjini struggled to care for her family so paid a people smuggler to board a boat to Australia. During what she has described as a ""painful"" journey, the boat ran out of fuel and was eventually intercepted by the Australian Navy who took the bedraggled and by now desperate asylum seekers to Christmas Island for processing. Ranjini and her sons were moved to the Australian cities of Perth, then Adelaide before being released to community detention in Brisbane in 2011. In September of the same year, Ranjini and the boys were granted refugee status. Their three-year quest for safety and freedom was over. Or so she thought. OPINION: Australian parties in race to bottom on asylum issue . Back in detention . In December 2011, Ranjini met a man, Ganesh, who is also from Sri Lanka but was living in Australia as a permanent resident, working as an I.T. consultant in Melbourne. The Immigration Department gave them permission to marry, and in April 2012 they exchanged vows in a traditional Tamil ceremony witnessed by 200 guests. However, within one month, Ranjini was back in custody. Immigration officials summoned the family to a meeting to inform them that she had failed a security test and would be detained indefinitely. She and the boys were flown to the Villawood Detention Center in Sydney. The next day she found out she was pregnant with Ganesh's child. Born into custody . Baby Paari was born in January, 2013, and lives with his mother in detention. ""I can't take the baby out, because if I take him out he'll cry,"" Ganesh told CNN. ""Once I tried but I couldn't keep him calm. After 10 minutes he started crying so I took him back."" He has taken Paari into the car park for photos; cameras aren't allowed within the detention center. And last month, Ranjini was allowed to visit Ganesh's home for four hours for a Hindu ceremony called Kolukaddai Kodduthal, which marks the arrival of their baby's first teeth. As an Australian citizen, Baby Paari is not being detained. Nor are his brothers who were granted permanent residency in June. The elder boys choose to live with their mother during the week, but leave the secure facility every Friday to spend weekends with Ganesh. Ganesh says over the past 16 months the boys have come to realize that other detainees only stay for a month or two while their claims are processed. ""They see people come and go but only their mother can't get out. It makes them very sad. They're starting to realize that their mother is in a difficult situation -- it's very hard for them,"" he said. Detained as national security risk . The security test that Ranjini failed was conducted by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO). According to its website, ASIO says part of its protective security work is ""to assess whether people applying for entry or permanent residence visas have the potential for espionage, have links with a terrorist organization, or may in other ways be a threat to national security."" Refugees who fail the assessment are not told why and they have no right to legal appeal. Because they're refugees, the country is obliged to offer them protection under international law. But under Australian law, they can't be freed. On Wednesday, the High Court of Australia will be asked to assess whether it's legal under Australian law and the constitution to detain refugees indefinitely and ""whether Australian law puts a different value on liberty for non-citizens, one where liberty is more easily put in jeopardy,"" Manne said. It's not known when the court will release its findings, nor the extent of the potential implications for more than 50 other refugees in the same situation. 'Serious psychological harm' Australia's policy of indefinite detention has been harshly criticized in the past, most recently by a special committee of 18 human rights experts assembled by the United Nations. In a report released on August 22, the committee said the policy was inflicting ""serious psychological harm"" on the 46 detainees who brought their complaints, the largest ever against Australia, to the U.N. Human Rights Committee. ""The combination of the arbitrary character of (their) detention, its protracted and/or indefinite duration, the refusal to provide information and procedural rights to (them) and the difficult conditions of detention are cumulatively inflicting serious psychological harm upon them,"" the Committee said. The report claimed the policy represented 143 violations of international law and urged Australia to free, compensate and rehabilitate the refugees involved. Ranjini was not one of the detainees who took their complaints to the United Nations, though she is among those being held. The independent reviews . Almost one year ago, the Australian government, then led by Julia Gillard, appointed an independent reviewer to examine evidence used by ASIO to determine whether a refugee was a national security risk. It followed an Australian Senate Committee report into the country's Immigration Detention Network which found that cases of indefinite detention should be subject to review. Of the 10 reviews completed so far by retired Federal Court Judge Margaret Stone, eight of the negative assessments were found to be ""appropriate."" Ranjini's was one of them. She still doesn't know exactly why. ""We didn't expect that outcome,"" Ganesh said. ""We were expecting that (the judge) would give a positive indication to release Ranjini. That was very sad for myself and my family."" Political parties vie for asylum votes . Australia's asylum policy has been one of the key issues of the upcoming Australian election to be held on September 7. Both leading political parties have announced plans that include sending asylum seekers offshore for processing. Under a Labor government, led by Kevin Rudd, asylum seekers found to be refugees would be settled in Papua New Guinea or the island of Nauru. None would be allowed to remain in Australia. The opposition's policy, led by Tony Abbott, goes a step further and proposes refusing permanent visas to some 32,000 people already in Australia who are waiting for their claims to be processed. Both parties have defended their policies as necessary to discourage the thousands of people who are paying people smugglers to board often unseaworthy boats for the dangerous trip to Australia. ""What we're seeking to do through these arrangements at the moment is to send a message to people smugglers around the world that the business model is basically undermined,'' Rudd said during the policy launch. ""It says if you jump on a boat you're going to end up in Australia. That doesn't apply any more.'' Abbott -- who is currently leading pre-election opinion polls -- went one step further over the weekend in announcing that, if he came to power, asylum seekers would be denied government-funded legal assistance, a move the Refugee Council of Australia has slammed as ""disastrous"" for people seeking refuge. Abbott would also scrap independent reviews for people like Ranjini, denying them the one opportunity they have for their cases to be re-examined. Ranjini's court hearing -- hope . Neither Ranjini nor her husband will be in court for the hearing in Canberra on Wednesday and Thursday, but they're both eager for her ordeal to be over. ""We are looking forward to the outcome because she's been in detention since 2010 -- one way or another she's been in detention,"" he said. Despite the setbacks -- including the independent reviewer's confirmation of the negative ASIO security assessment -- Ganesh is daring to hope that the High Court will rule in Ranjini's favor. ""There were two boys, now there are three boys... I trust the system so at least they will think that because of her family -- myself and the boys are here -- I'm expecting a positive outcome,"" he said.","Refugee held in indefinite detention taking case to the High Court of Australia .

"(CNN) -- Police officers in the Mexican resort town of Playa del Carmen are suspects in the alleged rape of an Italian citizen earlier this month, according to the local state's attorney's office. The alleged rape occurred on February 12, when the victim and a male companion were leaving a night club in Playa del Carmen between 3 and 4 a.m., said Maria Antonia Salmeron, a spokeswoman with the state's attorney's office of Quintana Roo, the state where Playa del Carmen and Cancun are located. The man, also an Italian citizen, decided to stop at a nearby alley to urinate. That's when the couple was intercepted by the police. Subsequently, the woman was attacked by the officers of the Playa del Carmen Police Department, Salmeron said. Mexican attorney general: Six suspects confess to raping Spanish tourists . ""(The suspects) detained her, and these young men caught (her) when she was in an 'inconvenient' state and took (advantage of the situation), or rather, took advantage of her,"" said Carlos Bibiano Villa Castillo, Quinata Roo security secretary, according to Mexico's Foro TV. The victim, who is a resident of Playa del Carmen, reported the incident to police, Salmeron said. Salmeron identified the suspects as Mardonio Guzman Gomez and Jose Manuel Enriquez Hernandez, who have been charged with rape and abuse of authority. Playa del Carmen Police Commander Ramon Bolainas Xicotencatl is at-large, Salmeron said . According to the government news agency Notimex, the police officers also demanded a bribe of 3,000 Mexican pesos (about $235) from their victims. When the police officers realized the Italians had no money, the woman was attacked, Notimex said. Gaspar Armando Garcia Torres, Quintana Roo's state's attorney, confirmed the bribe attempt. ""We were obviously very concerned after we learned about the alleged rape. That's why we immediately launched an investigation,"" Salmeron said. The alleged rape happened only eight days after six Spanish tourists were allegedly raped in the Mexican beach resort of Acapulco. Officials in the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located, announced the arrests of five suspects a week after the attack. Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back in the spotlight . The six victims were among 14 people victimized by hooded gunmen who burst into a beach bungalow in the resort town before dawn on February 4. An investigator in the Acapulco incident said the suspects, all between the ages of 20 and 30, also stole cell phones, iPads and tennis shoes from the victims, who allegedly had bought drugs from their attackers the day before the rape. According to a recent U.S. State Department travel warning ""resort areas and tourist destinations in Mexico generally do not see the levels of drug-related violence and crime reported in the border region and in areas along major trafficking routes."" The warning published last November says ""no advisory is in effect"" for tourist areas in Quintana Roo, including Cancun, Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, Riviera Maya and Tulum.

"(CNN) -- The South China Sea has returned to the geopolitical spotlight, eclipsing the Taiwan Straits as the region's most volatile flashpoint. But quite unlike the Taiwan or the associated Quemoy/Matsu dispute, the South China Sea's claimant nations are at least as interested in developing the region's economic potential as they are in asserting sovereignty and building military bases. This opens a window to resolving the dispute in a way that looks beyond the traditional frame of sovereignty and towards a win-win economic benefit. In the mid-to-late 1990s, Asia looked far from stable: naval vessels conducted provocative operations around the appropriately named Mischief Reef, the U.S.-Taiwan military relationship was causing headaches with China, the Asian financial crisis destabilized the region's ""Tiger"" economies, and a violent struggle for independence was waged to liberate East Timor, now known as Timor-Leste, from Indonesia. But the decade since has been marked by almost universal growth across the region. Growth surged from China to India, Indonesia became a $1 trillion economy, Myanmar rapidly normalized its relations with its neighbors and the world, and the South China Sea became the passageway for large volumes of energy and commodities. The main difference between today's South China Sea dispute and that of two decades ago is that China is immensely more powerful. Reflecting its growing clout, China is asserting its claims far more aggressively, claims which extend right up to the shores of the littoral nations of the South China Sea. China claims the entirety of the Spratly Island chain, as well as the Paracel island group which it occupies, and the submerged Macclesfield Bank, in a region defined by the so-called ""nine-dashed line"". China insists on negotiating bilaterally with other claimant states, dismissing the claims of other nations made in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), insisting that China exercises ""indisputable sovereignty"" in the area without fully defining the status of the nine-dashed line. China has built administrative and naval facilities on several islands, bullied vessels from other nations in dangerous and provocative manners not consistent with principles of good seamanship, and marginalized regional body ASEAN's role in attempting to address the dispute. Most fundamentally, China's behavior has created a window for the U.S. to return prominently to the region and shore up fraying alliances, giving the Philippines and other nations more leverage to stand up to China, as China inadvertently pushes the nations of the region toward the United States. But at best this scenario will lead to stalemate; militarization restores temporary balance but does not provide long-term solutions. Most of the islands in the South China Sea are too small to be permanently inhabited without substantial outside assistance, and although the oil, natural gas, and mineral deposits lying beneath have not yet been fully assessed, no nation wants to give up its potentially lucrative claims. A similar situation existed a century ago in Arctic Europe -- and could serve as a role model for Asia. The 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty (signed during the Versailles negotiations after World War One) granted Norway sovereignty over the Spitsbergen archipelago, which Norway subsequently renamed Svalbard, in the Arctic Sea. However, the treaty restricted Norwegian control to some extent, with limited taxation (at a lower rate than mainland Norway) and provisions to preserve the environment. Naval bases and other military fortifications were prohibited from the island, and Norway was obligated to be legally non-discriminatory against any nation or company from the signatory states seeking to undertake maritime or mining activity on the island. Norway, then, is effectively the steward of Svalbard, but not necessarily its master. The Arctic Ocean, of course, remains disputed in various sectors, and Russia even went so far as to famously plant a titanium flagpole under what it thought was the North Pole in 2007. But at the same time, Norway and Russia also built up sufficient confidence to legally resolve an outstanding maritime boundary dispute in the Barents Sea in 2010, providing the impetus for potential oil and gas exploration. As the Arctic ice cap recedes, more countries are peacefully using the Northwest Passage to cut shipping time between Europe and Asia. Most importantly, Norway and Russia both are massive oil explorers and exporters, not letting territorial disputes interfere with the need to provide for global commodities demand. There is much China and the Southeast Asian maritime nations can learn from how Norway and Russia have handled Svalbard and the Arctic. Parties must agree that the aim is peaceful exploration and exploitation of resources and mutually beneficial sales in international markets. Since the parties clearly don't trust each other to politically manage the islands, a joint-stock company should be created and listed on a major neutral regional stock exchange such as Singapore. The claimant nations -- through their national energy companies -- would collectively serve as the company's board. This ""South China Sea Exploration Company"" would effectively be a multi-national joint venture with both legal and commercial authorities. In order to circumvent the massive overlapping and mutually exclusive claims to full sovereignty over the islands, all national-corporate members would be recognized as equally entitled to the development of the islands, but only through mutually agreed arrangements. In appreciation of China's cooperation in developing such a multi-national venture, no new claimants should be recognized as parties to the sovereignty dispute, and Taiwan's claim would have to be made in the context of an entity not acting in the capacity of a nation-state -- hence the need for energy companies, not governments, to serve on any board. This special purpose vehicle would adjudicate the exploration rights of ships registered and recognized by it in order to continue to guarantee freedom of navigation and passage for shipping, while also respecting environmental concerns with respect to economic development. Existing occupations of territories would not be forcibly overturned, but the sovereignty question would be shelved for the time being without recognizing or dismissing the claims of the current parties to the dispute. Much as uncertified conflict diamonds from Africa are banned from sale by major private dealers, the same could be true of minerals and energy resources from unregistered deposits and unapproved operations in the South China Sea. Asian nations have been pragmatic about their disputes for over a decade; all have benefited enormously from regional peace and the associated resultant economic growth. Today, the claimants in the South China Sea face a choice between resolving the dispute in a creative, regional, and profitable manner versus escalating the conflict and potentially sparking a regional war involving major military powers. If Asia wants to demonstrate its capacity for independent leadership, it must start by calming its own waters. The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Parag Khanna and John Gilman.","Khanna: Territorial disputes in South China Sea can be resolved to everyone's benefit .
Nations should put aside territorial claims and start joint venture to exploit the sea's resources .
Nations can either resolve dispute profitably, or risk regional war involving major military powers ."
"(CNN) -- In the wake of massive anti-government protests, Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff proposed a referendum as a way to place political reform in the public's hands. The past weeks have seen the biggest demonstrations in decades, with tens of thousands taking to the streets in cities across the country. The protests started with outrage over a public transportation fare hike, but quickly ballooned to encompass a number of grievances against the government. Rousseff on Monday responded directly to some of the protesters' demands, outlining five ""pacts"" on social issues. Among those was a proposal for a referendum ""to make the political reforms that the country needs,"" she said. A fair World Cup deal for Brazil? The message the government is hearing from protesters is that they want more change faster, Rousseff said. ""The streets are telling us that the country wants quality public services; that they want more efficient mechanisms to fight corruption that ensure the proper use of public money; that they want political representation that permeates a society where, as I said before, citizenship -- and not economic power -- is put first and foremost,"" she said. She spoke at a meeting with governors and mayors. Her other recommendations: . -- Fiscal responsibility with an emphasis on inflation control and economic stability. -- Acceleration of investment in health care, including money for hospitals and health clinics, incentives for doctors to practice in needy areas, and the hiring of foreign doctors where shortages exist. -- Public transportation improvements to the tune of 50 billion reals (U.S. $22 billion), new infrastructure, and a national council on transportation. -- Boost public education by asking Congress to set aside 100% of oil revenues for schools. These proposals align with the most common refrains heard during the protests -- that money is squandered instead of being used to improve the situation of Brazilians. ""Together with the people we can solve large problems,"" Rousseff said. ""There is no reason to be inert, complacent or divided."" Opinion: Broken promises and corruption fuel protests . Many state governments had already reversed the fare hikes that had spurred the protests, but doing so did not slow the protests. The president has supported the protests as an expression of free speech, but has warned against the sporadic acts of looting and violence that have been recorded. On Monday, Rousseff met with representatives of the Free Fare Movement from Sao Paulo. It was her first meeting with protest leaders.","Brazil's president proposes a referendum on political reforms .

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Enrique Peña Nieto is the projected winner of Mexico's presidential election, according to a quick count by election officials. Representative samples from polling stations throughout the country gave Peña Nieto the lead, with between 37.93% and 38.55% of votes, the Federal Election Institute said. The projected victory for Peña Nieto marks a triumphant return to power for the PRI, which controlled Mexico's presidency for more than 70 years, until the election of the National Action Party's Vicente Fox in 2000. Criticisms of Peña Nieto and concerns about the PRI's possible return to power have fueled a student movement that has staged protests throughout the country in recent weeks. But the charismatic 45-year-old former governor has also galvanized fervent support among residents of his home state and party loyalists nationwide. The frontrunner's campaign platform includes plans to stop the rise in food prices, promote energy reform, give social security to all Mexicans and reduce violence nationwide. The Consulta Mitofsky, GEA/ISA and Parametria firms also said their exit poll results projected a win for Peña Nieto, with more than 40% of voters saying they cast ballots for the PRI candidate. In addition to Peña Nieto, three other candidates were vying for the presidency in what officials called ""the largest and most complex election day"" in the country's history. Ruling party candidate Josefina Vazquez Mota was trailing in exit polls. Throughout the three-month campaign, she appeared to be distancing herself from President Felipe Calderon. Her campaign slogan was ""Josefina Diferente."" But at a campaign rally Wednesday night, the National Action Party (PAN) candidate praised the ""valor"" of Calderon's fight against organized crime and made a surprise announcement that she would invite him to be Mexico's attorney general if she wins the presidency. As preliminary results trickled in Sunday night, Vazquez Mota acknowledged that the trend did not appear to be in her favor. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD) ranked in second place in numerous polls leading up to the election. Sunday night's quick count indicated that he had received between 30.9% and 31.86% of votes. In the 2006 presidential vote, election authorities said the former Mexico City mayor narrowly lost to Calderon. Lopez Obrador claimed election fraud and never conceded, referring to himself as ""the legitimate president of Mexico."" His supporters protested nationwide. In Mexico City, they staged sit-ins and blockades. On Wednesday, Lopez Obrador told throngs of supporters in Mexico's capital that he was confident that he would ""win the presidency again."" Gabriel Quadri of the New Alliance, who lagged far behind in polls before and after the election, praised Mexico's election authorities Sunday night. ""We have very solid, democratic institutions,"" he said. In polling centers throughout the country, workers began the day Sunday assembling cardboard voting booths marked with bold black letters saying, ""The vote is free and secret."" But some voters said they were afraid of fraud. From a command center in Mexico's capital, student activists tracked election irregularities reported in local media, and encouraged others to document activities at their neighborhood polling stations. The monitoring effort was spearheaded by youth who have led a series of social media campaigns and street protests leading up to Sunday's vote. At the Revolution elementary school near the heart of Mexico City, Martha Rojas Ramos was near the front of the line, waiting for the polls to open Sunday morning. The 58-year-old flea market merchant, who carried bags of merchandise in her arms as she waited in line to vote before heading to work Sunday morning, said money was tight, and the economy was a key issue for her in this year's election. Peña Nieto, she said, is the right person to solve Mexico's economic problems. ""He is obviously prepared. There was obviously a dirty war against him,"" said Martha Rojas Ramos, 58. Critics lamenting the possible return of the PRI to power aren't thinking straight, she said. ""That's all in the past. What's important is that he is young and has all the ability to represent us,"" she said. Alejandro Garcia, a 33-year-old accountant, said he supported Peña Nieto's security strategy, which aims to decrease violence in Mexico. Calderon, Mexico's current president, made combating cartels a top priority when he took office in December 2006. Since then, more than 47,500 people have died in drug-related violence nationwide, according to government statistics. Garcia said the surge in violence has negatively impacted daily life throughout the country. ""People don't go out as much in the streets. People go inside their homes earlier in the day. ...

Thalia Vasquez was one of hundreds of out-of-town voters who went to a special polling place to vote and had to wait for hours. Shouting matches ensued when people tried to cut in line, she said. ""Imagine how long this is going to take,"" she said, saying election authorities should do more to monitor the lines outside the polls. Voters still in line after polls close at 6 p.m. were allowed to vote, election officials said. Mexicans also cast ballots from beyond the country's borders. On Saturday, election officials said they had received 40,737 absentee ballots from Mexicans living abroad. For the first time, more than 79 million people were registered to vote, according to election authorities. Among them are 3.5 million young people who will be casting their first vote, the institute said. More than 2,100 federal, state and local offices will also be decided by Sunday's vote, according to Mexico's Federal Election Institute. Voters will elect governors in the states of Chiapas, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Morelos, Tabasco and Yucatan. In Mexico City, the nation's capital, residents will elect a new mayor. Election authorities suspended voting an hour early at nine polls in the southern state of Chiapas Sunday after clashes between political groups backing competing candidates for mayor in the town of Rincon Chamula.

"(CNN) -- It is likely that radical cleric Abu Hamza -- who was found guilty on terror charges by a New York federal jury this week --- will now spend the rest of his life in a U.S. top security prison while his victims will gain some succor from the fact that he is finally behind bars. However, merely stopping high-profile extremist preachers is not enough if the threat they represent is to be confronted. Much more needs to be done to challenge extremist narratives, ideas and propaganda if we are prevent the next generation of extremist preachers from emerging. There was a time, during the 1980s and early 1990s, when individuals would rarely become radicalized without direct contact with an extremist preacher of some description. In this context, preachers such as Abu Hamza became highly significant as recruiters and propagandists. Their ability to tailor the al-Qaeda worldview to young and impressionable audiences in Europe and North America allowed them to target a generation of Muslims born and raised in the West. However, even though many key extremist preachers have now been arrested or deported -- such as Omar Bakri and Abdullah Faisal -- extremist narratives are still being disseminated and reaching their target audiences. The likes of Abu Hamza have left a legacy which has now been taken on by some Western-born recruits, using educational institutions, prisons and the Internet to spread extremist messages. The fact that an estimated 400 British citizens are believed to have traveled to Syria to join jihadist groups suggests their efforts are having some success. In tackling extremism we need to ensure universities and colleges are not hosting extremist preachers without providing a robust challenge to their views. We need to ensure prisoners are offered mentoring and support to turn their lives around, making them less susceptible to recruitment within prisons. Online extremism also needs to be challenged with counter-arguments; this could be done through websites and social media accounts that confront the extremist narrative. A recent Quilliam report further details how this can be done. Arresting key individuals or shutting down extremist websites -- as some European governments propose -- are not long-term solutions to this problem. Extremist narratives only lose their appeal when they are undermined and thoroughly discredited; when the debate is opened up and won by their opponents, rather than being shut down and lost. We need to enter the realm of ideas and pitch more positive and enlightened values against extreme and regressive arguments. The extreme Islamist narrative offers listeners a simplistic framework through which all geo-political developments are misconstrued. Just as Marxists view all activities as part of a class struggle, so extreme Islamists rely on a West versus Islam framework or a Muslim versus non-Muslim rivalry. In the view of such extreme Islamists, Muslims are at war while non-Muslim states and political entities form part of a broad struggle to undermine Islam. Conflict zones -- such as Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan -- are viewed not as localised or isolated conflicts but part of a grand conspiracy to undermine Islam and prevent the emergence of a utopian Islamist super-power. Undermining extreme Islamism is about undermining the framework or narrative that is being used. This involves discrediting it and exposing its inaccuracies from a political, historical and theological point of view. It is also about revealing the true nature of the extremist narrative and presenting it in its unembellished form. Extremists often rely on highlighting a select number of grievances, while ignoring other less convenient ones, in order to create moral outrage and garner sympathy. Exposing this selective and agenda driven approach to conflict zones and political developments is key to discrediting their efforts. Ultimately, extremism will stop appealing to young people when it becomes unfashionable and is regarded as yesterday's news. However, or that to happen we need not only counter-narratives but also alternative narratives through which the world can be understood and appreciated. For this to happen we need more political literacy, more spaces in which young people can discuss political and social developments and a stronger sense of national and regional identity so that people feel a greater sense of rootedness and belonging. We undermine extremists by illustrating how our values are better than theirs and offering constructive answers in opposition to their destructive proposals.","Ghaffar Hussain: We need to confront extreme Islamist narratives .

"(CNN)  -- The NAACP filed lawsuits Friday against two of the nation's largest mortgage lenders -- HSBC and Wells Fargo -- alleging ""systematic, institutionalized racism"" in their subprime lending. NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous says, ""We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem."" ""We have targeted these banks because we have gone through what we can get our hands on, and it seems like there's a real problem here,"" NAACP CEO Benjamin Jealous told CNN. Jealous said the group wants ""transparency."" ""We want to see the books,"" he added. ""We are not seeking damages; we just want them to fix the problem."" Both companies denied the allegations. HSBC spokeswoman Kate Durham said the company does not comment on litigation, but she said, ""We stand by our lending practices."" In a statement, Wells Fargo spokeswoman Melissa Murray said, ""The NAACP's allegations are totally unfounded and reckless. We have never tolerated, and will never tolerate, discrimination in any way, shape or form in any of our business practices, products or services."" She added that the company has been ""working with the NAACP for the past two years to develop a partnership that would benefit the NAACP, its constituents and our communities, so we are dismayed that the NAACP has chosen to abandon that constructive dialogue in order to pursue this litigation."" Under subprime lending, people who don't qualify for lower interest rates can borrow money at higher rates. The NAACP argues that the companies gave subprime rates to African-Americans who qualified for better rates and gave better rates to white customers with similar credit histories.

But that's not solely because of intentional efforts to target African-Americans, according to the lawsuits.  Watch which parts of the country had the greatest percentages of subprime lending » .

"(CNN) -- An audio message believed to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri sought to halt infighting among jihadist groups in Syria, urging them instead to turn their arms against Shiites. In a 26-minute audio message posted on a jihadist website Friday, al-Zawahiri called on the Syria's al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as al-Nusra Front, to stop fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the message. A voice that appears similar to previous messages from al-Zawahiri ordered al-Nusra general commander ""Abu Mohammed al-Joulani and soldiers in al-Nusra front, and all other mujahedeen groups in Syria, to immediately stop fighting and aggression against their brothers and all Muslims, and should focus on fighting the enemies of Islam from Baathists, (Alawites) and their Shiite allies."" The al Qaeda leader also passed on orders for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and his followers to focus on the fight in Iraq, where sectarian violence has reached the highest levels in more than five years, often pitting Sunnis, a minority in Iraq, against Shiite Muslims. ""Focus on Iraq even if you felt that you have been oppressed and taken advantage of, to stop this bloodshed and focus [on] enemies of Allah and Sunni people in Iraq,"" the message said. The call for a truce among jihadist groups comes as some 60,000 people have been forced to flee the northern Syrian province of Deir Ezzor in recent days amid clashes between the rival organizations, the London-based opposition group, Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said via Facebook Saturday. At least 62 fighters have been killed in fighting over the past four days, the SOHR said. The clashes pit Jabhat al-Nusra and another group against ISIS, according to the SOHR. Al Qaeda splinter group ISIS this week staged bodies to look like they were crucified in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. The group said the brutal display served to send a message to anyone who dares challenge its rule. The group carried out seven public executions in Raqqa on Tuesday, but only two bodies were displayed afterward, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The men in Raqqa were shot in the head before being affixed to crosses. The displays of their bodies appear to be largely symbolic acts by ISIS followers against members of their own Sunni Muslim sect for perceived acts of treason. As Syria's civil war creates a power vacuum, groups such as ISIS have stepped in with their own form of radical Sharia law to rule over an exhausted and terrorized civilian population. In a recent long-ranging interview, al-Zawahiri urged Muslims to capture Westerners as pawns that might be used to free prisoners aligned with his movement. Asked what he'd tell ""Muslims and the mujahedeen"" -- a term used for some Islamist militants -- to do to ""fulfill their duty"" toward their allies in custody, al-Zawahiri said last week, ""I advise them to capture Westerners -- and especially the Americans, as much as they can -- to exchange them for our captives."" Al-Zawahiri touched on an array of topics in a question-and-answer session with al Qaeda's media arm, audio of which was published on the radical Islamist website Hanein. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the recording. In the first part of the interview, which was posted online two weeks ago, al-Zawahiri insisted al Qaeda is holding strong and, in fact, ""expanding"" 13 years after the United States launched its ""war on terror"" following the September 11, 2001, attacks.","Ayman al-Zawahiri calls for truce between Jabhat al-Nusra, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria .

"(CNN) -- A senior Iranian official said Saturday that Tehran is not considering a replacement for Hamid Aboutalebi, its choice for ambassador to the United Nations, despite the United States denying him a visa, Iranian state TV reported. The United States has told Iran that it will not issue a visa to Aboutalebi because of his ties to the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the White House said. But Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters in Tehran that Aboutalebi remained Iran's choice and that it is following up on the issue through diplomatic channels, according to state broadcaster Press TV. Iranian lawmaker Hossein Naqavi Hosseini told state news agency IRNA that the United States was obliged to honor its responsibility to issue visas in its role as host for the United Nations headquarters in New York. The White House is still reviewing a bill passed in Congress this week prohibiting the ambassador from entering the United States. Aboutalebi was a member of the Muslim Students Following the Imam's Line, the group of militants that seized the embassy on November 4, 1979, holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. He is a veteran diplomat who has served as Iran's ambassador to Australia, Belgium, Italy and the European Union. He has also held high-profile posts in the Iranian Foreign Ministry. He currently works in the political affairs office of President Hassan Rouhani and is believed to be close to the Iranian leader, who is widely viewed as a moderate with a reformist agenda. In an interview with Iranian media, Aboutalebi said he served as translator and negotiator, but denied taking part in the initial occupation of the embassy. Unusual step . One of the leaders of the takeover of the U.S. Embassy, Abbas Abdi, told CNN exclusively from Tehran that ""Mr. Aboutalebi was not in Tehran during the initial invasion."" Abdi, currently a reformist journalist, said Aboutalebi has ""no relation to the decision-making team, the group who invaded and those who continued the hostage captivity in Iran."" The choice of Aboutalebi could complicate U.S. President Barack Obama's efforts to re-engage with Tehran after the election of Rouhani and negotiate a comprehensive agreement with five other world powers to curb Iran's nuclear program. Asked Friday if the issue over Aboutalebi would affect nuclear talks, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters it had not impacted discussions held this week. She declined to give details of the reasons behind the visa refusal but said the United States had been ""very clear ... with the Iranians that this nomination is not viable."" Hamid Babaei, a spokesman for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, said it was a ""regrettable decision"" by the United States which was ""in contravention of international law, the obligation of the host country and the inherent right of sovereign member states to designate their representatives to the United Nations."" With no formal relations between the United States and Iran, the U.N. mission is Tehran's only diplomatic operation in the United States and has played a role in facilitating unofficial exchanges of messages between the two nations. The step taken this week is unusual, given that the United States is obligated to grant entry visas to representatives of U.N. member states, in accordance with a 1947 agreement signed with the world body. CNN's Laura Bernardini, Elise Labott and Richard Roth contributed to this report.","Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi says Iran is not considering a different nominee .

"(CNN) -- A Catholic bishop convicted of Holocaust denial in Germany has fired a lawyer with neo-Nazi links, the editor of the bishop's newsletter said. Bishop Richard Williamson dismissed the lawyer, Wolfram Nahrath, on orders from his superior, Nicholas Wansbutter told CNN late Wednesday. Nahrath told CNN earlier that he had been hired to help Williamson appeal his conviction, which stemmed from doubting Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's intention to murder Jews and denying the existence of gas chambers at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The appeal was originally scheduled to begin next week but was delayed indefinitely because of the change of lawyers, Nahrath said. Nahrath would not say when he was hired and would not comment on his political affiliations. He did not say he had been fired and did not respond to CNN requests for comment about the matter Thursday. The German Interior Ministry said Nahrath was the leader of the far-right Wiking Jugend until authorities banned the group in 1994. Williamson was in Germany, where Holocaust denial is a crime, when he made the remarks in an interview with Swedish television. The comments came shortly before Pope Benedict XVI lifted an excommunication on him and three other ultraconservative bishops. The Vatican said Benedict was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when the excommunication was lifted, and the pope ordered Williamson to recant. The excommunication was not related to his Holocaust denial. Williamson was convicted of Holocaust denial in April. He did not appear in court to fight the charges. Nahrath's father and grandfather led the Wiking Jugend before he did, according to the anti-extremist group Netz-gegen-Nazis. It said the Wiking Jugend was an imitation of the Hitler Youth, a group set up by Hitler to teach Nazi principles to children. Williamson's order, the ultra-conservative Society of St. Pius X, distanced itself from his decision to hire Nahrath. The order's superior general, Bishop Bernard Fellay, threatened to expel Williamson from the society if he stuck with his lawyer.","Bishop Richard Williamson hires, then fires, a lawyer to fight his conviction for Holocaust denial .

"(CNN) -- Germany captain Michael Ballack will miss the World Cup after he picked up an ankle injury during Chelsea's FA Cup final victory over Portsmouth at Wembley. The 33-year-old sustained ligament damage in a strong tackle from Portsmouth midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng that forced him to hobble off before half-time in a game that Chelsea won 1-0. A scan in Munich revealed the extent of Ballack's injury, which will rule him out for up to two months, according to the German Football Association. In a recent interview with CNN Ballack spoke of his excitement at leading his country to the World Cup, but he acknowledged it would be his last appearance at the tournament. Now he will be forced to watch from the sidelines as Germany open their bid for the trophy with a game against Australia on June 13. Ironically, Boateng may be representing Ghana at the finals, who are also in Germany's group. Ballack has 98 caps for Germany and made 36 appearances for Chelsea this season. A statement on the German Football Association's Web site read: ""German captain Michael Ballack will not be able to play at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. This is the result of a magnetic resonance imaging, which was performed this Monday in Munich. ""The tomography showed a rupture of the cruciate ligament and a partial rupture of the syndesmosis at his right ankle, which will be immobilized in a cast. Ballack will then wear a specially designed shoe for two weeks. ""German team doctor Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt said, that according to today's diagnosis, Ballack can look for a complete recovery, but that it should require a minimum of eight weeks before a possible re-entry into regular practice sessions.""","Michael Ballack has been ruled out of the World Cup through injury .

Both colleges are working with Italian authorities. ""It is with much sadness that the Durkin family informs you of the loss of John Nolen Durkin and thanks everyone for their support during the past few days,"" his family said in a statement released through Bates. He's been in Rome for a little more than a month as part of a semester-long program, according to Tom Durkin, a family spokesman. Two days ago, he went to a bar with a group of friends and never returned, according to the spokesman, who said he left the bar alone. His father, Tim Durkin, is in Rome. Bates President Clayton Spencer expressed ""deep sadness"" for Durkin's death and saying his college shares ""the tremendous grief of his family.""

"(CNN) -- When Lukas Hartmann, 29, signed up for 23andMe's at-home genetic testing service, there were no surprises in his results. The Berliner learned he would probably die from ""a mix of heart attack and prostate cancer,"" he wrote on a friend's blog, but ""nothing special there."" Then a few months ago, he received an update from the company. Hartmann's genetic code showed two mutations that are linked to limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, he says the site told him. ""Some people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy lose the ability to walk and suffer from serious disability,"" his results page read. This can't be true, he thought. It must be an error. Genetic testing can be a powerful tool. It can offer information about your family history, tell you how your body might respond to different drugs and identify your risk factors for disease. It can also be misleading. The Food and Drug Administration on Monday ordered 23andMe to stop sales of its $99 home genetic testing kits, saying the Google-backed company has not proven the validity of its product. The FDA warned that customers who received inaccurate results could suffer from undue mental anguish or undergo unnecessary medical procedures. The government agency has asked 23andMe to revise its marketing strategy to comply with federal regulations. The action triggered outrage among some of 23andMe's supporters. ""So GMOs, aspartame, artificial flavors & colors, pink slime ... no problem!"" a poster named Laura Ann wrote on the company's Facebook page. ""But in no way should we be allowed the right to know our own genetic material as a means for making better decisions about our health."" In a statement, 23andMe said it has received the FDA's letter and will be working to address the agency's concerns. There are more than 3 billion letters in our genetic code. Though it's been 10 years since the Human Genome Project was completed, scientists still don't understand what every gene does, and what a mutation might mean for someone's health. It's one of the issues opponents to home genetic testing kits raise most often. If DNA experts don't understand 100% what a gene mutation means, how can we expect consumers to? 5 cool things DNA testing can do . Scientists have identified more than 2,000 single gene disorders, says Rebecca Nagy, president of the National Society of Genetic Counselors. These are disorders that can be diagnosed based on the mutation of a single gene in the body; some examples include Huntington's disease or cystic fibrosis. But conditions such as Type 2 diabetes or Alzheimer's are more complex. Hundreds of genes may contribute to the development of these diseases, Nagy says, and a person's risk is also influenced by his or her environment. Testing for markers of risk scattered across someone's genome is ""really only testing for the tip of the iceberg."" ""That's where it gets a little scary, because if a person has a normal test result on 23andMe, they leave thinking they don't have a risk,"" she says. ""It's not that the science behind (this kind of genetic testing) isn't good. It's that the science behind them isn't complete."" The upside of these at-home genetic testing kits -- and 23andMe isn't the only company that sells them -- is that they've generated a lot of buzz about genetics, Nagy says. She says she believes most early adopters of the tests are information-savvy and understand the results aren't set in stone. ""I don't think that anyone thinks that this kit replaces formal testing by a doctor,"" Heather Armstrong posted on 23andMe's Facebook page. ""I seriously doubt that a doctor would agree to perform, say, a double mastectomy, based on these results."" Joseph Stolarski posted, ""If you find something interesting, you then take it to a medical professional for further evaluation. No one is or should rely on it for medical 'diagnosis.' It's just a tool, like personally checking your heart rate with a watch or checking your weight on a scale."" But Nagy says she worries about what will happen when the tests become more mainstream. Giving this kind of information to someone unfamiliar with genetic testing's limitations could prove dangerous. Nagy recommends anyone who wants to do genetic testing first talk to a genetic counselor. Counselors have specialized graduate degrees and extensive knowledge of the human genome. They're also trained in explaining test results to laymen. ""Our message is to be a smart consumer,"" Nagy says. ""Know what you're doing so that when you get the results back you can really use them to your best benefit."" Hartmann did some intense investigating, saying he looked at the raw data 23andMe provided him. He eventually found he did indeed have two mutations, he says, but they weren't on the same gene. He says he submitted his ""bug report"" to the company and it apologized. In general, Hartmann thinks it's a good thing for every person to have affordable access to his or her genetic data. But he's browsed the community forums on 23andMe.com and has seen how seriously some people take their results -- without fully understanding them. Hartmann says he now believes he will not get limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, although he says there is a risk he could pass the genetic mutations onto his kids. ""I can live with that,"" he wrote. ""For quite some time, I hope."" Parents push for standardized screening of Jewish genetic diseases .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever gazed down from an airplane on a clear day, you've probably admired the quilted fields or jagged ribbons of coastline below. Now imagine seeing those views from several hundred miles higher, a perspective that morphs recognizable landscapes into something that looks more like abstract art. That's the aesthetic behind ""Earth from Space,"" a new book of photographs that emphasizes the beauty and delicacy of our planet. The coffee table-sized volume contains more than 150 high-resolution images, shot from satellites, that chronicle everything from the patchwork plains of Kansas to the shrinking snows of Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa to the twinkling sprawl of Shanghai, China, at night. ""Whether seen from the sky or from space, no matter the difference in scale, our planet arouses the same sense of wonder by offering us unexpected geometric forms, magnificent structures and stunning colors -- even if the colors in satellite images are often artificial,"" writes author-photographer Yann Arthus-Bertrand in the book's preface. Unlike true-color images that use visible light, some satellite photos incorporate infrared light and show unexpected colors, enhancing selected features on Earth, such as fires. Published by Abrams Books, ""Earth from Space"" is a project of Arthus-Bertrand's GoodPlanet Foundation, which works to raise awareness of conservation and environmental issues. Its photos were collected by Astrium, a French company specializing in satellite services and other space technology. Newly sophisticated lenses and sensors have allowed photographers to capture the Earth from space in remarkable detail -- down to the rows of shanties in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, that were destroyed in the 2010 earthquake. Images from space also help make scientists aware of gradual environmental shifts wrought by climate change or humans, such as deforestation or disappearing polar ice caps. Google Earth has given us all access to spacecraft's-eye views of our planet. But the book's large-scale photos, with their colorful swirls and mysterious patterns, function as artworks as well as documents. Arthus-Bertrand hopes the images in ""Earth From Space"" serve another purpose as well: to inspire readers to learn more about Earth's delicate ecosystems and how to protect them. ""What satellites cannot give us is the meaning of what they observe,"" he writes. ""Only our species can interpret their images and discern within them the fascinating beauty of our world, as well as its incredible fragility.""","""Earth from Space"" is a book of photos that emphasizes the beauty of our planet .

"(CNN) -- It's called the ""Walmart of Weed."" This newest big-box store is devoted to selling marijuana-growing equipment. Its biggest outlet yet is to open Wednesday in Phoenix, where Arizona voters approved medical cannabis last fall. The weGrow Store will be the first outside California, where medical weed has long been legalized. None of the chain's three stores sell the drug. Instead, they unabashedly promote medical marijuana by offering ""everything -- from supplies to services -- that cultivators need to grow it,"" the company says. What sets weGrow apart from the mom-and-pop stores selling the growing supplies is that weGrow openly states its hydroponic equipment is intended for pot, a spokeswoman said. The smaller stores often claim the hydroponic equipment is used for growing indoor tomatoes and often kick out a customer if they broach the subject of medical cannabis, said weGrow spokeswoman Melissa DiGianfilippo. While 16 states and the District of Columbia now allow for some sort of medical marijuana, there remains ambiguity about whether U.S. authorities would ever enforce federal laws against marijuana distribution, though 90% of hydroponics revenue is from cannabis growers, DiGianfilippo said. In fact, the state of Arizona filed a federal lawsuit last week asking the courts to determine whether the voter-approved initiative legalizing medical marijuana is, indeed, legal. Calling itself ""the nation's only hydroponics franchise that openly talks about medical marijuana,"" the Oakland, California-based weGrow sees a boom in Arizona and projects 100,000 Arizonans acquiring state medical cannabis cards, DiGianfilippo said. So far, about 4,000 Arizonans became state-authorized marijuana users after the state began issuing the cards on April 15, DiGianfilippo said. WeGrow chose Wednesday to open its superstore because that was supposed to be the day the state was scheduled to begin accepting applications to run a marijuana dispensary. But Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer and Attorney General Tom Horne filed a federal lawsuit Friday seeking a declaratory judgment regarding the legality of Proposition 203. Voters approved the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act last November and Brewer signed it into law in December. Nonetheless, the federal government considers marijuana a controlled substance. In a May 2, 2011, letter, U.S. Attorney Dennis Burke of Arizona warned state officials that ""growing, distributing and possessing marijuana, in any capacity, other than as a federally authorized research program, is a violation of federal law regardless of state laws that purport to permit such activities,"" according to Brewer. Burke declared that his office would ""vigorously prosecute individuals and organizations that participate in unlawful manufacturing, distribution and marketing activity involving marijuana, even if such activities are permitted under state law,"" according to Brewer's office. ""The State of Arizona has worked to follow the wishes of voters,"" Brewer said in a statement. ""But I won't stand aside while state employees and average Arizonans acting in good faith are unwittingly put at risk. In light of the explicit warnings on this issue offered by Arizona's U.S. Attorney, as well as many other federal prosecutors, clarity and judicial direction are in order."" Brewer has directed that the Arizona Department of Health Services put on hold its process for licensing marijuana dispensaries, pending court action on this issue, Brewer's spokesman, Matthew Benson, told CNN on Tuesday. ""The agency will continue providing registration cards for individuals who receive a doctor's recommendation to use medical marijuana,"" Benson said in an e-mail. WeGrow founder Dhar Mann, a 27-year-old entrepreneur who opened his first store in Oakland after a small hydroponics store ejected him for asking about medical marijuana cultivation, said his firm still sees an opportunity in Arizona, where he estimates medical pot to be a billion-dollar industry. He has plans for similar superstores in other states with legal marijuana. The Phoenix store, located in an industrial area so as not to upset any homeowners, will be 21,000 square feet. Wednesday's grand opening in Phoenix will feature indoor growing demonstrations with nonmarijuana plants, experts on how to build professional grow rooms, a physician for patient evaluations and classes on how to safely and responsibly cultivate medical marijuana, weGrow officials said. The first weGrow store was a 15,000-square-foot facility that opened in Oakland last year, and in February, a 10,000-square-foot store opened in Sacramento, California, a spokeswoman said. Mann said the Arizona law allows for up to 124 dispensaries, and he took exception with the governor's lawsuit. ""Delaying the process that a majority of the Arizona voters have asked for prevents qualified cannabis patients from receiving medicine they need and causes unfair financial hardship to businesspeople who have invested tens of thousands of dollars in reliance on the process set up by the state,"" Mann said in a statement. ""Medical marijuana cultivating, dispensing, and consuming will exist with or without governmental approval,"" Mann said. ""It's time to tax and regulate this industry so legitimate business people and patients are not criminalized.""","The weGrow firm will open its third superstore in Phoenix on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- This week, veteran Cleveland marketer Kelly Blazek learned the hard way that you should watch your words -- especially when you put them in writing -- after a nasty digital lecture she delivered to a young job seeker went viral. In her sarcasm-laden message to recent graduate Diana Mekota, who'd asked to connect with Blazek via LinkedIn, Blazek wrote: ""Your invitation to connect is inappropriate, beneficial only to you, and tacky. Wow, I cannot wait to let every 26-year-old jobseeker mine my top-tier marketing connections to help them land a job. ... You're welcome for your humility lesson for the year."" It was hardly a lesson learned. Mekota countered by posting Blazek's response online asking people on Facebook, Reddit, and Imgur to ""please call this lady out."" She then forwarded Blazek's message to a local radio station and appeared on air to discuss. Blazek's words were, of course, undeniably, and likely unnecessarily, harsh, especially considering Blazek has made her name as an advocate for Cleveland jobseekers, creating and updating a popular local jobs bank with some 7,300 subscribers. Last year, in fact, she was named the city's ""Communicator of the Year."" It's a time when many women struggle to find mentors. In a 2011 survey of more than 1,000 working women, one out of five said they've never had a mentor at work. And the ""queen bee syndrome"" is alive and well. Blazek might have aimed to correct what she considered Mekota's breach of protocol with kindness rather than condescension and cruelty. Instead, she seemed to take glee in putting Mekota in her place. ""I love the sense of entitlement in your generation,"" she wrote. ""And I therefore enjoy denying your invite."" She ended the note with ""Don't ever write me again."" Certainly, it's hard not to wonder why Blazek -- a professional in a field where image matters, a lot, and an avid social marketer besides -- didn't anticipate the possibility that Mekota might share the note with others, although it turns out this was not the first time Blazek had delivered such an admonishment. But she's hardly the only one at fault here. By herself choosing not to ignore Blazek's words, and instead shame her for them in a most public manner, Mekota acted with malice, and caused the older woman significant damage. Blazek has since been the subject of national outrage; many have suggested that her career is dead. In the wake of the exchange, she issued a public apology and has deleted most of the contents of her blog and shut down her social media accounts, including the Job Bank twitter that served to help thousands of people find work. No question, Blazek lashed out first, with unprofessional behavior that can only be described as bullying. An undoubtedly kinder, and wiser, alternative, of course, might have been to simply ignore Mekota's request. But Mekota responding in kind makes her no less a bully. Perhaps it's not surprising: Bullying is wont to breed more bullying. And social media provides the opportunity to make anything public with ease and efficacy -- a ready and willing vehicle for public shaming. But just because you can doesn't mean you should. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Job seeker posts sarcastic, mean reply from marketer and it goes viral .

"(CNN) -- If Facebook is the ultimate popularity test, then the most famous art institute on the planet is not in Paris, New York or London. It's a tiny gallery hidden on the fifth floor of a nondescript building in Amsterdam. Measuring a meager 750 square feet, The Greenbox Museum is the only museum in the world dedicated solely to Saudi contemporary art, and with over a million Facebook ""likes"", it is more loved than the Tate, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or the Louvre. ""When I started, people thought, it can't be true, it's a joke, its April Fools,"" recalls Aarnout Helb, the museum's founder. Helb started collecting Saudi art in 2008, after accidently stumbling upon a work by leading Saudi artist Ahmed Mater online. A year later, he opened Greenbox. Helb doesn't find the museum's online popularity unusual. ""A lot of the fans are basically young Muslims that perceive Saudi as a country relevant to their culture, because of the historical and ritual position of Mecca,"" he says. Saudi art has also become trendy in Western art circles. Last year, Tate Modern director Chris Dercon made a special visit to Saudi for Jeddah Art Week. Michael Jeha, the managing director of Christie's Middle East, who last year sold a piece by Abdulnasser Gharem for $842,500 (the highest grossing work by a Saudi artist ever), says that much of the demand is coming from Europe and America. For Saudi artists themselves, foreign influence can be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, art shown outside the country is less censored. Read more: Saudi artists push the limits . Soraya Darwish, a young artist who also blogs about her country's art scene, notes that often, artists will feel more comfortable showcasing sensitive materials abroad. In Saudi, all exhibits have to pass review by the Ministry of Culture and Information before they are opened to the public. Overseas, there are no such measures. ""If an artwork is too culturally sensitive, it could get banned from being shown in Saudi,"" she says. ""It hasn't happened to me, but I've known artists it has happened to. Usually, they'll just be asked not to show a work. I guess in the worst-case scenario, a show could be shut down."" Manal Al Dowayan, the country's highest grossing female artist, disagrees that censorship is problematic within Saudi. Al Dowayan has exhibited at both the V&A and British Museum, and at solo and group shows within Saudi. At Alaan Artspace, a newly opened gallery in Riyadh, she showed a sculpture entitled ""esmi"" or ""my name"", which depicting giant prayer beads bearing female names (it was made in response to a conservative trend forbidding men to use a woman's name in public). ""My art is very critical of social attitudes toward women, and I have never been censored in Saudi,"" she says. ""The obvious untouchables are insulting religion and the royal family; everything else is open."" Saudi hasn't traditionally championed its artists. The majority of Greenbox's online love, for instance, doesn't come from Saudi, which ranks ninth on the list, but from Indonesia, Pakistan and Egypt. Yet as art becomes more accepted (and lucrative) outside the Saudi Arabia, those inside the country are starting to take note. One of the first institutions inside the country to champion Saudi art was Athr, which launched in Jeddah in 2009. Only recently have other institutions started to join the fray. Last October, Alaan Artspace opened, with the added mission of establishing an art curriculum in the country. ""Art and design have always been a part of Saudi culture. It is art education that has been overlooked,"" says Neama Al Sudairy, Alaan's founding director. The art scene has picked up to such an extent that last March also witnessed the launch of the country's first art guide (appropriately titled ""Saudi Art Guide""), available online and in app form. ""In Jeddah and Riyadh, there are more galleries opening -- maybe one or two a year. It's kind of a trend, where someone sees the market potential and opens up a gallery,"" says Darwish, the guide's co-founder. For some artists, the development of art within the country is a reaction against the adverse effect foreign influence has had on the scene. Recently, Ahmed Mater sent out a brief stating his longing to return to his roots, partly because the growing Middle Eastern art market ""treats our practices as a means to a resulting commodity, our visual languages and aesthetics being transformed into identifiable and inflexible brands."" Helb also worries about the effects of commercialization. ""You have censorship (of Saudi art) in London. Not a little, but a lot,"" notes Helb. ""Galleries want to make things glossier for the art market, so it sells and fits in your house and is interesting, and Saudi artists lose the spontaneity of their voices. They turn artists into race horses.""","Small gallery in Amsterdam has huge online support .
Facing a lack of interest in their country, many Saudi artists have found recognition abroad .

"(CNN) -- The father of the teen who survived a flight to Hawaii in the wheel well of a jetliner says his son is ""a good kid"" who has struggled to adjust to life in America. In a statement released through a San Francisco-area Islamic group, Abdulahi Yusuf said he and his family came to the United States from war-torn Somalia. He identified his son as Yahya Yusuf and said he plans to escort his son back to California from Hawaii. The 15-year-old Yahya told authorities that he crawled into the wheel well of the Hawaii-bound Boeing 767 and lost consciousness when the plane took off. He survived the nearly five-hour flight in subzero temperatures at oxygen-depleted heights as high as 38,000 feet, authorities believe. ""Our family was deeply concerned when my son went missing, and we were relieved to hear of his safety considering the circumstances of his trip,"" Abdulahi Yusuf said in a statement issued by the Bay Area chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. ""My son, like many immigrant children, is struggling adjusting to life in this country,"" he said. ""Our situation was aggravated by our displacement in Africa for many years after fleeing our home country of Somalia because of war conditions. As a result, my son was not able to receive any formal education before we immigrated to the United States. Yahya is a good kid who I love dearly."" Discovered after he apparently regained consciousness on Maui, the teen has been recovering at a hospital and is in the custody of the state's child welfare agency, officials there said. He told investigators that he was trying to get to Somalia to see his mother, and had no clue which plane went where, a law enforcement official told CNN last week. He is said to have hopped a fence at San Jose International Airport shortly after 1 a.m. April 20 and stayed on the grounds for six hours without getting caught, a government official said. Yusuf said he's headed to Hawaii soon, ""and am excited to bring him back home to his family in California. We thank everybody for their concern and support, and ask that people continue to respect our privacy during this incredibly difficult time.""

"(CNN) -- Two Kenyan aid workers who had been held by the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab since 2011 have been rescued near Somalia's border with Kenya, the African Union Mission in Somalia said Friday. The rescue was carried out on the outskirts of Dhobley town in Somalia by peacekeepers for the mission, known by the acronym AMISOM, who were working with Somali forces, AMISOM said in a news release. One of the rescued, James Kiarie Gichoi, was working for Care International when he was kidnapped near the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya. The other, Daniel Njuguna Wanyoike, was working as a driver's helper for a company contracted by the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres when he was kidnapped in Afmadow, a nearby town in Somalia. Both men were receiving treatment Friday at an AMISOM medical facility in nearby Dhobley, Somalia, and were expected to be repatriated to Nairobi, Kenya. AMISOM forces working with the Somali National Army have mounted an offensive that has liberated 10 towns that were among Al-Shabaab's strongholds, said AMISOM, the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Al-Shabaab, designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States, has a relationship with al Qaeda that goes back several years. In 2012, the two groups effectively merged, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. Al-Shabaab hopes to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, but has launched attacks in other countries as well. In 2010, Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for two suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, amid crowds of soccer fans watching televised screenings of the World Cup final. The bombings left 74 people dead. The group said the attacks were retaliation for Ugandan participation in AMISOM. One AMISOM goal is to support Somali government forces in cracking down on Al-Shabaab. Al-Shabaab has also mounted many smaller attacks against targets in Kenya, hurling hand grenades into nightclubs, restaurants and schools. The group has also kidnapped tourists and aid workers. The group claimed responsibility for the September siege of the Westgate mall in Nairobi on September 21 that killed at least 67 people. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya's involvement in the African Union effort against the group. In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces have fought the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu, the Somali capital.

"(CNN) -- Officials in the resort city of Branson, Missouri, were relieved an EF2 tornado, which damaged some of its marquee musical theaters, struck before the prime tourist season began. They said Wednesday the town was still open for business, although tourists might have to change some of their entertainment plans. ""We are getting through it,"" Mayor Raeanne Presley said of the storm that moved through early Wednesday. The tornado had winds of 120 to 130 mph, was 400 yards wide and was on the ground for about 20 miles, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service. The storm smashed at least seven miles of the city's commercial strip. Although tourists were in town, the numbers would likely have been much higher in about two weeks, when entertainment moves into full gear through Christmas, officials said. Storm system rakes long path . Thirty-three injuries were reported; most were minor or moderate. One person was listed as critical, according to City Administrator Dean Kruithof. Gov. Jay Nixon said damage was in at least in the tens of millions, perhaps higher. Crews were still assessing the extent of the losses. ""We are confident that Branson will be back bigger and better than ever,"" Nixon told reporters. ""I woke up this morning and looked outside and saw houses were destroyed,"" said resident Steven Scharmanzer. ""I've never seen anything like this in the 20 years I've lived here."" Presley told CNN she couldn't recall a storm that hit so many structures. Several venues were more fortunate. Silver Dollar City theme park, for example, appeared to be unaffected. Nestled in the Ozarks region, about 40 miles south of Springfield, Branson has been a musical magnet for decades. It really took off in the mid-1980s, and its many theaters have showcased stars such as Andy Williams and Tony Orlando. The offerings range from country to comedy, classical to kitsch. Kruithof said about five or six of the city's roughly 40 theaters were damaged. The Branson Variety Theater was heavily damaged, he told CNN. ""One of the big issues is cleaning up and getting rid of the debris,"" he said. ""(However), many, many more of our theaters had minor, or no damage at all."" The city's convention center and an attached Hilton were damaged, as was a portion of Branson Landing, a large shopping and entertainment complex. iReport: Hilton's windows blown out . ""While we do have significant damage, this is not to the extent to what you saw in Joplin,"" Kruithof said. ""Some properties will be difficult to repair."" The May 22, 2011, EF5 tornado in Joplin, killed 161 people and injured more than 1,000. Joplin is about 110 miles west of Branson. ""We sent crews to Joplin the day that happened,"" Kruithof said Wednesday. ""I have already received e-mails from Joplin to show they are ready to help us."" Damage across Branson included one neighborhood and familiar tourist spots. A World War II-era biplane in front of a miniature golf course was knocked from its perch. A P-51 Mustang airplane in front of a veterans museum was heavily damaged. Visitors coming to the town this weekend should be aware of the recovery, officials said. ""Many people who have plans ... will probably need to check with their lodging or shows they had tickets for,"" Kruithof said. Many businesses in the southwest Missouri town have disaster preparedness plans. Entrepreneurs are eager to rebuild. ""We have so many people who want crews in here to clean up, who want to start rebuilding,"" Kruithof said. ""It will be a few weeks to get to some sense of normalcy. Some areas it will take longer."" Resident Donna Lowe told CNN she was asleep in her trailer when the storm arrived. ""When the wind started blowing, I started praying,"" she told Wolf Blitzer. The storm threw Lowe from her bed. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris contributed to this report.","EF2 tornado strikes Branson, Missouri, overnight; it was on ground for 20 miles .

"(CNN) -- People have the ""right to be forgotten"" and search engines like Google must remove certain unwanted links, Europe's top court decided in a surprise ruling Tuesday. The case, which spotlighted the clash between privacy and freedom of information advocates, centered on a Spanish man's efforts to remove historic links to his debt problems. In its decision, the European Court of Justice found operators of search engines such as Google were the ""controller"" of information. They were therefore responsible for removing unwanted links if requested. ""An Internet search engine operator is responsible for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third parties,"" the judges said in a statement about the ruling. A Google spokesman, in an email to CNN, said the ruling was ""disappointing,"" and that the company needed time to ""analyze the implications."" Google had previously argued it was only hosting the data and said it was up to the individual websites to remove the data. The decision came as a surprise to the industry and legal experts, as it ran contrary to the court's Advocate General opinion, whose guidance is usually followed. ""For Google, this result creates a headache -- and potentially huge costs,"" University of East Anglia Law School lecturer Paul Bernal said. ""The ruling looks like a strong decision in favor of privacy and individual rights -- and against the business models of search engines, and certain aspects of freedom of speech."" The case arose in 2010, when Mario Costeja Gonzalez complained to the Spanish Data Protection Agency about an old newspaper notice detailing his social security debts. The advertisement was placed in a Spanish newspaper by the Ministry of Labour in 1998. It detailed a property auction being held to recover the debts. Gonzalez argued that he had long resolved his debts and the information was no longer relevant. He complained that details about his old debts were coming up in Google search results, which he said violated his data protection rights. The Spanish privacy watchdog rejected the complaint against the newspaper, saying it was right to publish the information at the time of the auction. However, it also said that Google had no right to spread the news about Gonzalez further and ruled that the search engine must remove the link from the list of results. Google challenged the ruling with the Spanish High Court which referred the case up to EU's top court. International watchdog Index on Censorship said the ruling ""violates the fundamental principles of freedom of expression."" ""It allows individuals to complain to search engines about information they do not like with no legal oversight. This is akin to marching into a library and forcing it to pulp books."" Index said in a statement. Read more: Authors' case against Google Books dismissed . Read more: Google, don't be secretive .

"(CNN) -- A new book on the history of Straits Chinese culture reveals page after page of dazzling, intricate jewelry combining Malay, Chinese, Indian and European designs. These pieces bring together rich materials of far-flung origins: Swiss gold thread and German organza are spun into patterns of Chinese phoenixes and peonies, while European coronets are studded with jade. Lillian Tong, director of the Pinang Peranakan Mansion in George Town, Malaysia, has curated the best of the museum's collection in her book, Straits Chinese Gold Jewelry. Blending of cultures . By the late 19th century, wealthy families of mixed Chinese-Malay descent (known as the Straits Chinese or Peranakans) created a society that incorporated elements of both Asian and European cultures, reflecting their history under the Malay sultanate and Portuguese, Dutch and British rule. In the ports of Penang and Malacca, they built Victorian-style houses according to the principles of feng shui and amused themselves by playing polo, collecting European antiques, and commissioning jewelry. As Tong explains, jewelry was the ""crowning representation of Straits Chinese identity"", serving as a marker of status as well as the increasingly specialized tastes of these merchant families. Subtlety of craft was prized as much as the display of gems and gold. The Straits Chinese wedding was a showcase of this sophisticated material culture, in which a bride might wear over a hundred gold hairpins, each a fine piece of filigree with rose-cut stones. The result was an unprecedented era of creativity in the region, not only in accessories but in architecture, fashion and graphics. This great age of design reached its height between 1900 and 1940, as artisans worked to fuse the luxuries of imperial China with high European style. Fabulous gems . The jewelry itself is a profusion of busy patterns and extraordinarily detailed workmanship. Even a heavy three-piece brooch in 22-carat gold and diamonds is so meticulously crafted that it manages to seem delicate. A tiny hairpin of pearls and silver is reserved for periods of mourning, to be gradually replaced by ornaments of sapphires and jade. For festive jewelry, Burmese rubies and gold are worked into maximalist designs of flora and fauna. The collection reveals the interests and fantasies of a multicultural, multilingual society. Chinese and European motifs are often combined into one piece, as Dutch tulips appear alongside Buddhist bats and deer, while Victorian silver mesh purses feature auspicious Chinese symbols. Asian blossoms are gathered into English-style garlands and bouquets, and entwined with Malay birds. The mythological and real animals of different countries are seen grazing together. This range of ethnic references might seem wildly eclectic today, but for the Straits Chinese community, it was possible to reconcile Europhilia with an appreciation for traditional crafts. According to Dr Alan Chong, director of Singapore's Peranakan Museum, signature ornaments such as the kerosang (heart-shaped brooch) are derived from European jewels of the 18th and 19th centuries. The Straits Chinese were familiar with the concept of taking the best from each culture: borrowing objects from European and Chinese practice, and giving them local variations and stylistic twists. It is astonishing to look back on this era of playful diversity, when a hybrid mix of influences was the norm. These pieces are not only exquisite but inspiring, pointing towards a time when designers felt free to experiment, pulling ideas from every culture and blending them together.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's week went from bad to worse Saturday. Three days after it was ousted by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals, Barcelona lost 1-0 at lowly Granada in Spain's La Liga to give Madrid's second club a huge boost in the title race. Atletico can move four points clear of Barcelona on Sunday, a lead that would render the teams' clash on the final day of the season meaningless -- if Real Madrid is out of contention. Real Madrid replaced Barcelona in second by defeating Almeria 4-0 at home later Saturday but was still without the injured Cristiano Ronaldo. Real Madrid has 79 points to match Atletico, though trails through head-to-head record and has played a game more. A combination of inspired goalkeeping by backup Orestis Karnezis and Barcelona misses -- from the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta -- ensured a night of frustration for Tata Martino's men, who must pick themselves up in time for Wednesday's Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid. A headline on Barcelona's website Saturday proclaimed, 'The ball didn't want to go in.' Barcelona registered nearly 30 shots but only one player scored in the game: Yacine Brahimi in the 16th minute. Granada entered Saturday three points above the relegation zone. ""This is a step backwards,"" Iniesta told Canal Plus. ""Sometimes it's hard to find an explanation when you lose but we just couldn't get the goal. ""Teams like Granada who are playing for their La Liga survival live and die on chances like the one they scored but that was too much punishment for us. ""We tried everything we could to score. It hurts having taken this step backwards with so few matches left."" Surging Atletico visits third-last Getafe on Sunday, hoping to take three more points. Getafe has won once in the league since the end of November. Dortmund wins the German classic . After winning the league title in record time in late March, Bayern Munich lost its lengthy unbeaten streak, lost in the league for the first time this season and, some would say, struggled to eliminate Manchester United in the Champions League quarterfinals. Saturday saw another wobble, as Bayern Munich was soundly beaten by Borussia Dortmund 3-0 at home in Germany's biggest club game. For Dortmund, meanwhile, it was the perfect response to exiting in the Champions League this week to Real Madrid. Henrik Mkhitaryan -- guilty of a miss or two against Real Madrid in the second leg when another Dortmund goal would have forced extra time -- Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann scored for Dortmund. Bayern Munich ended the evening with 10 men after Rafinha was given a straight red for striking Mkhitaryan in the face in added time but worse news for Bayern was keeper Manuel Neuer's calf injury. He had to be substituted at halftime. Bayern and Dortmund are expected to meet again this season, in the German Cup finale.","After exiting in the Champions League quarterfinals, Barcelona loses in La Liga .

"(CNN) -- It's been more than three weeks since militants from the dreaded Boko Haram terrorist group dragged 276 girls out of their beds at a boarding school in northern Nigeria, and still no one knows where the girls are. International assistance has begun to flow into Nigeria, whose president has vowed to end the terror threat plaguing his country. Here's what you need to know to get caught up: . Where are the girls? It's anyone's guess. Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said in a video that he was going to sell them into slavery, but it's unknown whether he has. Pentagon spokesman U.S. Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby and other officials have said they believe the girls may have been separated into smaller groups, making the task of finding them inordinately more difficult. Gordon Brown, a former UK prime minister and the U.N.'s special envoy for global education, speculated that the girls may have been moved into neighboring countries. ""The search must be in Niger, Cameroon and Chad, to see if we can find information,"" he said. What's being done to find them? Nigeria hasn't given a lot of information about its efforts other than to say that its soldiers have been out in the field, looking for the girls. Nigerian police offered a $310,000 reward, but there's no evidence that has turned up any leads. The United States and Britain have sent advisers to help the Nigerian government find the girls, stage rescue missions and help in the larger fight to defeat Boko Haram. Has Nigeria done enough? Not by a long shot, according to many critics. Amnesty International came out Friday with a damning report accusing Nigerian officials of having warnings about the raid on the school in Chibok but failing to react. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been roundly criticized for waiting three weeks to speak to the nation on efforts to find and free the girls. And larger efforts to subdue Boko Haram have had little success since Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Nigeria's north one year ago this month. What is Boko Haram? Nigerian and U.S. officials call it a terrorist group dedicated to founding an Islamic state in Nigeria, which is divided between a largely Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. It has roots, however, in deep-seated animosity in northern Nigeria over poor governance and anger over economic inequality. Most of Nigeria's oil wealth is concentrated in the south. The group has been blamed for dozens of brutal attacks in Nigeria, including attacks on churches, schools and other targets. Last year, the group was blamed for an attack that killed more than 40 students at an agricultural college. In February, the group burned down a school in Yobe state, killing 29 boys. Last month, in addition to the school abductions, the group claimed responsibility for the bombing of an Abuja bus station that left dozens of people dead. And on Monday, Boko Haram fighters attacked a town that had been used as a staging ground for troops looking for the girls. At least 310 people were killed, some of them burned alive. Why did they do this? It's all in the group's name. Boko Haram translates to ""Western education is sin"" or ""forbidden."" The group has called for an end to all such education, especially for girls. In a video that surfaced this week, Shekau said girls shouldn't be in school. ""Women must go and marry,"" he said. What's going to happen to the girls if government forces don't find them? Shekau said he was going to sell them into slavery. ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell,"" he said in the video. Some experts aren't so sure they will be sold outright, but they could used as sex slaves for fighters, forced into marriages or traded for ransom. They may also be used as human shields in any military operation against Boko Haram, said Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria. Video purports to show abducted Nigerian girls .

"(CNN) -- With all the Facebook news lately -- the flat IPO, the regulatory interest, the Chan-Zuckerberg wedding -- it's highly possibly you've forgotten all about Twitter. If so, you'd be like most Americans. Only 8% of online Americans check their Twitter feeds on an average day, according to survey results released Thursday by the Pew Center for Internet & American Life. That's up from 2% in November 2010 and 5% in August, the group says, but it's nowhere near the numbers Pew tallies when it asks about online social networks in general. In February, the group asked Americans if they ""use social networking sites like Facebook, LinkedIn or Google Plus."" Sixty-six percent said yes. That's not an apples-to-apples comparison, since the questions were asked in different ways and since Pew didn't ask about just Facebook specifically. But it's fair to assume the vast majority of those respondents use Facebook, or Facebook in combination with some other social networks, said Aaron Smith, a senior research specialist at Pew. That means Facebook appears to be reaching a much broader chunk of the population. Perhaps confusingly, Twitter continues to make news for other reasons than popularity. The service was recently the basis for live question-answer-sessions with the U.S. president; it played a role in coordinating protests during the Arab Spring; and a Pakistani man inadvertently alerted the world to last year's raid that killed Osama bin Laden when he live tweeted it. It's also given consumers, including famous people such as director Kevin Smith, a way to complain about poor customer service. And it can create conversations between wildly different groups of people: Witness this exchange between Canadian rapper Drake and the billionaire oil tycoon T. Boone Pickens. A Forbes writer described the dichotomy -- that Twitter seems essential to some forms of communication but, apparently, isn't all that mainstream -- in this way: . ""Twitter is growing in all sorts of ways: in the number of tweets sent per day, in the ad revenue it's taking in, in the number of celebrities and brands using it in ways they quickly come to regret. But in terms of the overall proportion of the population engaging with the social messaging service, it might be in a bit of a lull."" User numbers also tell the story of Facebook's rise and Twitter's relative stagnation. Facebook says it has 901 million active users at this point, and the site is widely expected to cross the 1 billion mark this year. Twitter, meanwhile, says it has 140 million monthly active users. The site went through meteoric growth in its early years. But it's been six years since Twitter launched, and by some metrics that growth appears to have slowed. Unsurprisingly, a Twitter spokesperson saw things differently. ""Growth is extremely strong. We announced that we have more than 140 million active users in March. The previous number we shared was 100 million active users just last September,"" Carolyn Penner told CNN in an e-mail. ""To add to that, it took us 3 years, 2 months and 1 day to reach 1 billion Tweets. Now, we see more than 1 billion Tweets every 3 days."" In its survey, conducted in two chunks between January and April, Pew found that the percentage of online Americans who use Twitter has leveled off. Only 15% of online adults in February said they used Twitter -- and that's ""similar to"" the 13% who said they used the micro-blogging platform in May 2011, according to Pew's report. While the overall popularity of Twitter may be about the same, the subset of people who use Twitter frequently appears to be growing, according to the report. ""The proportion of online adults who use Twitter on a typical day has doubled since May 2011 and has quadrupled since late 2010,"" Pew writes. So it would appear that Twitter does matter quite a lot for some people. Smith, the Pew researcher, said in a phone interview that much of the growth in Twitter is driven by younger people who use the mobile Web or apps to access Twitter's services. It's part of the trend of ""constant access"" to data, which ""really pulls people more deeply into the (technological) tools they use,"" he said. And maybe that's the trend to underscore, rather than pitting social networks at each other. Some tech pundits argue Facebook and Twitter serve very different purposes -- with Twitter becoming more of a news feed and Facebook becoming an online hub for friendships. What do you think? Is Twitter falling behind? Or, at a time when the network is democratizing the spread of information, at least for some people, does Twitter still have an important role to play on the Internet? If you're part of the elite, Twitter-addicted 8%, we'll await your responses on Twitter. And if not, CNN Tech also has a Facebook page.","Pew survey finds 8% of American Internet users go on Twitter daily .

"(CNN) -- For one day a year, a desert outpost in the Persian Gulf becomes the center of the horse-racing universe. The Dubai World Cup is the richest horse race on the planet and features the world's finest thoroughbreds. Hosted at the futuristic Meydan Racecourse every March, upwards of 60,000 people pack the stands, have a flutter and cheer on the action below. The venue is now set to feature at the heart of a much bigger project in the lead up to the World Expo which will take place in the emirate in 2020. The plan is to build a high-end, mini-city around Meydan, stretching all the way to Dubai's nearby financial district and the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. Stage one of this complex process has seen the racecourse transformed into a year-round destination. First came the grandstand, a statement construction over one kilometer long that opened in 2010. The five-star Meydan Hotel was completed in the same year. Then followed an IMAX cinema, school, tennis center, school and golf course. ""(In) 2005 I came here ... there was no thought of Meydan or developments. It was just horse racing,"" said former CEO of Dubai Racing Club, Frank Gabriel. ""All of a sudden within six months we were building a master plan of a race track and a city and the next thing you know we never stopped moving."" With each addition, Meydan's purpose has extended beyond its equestrian origins. Stage two is by far the most ambitious element of the project and will feature the development of 1,500 villas over 16 million square meters (172 million sq ft). The vast housing site -- named Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum City after the ruler of Dubai -- will include parks, lagoons, waterways, jogging tracks, beaches and woodlands. The development aims to take the thoroughbred lifestyle Meydan seeks to embody and recreate it on a massive scale. ""Horse racing and equestrian is the heart and soul of Meydan,"" said Saeed Al Tayer, chairman of Meydan Group. ""That will always be in our pedigree. But developing a city ... it puts us on the global map."" Four to eight bedroom villas here will cost $6,200 per square meter ($579 per sq ft), that's more 40% above the Dubai average according to real estate consultancy CBRE. The next race at Meydan, it seems, will be finding the well-to-do residents and investors willing to pay these higher rates for the luxury mini-city experience.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Armed men clashed with Ukrainian border guards Saturday after a separatist leader was detained at a checkpoint. He was trying to re-enter the country from Russia, the Ukrainian Border Service said. The incident is the latest violent flare-up in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists staged a referendum on independence last weekend. Luhansk's self-declared ""people's governor"" Valeriy Bolotov -- who is wanted by Ukraine's Security Service -- was stopped at the Dovzhanskiy checkpoint, the border service statement said. Following his detention, about 200 armed men arrived at the checkpoint and demanded his release. The border guards tried to avoid bloodshed, but after an altercation, shots were fired. In the ensuing armed assault on the checkpoint, ""the attackers"" were able to take back Bolotov, the statement said. The were no casualties in the incident, separatist spokesman Vasiliy Nikitin said. The fight involved about 150 fighters on each side, he said. Bolotov had gone to Russia for medical treatment after being wounded on Tuesday. Tensions remain high across the country's east, with just over a week to go before May 25 presidential elections. Separatist groups have declared ""people's republics"" in both Luhansk and Donetsk. Neither the West nor the interim government in Kiev consider the two regions' referendum on independence as legitimate. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. government rejects Denis Pushilin, the self-declared leader of the Donetsk People's Republic, who asserted earlier this week that his region is not only independent, but also will ask to join Russia . ""These pro-Russia separatists have never been elected and do not represent the people of the region,"" Psaki said Saturday. ""... Any decisions made about Ukraine must be taken by those with lawful authority, representing the citizens of Ukraine as a whole, and not under threat of foreign military intervention."" Separatist leader: Donetsk region asking to join Russia . Russia slams Kiev military operation . Russia's Foreign Ministry called Saturday for an end to what the Kiev government describes as an anti-terrorist operation against the separatists -- and questioned whether it was possible to hold elections given the militarized situation. In its statement, the ministry accused Ukrainian troops backed by aircraft of trying to storm the town of Slovyansk and of using heavy artillery to shell ""civilian installations."" ""Such punitive action against its own citizens shows the hypocrisy of the Kiev authorities,"" the statement said, referring to an international pact agreed to last month which called for an end to violence. Ukraine's official news agency Ukrinform cited the nation's Defense Ministry Saturday as saying that Ukrainian forces continue to ""fully control"" the situation around Slovyansk, a stronghold of pro-Russia militants. The militants have put up 27 barricades around the town, where they still hold a number of public buildings, the Defense Ministry is quoted as saying. Report: Human rights worsening . A U.N. report released Friday shows an ""alarming deterioration"" of human rights in eastern Ukraine, said the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay. The report paints a troubling picture, citing cases of targeted killings, torture, beatings, abductions and sexual harassment, as well as intimidation of the media. It also highlighted serious problems in Crimea, Ukraine's Black Sea peninsula that was annexed by Russia in March, particularly for the minority ethnic Tatar population. Russia's Foreign Ministry dismissed the findings of the U.N. report, saying it showed a ""complete lack of objectivity, total inconsistencies and double standards."" Kiev and the West have condemned the annexation of Crimea and accuse Moscow of backing the pro-Russia militants in Ukraine's east. Moscow blames the unrest in Ukraine on far-right ultranationalist groups. Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.

"(CNN) -- Marc Marquez raced to his third straight pole position of the 2014 MotoGP World Championship at the Termas de Rio Honda circuit in Argentina on Saturday. The Repsol Honda rider produced a lap of one minute, 37.683s, trumping Yamaha's two-time MotoGP champion, Jorge Lorenzo, by 0.742 seconds. Marquez will now look to maintain his 100% record in the full race on Sunday after winning the first two meets of the season in Doha and Austin. ""Today I really felt good on the bike and I am happy to have taken pole position,"" a smiling Marquez told the MotoGP website. ""In the morning and in FP4, we worked a lot with the used tire and this afternoon we obviously focused on qualifying. I put in a very good lap and I am happy,"" he added. The Spaniard, who was also the quickest in all of the practice sessions, was the only rider to break the 1.37s barrier all day. Lorenzo improved significantly in the final stages of qualifying but his best lap of one minute, 38.651 seconds was only enough to qualify in second place. Marquez's Honda teammate, Dani Pedrosa, finished 0.226 seconds back on Lorezo to pick up the final place on the front row. The second row will contain Pol Espargaro of Yamaha, Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso and nine-time champion Valentino Rossi, also of Yamaha.

"(WIRED) -- The Obama administration said over the weekend that it would not support legislation mandating changes to Internet infrastructure to fight online copyright and trademark infringement. ""Proposed laws must not tamper with the technical architecture of the Internet through manipulation of the Domain Name System (DNS), a foundation of Internet security,"" the administration said in a statement on Saturday. ""Our analysis of the DNS filtering provisions in some proposed legislation suggests that they pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online. We must avoid legislation that drives users to dangerous, unreliable DNS servers and puts next-generation security policies, such as the deployment of DNSSEC, at risk."" The announcement follows a whirlwind week in which leaders in the House and Senate, apparently buckling to widespread pressure, announced they would at least temporarily remove DNS-redirecting requirements in the Protect IP Act in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House. The White House move likely signals that Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vermont) and House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) would not likely re-introduce the Domain Name System redirecting provisions in their bills. The DNS-redirecting provisions in both bills were designed to prevent American citizens from visiting sites the attorney general maintains are dedicated to infringing activities. The Obama administration's announcement appears to have conceded to opposition from security experts who say the plan would sabotage U.S. government-approved efforts to secure DNS against hackers and break the Internet's unified naming system by introducing lies into infrastructure. The government is agreeing with experts who maintain that the SOPA and PIPA and the Senate's Protect IP Act would break the Internet's universal character and hamper U.S. government-supported efforts to roll out DNSSEC, which is intended to prevent hackers from hijacking the net through fake DNS entries. However, both bills essentially grant the government the authority to bring lawsuits against so-called rogue websites and obtain court orders requiring search engines like Google to stop displaying links to them. They would allow rights holders to seek court orders instructing online ad services and credit card companies from partnering with the infringing sites. The administration's announcement was unclear on whether it would support those provisions. The White House announcement was penned by Victoria Espinel, the White House copyright czar; Aneesh Chopra U.S. chief technology officer; and Howard Schmidt, special assistant to the president for cybersecurity. David Hirschmann, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce president, urged lawmakers to move forward on the bills without the DNS provisions, saying it was ""much needed legislation."" Sherwin Siy, deputy legal director of digital rights group, Public Knowledge, said the White House statement underscored that the Obama administration has concluded that the legislation ""poses real risks to the security and stability of the internet."" Rep. Darrell Issa (R-California) was scheduled to conduct a hearing Wednesday on the cybersecurity issue before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Issa, the committee's chairman, has called prominent internet security experts and others to testify about the security ramifications of DNS redirecting. But in response to the White House announcement, that hearing has been tentatively postponed. Among those summoned by Issa was Stewart Baker, a former Bush administration Department of Homeland Security policy director, who has said tinkering with the Domain Name System ""would do great damage to Internet security.""

"(CNN) -- This week the U.S. president will visit Brussels for the first time. Quite why he has left it to his second term to make the trip baffles many in the EU's halls of power. And there's no denying it paints a decidedly underwhelming picture of today's trans-Atlantic relationship at a time when Russia's aggression in the east requires it to be strong. Born from the ashes of the second world war, Europe's alliance with the United States has been a major force for global peace and prosperity, conquering cold wars and fighting for common values. Yet amid allegations of America spying on its friends and Europe's ensuing grudge, it's time to redefine those ties so that both parties can move on to the next stage. Like a marriage in which the kids have long flown the nest, the EU and the U.S. have drifted apart. Europe's countries have crept closer together, pooling their commercial might into one free trade and legislative bloc, just as Washington has entered a new isolationist era. Mistrust has crept in. Younger, burgeoning emerging economies have tempted the roving eve and, though it's not yet time to call in the divorce lawyers, a reality check is long overdue. So what better excuse to take stock than a comparatively new initiative called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or T-TIP for short, the biggest free trade pact in history and the cornerstone of a new economic age. Let's face it, trade in itself is not a sexy subject. But if politicians were to let the money do the talking for once, their electorates would sit up and listen. And a few years from now, the pros and cons of increased globalization will yet again make their way higher up the political agenda; for better or worse. The T-TIP is ambitious. Perhaps a little too ambitious, you could argue, with the goal of creating an open market for the region's 700 million potential consumers. A move which economists reckon could add about half a percent of growth to both economies by 2027. Yet any deal will require endless negotiations, consultations with huge swathes of industry, hours clocked up in red-eye flights and much late-night quibbling over health and safety and agricultural trading directives among a myriad other issues. Eurocrats will be sorely disappointed if Barack Obama does not set a clear agenda on this topic in his address. EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told me at a gathering organized by the German Marshall Fund that any trade deal worth having would have to be ""ambitious."" Still, as various rounds of failed WTO negotiations have taught us, there is no use in putting too many issues on the table or nothing will be achieved. To see the light of day, the pact will have to accomplish three broad things. First governments will have to sell the concept to their people and convince them of its economic benefits. Research conducted by the European Commission estimates an open trans-Atlantic area could add 214 billion euros in extra growth for both parties. Secondly the partnership affords both sides an opportunity to tackle superfluous red tape, harmonizing existing rules and regulations, providing a new framework for drafting future legislation. Where the T-TIP pact will really make a difference is on its third goal: investment. Both economies currently enjoy $4 trillion of such money flows, supporting 7 million jobs. If the free trade zone were to give business leaders the confidence to see a clearer, less bureaucratic trade climate, such figures would multiply fast. So that's the theory but what about the practicalities? Smashing subsidies, eliminating other non-tariff and tariff barriers to trade will be unpopular, especially with so called special interest sectors like chemicals and cars, each deploying their formidable trade lobbies at each twist and turn. To be effective any new rules will also have to govern new, complex and intangible commodities, like data, and balance Europe's hunt for new energy providers with America's desire to keep its oil surplus to itself. The initial stages of the free trade zone are unlikely to be passed until after the U.S. midterm elections. Even then, selling the concept to an increasingly protectionist congress will be tricky. And all the while, the European Parliament is coming up for its own vote in May, further delaying the T-TIP timeframe. Yet the opportunity cost to the world's most influential alliance of not formalizing its lucrative partnership at a time when other deals are being struck elsewhere would leave both sides wrong-footed. The trans-Atlantic relationship needs a new purpose. Although the two may not exactly be celebrating their diamond anniversary, it's time to renew those vows and start thinking about the putting something extra in the pension fund. And where better to start than with more trade. Read more from Nina dos Santos: . Russia sanctions: EU should leave trade alone .

"(Parenting.com) -- My mother gave birth to my older brother in a hospital in Malawi in rural East Africa, where she and my dad were in the Peace Corps. Then she ran herself a hot bath and shared a bowl of curry with her neighbor. When she had me, two and a half years later, she chose a freestanding birthing center, 45 minutes from our house in upstate New York, where I popped out after two hours of labor and only a couple of pushes. She went home a few hours later. Both of these birth experiences, she always said, were joyous, easy and free of angst -- there was no medical establishment pressuring her to give birth in a particular way, or in a particular time frame. So when she started hearing about how most people give birth in America today -- the C-section rate is around 34% and medical interventions are practically par for the course -- she thought perhaps America had lost sight of the best ways to have babies. Surely, she thought, other countries and cultures know better how to handle this most basic human experience. ""I assumed there would be a better model in the developing world, based on my experience in Malawi,"" my mother, Helaine Selin, told me, ""a more humane and mother-friendly way of giving birth."" She set out to find how women give birth in the non-Western world, which culminated in a book she edited called ""Childbirth Across Cultures: Ideas and Practices of Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Postpartum."" What she discovered deeply surprised her ... and not necessarily in a good way. Parenting: 12-year-old gives birth on field trip . Many cultures and countries had either replicated the American way of birth -- we have exported the C-section model to many remote regions -- or they have clung to traditional methods that are, at best, disrespectful of women; at worst, the methods are downright dangerous. All around the world, she found, childbirth is a battlefield, and women have to fight everyone from surgeons to mothers-in-law for control over their bodies and their births. Traditional childbirth: womanly ways aren't always safe . Some 536,000 maternal deaths occur each year, 99% of them in developing countries. Childbirth in countries that haven't modernized the birth experience is still very much women's work, attended mostly by women who aren't always trained in modern methods of hygiene. While the camaraderie of women in childbirth is commendable, even enviable, childbirth in these places can be oppressive, and many mothers are denied choices, or even harassed, during labor. Nepalese women, for instance, are sometimes pressured to push the baby out before their bodies are ready. Hmong women must give birth alone, without expressing any pain or discomfort, as do women in Nigeria; one in 18 die during the process. Tibetan women often give birth in animal pens. If Bangladeshi women give birth in a hospital, they're often berated by the staff and prevented from reciting religious verses that they traditionally use as a source of comfort and pain management. Women in Uganda and Bangladesh are looked down upon for expressing the pain of childbirth, which usually happens at home. Korean women are discouraged from getting pain medication but often have episiotomies forced on them. Few developing countries have health insurance that covers the cost of childbirth; even if a poor woman wanted a safe birth in a medical facility, she probably couldn't afford it, or even the cost of transportation to get there. The book reveals that in countries without good health insurance and without good medical facilities, hospital birth is not necessarily any safer than home birth; both arenas leave much to be desired. Parenting: 9 things you should never say to your child . The American way of birth: C-sections as status births . While traditional childbirth in many cultures left much to be desired, my mother was just as surprised to find a second trend. Many cultures that had unique and non-medical approaches to birth even five or 10 years ago have replicated American-style births. ""The American way of birth is spreading around the world the way blue jeans and Coca-Cola have,"" she writes. In more developed parts of Asia, especially, the tradition of home birth -- attended by midwives and relatives -- has either disappeared or is only engaged in by the poorest and most rural of women. Almost all women in China, Japan and Korea now give birth in hospitals. In the more urbane parts of China, C-sections are considered highly desirable, a sign of status and wealth; some hospitals have C-section rates as high as 90%. The end of joy in childbirth? Many wouldn't consider this an inherent problem. After all, along with the exportation of American biotechnological birth, and the rise of C-sections, we've seen dramatic decreases in infant and maternal mortality rates. That's probably not because of C-sections -- infant mortality rates from voluntary C-sections are higher than they are for vaginal births -- but because of improved health care and international strides to improve the safety of childbirth around the world. The problem, as my mother sees it, is that making childbirth a medical experience detracts from it as an emotional experience. ""We have given up the ecstasy of childbirth for a sterile, safe, vacant experience,"" she writes. The joy is gone, and replaced with technology. Parenting: Totally ridiculous baby products . War of the births . Women who have had C-sections might argue with her: mothers love their babies no matter how they gave birth to them, and what matters more than an ecstatic childbirth is a healthy child. What might be more serious is the lack of safe conditions in non-Western countries, and the lack of choice. Even with vast improvements in education of traditional birth attendants, and expansion of medical services to rural areas, childbirth is still very much a war all over the world. No matter how you give birth, or where, my mother's book reveals that in almost every culture, people are struggling for dominion over an experience that is almost impossible to control. Wanting that control is understandable, of course, especially when childbirth has been, historically, one of the most dangerous experiences a woman could have. The best births: choices in childbirth . This isn't to say that there aren't exceptions to the rules, or that there aren't countries and cultures where childbirth is both safe and celebrated. The best places to give birth are those where attendants honor the pain and help women through it, giving them the opportunity to have the kind of birth they want. The Navajos have a beautiful, if rare, tradition of home birth, where the mother and father labor together while a traditional healer performs blessings. Western Europe tends to have lower C-section rates and higher breastfeeding rates, and childbirth is usually attended by a midwife -- doctors are called in only if there are true medical complications. Hospitals are mother-friendly, with labor lounges and room for family to aid the mother as she progresses. Where does my mother recommend giving birth? Your best bet, she says, is Sweden, which has homey hospitals, midwife attendants and happy mothers. In Sweden, she says, ""they try not to treat childbirth like a disease.""

Let's just say that Manson -- one of the most vilified entertainers in history, who has been accused of everything from causing the Columbine school massacre to being the devil incarnate -- has a lot to say on the subject. ""Growing up going to Christian school and the concept that you're born a sinner and you don't really have a choice to change who you are has been hammered into my head and created the entire reason why I made art and made a band and made records called 'Antichrist Superstar,'"" he explained. ""In any story, the villain is the catalyst. The hero's not a person who will bend the rules or show the cracks in his armor. He's one-dimensional intentionally, but the villain is the person who owns up to what he is and stands by it. He'll do the things that are sometimes morally questionable, but he does it because it's his nature to do it and it doesn't fluctuate. It's the fable of the frog and the scorpion, all those stories that just say, whatever you're going to be, stick to it in confidence. Don't waver or life will f*** you over."" After sluggish sales, tepid reviews and simultaneous accusations of being too shocking and not shocking enough, Manson said he ""fell into a confusing state where I didn't want to be who I was. I needed to be the person I'm going to be, the person I should be. I had to accept that this is what I am. And it took me the humility to say I have to make a comeback."" ""On the last two records [""Eat Me, Drink Me"" and ""The High End of Low""], I think I started to write songs to make people feel like I was feeling rather than to make them feel something. And I was feeling like s***, so that was a really stupid thing to do,"" he said. And though he doesn't address it outright, that dark period coincides with Manson's protracted breakup with ex-fiancÃ©e Evan Rachel Wood. ""Of course, I'm a person,"" he said. ""Anyone's personal relationships will affect what they do, but when I listen to Bowie, I'm not thinking about what he was going through in his personal life; I just listen to it and am affected by it in whatever way. That's what music should do."" ""Born Villain"" is the eighth studio album by the inveterate provocateur, but Manson said he's dropped any expectation of people knowing his oeuvre until this point. ""I went into recording this with the idea and common sense that people know who I am for many different reasons: Columbine, music, publicity, celebrity bulls***. I had to realize that that does not equal who I am and simply had to make something that said this is what I am."" While writing for the album, he found recurring themes of guns and flowers emerging in his lyrics. ""I don't know where all this came from essentially. Maybe it's because my dad was in Vietnam,"" he said, ""and there's an iconic image of the flower being put into the rifle."" And, much like with his own stage name, Manson has a flair for combining seemingly incompatible references to yield something greater than the sum of their parts. He was inspired by Charles Baudelaire's debauched poetry collection to create the track, ""The Flowers of Evil"" and he named another song ""Pistol Whipped,"" because ""a pistil is obviously the female part of the flower and I think that this record and everything on it is an implied threat."" Manson also drew upon other subversive works like Federico Fellini's ""Never Bet the Devil Your Head,"" (itself an allusion to an Edgar Allan Poe story) and ""Macbeth,"" (both William Shakespeare's and Roman Polanski's) because ""there's always witches around,"" Manson cautions. ""Many, many witches. And I don't mean women simply. But, mostly."" The song ""Overneath the Path of Misery"" opens with a quivering recitation of the play's famous soliloquy: . ""And all our yesterdays have lighted fools . ""The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! ""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player . ""That struts and frets his hour upon the stage . ""And then is heard no more: it is a tale . ""Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, . ""Signifying nothing."" ""That quote can be taken as, woe is me, my life is s***, I give up,"" Manson said. ""When Macbeth said it, it was a resignation. But I read it differently. I started thinking it was empowering. For me, it was a resurrection."" Indeed, ""Born Villain"" is Manson's return to form: A hard-rocking album, brimming with rich imagery, visceral blowback and the glamour-meets-gutter eroticism that his best work evokes. ""If you like it, that's great,"" he said. ""That's what I want. But it's not about my ego in that sense. Living in Hollywood, it's easy to have someone flatter you. That doesn't help me. In fact, it makes me furious that people reduce my intelligence to think that simply complimenting me, for example, on what I said in ""Bowling for Columbine"" makes me more intelligent than they thought I was. I have to restrain myself and realize that they're not trying to insult me, but it insults me that I need to do something that's more powerful than a simple quote in a movie that I didn't create."" ""I appreciate the window it opened up,"" he continued, ""but I don't think it's a great movie because it didn't answer a lot of questions in a period of my life and an event that affected my life so much. I have 36 school shootings under my belt -- I didn't do the shooting part -- but I had to realize that I can't be lazy or ignorant enough to think that just because I went through all this, people should be expected to like what I make."" In fact, Manson said he didn't record this album with the approval of his fans or critics in mind at all. Rather, he said his biggest goal was to prove to his close friends and family that they were right for believing in him. ""People like you for reasons. There's no reason to change what you are, but if you're not being you, then you need to acknowledge that. And it didn't take psychology or sobriety or anything that rhymes with a Y at the end for me to realize it."" So, what did cause the shift? ""I just applied what I do when I go to a dinner party,"" he said. ""I'm completely the person you think would be the most offensive, but I end up being the person that a lot of people listen to. I like to make people think differently than they did before I walked in the room."" While getting here may not have been easy for him, Manson said he will remember recording ""Born Villain"" more than any of his other albums both because he enjoyed the process and is proud of the result. ""I'm supposed to do this interview with you and say, 'Oh I love my new f***ing record. It's great, it's better than all the other ones.' It's not. I know it is, but I'm not saying that it's better than the other ones,"" Manson said. ""I'm saying that I'm better than I was and that's the whole thing."" ""If I were to go on Match.com and I was doing some sort of, oh, would you like to know me? situation, this record would represent me,"" he mused. ""Now, would I get eights from it? I don't know. But this is me and I'm not doubting that for a second. I think the most attractive thing in life is seeing someone that's confident just peacocking."" And what better way to celebrate that than to include a cheeky rendition of Carly Simon's ""You're So Vain"" as a bonus track on the album? The song features Manson's pal -- and fellow musician -- Johnny Depp on drums and guitar. ""We started jamming -- I don't even like to use that word because I think it sounds too musical and I consider myself to be more of a problem-maker than a musician. We ended up thinking, what could we do that would be really amusing to both of us because of what people think about us? 'You're So Vain' really says it all.""","Marilyn Manson's new album ""Born Villain"" comes out on May 1 .

"(CNN) -- Less than two weeks after he partied with classmates in a college dorm, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev now lives in drastically different surroundings. The 19-year-old Boston Marathon bombing suspect is locked inside a 10-by-10-foot cell with a steel door, a slot for food and an observation window, a prison spokesman said Sunday. Tsarnaev is able to speak and has been interacting with staff at the Federal Medical Center Devens, spokesman John Colautti said. Medical professionals at the prison medical facility, which currently houses 1,044 inmates, are making regular rounds to check on Tsarnaev, Colautti said, and Tsarnaev has spoken with staff there about managing his health. The spokesman said he could not comment on whether Tsarnaev was speaking with investigators. He referred questions on Tsarnaev's medical condition to the FBI, saying the facility does not assign medical condition rankings like civilian hospitals. Tsarnaev is in an area of the facility where there's extra security, he said. On Friday, authorities said Tsarnaev had been transferred from Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to the prison facility, which is about 40 miles west of the city. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction for his alleged role in the April 15 bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the marathon's finish line. Tsarnaev was captured April 19 after a nearly 24-hour manhunt. His brother, Tamerlan, died after a gun battle with police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had what appeared to be gunshot wounds to his head, neck, legs and hand when he was captured, according to the criminal complaint accusing him in the marathon blasts. Tsarnaev has been less talkative since authorities read him his Miranda rights three days after his capture. But the information the teenager gave investigators in two sessions of questioning has produced good leads, a U.S. law enforcement official said. FBI: Search of dump tied to suspect ends . Since the pair of blasts turned celebratory cheers into screams of horror at the Boston Marathon's finish line, investigators have kept working -- interviewing people and searching for evidence, even when it meant sifting through trash -- to find out why. One of the most recent focuses of the probe was a landfill in New Bedford, Massachusetts, adjacent to the town where Tsarnaev attended school at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Authorities finished combing the dump for clues that may shed light on the bloody attack on Friday, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, who wouldn't say whether they found anything. A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation had said investigators were looking for Tsarnaev's laptop computer. Tsarnaev led authorities to look there, the source said, and others who may have knowledge of the computer's whereabouts or may have played a role in disposing of it also provided leads that prompted the search. Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said the investigation remains open, with interviews and the search for evidence continuing. Officials: 2011 wiretap reveals talk of jihad . In the past few days, Russian authorities turned over an intercepted conversation from 2011 between one of the Tsarnaev brothers in the United States and their mother in Dagestan, Russia, according to an official with knowledge of the investigation. The wiretapped communication discussed jihad, but the conversation was vague, according to two U.S. officials. It's unclear why the Russians were eavesdropping on the mother or for how long. One of the officials declined to say whether that wiretap information could have made a difference in ultimately uncovering a future attack on the United States. Tom Fuentes, a CNN contributor and former FBI assistant director, said the FBI would have found that information helpful when the Russians asked U.S. investigators to look into Tamerlan Tsarnaev for a possible shift toward increasing Islamic extremism in 2011. Family in Russia . The brothers' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, said Friday that she and her husband had left their home in Dagestan for another part of Russia. Their father, Anzor Tsarnaev, had said he'd planned to travel to the United States, but that trip has been delayed indefinitely for health reasons. The mother has said she will not return to the United States, where she is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. The family lived in Massachusetts before Zubeidat Tsarnaev jumped bail after her arrest on the charges in 2012. The parents moved to Dagestan, a semiautonomous republic in southern Russia that year. Zubeidat Tsarnaev has denied the reality of the bombing. She believes it was fake. She said she has seen a video pushing the wild idea, and that there was no blood, that paint was used instead. Botched hijacking thwarts plans to head to New York . Three days after the marathon attack, and hours after authorities released images of the two suspects, they spontaneously decided to go to New York's Times Square to blow up their six remaining explosives, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators. But a botched carjacking spoiled the impromptu road trip, said Tsarnaev, whose account was outlined by New York's police commissioner. Before forcing their way into a vehicle the night of April 18, the brothers fatally shot a campus police officer at MIT, police said. The vehicle they subsequently hijacked, a Mercedes sport utility vehicle, ran low on fuel, and they stopped at a service station, where the vehicle's owner escaped. Shortly thereafter, police picked up the trail of the SUV and pursued it. Authorities say the men threw bombs out the vehicle's window at them. The gun battle and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's death followed. CNN's Tim Lister, Ben Brumfield, Ashleigh Banfield, Paula Newton, Drew Griffin, Dave Alsup, Carol Cratty, Brian Todd and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is inside a 10-by-10-foot cell with a steel door and a slot for food .

"(CNN) -- Afghanistan's president is speeding up the transfer of the U.S.-run prison at Bagram to Afghan control within a month after hearing a report citing problems at the facility, including human rights issues. President Hamid Karzai on Thursday assigned a commission to conduct the move. He made the decision after a briefing about the facility and the condition of its prisoners from the head of the country's Constitutional Oversight Commission, Gul Rahman Qazi. The commission is made up of top Afghan officials, including the defense, justice and interior ministers. ""The report details many cases of violations of the Afghan Constitution and other applicable laws of the country, the relevant international conventions and human rights,"" the president's office said. A transfer has been planned for a while, and this effort is being made as the United States pledges to hand over more authority to the Afghans in the coming months and years. The original detention facility had been the Bagram Theater Internment Facility at Bagram Air Base. It has been replaced by a nearby prison built in late 2009 called the Detention Facility in Parwan, named for the province. Both facilities have been called Bagram prison. ""The United States has repeatedly made clear we are committed to working with the Afghan government to complete a joint plan for transition of detention operations in Afghanistan,"" said Gavin Sundwall, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. ""We will continue to work with the Afghan government to meet this objective."" Sundwall said he believed the announcement referred to Parwan but added that the embassy only had the palace statement to refer to and had not been given a copy of the commission's report mentioned in the presidential news release. ""We take seriously and investigate all allegations of detainee abuse. The United States respects the human rights of detainees at the Detention Facility in Parwan. Any specific allegations of detainee abuse should be addressed to ISAF,"" NATO's International Security Assistance Force. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States has been working with the Afghan government ""on appropriate timing and pace for transfer of the detention facilities."" ""We're going to continue to work with the Afghan government to implement the transition -- that we have both agreed needs to happen -- of detention operations in Afghanistan. We need to do this in a manner that is maximally responsible,"" she said. Karzai's decision also comes amid tensions between the United States and Afghanistan over the announcement of a Taliban office in Qatar. Karzai withdrew his ambassador from Qatar last month, apparently unhappy that his Western allies -- and principally the United States -- were forging a channel for talks with the Taliban without his approval. The United States invaded Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban after the al Qaeda terror network attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. The Taliban had ruled Afghanistan since 1996. Human rights activists have criticized detention practices at the Bagram facilities over the years. Last year, Human Rights First said the detainees ""are, in fact, afforded far fewer rights than are those at Guantanamo, who have the right to challenge their detention in a U.S. court and to representation by a lawyer."" ""Some detainees at Bagram have been imprisoned for eight years or more without charge or trial, based largely on evidence they have never seen and with no meaningful opportunity to defend themselves,"" a report from the group said in May. A U.S. Forces in Afghanistan fact sheet issued in October said the Detention Facility in Parwan ""enables security, transparency and rule of law in Afghanistan both now and when the facility is transferred to the Afghan government. The design of the DFIP allows for safe, humane and effective management of the detainee population."" CNN's Nick Paton-Walsh contributed to this report.","Detention facility in Parwan, Afghanistan, was built in late 2009 .

"Xenia, Ohio (CNN) -- Karen Shirk has spent 15 years matching people with service dogs that can help them with their special needs and disabilities. With the help of her staff, she puts a lot of thought into the process to make sure each person has the right dog for them. But one recent story -- involving an Afghanistan war veteran and a German shepherd named Gabriel -- has her convinced that larger forces are sometimes at work. It began in March, when Shirk got an e-mail from U.S. Army Sgt. Derek McConnell. McConnell had lost both his legs in an IED explosion, and he was desperate for a service dog while he recovered at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington. Shirk knew Gabriel, a dog they were training at the time, would be perfect for him. ""I sent him a picture of Gabriel and said, 'How would you like this dog?' "" Shirk said. ""He was so excited. ... He would text me every day."" She understood that McConnell was eager for the companionship of a service dog and the independence that it could provide. ""Soldiers, they're not wanting people to do things for them,"" said Shirk, who was honored as a CNN Hero for her work with autistic and special-needs children. ""If you have to ask (someone) all the time to pick things up that you drop or 'Bring me my wheelchair,' they have to depend on somebody else. ... Giving them a service dog is giving them back a means of doing it themselves."" Shirk and McConnell grew to be friends, and she was struck by his generosity. Although Shirk was going to give him his dog for free, she asks civilians to contribute to help offset their dog's training costs. So McConnell had started planning ways to help raise money. Then, one day, Shirk didn't hear from him. ""I went to his Facebook page, and this first post that I saw said, 'You were the most wonderful young man,' "" she said. ""And I'm like, ""Were?' "" Shirk was devastated to learn that McConnell had passed away from complications related to his injuries the previous night. But she soon decided that the best way she could honor him was to place Gabriel with another disabled soldier. She reached out to someone she knew in the military and asked for help. ""I said, 'Find me another Derek!'"" she recalled. Within days, Lisa Murphy heard about the dog at the Yellow Ribbon Fund, a Maryland-based charity that helps injured service members recover. ""Someone basically made her aware that this group was looking for a soldier amputee to connect with a service dog,"" said Lisa's husband, U.S. Army Capt. Jake Murphy. ""I was looking for a dog myself, so Lisa kind of jumped on it."" Murphy, like McConnell, had lost both his legs in Afghanistan. But Shirk soon discovered that they had much more in common. She found out they had served in the same unit and been injured on the same day. In fact, McConnell had actually helped with Murphy's medical evacuation, just hours before suffering his own injuries. Both had also recovered at Walter Reed and become friendly during therapy together. Shirk was floored by the coincidence, as she had gotten in touch with both men through completely separate channels. ""It's like a once-in-a-lifetime story that you hear,"" she said. ""I just think it was meant to be."" Murphy recognizes that it's an unusual coincidence, but he doesn't think of it in quite the same way. ""If it was fate, then Derek was meant to die, so I don't really like to think of that,"" he said. ""But if Derek can't be here, it's almost fitting that I get Gabriel as my service dog. ""There's a connection between him and myself. ... Derek will always be in my thoughts."" Shirk said the episode has renewed her desire to work with veterans. ""Derek and Jake lost their independence, giving independence to others. ... Those veterans, that was who I wanted to help,"" she said. ""I'm hoping more of these wounded soldiers will come to us looking for dogs. ""We are ready. They can all come, and we will help them."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2013 CNN Heroes .","Karen Shirk, a 2008 CNN Hero, finds service dogs for people in need .

"(CNN) -- At least 10 people were killed and more than 100 wounded following a pair of bombings Saturday in the southern Thai city of Yala, Thai media reported. The two blasts were the result of bombs stashed in stolen trucks, Police Lt. Gen. Paitoon Chuchaiya told CNN affiliate MCOT. Video from the scene showed damage to buildings, cars and motorcycles on the street. The blasts set fires to nearby vehicles, including a van, which itself exploded, leading to initial reports of a third bomb, Chuchaiya said. Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said she has been informed of the Yala bombings and has instructed national police chief Gen. Prewpan Dhamapong to investigate the crime scene immediately, according to MCOT. Police investigators believe suspected insurgents are behind the attacks, MCOT said. Last month, a series of bombs detonated in Bangkok. No one was killed in those blasts, and an Iranian suspect was arrested in connection with the incident.","Police: Two apparent car bombs exploded in the city of Yala .

"(CNN) -- U.S. authorities Tuesday arrested a Roman Catholic priest in Puerto Rico on charges he sexually abused an altar boy. U.S. Homeland Security agents arrested Israel Berrios Berrios, 58, at his residence in the Puerto Rican town of Naranjito. The Caribbean island of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory. ICE press release on arrest . At a press conference after the arrest, Angel Melendez, a Puerto Rico-based special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, part of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, alleged that Berrios was able to sexually abuse the minor after gaining the trust of the boy's mother over several years. By 2008, Berrios ""was already considered part of (the alleged victim's) family,"" Melendez said. ""He convinced the (alleged victim's) mother to give the young man permission to go on a cruise to the Bahamas,"" on which Berrios shared a cabin with the boy, Melendez said. According to the federal indictment obtained by CNN, Berrios used a car connected to the local San Jose parish to transport the alleged victim knowing the young man ""would engage in a commercial sex act."" The indictment includes four charges: two counts of sex trafficking of children and another two counts of transportation of a minor with intent to engage in prostitution and criminal sexual activity. Two of the charges stem from the alleged trip to Bahamas. Agent Melendez also said the alleged abuse happened in 2007, when the alleged victim was 14 years old. The minor was serving as altar boy at San Jose's Church in the Puerto Rican town of Aibonito. Berrios was the parish priest and also a director at a Catholic school there. As he was led by federal agents into a detention center in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico, Berrios told a reporter from WAPA, a CNN affiliate, that his conscience is clear. ""I'm very much at peace. Our Lord Jesus lived moments like this and I believe that even though my hands and feet are shackled, there are other people who are prisoners of their own conscience. That's what I can tell you,"" Berrios said. Monsignor Ruben Gonzalez, bishop of the Caguas Diocese, suspended Berrios last year when the allegations first surfaced, but the priest has yet to be expelled. ""I confronted the facts and called the priest and asked him if it was true what was being said. He admitted it and asked for forgiveness for the situation,"" Gonzalez said. This is the first time U.S. federal authorities have prosecuted a priest in a pedophilia case in Puerto Rico. Gonzalez said he fears there are other victims. ""It might be entirely possible that now that the name of this priest has been made public other people will step forward. I urge them, with humility, if there are other victims, to speak up,"" Gonzalez said. If convicted, Berrios faces 10 years to life in prison.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- My name is Lauren Johnson. I'm an associate producer at CNN, and I have systemic lupus erythematosus. It's an autoimmune disease where the body's immune system becomes hyperactive and attacks healthy tissue. It can cause damage to many parts of body such as joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, blood vessels and the brain. Lupus is one of the most complicated and cruelest autoimmune diseases. Simply put: It's difficult to diagnose, hard to live with and challenging to treat. If I could write a letter to lupus, I would say ""I want me back, I've had enough."" As a junior at Kent State University, I felt like I was on top of the world. I went to a great school, I was doing exactly what I love (journalism), and then on September 11, 2001, I began to get unexplained illnesses one after another. Eventually, I landed in a hospital bed with an IV pumping a cocktail of drugs meant to cure ""a series of infections"" ravaging my body. When I finally felt reasonable enough to go to class, I couldn't remember things. My essays, as one professor told me, suddenly ""read like ramblings."" I wasn't me. That semester, I ended up taking incompletes in all of my classes. My doctors and professors declared I was overwhelmed with catching up in my classes and the anxiety of it all consumed me. Little did I know that it would be a decade later before I would officially find out it was really systemic lupus erythematosus. My diagnosis came as I was entering what I considered the magical part of my life. I had married, had a beautiful daughter and was working my dream job (CNN) and finally felt like I was walking in my purpose. I began to have horrific migraines, excruciating nerve pain down my left arm, and bruises and rashes started to appear more and more often. Initially, I thought I was just tired and it was the allergies and the bruises. I simply attributed it to being anemic. This was until my esophagus began to feel as if it was closing up. I went to a physician, and he said I had a tumor on the shoulder and that must be causing everything I was feeling. When I went to the surgical oncologist, she said ""it's not cancer"" and referred me to an amazing internist. I had already gone through the gamut of diagnoses: leukemia, thoracic outlet syndrome, sarcoidosis. I was completely over the diagnosis portion of the process. My life had become work, bed and repeat. They ran multiple tests. I remember the appointment like it was yesterday. When I came back in for my follow-up, I was told I had lupus. A disease that has no cure. To me, that diagnosis was not a death sentence, but a sentence to feel the way that I felt at the moment for the rest of my life. I felt pain, I felt exhausted and I was not me. Having lupus has been like having a horrific hangover while doing two-a-day workouts -- #exhausting. No one knows what is wrong unless you tell them. There is no escaping the pain, and the only way out is to sleep or die. I've felt like lupus at times has sucked the life out of me. It's shifted my priorities, taken away many of the things I love because I'm stuck in a holding pattern just treating the symptoms. Never being cured. Fighting this disease has been no easy ride. The disease has affected my brain, GI system, lungs and heart. I take nine medications to treat symptoms. Meaning, this is what I had to do to get through the day. Those drugs include chemotherapy, an antimalarial, a beta-blocker, an anticonvulsant, corticosteroids and a drug used to treat nerve damage. None of the drugs is specifically meant to treat lupus. When people see me, they always say, ""You don't look sick."" This has sort of been a gift and a curse for me. On one hand, I didn't want people to look at me as if I had a disability. On the other, I wanted people to know what I've been able to accomplish in spite of the disease. It's an invisible fight for me, but now is my time to make some noise so we can find a cure. If no one is aware of my struggle, we can't get there. I want me back, and I've realized that every breath I take is blessed with a responsibility. A responsibility to raise awareness about life with lupus and the need for a cure. Every day, this is what keeps me going. Lupus is one of America's least recognized major diseases, although 1.5 million Americans are living with it. Research is not keeping pace with the research for other diseases of similar scope and devastation. A study conducted by the Lupus Foundation of America found 72% of Americans from 18 to 34 (those most at risk for lupus) have either not heard about lupus or know nothing more than the name. In the past century, only one drug has been developed and approved to treat the disease. With the ebbs and flows of the economy, this disease has taken the backseat to research investment priorities. The Lupus Foundation of America is the oldest and largest nonprofit organization focused on improving quality of life and finding a cure for lupus.

"(CNN) -- In Madrid, all the talk is about ""La Decima"". In London, all the talk was about the ""Special One"". Tonight, after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season's most romantic fairy tales, Atletico Madrid allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- La Primera -- the first. Atletico, for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival Real, has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the European stage. A convincing 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge secured a place in the Champions League final and allowed the dream of a league and European double to prosper. This Atletico team has guts, resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has, in abundance, is quality. Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. Four points clear at the top of La Liga with three games remaining and a clash with Real to decide the destiny of the Champions League trophy to come in Lisbon on May 24, this is turning out to be some season for Atletico. ""It's a dream,"" Atletico midfielder Tiago told Sky Sports. ""We have a great spirit, we are a great team, we all work together, now we are in the final in Lisbon, the dreams can be true. ""It is not easy to play here, we know that. But we knew Chelsea had to play more. ""We know we are very good away from home. After our goal Chelsea went down a bit, but we were confident and now we are there. ""We know Real Madrid is a fantastic team with great players. They can win the game in any action but we are there. Last year we won the Cup in their stadium so we are confident."" Not since 1996 has Los Rojiblancos won the domestic title but managed by Diego Simeone, who was part of that team 18 years ago, it now stands on the brink of history. Simeone, who presides over a budget nearly five times smaller than Real, has worked wonders but perhaps even would not have expected his players to record such an impressive victory. To score three goals away from home in European competition is a marked achievement, but to do so against Chelsea, a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition, is staggering. Chelsea, derided for its defensive tactics and considered an ""enemy of football"" by some because of its negative approach, has already answered its critics on numerous occasions this season. A fine victory at Liverpool on Sunday proved once again that Mourinho's tactics, however unpalatable, gain results. But on this occasion, the solidity and cohesion which had caused such frustration in Madrid last week, was missing. The dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that Chelsea had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle Atletico. There is no doubt that Mourinho has been hurt by the criticism and hit back at his detractors by claiming that ""at this moment, football is full of philosophers."" While everybody appears to have an opinion on Chelsea's defensive approach, Mourinho sticks to the belief which has made him a serial winner -- winning at all costs. The prospect of facing his former employer, Real Madrid, in the final added another subplot to an already intriguing tie. Eden Hazard, back from injury, was restored to the side, and Chelsea, often so adroit at scraping through tight contests, appeared confident. Yet it was the visitors who began the brighter of the two. Atletico, on the brink of the domestic title and chasing a place in the final for the first time in 40 years, played with a sense of purpose and came within inches of taking an early lead. Koke, influential throughout, aimed what looked like a cross towards goal only for the ball to sail over Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and smash against the crossbar. Chelsea responded with David Luiz's overhead kick sailing just wide of the far post as the home side stepped up the pressure. And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, the home side finally made the breakthrough. Willian escaped his marker on the right before finding Cesar Azpilicueta, who in turn found Torres to fire home from inside the penalty area. Torres, who began his career at Atletico and scored 84 goals in 214 games for the club before moving to Liverpool in 2007, refused to celebrate but that gesture did not detract from the significance of the strike. Buoyed by the goal, Chelsea began to take control and with its resilient defense holding Atletico comfortably, the visitors appeared rattled. But with just a minute of the opening period remaining, the game was turned on its head. Tiago, once of Chelsea, picked out Juanfran at the far post and when he crossed the ball into the penalty area, Lopez was on hand to steer the ball home. Mourinho's defense, such an integral part of his side's success, appeared brittle for the first time in the competition and it never really recovered. Within minutes of the restart, Schwarzer was forced to produce a fine save to deny Turan after the Atletico midfielder had found space inside the penalty area. While Schwarzer performed heroics at one end, Thibaut Courtois, on loan from Chelsea, did similar at the other. John Terry's powerful header looked certain to find the net but Courtois produced an astonishing stop to deny the Chelsea captain. That save appeared to change the momentum of the contest and slowly but surely, Atletico began to turn the screw . With an hour of the game gone, Atletico finally struck and grabbed the initiative. Diego Costa, a man constantly linked with a move to Chelsea, was fouled inside the penalty area by Samuel Eto'o. The Spain striker, who endured a nervous wait to take the spot kick after the ball failed to settle on the spot, fired home emphatically to put his side within touching distance of glory. An eerie silence engulfed Stamford Bridge and but for a few thousand Spaniards clad in red and white, a sense of hopelessness began to emanate. Chelsea, to its credit, refused to give up the fight and came perilously close to equalizing within five minutes. Willian's exquisite free kick caused panic in the Atletico defense and Luiz sent a header crashing against the post when the ball seemed destined for the net. Chelsea, by now beginning to look ragged and forlorn, strained every sinew in an attempt to gain some sort of foothold to launch a comeback. But as the home side pushed forward, Atletico countered and in doing so, swiftly put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach. Once again, a wonderful switch of play caught Chelsea sleeping and after sending a powerful header against the crossbar from Juanfran's cross, Arda tucked away the rebound from his own effort. That strike sent Simeone down the touchline dancing a jig of delight a la Mourinho all those years ago. It is a jig he will hope to dance again in Lisbon with the whole world watching.","Atletico Madrid will play Real Madrid in Champions League final .

"West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Working as a guidance counselor five years ago in Palm Beach County, Estella Pyfrom noticed that fewer students had access to a computer after school. The sluggish economy forced many families to prioritize their money and use it for more pressing needs. ""They needed food. They needed to pay their mortgage or their rent,"" said Pyfrom, a former teacher. ""Some of them lost their cars. So I knew it was a serious problem."" Without a computer at home, or reliable transportation to get to a computer, Pyfrom feared that many of these students would get left behind. So she bought a bus, filled it with computers and brought technology to the kids. Her mobile computer lab, Estella's Brilliant Bus, has provided free, computer-based tutoring for thousands of students since 2011. ""If people don't have some knowledge of technology, they're going to be limited,"" said Pyfrom, who retired in 2009 and used money from her savings to buy the bus. ""It's absolutely essential that they get involved technologically."" Pyfrom is determined to help poor children get the same educational opportunities as other children. According to the Institute of the Study of Labor, students who lack access to a home computer are less likely to graduate high school. ""The digital divide is absolutely real,"" said Pyfrom, 76. ""And it didn't just become a reality. It's been there for years, and it's getting bigger and more important."" Pyfrom's custom-designed bus is outfitted with 17 computer stations that are connected to high-speed Internet via satellite. Emblazoned on its side are the words ""Have Knowledge, Will Travel"" and ""We bring learning to you."" The bus travels to schools, shelters and community centers throughout the county. ""We serve children starting with age 3 all the way through senior citizens, based on what the needs are,"" Pyfrom said. ""We are bringing the learning and the technology to the neighborhoods. They all can benefit from that."" Pyfrom and her army of volunteers hold regular classes and tutoring sessions about four days a week. They offer lessons in computer and Internet basics as well as reading, math or science classes that supplement what children are learning in school. Sometimes, the bus simply serves as an open computer lab. The rules on the bus are few and simple. Among them, gum and Facebook are not allowed. Pyfrom takes a no-nonsense approach to her mobile classroom. ""Excuses don't get the job done,"" she said. ""You do whatever it takes to make things happen. That's the only thing that works."" The computers are loaded with educational software, providing interactive exercises that reinforce state-mandated curricula. Children receive their own account login and password, allowing them to continue their work from anywhere they can access the Internet. Users can only advance to the next level in a subject once they reach 90% proficiency in the current one, and the software allows Pyfrom to track their progress. For older students, the bus brings GED and college preparatory assistance, anti-bullying and peer mediation classes, and student leadership training. Pyfrom and her team provide about 8,000 hours of instruction to at least 500 children a year. She hopes the extra time will help bring students up to their grade level in reading, vocabulary, math, science and life skills. Freddy and Brianna Rodriguez are two students benefiting from Pyfrom's bus. Adopted from foster care, the siblings struggled with their grades when they entered junior high school. ""If I didn't have the bus to come to, it'd be hard to get to a computer,"" said Brianna, 13. ""My grades have gotten better. The one-on-one time, it helped me."" In working with the students, Pyfrom found that many parents didn't know how to use a computer. Now her bus helps them, too. ""They're learning right along with the kids,"" Pyfrom said. ""They don't feel threatened, because what I say to them is, 'If your 4-year-old can use a computer and click a mouse, so can you.' "" On the bus, adults can receive online banking tutorials, resume assistance and help searching for jobs and affordable housing. Pyfrom's efforts to help low-income families haven't stopped with her bus. She also partnered with a community nonprofit to help provide meals to 3,000 residents each month. Through that work, she's identified other ways her bus can help struggling neighbors build up technological proficiency necessary in the marketplace. ""We want to do what we can do in (each) neighborhood to make things better for all,"" Pyfrom said. ""We run into people who really want to better their lifestyles and are without help. We can help them make a big difference in their neighborhoods."" To keep up the momentum of her efforts, Pyfrom has continued to pour her savings into maintaining and modifying her bus, so far spending about $1 million, she says. An easy retirement is not something she aspires to. ""I'm not tired yet. And I don't think I'm going to get tired,"" she said. ""I'm constantly charged up. I look at the faces of the children and I get energized."" Pyfrom is determined to see her services expand throughout the state, even the country. She estimates she has enough savings to keep her bus running for another two years, but she hopes to find financial support before she runs out of money. ""I don't think about what I'm not able to do or not going to be able to do,"" she said. ""I plan for the things that I think I'm going to do, need to do and want to do. And I think most of them are going to happen. ""We've got to keep rolling. We're going to keep taking the service to the neighborhoods, and we are going to keep making a difference.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Iran are adding a new round of senior-level talks about the latter's nuclear program, discussions separate from the so-called P5+1 process continuing in Vienna. The increase of diplomatic effort comes as an interim agreement reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council nears its end. That deal eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon. Iran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. Major disagreements on a comprehensive agreement remain, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. The new talks appear to be a push to see whether roadblocks can be overcome. ""We believe we need to engage in as much active diplomacy as we can to test whether we can reach a diplomatic solution with Iran on its nuclear program,"" the official said. ""These consultations come at an important juncture of the negotiations, and they will give us a timely opportunity to exchange views in the context of the next P5+1 round in Vienna.""

"(CNN) -- In beating a hasty retreat from Cliven Bundy, their onetime Lonesome Cowboy icon, Republicans have resorted to a familiar tactic: divert, deny, distract. Divert attention by claiming the ""media"" made a story out of Cliven Bundy. The ""media"" plucked him out of obscurity, baited him with questions about race, and then blew the story out of proportion. Deny having defended, supported and promoted Bundy -- despite the recorded evidence -- with faux outrage and feigned offense. Divert by talking about how much the only racism left in America is the talk about racism. That's one of the points Tara Wall makes in her op-ed attacking CNN for its coverage of Bundy and his self-declared ""Range War."" But sticking our fingers in our ears and saying ""I can't hear you"" didn't make problems go away when we were 5-year-olds on a playground. And saying that if we just stop talking about race, there won't be any racial bias, doesn't make it so. Look, I get it. Talking about the racial reality in America makes some powerful people uncomfortable. It shows in Chief Justice John Roberts' argument that a nonexistent colorblindness justifies the Supreme Court's gutting of affirmative action and the Voting Rights Act. Most Americans aren't hateful, and many who are, like Cliven Bundy, don't see themselves in the mirror. But there's still a racial bias in this country that holds back talented Americans who aren't white. What Justice Sonia Sotomayor said about the judiciary applies to all of us. If we believe in the guarantee of equal protection, then ""we ought not sit back and wish away, rather than confront, the racial inequality that exists in our society."" ""Wishing away"" leads to a denial, and denial of history is, unfortunately, part of Tara Wall's appeal to history. Yes, President Abraham Lincoln was a Republican, but a hundred years later the Republican Party wasn't Lincoln's. Richard Nixon became president by courting Americans upset by integration, intentionally fueling the racial divide. In his first speech after winning the Republican nomination in 1980, Ronald Reagan, said he believed ""in states' rights."" This at the Neshoba County Fair, just a few miles from Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights workers were murdered. In 2005, Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman formally apologized for this ""Southern Strategy."" This would have been great, if only they'd stopped using it. But they haven't. Here's the proof. Or more proof. Phil Robertson of ""Duck Dynasty"" said pretty much the same thing Cliven Bundy did. Republicans didn't chastise him. They celebrated him. In fact, some Republicans invited ""Duck Dynasty"" cast members to this year's State of the Union address to show their support. The Republican elected officials and their allies supported Bundy's cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre with their actions and rhetoric from the beginning. Before he wondered if ""Blacks might not be better off as slaves,"" Bundy received support and encouragement from three Republican senators, two of them (Ted Cruz and Rand Paul) with presidential ambitions. Nevada's Republican senator, Dean Heller, referred to Bundy and his supporters as patriots before retracting. And then there's the list of state and local Republicans around the country who supported Bundy, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, another presidential aspirant. Bundy felt comfortable lecturing a reporter about race and slavery because for weeks he'd been puffed up by right-leaning media outlets, potential Republican presidential candidates, and current GOP officeholders. That's why he was even on the media's radar. And speaking of the media, here's another dot to connect. In April, before this most recent controversy sparked, Fox News mentioned Cliven Bundy 458 times. Sean Hannity -- who said Bundy was a ""friend and frequent guest"" -- interviewed Bundy at length, more than a half-dozen times, about his confrontation with the federal government. It was all part of a concerted effort to turn a racist welfare rancher into a folk hero. Why? MediaMatters.org and others report that ""Hannity receives major funding and large ad buys from Koch-affiliated Heritage and Tea Party Patriots."" That's significant because the Koch Brothers and their affiliates want to ""transfer control of federal lands to states"" so that they can ""use the land in whichever way is most profitable to them such as mining, drilling, and other resource extraction."" It's a shame a little racism gets in the way of profits and power grabs. That Republicans eventually got around to denouncing Bundy's racist, pro-slavery statement, after conspicuous silence, doesn't change the fact they have a history of promoting people like Robertson and Bundy. It doesn't change the fact that they're still advocating an agenda fueled by hatred and fear. It's time for Republicans to stop posing and look in the mirror. They can't light a fire under a pot and then feign outrage when it boils over.","Donna Brazile says when it comes to race, the GOP has a simple game plan .
Divert, deny, distract, says Brazile, are the tactics they use most frequently .
Their reaction to comments made by rancher Cliven Bundy are another example, she says ."
"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery will battle it out for the FIFA Ballon d'Or, football's most prestigious individual accolade. Global governing body FIFA whittled down the initial 23-man list to a final shortlist of three players, with the winner set to be announced during the annual Ballon d'Or gala in Zurich on January 13. Barcelona and Argentina No. 10 Messi is hoping to be crowned the world's leading player for a record fifth year in a row, but he faces stiff competition from Real Madrid's Ronaldo. Portugal captain Ronaldo is the favorite to clinch the award for the second time in his career, having previously won it as a Manchester United player in 2008, after a year which has seen him outscore Messi while also firing his country to next year's World Cup in Brazil. France's Ribery was a key player in the Bayern Munich team which won a European Champions League, Bundesliga and German Cup treble in 2013. FIFA also announced the three men in the running for the coach of the year accolade. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson is nominated for guiding the Old Trafford club to a record 20th English championship. The Scot called time on his glittering 26-year reign at United in May. Jupp Heynckes also stepped aside at the end of last season after leading Bayern to an historic treble. The German veteran is nominated alongside Jurgen Klopp, whose Borussia Dortmund team lost to Heynckes' Bayern in the Champions League final but won many admirers with their vibrant, attacking football. The world's leading female player will also be crowned. Brazilian star Marta is once again nominated for the award having won it five years in a row between 2006 and 2010. Germany goalkeeper Nadine Angerer saved two penalties in a 1-0 win over Norway in the final of Euro 2013, with American Abby Wambach completing the shortlist after becoming the leading goalscorer in international football history.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Franck Ribery shortlisted for 2013 Ballon d'Or .

"(CNN) -- The atmosphere could have fallen a little flat after the Champions League setback against Real Madrid, but it did not stop a capacity 71,000 crowd at the Allianz Arena celebrating Bayern Munich's 24th Bundesliga title in traditional style Saturday. A last-gasp winner from Claudio Pizarro ensured the final league game of the season would result in a 1-0 win over Stuttgart and the cue for the party to start. Manager Pep Guardiola was dowsed with the best Bavarian beer as has become the custom, with defenders Jerome Boateng and Daniel van Buyten the main protagonists. He scarcely seemed to mind as he lifted the shield, reward for an all-conquering season which saw the championship wrapped up by March and with 29 wins, three draws and only two defeats. Some have blamed the early clinching of the title for some lackluster performances which followed, including the 5-0 semifinal aggregate reverse to Real which ended Bayern's hopes of defending the Champions League crown. The last league game was also a low-key affair on the pitch until Peru's Pizarro scored from outside the penalty area in the 92nd minute. Guardiola, whose future at Bayern has been the subject of some speculation, looked a relieved man after it went in, but he will be hoping his team can raise themselves for one final big performance next week. They face arch-rivals Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup final in Berlin, hoping to complete the domestic double before many of their squad head to Brazil for the World Cup finals. Bayern may have to do so without key midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, who limped off in the first half with a knee injury. He will undergo an MRI scan Monday to determine the seriousness, worrying for his club side and Germany. ""Bastian has a problem with his kneecap,"" Guardiola told the official Bayern website. ""But we still have six days to go until the cup final."" Guardiola also reflected on his team's achievements in his first season in charge. ""The first championship is very special for a Catalan such as myself,"" he said.","Bayern Munich beat Stuttgart in final game of Bundesliga season .

"(CNN) -- Syria's president says he'll welcome the return of U.N. investigators to follow up on more allegations of chemical weapons use in his country. ""We've been asking them to come back to Syria to continue their investigations,"" President Bashar al-Assad told Fox News in an interview broadcast Wednesday. Al-Assad said he hadn't had time yet to analyze the U.N. investigators' findings so far, but stressed they have more work to do. ""They haven't finished it yet,"" he said, adding that it's clear that rebels were behind chemical weapons attacks, not his government. Ake Sellstrom, the head of the inspection team that visited after an August 21 attack outside Damascus, told CNN that the next visit could take place as early as next week. In the meantime, Al-Assad vowed that his government would comply with the deal to hand over and destroy its chemical weapons, but noted that the timeframe is uncertain and the costs will be great -- up to $1 billion by some estimates. And he said that his government's decision to sign on had nothing to do with a threat of military action by the United States. ""Syria never obeyed any threat. We actually responded to the Russian initiative,"" he told Fox. ""We obey because we want to obey. We have completely different incentives."" Russia denounces U.N. report . Soon after Western countries said the U.N. findings implicated the Syrian regime in using sarin gas, Russia fired back, calling the report ""distorted."" Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov also told Russia Today that the report was built on insufficient information. He said Russia has its own evidence from the site of the August 21 attack that, according to U.S. estimates, killed more than 1,400 people. ""This analysis is not finished, so the point here is not about accusing parties,"" Ryabkov told Russia Today. ""But the point is ... that those inspectors of the U.N. should come back to Syria to complete their investigation."" In the same interview, he said Syria has given Russia evidence that implicates rebels in the August 21 attack, which occurred outside Damascus. ""This confirmation and this evidence has been transmitted to the Russian side ... and we are in the process of studying those,"" he said without citing what the evidence was. Russia will present evidence to the Security Council, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters in Valdai, Russia, on Wednesday. He did not say when the presentation would take place and added that he himself had not seen it. Russia has been a strong ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, and Russian defense contracts with Syria have probably exceeded $4 billion. Is the U.S. back to square one on Syria? The United Nations official in charge of weapons inspectors said that the report alleging chemical weapons use in Syria ""stands for itself,"" shooting back Russian allegations that the report was ""biased"" and ""distorted."" ""It is a very sound, scientific report,"" Angela Kane, the U.N. high representative for disarmament affairs, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Wednesday. Moscow's reaction to the U.N. report has differed sharply from those of the United States and France. ""Based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report, several crucial details confirm the Assad regime's guilt in carrying out this attack,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Tuesday. She said one of the munitions identified in the report, a 120 mm improvised rocket, has been linked to previous attacks by al-Assad's regime, and ""we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket."" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country also believes the report proves the Syrian regime used chemical warfare in opposition strongholds near Damascus. But Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane's Defence Equipment and Technology Centre, said that though the U.N. report appears to prove that high-quality, weaponized sarin was used in significant quantities in Syria, ""I have not personally seen any compelling data that proves beyond doubt who the weapons were used by."" He added: ""There is a degree of circumstantial evidence that appears to point to the attack originating with the Assad forces, but the exact forensic detail of who prepared and then triggered the weapons remains unclear and was beyond the scope of the U.N. investigation."" Securing Syria's chemical weapons: Mission impossible? Syrian government claims a win . United Nations Security Council members met Wednesday to try to hammer out a resolution to get Syria to give up its chemical weapons. It wasn't clear Wednesday night how much progress they'd made. Reaching a deal will be tough. U.S. and French officials want to include the threat of military action in the event Syria doesn't comply, but Russian officials don't want any wording that could countenance the use of force. The disagreement came days after Russia and the United States reached a rare agreement on Syria -- a plan for eliminating the country's chemical weapons stockpile. Even Syria agreed to the plan, and U.S. President Barack Obama has held back on possible military action while diplomatic options play out. But even before seeing a Security Council resolution, the Syrian regime claimed an international win. Prime Minister Wael al-Halqi told the Syrian Cabinet about ""brilliant victories of the Syrian diplomacy realized ... in terms of preventing the U.S. from launching a military aggression against Syria,"" the Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday. But the diplomacy hasn't stopped bloodshed. The opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported Wednesday that regime forces killed 24 people in the village of Kafr Zeiba in Idlib province. The Syrian opposition has blamed al-Assad's government for the violence and called for his ouster. Al-Assad told Fox News that his government can't back down on what he called a fight against terrorism, arguing that 80%-90% of rebels have ties to al Qaeda or other extremist groups. Civilian casualties in the Syrian conflict, he argued, have come from rebel attacks and from his government's attempts to root out terrorists from residential areas. ""The army has to go there and get rid of terrorists. The army should defend citizens. You cannot leave them free, killing people, beheading people, eating their hearts,"" he said. ""In every way, you have casualties. This is war. (There is) no clean war, no soft war, no good war."" Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors. The blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps . The program, called ""Discovering Hands,"" is the brainchild of German gynecologist Dr. Frank Hoffmann. Two years ago, he created Braille strips as a system of orientation, allowing the blind to carry out breast examinations. Using these strips blind women are trained to become Medical Tactile Examiners (MTUs) because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors. Hoffman argues that because of their disability, the blind can possess a more acutely developed sense of touch, which has proved to be a valuable asset in breast examinations. Once the strips are placed along specific areas of the breast, they are then used to report a precise location to the doctor as the MTU reads their Braille coordinates. ""We are turning a disability into a gift,""  Dr. Hoffmann told CNN. ""It's like the game Battleship,"" he added. ""You have the exact location."" A study at the Essen University's women's clinic, Germany, concluded that MTUs found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases. The identification of smaller lumps allows earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment. Another advantage of having MTUs is that they are able to dedicate more time to examining a patient. Dr. Hoffman said he had previously been able to spend only a few minutes on each examination due to his other commitments, whereas MTUs can commit half an hour. Training takes place at the BFW occupational school in Düren, west Germany, a center for those who are no longer able to continue their profession because of visual impairment or blindness. So far, ten blind women have qualified as MTUs. One of the women, Marie-Luise Voll, 57, told CNN: "" The work brings me a lot of joy."" Voll had previously practiced as a nurse before losing her sight in 2007, but used the experience when training at Düren for her new role. The highly personal nature of the procedure means that only women will be trained. The MTUs report to the doctor - for whom they act as an assistant not a replacement - who then uses this information as part of their ultimate diagnosis. If an abnormality is located the doctor will decide how to proceed, with ultrasounds and mammography being the most frequent course of action. The testing phase of the project between 2006 and 2008 has now been completed in Germany. The hope is that twenty trained MTUs will qualify every year after 2010. The program has been acclaimed as a success by both patients and practitioners in Germany. Health services in Europe including Ireland, France, Denmark and Austria have also registered interest in starting an equivalent of their own, Hoffman said.","Blind women being trained to use their sensitive touch to detect breast cancer lumps .

"(CNN) -- With each day, the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 becomes one of the most baffling mysteries of the modern era, but history offers many great quests in which mankind searched for something or someone lost. These are epic searches, based on legend or fact, ending successfully, tragically, or sometimes not at all: . The Holy Grail . There are many great biblical searches: Noah's Ark. The Ark of the Covenant. The Garden of Eden. But there's nothing like the Holy Grail. Indeed, it's a metaphor for any monumental search. It's not clear what the Grail exactly was, but it's said to be the shallow cup from Jesus Christ's Last Supper and from his crucifixion, where the vessel took blood flowing from his side. Some believe Joseph of Arimathea brought the Grail to Britain, where it lies hidden. Not even legendary King Arthur and his knights could find it, though their crusade inspired lore and romance. The Titanic . RMS Titanic was a British luxury passenger ship that sank in 1912 during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. The ocean liner was touted as ""unsinkable"" -- until it met an iceberg in the North Atlantic around midnight on April 14-15, 1912. About 1,500 of the more than 2,200 people aboard the Titanic died. For decades, the ship was considered forever lost at the bottom of the ocean -- until 1985, when scientists found the wreckage on the seabed. Its story inspired director James Cameron to make the Hollywood tragic love tale ""Titanic"" in 1997. Air France 447 . A long search for a commercial airliner like Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 isn't unprecedented. In 2009, Air France Flight 447 plunged into the South Atlantic Ocean during a storm, killing all 228 people aboard. The precise location of the wreckage remained a mystery for almost two years. Then the plane and its dead were found in a mountain range deep on the ocean floor. Miniature submersible vehicles retrieved the Flight 447's voice and flight data recorders. That allowed investigators to blame the crash on a series of errors by the pilots and a failure to react effectively to technical problems. Nine aviation mysteries highlight long history of plane disappearances . Jimmy Hoffa . The disappearance of Teamsters leader James Riddle Hoffa remains a subject of relentless speculation and macabre jokes. He vanished on July 30, 1975, after he stood outside the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Michigan and made a phone call. He was never heard from again. His name makes news anytime FBI agents and police are seen holding shovels. Lore holds that Hoffa was killed and buried. But where? Amelia Earhart . The swashbuckling aviatrix and pioneering woman embarked on the first around-the-world flight at the Equator in June 1937. After completing about two-thirds of the flight, she and navigator Frederick Noonan disappeared after their plane took off from Lae, New Guinea. They were heading to the Pacific Ocean outpost of Howland Island -- a distance equaling a transcontinental U.S. flight. A search never found any trace of her, Noonan or their plane. Some believe they ran out of fuel and crashed into the sea -- similar to one theory of what happened to the Malaysia Airlines plane. Atlantis . In the fourth century B.C., the philosopher Plato spoke of an ancient utopia that existed 9,000 years before, a place called Atlantis. Made of concentric islands rich with gold, silver and exotic life, Atlantis descended into depravity, Plato said, until earthquakes and tsunamis ultimately destroyed it. Over time, thinkers and writers began trying to place Atlantis in real countries and lands, even America. At a minimum, Atlantis lives on in the imagination, thanks to one of Western civilization's greatest philosophers. Seven cities of gold . It's one thing to imagine of a paradise like Atlantis. It's quite another to actually voyage into a strange new world in search of one. That's what the Spanish explorers did in the 1500s, driven by a tall tale told by natives of how the New World held seven cities of gold. In their lust for wealth, the Spaniards traveled through modern Florida, Texas and Mexico in search of Cibola. When they arrived in Kansas, they finally quit. They never found the seven lost cities of gold. Tomb of Cleopatra and Mark Antony . Cleopatra, the great queen of Egypt, died in 30 B.C. and was buried with her lover, Mark Antony. The couple's great passion has been captured in theater and film, thanks to Shakespeare on stage and Elizabeth Taylor in film. But for some adventurers, that's not enough. In 2009, flamboyant archeologist Zahi Hawass of Egypt and his colleagues began a new search for Cleopatra's tomb -- ""in hopes of removing some of the great mystery that hangs thick around this famous queen,"" Hawass wrote in National Geographic. ""Many have searched for the tomb of Alexander the Great, but no one had searched for that missing piece of ancient Egypt's story -- the tomb of Cleopatra, who took her own life rather than surrender her homeland to the Romans,"" Hawass wrote. ""It occurred to me that we had before us an opportunity to recover the last page in the book of ancient Egyptian civilization, an opportunity we could not pass by."" So far, he's had no luck. Then again, no one has found the tomb of Alexander the Great, either. Bermuda Triangle . Many ships, planes and people have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle, a section of the Atlantic Ocean in a ""triangle"" marked by the points of Bermuda, Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Speculation runs wild on what caused the boats and aircraft to vanish. Sound familiar? The disappearance of Flight 370 has nothing on the Bermuda Triangle. Some even blame the triangle disasters on supernatural forces, including influences from lost Atlantis or another time-space dimension. The U.S. government devotes a Web page to the Bermuda Triangle and rebuts fringe theories. U.S. officials cite hurricanes, sudden storms, the powerful Gulf Stream and shallow Caribbean waters as reasonable explanations for the lost vessels. ""The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea. Their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction,"" the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says on its website. ""The ocean has always been a mysterious place to humans, and when foul weather or poor navigation is involved, it can be a very deadly place. This is true all over the world."" By the way, no official mapping exists for triangle's boundaries, NOAA says. Life out there . Call them aliens. Call them extraterrestrials. Call them what you want. But let's face it: Don't we all wonder what's out there, especially when we launch spacecraft to another planet? Sure, astronomers study the heavens and find new planets, but what we're privately searching for is whether we are alone. Among the organizations advancing this pursuit is the Carl Sagan Center for the Study of Life in the Universe, named after the late American astronomer who championed exploration of the cosmos. ""The significance of a finding that there are other beings who share this universe with us would be absolutely phenomenal, it would be an epochal event in human history,"" Sagan once declared.","The hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 conjures up other great searches by mankind .
The Holy Grail, never found, is a metaphor for all monumental quests .
The ocean searches for the Titanic, Air France 447 ended with success .
Is our greatest search the one to know whether we are alone?"
"Washington (CNN) -- A competitor of the Coca-Cola Company can bring a private lawsuit against the beverage giant over allegations of false advertising in a juice product, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday. The 8-0 decision is a win for Pom Wonderful, a California-based firm. It claimed Coke's Minute Maid brand was cheating consumers through deceptive labeling in its Pomegranate Blueberry beverage, which the court said ""in truth ... contains but 0.3% pomegranate juice and 0.2% blueberry juice."" At issue was whether one federal law regulating and enforcing food labeling preempted or overrode efforts by private parties to bring lawsuits under a separate federal law. Those two laws are the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Lanham Act. ""Nothing in the text, history, or structure of the FDCA or the Lanham Act shows the congressional purpose or design to forbid these (private) suits,"" Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the unanimous court. ""Quite to the contrary, the FDCA and the Lanham Act complement each other in the federal regulation of misleading food and beverage labels. Competitors, in their own interest, may bring Lanham Act claims like POM's that challenge food and beverage labels that are regulated by the FDCA."" Lower courts had sided with Georgia-based Coca-Cola, a global brand. But the justices concluded that while the federal government can go after misleading labels, private parties can also challenge ""practices that allegedly mislead and trick consumers."" POM Wonderful, which produces pomegranate juices and products, has also faced allegations of deceptive advertising. It was separately sued by the Federal Trade Commission in 2010, for making ""false and unsubstantiated"" health claims, and the agency had asked POM to remove the claims from its ads. The current case is POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca Cola Company (12-761). Justice Stephen Breyer did not participate in deciding this appeal.","Pom Wonderful has accused a Coke brand of deceptive labeling .

"(CNN) -- Your days at the beach with a bucket and shovel making castles in the sand were child's play compared to what you'll see at sand sculpting events. There, the massive, inventive, intricate works of art go so far beyond ""sand castles."" You'll never look at sand and water the same way again. (Keep reminding yourself—it is just sand and water.) On Day One of a contest, a solo sculptor or ""carver"" is presented with a 10-ton pyramid of sand (two-person teams in doubles competition work with 20 to 25 tons). Then, through a rigorous process of shoveling, packing, stacking and carving, a sculpture takes shape. Spectators can watch it all -- from the first day ""pound up"" in which the sand is compressed, to the hours of carving with manual tools such as trowels, butter knives, tablespoons and drinking straws, plus some that the sculptors devise for themselves. (Dutch sculptor Wilfred Stijger's patented Willysphere -- inspired by the base of a wine glass -- makes perfect sand spheres.) ""The first question anyone asks us is what happens when it rains, but wind and sun are worse than rain when you're sculpting sand,"" says Rusty Croft, who with Kirk Rademaker is co-owner of Sand Guys International and co-hosted the Travel Channel series ""Sand Masters."" ""We wet down the sculptures as we work. The surface tension of the water holds the sand together."" Finished sculptures may be sprayed with a solution of water and school glue to preserve them for long-term viewing. Nevertheless, many sand sculpture events are held under tents or temporary shelters safe from the elements, and quite a few take place off the beach in parks and open spaces where sand is brought in especially for the event. America's best little beach towns . ""The sand is always different,"" Croft notes. ""Sand dug out of the ground has sharp edges that lock together. Beach sand is rounded because it's been washed by the waves. You have to listen to the sand. It tells you what to build. Sand sculpture is a brilliant mix between engineering and artwork."" Here are some of the masters' top picks for sand sculpting events around the globe. No bucket required. July 19-21, 2013 . National Sand Sculpting Festival, Revere Beach, Revere, Massachusetts . ""There's a wonderful festival atmosphere here and the sand is definitely some of the best stuff out there -- you can make crazy vertical sculptures,"" says Sue McGrew, a Tacoma-based professional sand sculptor and a member of the ""Sand Masters"" team. ""They finish the event off with a bang ... fireworks. And there's easy access from Boston by public transportation."" August 10-September 8, 2013 . International Sand Sculpture Festival, Rorschach, Switzerland . ""You're sculpting in a park on the Bodensee and you have the Alps behind you; the whole event has a great elegant feel,"" says Kirk Rademaker, who will pair with Wilfred Stijgers of the Netherlands in this year's doubles competition. With a full week to complete their pieces, the doubles carvers create spectacular things. Biggest, baddest roller coasters for summer . August 30-September 2, 2013 . U.S. Sand Sculpting Challenge, San Diego . On the water, but not on the beach, this four-day competition takes place on the B Street cruise ship terminal pier in downtown San Diego. Croft calls it one of the more progressive events on the sand sculpting calendar, giving carvers four days to work. There's also a head-to-head team competition and a chance for visitors to vote for this year's People's Choice sand sculpture. 5 spectacular and storied beach trips . September 27-October 6, 2013 . International Sandsculpting Championship, Virginia Beach, Virginia . A significant cash prize for the winners ensures that the field of competitors is top-notch. Carvers love this event and so do spectators. Look for lots of international representation here, including Fergus Mulvany from Ireland, Benjamin Probanza from Mexico, Edith Van Wetering of the Netherlands, and Canadian master carvers Guy-Olivier Deveau, David Ducharme, Karen Fralich and Abe Waterman. October 15-20, 2013 . Carve San Francisco, San Francisco . Croft and Rademaker are consulting on and participating in this event, which will be held for the first time this year. Through October 27 . International Sandsculpture Festival, Søndervig, Denmark . Each June, a team of international artists is invited to work together on an enormous sculpture of sand in this beach area of western Denmark. Done by 38 sculptors, this year's carving is complete; the sculpture will remain intact and on view until October 27. November 15-18, 2013 . Crystal Classic Master Sand Sculpting Competition, Siesta Key Beach, Sarasota, Florida . ""Some of the most beautiful beach sand in the world,"" McGrew says. ""I think this is a great little spot for anyone looking for super-clean, white sugar beaches and beautiful warm weather in November."" Events include amateur competitions for kids and parents, head-to-head speed-carving events and a demonstration by Amazin Walter. Expect crowds—some 70,000 people attend over four days. Part of the proceeds supports sea turtle conservation projects at Mote Marine Laboratory. November 21-24, 2013 . Sanding Ovations Master Cup Sand Sculpting Competition, Treasure Island, Florida . Now in its fifth year, this event takes place beside the Bilmar Beach Resort on Florida's Gulf Coast. The competition is serious, but the atmosphere is laid-back, unpretentious and beachy. November 22-December 1, 2013 . American Sand Sculpting Championship, Fort Myers Beach, Florida . More than 1,000 tons of sand plus 30 master sculptors in singles and doubles competition add up to what's billed as the largest sand sculpting event in Florida. Now in its 27th year, it's also one of the oldest. In addition to the pros, amateurs and kids compete for prizes and acclaim—and everyone attempts to avoid structural collapse. ""When you work with beach sand, you have to be flexible,"" Croft notes, ""but it helps retain that 'sand castle' essence."" December 26, 2013-January 26, 2014 . Hawkesbury International Sand Sculpting Championship, Howe Park, Windsor, NSW, Australia . Now in its third year, this competition is held in a park about an hour's drive from Sydney. Solo and team carvers work from December 26 to January 3 and the sculptures remain for People's Choice voting until January 26. (Summer in Australia, remember!) ""The event is in a great location on the Hawkesbury River with sculptures nestled in between trees and park benches,"" McGrew says. April 11-13, 2014 . Texas SandFest, Port Aransas, Texas . When planning the annual Texas SandFest, organizers consult the tide charts to determine the dates of lowest tide, so while the chosen week varies from year to year, the event is always in early spring. That used to be before summer tourist season, yet after 18 years of successful festivals, tourists now arrive early—because of Texas SandFest. With events for both amateurs and pros, ""it is a great community event with a good vibe,"" Rademaker says. June 2014 . Summer Signs Annual Sand Sculpture Festival, Jelgava, Latvia . ""My favorite competition abroad,"" McGrew says. ""In a beautiful park, a dozen or so international sculptors come together for a five-day event with practically no time limit. ... You can practically work 'til you drop, if you were so inclined."" June 2014 . Master Sand Sculpting Competition, Hampton Beach, New Hampshire . This year's competition just ended, but pencil it in for next year—an annual event that brings in 200-plus tons of imported sand and a dozen or so master carvers to shape it into something beautiful, plus lessons and clinics for the public. June 2014 (likely) World Championship of Sand Sculpting, Atlantic City, New Jersey . This year's competition also just ended and dates haven't been posted for next year yet. Retired Atlantic City fireman and master sand sculptor John Gowdy helped bring this event to what is arguably sand sculpting's U.S. birthplace, where sand sculptors entertained crowds with art on the Boardwalk from the late 19th century until the 1940s.

"Douai, France (CNN) -- French prosecutors said Thursday they charged a woman with murder after she admitted giving birth to and smothering eight babies over a 17-year period in northern France. The woman, Dominique Cottrez, said she hid the pregnancies and deaths from her husband, who said he had no idea what she had done, prosecutor Eric Vaillant told reporters. Cottrez is overweight and was able to conceal the pregnancies, he said. Cottrez told investigators the reason she killed the babies was that she did not want to have any more children and did not want to see doctors for contraceptives, Vaillant said. Despite earlier reports that the husband had been charged, Vaillant said he was free to go but may still be investigated. Vaillant said he personally still had ""doubts"" about the father's story. ""The sky has fallen in on his head,"" Vaillant said of the father, Pierre-Marie Cottrez. ""He indicated he had no idea she was pregnant."" Vaillant said there are no other babies' bodies left to be found. The case came to light when a couple gardening in their backyard in the northern town of Villers-au-Tertre found two babies' bodies in sealed plastic bags and called police. Police spoke to Cottrez and her husband, who had previously lived in the home, and Cottrez admitted immediately that she was the mother of the two babies, Vaillant said. She then told police about six others concealed in their garage, Vaillant said. Those six bodies were also in sealed plastic bags but were covered by various objects, he said. Cottrez, a nurse, had psychological problems from her first pregnancy, said Pierre-Jean Gribouva, the lawyer for her husband. ""My client is in a deep state of shock,"" Gribouva told CNN affiliate BFM. ""He had no idea about this. He has totally fallen apart."" The babies were born between 1989 and 2006, but their exact birthdates aren't known, Vaillant said. ""She knew that she was pregnant every time, and she has admitted this,"" Vaillant said. Cottrez ""answered in a very straightforward way."" Cottrez and her husband have two adult daughters, but it was a difficult first pregnancy that sparked her actions, Vaillant said. Because of her weight, the first pregnancy was ""traumatic,"" and she didn't want to go through it again, he said. Vaillaint did not explain why Cottrez went through a second pregnancy with her other daughter before apparently committing the crimes. Pierre-Marie Cottrez hopes the public does not make ""simplistic conclusions"" about his wife, Gribouva told BFM. The family members ""are supporting the wife and the mother because they realize she has serious problems,"" he said. ""There is no rejection of her as a wife and mother."" Psychotherapist Lucy Beresford told CNN that very little was known about incidences of infanticide because it was a taboo subject. A paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association by researchers in North Carolina estimated that 2.1 cases of infanticide occurred for every 100,000 births, but Beresford said the body of psychological research was ""slim."" Research suggested that women who denied or concealed their pregnancies, for whatever reason, were a ""high-risk"" group, she said. But other factors could trigger infanticide as well. ""It could actually be to do with the social isolation of the mother, or it could be their psychopathology prior to pregnancy,"" Beresford told CNN. ""For example, do they have a history of substance abuse or other mental health concerns that have contributed to them being in this situation which they cannot accept as a reality?"" Postnatal depression could also be a possible contributory factor, she said. ""That could be because when they're depressed they're not really of sound mind. It could be that they genuinely believe they are unworthy to be a parent. Or it could just be the level of disordered thinking that comes with being depressed."" CNN's Phil Black contributed to this report.","Police free husband, saying he knew nothing of wife's pregnancies .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Two American paratroopers went missing on Wednesday during a ""routine resupply mission in western Afghanistan,"" the NATO-led force in the country said Friday. The pair -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- are operating under NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Initial reports indicate that 25 ISAF and Afghan forces have been wounded in the search for the two. ""All available resources are being used to find the two missing paratroopers,"" said the brigade operations officer, Lt. Col. Guy Jones. ""Our rear detachment is doing everything they can to support the families during this difficult time while we continue the search with our Afghan and coalition partners."" U.S. Navy Capt. Jane Campbell of the ISAF Joint Command said, ""We are committed to taking every measure possible to rescue or recover our missing service members. We continue to do everything we can to find them."" The service members disappeared near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan, in the town of Bala Morghab and the province of Baghdis, said Sayed Ahmad Sami, the provincial police chief. He said they appeared to have gone missing in the Morghab River, but he didn't have any details about what happened. Service members from 42 countries serve in the International Security Assistance Force, including military men and women from 28 NATO countries, according to ISAF's Web site. U.S. military personnel account for the bulk of ISAF  service members. Separately, military authorities reported other recent incidents: . • Two U.S. service members and a British soldier were killed in southern Afghanistan on Thursday in roadside bombings, ISAF and the British Defense Ministry said. • Police in Kunduz province said more than 130 Taliban insurgents were killed in a weeklong Afghan-ISAF operation that began on October 31. Eight Taliban commanders and four Chechen fighters were among those killed, police said.

"Majuro, Marshall Islands (CNN) -- The mysterious castaway who turned up in the Marshall Islands after saying he spent 13 months at sea has been moved to an undisclosed location to avoid the media, sources familiar with his care told CNN on Saturday. Security around Jose Salvador Alvarenga has tightened since he came ashore last week more than 6,600 miles from where he says he started; a crush of media has descended on the tiny island nation. Alvarenga, a Salvadoran who lived and worked in Mexico, was moved overnight from the Marshall Islands Resort Hotel in Majuro, the sources said. Security continues to guard the room where Alvarenga was staying at the resort, giving the impression he is still there, according to the sources. Five questions: What is going on? His return journey to El Salvador this week was postponed because of his health, but Dr. Kennar Briand, chief of staff at Majuro Hospital in the Marshall Islands, says Alvarenga is ready to travel. The castaway will have another medical checkup on Monday to see whether he is fit to return home, Briand said. Alvarenga's mental health appears to have improved, too, the doctor said. ""He was a bit 'off,' maybe it's due to him being in the open for so many months and not talking to people, but I think he is finally getting it back,"" Briand said. Alvarenga was released from the hospital in Majuro on Friday, one day after being readmitted because of declining health. Alvarenga's claims have garnered widespread skepticism about how he could survive for 13 months adrift in the Pacific. But from what officials can tell, they have no reason to doubt him.

"(CNN) -- After Angelina Jolie made the surprise announcement on Tuesday of having undergone a preventative double mastectomy, the world stood in awe of her brave move and willingness to share her story. Now hailed an inspiration to other women, CNN examines what makes us love the Oscar-winning actress turned humanitarian. 1. Demonstrating courage . Angelina Jolie has never been afraid to express herself, emotionally or artistically. Her decision to publicly announce her preventative surgery so other women could benefit from her experience shows bravery and an overwhelming desire to help others. She has gone against her own public image and challenged the perception of a woman's identity by choosing to speak up about her operation. Even more powerful, her global reach may influence millions of women to proactively look after themselves. 2. Humanitarian efforts . It has become Jolie's mission to provide a voice for people whose lives have been ravaged by war and natural disasters. In short, she has turned her celebrity status into a force for good. She has personally donated more than $5 million to the UNHCR since 2001. In addition to her appointment as UN Special Envoy to Refugees, the actress has set up the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation dedicated to conservation, education and healthcare in Cambodia. 3. Transcending stereotypes . Jolie refuses to fit a certain mold and proves that women can be daring and independent, and at the same time caring and altruistic. She is a loving mother of six campaigning tirelessly for women and children across the globe, but she is also an Oscar-winning Hollywood actress. The actress has redefined what it means to be a humanitarian. 4. Cinematic talent . From her award-winning portrayal of a mentally unstable woman in ""Girl, Interrupted"" to starring in the ""Lara Croft"" series, Jolie has steered clear of typecasting and has not shied away from theatrical risk. In the last decade, she has steered her career in a serious and meaningful direction, starring in films such as ""Changeling,"" as a distraught mother looking for her son, and ""A Mighty Heart,"" playing the role of Mariane Pearl, wife of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl who was, in 2002, abducted and killed in Pakistan. In 2011, she made her directorial debut with ""In the Land of Blood and Honey,"" a film about the Bosnian War. 5. From celebrity to icon . Jolie has emerged as a woman who is not afraid to make mistakes. She has made the ultimate transition -- from Hollywood starlet to global ambassador and in turn, has become an icon of female empowerment, strength and independence along the way.","Angelina Jolie has demonstrated courage going public about her mastectomy .

"(CNN) -- Mexico is not heading to Brazil simply to make up the numbers -- it's looking to go all the way. That is the belief of Javier Hernandez, who has his eyes firmly fixed on leading his side all the way to the World Cup final. El Tri face a challenge to get out of a tricky group, which also features Cameroon and Croatia in addition to host and tournament favorite, Brazil. But Hernandez insists a nation which has never gone further than the quarterfinal stage in the past can make history this time around. ""Our mind is on the final, really,"" he told CNN. ""I think every national team has the same possibilities to win the World Cup. ""It's a very short competition and anything could happen, so our goal is to get into the final and to try to win it. ""There's no point going to a competition and just thinking: 'We're just going to play three games.' That's not the point if you want to make history."" The striker will take heart from his side's performance at the 2010 World Cup after it progressed from a group which included France, Uruguay and host nation, South Africa. The 25-year-old scored twice in the tournament before Mexico eventually crashed out to Argentina with a 3-1 defeat in the second round. Should El Tri get that far this time around it could come up against reigning champion Spain or 2010 runner-up Netherlands in the last 16. Hernandez, though, says the big boys of the tournament hold no fear for a nation competing at their sixth straight World Cup. ""If you want to win the World Cup you need to play against the best national teams in the world. We know that if we have a very good group stage and get through, obviously the teams that we could face in the next match are going to be very difficult,"" he said. ""But there's no easy national team really -- you need to play against the best."" Mexico's most impressive World Cup campaigns to date came in 1970 and 1986, where they made the quarterfinal stage as the tournament's hosts on both occasions. And Hernandez feels that with Brazil sharing similar conditions to his country of birth, El Tri have a better chance than many this summer. ""It's normal and it's logical that Mexico are going to find it a little bit easier because of the way the weather in Brazil,"" he added. ""It's quite similar to our country, and obviously for countries like England or other European countries which are colder or have a different type of weather, it's going to be a little more difficult for them."" Hernandez joined Manchester United in 2010 after impressing as a youngster at local Mexican side Club Deportivo Guadalajara, where he came through the youth ranks. Despite enjoying initial success at Old Trafford, he found life tough under manager David Moyes last season and was limited to just six Premier League starts. But Hernandez, who has racked up 58 caps for Mexico since making his international debut in 2009, is determined to put a frustrating campaign behind him and get back to his best in Brazil. ""It was a very difficult year for me especially because I couldn't play and I couldn't help my team,"" he said. ""But my head now is 100% on the national team. I'm very focused and very concentrated on this World Cup. ""I want to do my best, to give my best to my teammates and to the coaching staff. Like I told you, [I want] to try and make history in this World Cup."" Hernandez was reticent about his future at United and refused to talk about it while on international duty. But when asked to comment, he said: ""I think there is going to be time after [the World Cup] that I am going to speak about that.""","Javier Hernandez says Mexico are looking to make history at the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- WWE superstar wrestler Darren Young publicly came out as gay during an unplanned interview with the news entertainment website TMZ late Wednesday. He is the first openly gay wrestler in the organization -- which is the premier professional wrestling company -- according to a tweet by WWE Executive Vice President Stephanie McMahon. Young made the statement while at an airport baggage carrousel in Los Angeles after being asked if ""a gay wrestler could be successful within the WWE."" ""Absolutely. Look at me. Ya know. I'm a WWE superstar and to be honest with you, I'll tell you right now, I'm gay. And I'm happy. I'm very happy,"" Young said in response to the question. The revelation, which is not thought to be part of the wrestler's onscreen character, apparently caught the cameraman off guard. He stumbled over his response. ""Man, that's in ... that's ... sorry. I'm kinda' of flabbergasted man. I think ... I didn't know and obviously I think that's just ... I commend your bravery,"" the cameraman said. ""I don't think it matters. Does it matter? Does it matter to you?...Does it change what you think about me?"" Young rhetorically asked after making the statement. ""Not an iota,"" TMZ's cameraman said. ""In fact I commend you even more that you would share something so beautiful and personal with me."" ""We're all adults. All sports are physical. When I come to work, I come to work,"" Young said. ""Business is business."" He added, ""Some people might not like it, and some people will like it. When contacted by CNN for comment, World Wrestling Entertainment Inc., said, ""[The] WWE is proud of Darren Young for being open about his sexuality, and we will continue to support him as a WWE Superstar."" On Thursday, Young was expected to participate in an anti-bullying event in Los Angeles ""to teach children how to create positive environments for everyone regardless of age, race, religion or sexual orientation,"" WWE added in its statement. While Young's public disclosure made headlines, he is not the first wrestler to come out. In a posthumously released 2011 book, WWE and WCW star Chris Kanyon wrote about being both a gay man and pro wrestler. He committed suicide in April 2010 after battling with mental illness.","Darren Young made the revelation in an impromptu interview on TMZ late Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Paul Anthony Ciancia was a newcomer to Los Angeles -- a 23-year-old Catholic school graduate and son of a popular Fraternal Order of Police member back in New Jersey. According to a profile emerging of the suspected gunman, he also harbored anti-government views and fears of an ominous New World Order when he walked into Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. Police say Ciancia pulled an assault rifle out of a bag and opened fire in the airport, killing Transportation Security Administration officer Gerardo Hernandez, 39, and wounding several others, including at least two other agents, in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency. A federal criminal complaint was filed Saturday afternoon charging Ciancia with murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said. Investigators unable to interview suspect . Ciancia remained hospitalized Saturday. FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich described him as ""unresponsive."" ""We are unable to interview him, as of today,"" Bowdich said. Asked at a news conference if Ciancia had any known run-ins with TSA officers, Bowdich said, ""To this point, we have found none."" Shooter:""Are you TSA?"" Eyewitnesses said Friday's shooter walked from person to person, calmly asking, ""Hey, are you TSA?"" ""I just shook my head,"" Leon Saryan, a traveler at the airport, told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And he kept going."" Ciancia was eventually shot multiple times in the chest and taken into custody as he allegedly continued his eerily calm run through the airport's Terminal 3. He had enough ammunition to ""have literally killed everyone in that terminal,"" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. Ex-roommate in L.A. shocked . In the hours after the attack, with the terminal at one of the world's busiest airports still closed, authorities were piecing together a picture of the man in hopes of finding answers. If they're looking for telltale signs of trouble from before he moved to Los Angeles about a year and a half ago, nothing has emerged, at least publicly. John Mincey, who said Ciancia was his roommate in a Los Angeles apartment complex until February, said he was ""absolutely shocked"" by the charges. ""From knowing this guy, I can't believe that he would -- it just doesn't make sense,"" Mincey told CNN affiliate KABC-TV. ""He would always talk about documentaries he would watch,"" but Ciancia never talked about ""any hatred,"" Mincey said. Mincey told KABC he had lunch last week with Ciancia, who said he was going to New Jersey for the holidays and hoped to make amends with his family. Chaos, terror unfold inside LAX Terminal 3 . No history of mental illness in New Jersey . Allen Cummings, the police chief in Ciancia's hometown of Pennsville, New Jersey, said Ciancia has no history of violence or recorded mental illness. Family members told police he didn't seem troubled the last time they saw him -- when he visited family for a wedding this summer. ""Obviously, you know, they're upset,"" Cummings told CNN. ""I mean, this is a shock to them. It's a shock to our community."" Ciancia grew up in a quiet, wooded neighborhood just minutes from the Delaware Memorial Bridge, according to The News Journal in Wilmington, Delaware. Houses there are far apart, nestled in the woods at the end of driveways sometimes hundreds of feet long. He once worked in a popular auto repair shop owned by his father, an associate member of the local Fraternal Order of Police who neighbors say has always been known for how well he takes care of customers there. Remembered as quiet high school student . The younger Ciancia graduated in 2008 from an all-boys Catholic school, the Salesianum School, in Wilmington, according to Brendan P. Kennealey, the school president. Classmates there described him as awkward, saying he never fit in. ""In four years, I never heard a word out of his mouth,"" David Hamilton, who graduated with Ciancia in 2008, told the Los Angeles Times. ""He kept to himself and ate lunch alone a lot. I really don't remember any one person who was close to him."" Texts alarmed family . It wasn't immediately clear Saturday why he moved across the country. But that may have been where the first signs of trouble began to surface. In texts to his brother and father, Ciancia said he was unhappy and discouraged living in Los Angeles, according to an intelligence source with knowledge of the investigation. The source spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the ongoing investigation. It was one of those text messages that made his family think something bad was about to happen. ""Basically, the text message was just a message to the little brother, and the way it was written, they had some concern about it, and that's when they brought it to our attention,"" Cummings said. The intelligence source described his texts as ""angry"" and ""rambling."" LAX shooting underlines security vulnerabilities . Father called hometown police chief . The father called Cummings about 1:30 p.m. ET on Friday. Cummings, in turn, called the Los Angeles Police Department, asking them to check on him and make sure he was OK. When they checked, he wasn't home. The next Cummings heard, he said, were media reports linking Ciancia to the shooting. Angry note found on suspect . A note found on the alleged shooter paints a picture of an angry young man. The materials included a rant that appeared to refer to the New World Order as well as anti-TSA and anti-government claims, a federal law enforcement official said Saturday. The New World Order is a common conspiracy theory focused on a secretive group of international elites bent on controlling the planet and forming a one-world government. Sources: Note said ""kill TSA"" Investigators found information on the suspect expressing not just anti-federal government sentiment but also anger at the TSA specifically, according to a federal law enforcement official. Multiple reports cite police sources saying the note included language saying he wanted to ""kill TSA"" and ""pigs."" The evolution of those thoughts, and how they may have led to Friday's bloody shooting, is a story that is yet to unfold. ""We are currently investigating his background and more about him,"" FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich told reporters. CNN's Greg Botelho, David Simpson, Deborah Feyerick, Chelsea J. Carter, Joseph Netto and Paul Matadeen contributed to this report.","NEW: FBI unable to interview wounded LAX shooting suspect Paul Anthony Ciancia .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- Sunday could not have begun any better for South Africa's ruling African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela. As the autumn sun rose and warmed the seats of the 95,000-seater, calabash-shaped FNB Stadium, supporters poured in from across the country. By mid-morning the stadium was packed to the rafters. The beautiful, melodic songs used by activists through the years of struggle against apartheid until 1994 when Mandela was voted into power filled the stadium. Party activists crowed about the party's pulling power: no other political party in the country has yet managed to fill the stadium. This was the last political rally before new South Africa's fifth democratic elections are held. All the major parties staged political rallies, but the ANC sought to present a show of force as it attempts to swat off challenges from the relentless opposition Democratic Alliance and the upstart, Left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters launched a few months ago by expelled former ANC Youth leader Julius Malema. Then the ANC's leader, President Jacob Zuma, rose to address the packed stadium. Within half an hour of his plowing into a statistics-laden speech, nearly half the stadium seats were empty. A laborious and monotonous speaker at best, Zuma struggled through the speech, igniting only a few rounds of applause from die-hard supporters in the hour-long delivery. It was only at the end, when he burst into his election signature song Yinde Lendlela (""This Road Is Long,"" as opposed to his other favorite, ""Give Me My Machine Gun"") that some energy returned to the crowd. The scandal-soaked Zuma -- who was booed in front of U.S. President Barack Obama, Cuba's Raul Castro and other world leaders at the same stadium on December 10 last year during the memorial service for Nelson Mandela -- has become the most divisive figure in South African politics today and the pivot around which electioneering and questions about the country's future have swung. As he spoke, a scandal about the national ombudsman's report into how he unduly benefited from the building of a $25 million palace for him at his rural KwaZulu Natal village was intensifying. A $200 million town is also being built near his home, claimed a newspaper. Other scandals have wracked his administration since he came to power in 2009. Questions continue to be raised about his closeness to an Indian family that employs his son and wife and which landed a private jet filled with 200 wedding guests from India at a top-security military base; his evasion of more than 700 charges of fraud and corruption due to the influence of intelligence services and numerous suspect business connections by members of his family. In all these cases, Zuma has said that he did not know and that people abused his name to gain favor. Yet, despite the cocktail of scandals and gaffes that engulf Zuma, there is no doubt here that the ANC will win the election on Wednesday and Zuma will be returned to the presidency. According to a South African Sunday Times poll released on May 4, the ANC will get 63.9% of the vote, down from the 65.9% the party won in the 2009 general election. The opposition DA will increase its support to 23.7% while Malema's EFF party is expected to get 4.7%. If there is so much disenchantment with Zuma, then, why is he headed for victory? History, for one. In Zuma's speech on Sunday he went through a long list of achievements by the ANC in the 20 years of democracy. It is an impressive roll call: ubiquitous access to water, electricity and health services. About 16 million people are now on social grants while there is universal access to no-fee schools. The dignity of full citizenship has been restored to blacks like me, a powerful, deep act that resonates with many. We still enjoy a free and vigorous press, despite iniquitous new legislation waiting to be enacted by Zuma that will criminalize much newsgathering. Yet this narrative -- which the ANC has harnessed in its election slogan: ""We have a good story to tell"" -- is incomplete. Violent strikes over poor services are on a sharp increase, with the SA Police Services reporting a total of 569 protests in three months in South Africa's wealthiest province, Gauteng. About 122 of these turned violent. Reports of corruption are on the increase, with Transparency International's 2013 global Corruption Perception Index showing that South Africa has dropped 17 places since Zuma came to power in 2009. South Africa is currently ranked 72 out of 175 countries. The economy is taking a beating under Zuma, with paltry GDP growth of 1.9% last year and unemployment at 24.1% (narrowly defined) or a staggering 36% if one includes those who have given up looking for work. The EFF has found fertile ground among these disaffected youth, with an estimated 30,000 young people turning up to listen to Malema giving his final election speech on Sunday. So what happens after Wednesday? Increasingly, South Africa feels like a country caught between its past and its future. For many, the ANC represents the triumph against a heinous apartheid system. The memory of Mandela, so central to that victory, is still fresh. Leaving this party of freedom, which has enjoyed near 70% majorities in the late 1990s and early 2000s, feels like a betrayal of the struggle for freedom. Yet, slowly, all that is changing. A 63% win by the ANC, for example, will mean that the party is experiencing its second significant decline in two successive elections. With the growing discontent about its government, it is unlikely that it will claw back these losses at the next election in 2019. The opposition DA, for long regarded as a ""white party,"" is swiftly transforming. Advised by Barack Obama and Bill Clinton's former pollster, Stan Greenberg, it has encouraged the emergence of credible young black leaders. The EFF, in just five months, has become a force to be reckoned with. But both parties are only likely to give the ANC a real run for its money in the 2019 and 2024 elections. Many are hoping that the ANC will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures. Among these would be assessing the damage done to the party by Zuma's scandals, and a return to some regard for the people. Indeed, speculation is rife that Zuma may be ousted should the ANC's showing in this election fall to 60%. That is unlikely. Zuma controls about 75% of the ANC's national executive committee, and it is unlikely that his allies in that powerful body would cut him loose. Given that scenario, he will continue to inflict damage on the party of Mandela -- and on the nation's fortunes. That would open the window for a stronger challenge from the opposition in 2019 and beyond. On the other hand, President Zuma could attempt to introduce serious economic reforms to build a proud legacy for himself. That, too, seems unlikely. And so South Africa finds itself caught in a slow, glacial even, journey towards a multi-party future. Loyalty to its past heroes continues to hold it hostage.","South Africa's fifth democratic elections are held this Wednesday - first since Nelson Mandela's death .

"(CNN) -- No one has come out yet and explicitly suggested that old folks like me (I am about to turn 83) should be treated the way the Eskimos, as folklore has it, used to treat theirs: put on an ice floe and left to float away into the sunset. We are, however, coming dangerously close. A recent study by Dr. Alvin C. Kwok and his colleagues finds that surgery is common in the last year, month and week of life. Eighty-year-olds had a 35% chance of going under the knife in the last year of their lives; nearly one out of five Medicare recipients had surgery in their last month and one in 10 in their last week. Nobody doubts that some of these surgeries were necessary. But major medical and ethical figures argue that they reflect our reluctance to accept death or let go, the surgeons' activist interventionist orientation and the way the incentives are aligned. As the surgeon Atul Gawande put it in The New Yorker: ""Our medical system is excellent at trying to stave off death with eight-thousand-dollar-a-month chemotherapy, three-thousand-dollar-a-day intensive care, five-thousand-dollar-an-hour surgery. But, ultimately, death comes, and no one is good at knowing when to stop."" It remained for Daniel Callahan, an influential bioethicist and co-founder of the prestigious Hastings Center, a nonpartisan bioethics research institute in New York, to take the next step. In a May article in The New Republic, Callahan (with co-author Sherwin B. Nuland) argues for a cease-fire in America's ""war against death,"" calling on us to surrender gracefully; Americans thus ""may die earlier than [is now common], but they will die better deaths."" Focusing on care for the elderly, Callahan and Nuland warn that our present attitudes ""doom most of us to an old age that will end badly: with our declining bodies falling apart as they always have but devilishly -- and expensively -- stretching out the suffering and decay."" They hence call on us to abandon the ""traditional open-ended model"" (which assumes medical advances will continue unabated) in favor of more realistic priorities, namely reducing early death and improving the quality of life for everyone. They further advocate age-based prioritization, giving the highest to children and ""the lowest to those over 80."" The journalist Beth Baker summed up this position: ""After people have lived a reasonably full life of, say, 70 to 80 years, they should be offered high quality long-term care, home care, rehabilitation and income support, but not extraordinary and expensive medical procedures."" Baker's interview with Callahan reveals one reason this line of argument should be watched with great concern: Once we set an age after which we shall provide mainly palliative care, economic pressures may well push us to ratchet down the age. If 80 was a good number a few years ago, given the huge deficit and the pressure to cut Medicare expenditures, there seems no obvious reason not to lower the cut-off age to, say, 70. And nations that have weaker economies, the logic would follow, should cut off interventionist care at an even younger age. Say, 50 for Guatemala? Above all, age is the wrong criterion. The capacity to recover and return to a meaningful life is the proper criterion. Thus, if a person is young but has a terminal disease, say, advanced pancreatic cancer, and physicians determine that he has but a few months, maybe weeks, to live (a determination doctors often make), he may be spared aggressive interventions and be provided with mainly palliative care. In contrast, an 80-year-old with, say, pneumonia -- who can return to his family and friends to be loved and give love, contribute to the community through his volunteering and enjoy his retirement he earned with decades of work -- should be given all the treatments needed to return him to his life (which in my case includes a full-time job and some work on the side). We should learn to accept death more readily; we should stop aggressive interventions when there is little hope; we should provide dying people with palliative care to make their passing less painful and less traumatic. Such a case may not just be that of an elderly person succumbing to a terminal illness -- it can be that of a preemie born too early to survive, a youngster following a car wreck, a worker following a tragic accident. We should learn from the Eskimos -- they long ago stopped abandoning their elderly just because they got ""too"" old. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.","We're coming close to saying old people should be cast off, says Amitai Etzioni .
Some are arguing for a cease-fire in America's ""war against death,"" he writes .
Etzioni: Capacity to recover and return to a meaningful life is the proper criterion for intervention .
We should accept death and stop aggressive interventions when there's little hope, he says ."
"(CNN) -- Chris Brown's nightmare cross-country trip to face trial in Washington ended Monday five days after it began in Los Angeles. The singer's ""Con Air"" flight landed in the D.C. area, and he was escorted by U.S. marshals to a local jail where he will be locked up until his assault trial later this month, according to a Marshals Service spokesman. He had been chained at his ankles, waist and arms much of the time since marshals took him into custody from the Los Angeles County sheriff last Wednesday. Brown's lawyer failed to convince a judge at a hearing Monday that his assault charge in Washington should be dropped because of prosecutors' misconduct. Judge Patricia Wynn rejected the argument by Mark Geragos that the U.S. attorneys abused the grand jury process in preparation for Brown's trial. The singer and his bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, are charged with hitting a man on a sidewalk just blocks from the White House in October. But Wynn did grant Geragos' request to hold separate trials for Brown and Hollosy. The bodyguard's case will be tried first on April 17, with Brown's trial to follow on April 21, Geragos said. The would permit Hollosy to testify for Brown, he said. Although the charge is a misdemeanor and is unlikely to carry jail time for Brown if he is convicted, the arrest has put him behind bars because of his probation for an attack on ex-girlfriend Rihanna five years ago. Brown, 24, did not attend a hearing Monday in a Washington courtroom because he was still on his way to the nation's capital through the Justice Department's prison transport system. Planes, chains and automobiles: Chris Brown's miserable trip to trial . Even if Brown is acquitted, he could still have to return to Los Angeles the same way he got there -- in custody. Geragos could be expected to ask the Los Angeles judge to let Brown return to California on his own in that case. It's the difference between flying five hours in first class or spending five days in chains with federal prisoners as seat mates and marshals as flight attendants. He was ordered to jail after he was booted from a court-ordered rehab program last month, complicating his travel arrangements for the assault trial. A Los Angeles judge refused to release him to travel on his own because his California probation had been revoked as a result of his arrest in Washington. U.S. marshals picked Brown up in Los Angeles on Wednesday for the start of the trip to Washington. Con Air -- the nickname for the federal government's Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System -- involves heavily guarded passenger planes that hopscotch the country, picking up and dropping off prisoners. Brown's legal troubles began five years ago when he beat Rihanna as the two were in a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street. He pleaded guilty to felony assault in June 2009, which resulted in a sentence of five years of probation and 1,400 hours of community ""labor-oriented service."" The judge has revoked Brown's probation twice in the past year, most recently because of his Washington arrest. Brown voluntarily entered a rehab program a day after being released from a Washington jail in October, but he was kicked out a few days later for ""throwing a rock through his mother's car window"" after a family session at the center, a probation report said. Brown was upset because his mother said she wanted him to stay in treatment, the report said. Brown proceeded ""to walk outside and pick up a rock and threw it through his mother's car window and it shattered,"" according to a letter from the rehab center included in the probation report. His probation was revoked in November, but the judge allowed him to stay out of jail by entering a 90-day anger management and drug rehab program. Although he completed that program last month, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu, California, treatment facility until another hearing April 23. Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer ""continues to make great improvement"" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17. If he is convicted in that case, the judge would decide at an April 23 hearing whether Brown should complete his probation in jail. He was sent to jail March 14 after he was kicked out of the second rehab program for rules violations. The judge said he was concerned about a ""provocative"" statement that counselors said Brown wrote on a card at the Malibu rehab center. ""I am good at using guns and knives,"" according to a document read in court. The rehab program told Brown to leave because of that statement and two other rules violations, the document said. Brown refused a drug test -- which his lawyer denied -- and he touched elbows with a female patient, according to the document. Brown had been working on a highway cleanup labor crew in Los Angeles three days a week to fulfill the 750 hours of service remaining in his probation requirements, his probation report said. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year. With his community labor work now on hold, his probation is expected to extend into 2015. CNN's Carolyn Sung contributed to this report.","NEW: Chris Brown and a bodyguard will be tried separately starting on April 17 .

"Editor's note: Look for the Martha Stewart Halloween special issue, on newsstands now, and download the digital edition from the App Store. It's loaded with hundreds of ideas from the silly to the spooky (and every mood in between). (Martha Stewart Living) -- I love getting dressed up in fantastical costumes for Halloween—and luckily for me, most years I get to do it not once but twice. In addition to whatever I wear on October 31, I also undergo a complete transformation for our Halloween special issue (on newsstands now). In order to have this edition available in time for the holiday, we create costumes, carve pumpkins, bake treats, and make all manner of scary and unusual and bewitching decorations months in advance. Martha Stewart Living: 15 kitchen shortcuts that will change the way you cook . I thought you might like to go ""behind the scenes"" to find out a little about how we dream up these costumes. The notion of a ""Fairy GrandMartha"" first came about in March, when our special-projects group was planning the Halloween issue. I met with crafts director Marcie McGoldrick and told her that, this year, I wanted my costume to be something sweet and nice. (Some years I want it to be dark and mysterious.) The editors had already been planning a story inspired by classic fairy tales, so a fairygodmother character came to us naturally. I suggested a costume made of tulle, because it is so readily available and economical yet lends itself to beautiful and ethereal effects. Marcie began sketching ideas for a ""low-sew"" gown, requiring little stitching, and we discussed all the details: whether it should have a hood or a collar (we went with a dramatic collar), how my makeup should look (very sparkly), and how to wear my hair (up, with ringlets and tendrils). Martha Stewart Living: 19 tips for perfect laundry every time . On the day of the photo shoot, in June, I was very pleased to see the wooded wonderland the team had created in our studio—complete with moss and tree stumps from my farm. It took two and a half hours for me to get into full costume; I took a break about halfway through and walked the halls of our offices and test kitchens with my Fairy GrandMartha makeup on and my hair in curlers. (Funnily enough, colleagues were not too surprised to see me that way!) Martha Stewart Living: Instant organization: Get it together in 15 minutes or less . After all that, the photographs, shot by the very talented Fadil Berisha, took 25 minutes. I hope you try this costume—or maybe the Rapunzel or the Red Riding Hood or the Ogre in the special issue is more your style, or perhaps your kids would like to be elves or sprites—and enjoy the process of transformation as much as I did. Martha Stewart Living: 20 super-efficient, super-effective ways to clean all the things . The Fairy GrandMartha gown .

Sew to-gether layers along one long edge. gently pull thread at end to gather layers into a ruffle (this one is approximately 16 inches wide). Repeat with six 7-inch-long lay-ers of tulle. Hand-stitch ruffles together length-wise, near gathers. 2. Stack 6 layers of tulle that are as long as your desired gown. Sew them at one 108-inch end in same manner as ruffles, pulling thread to gather to the same width. 3. Hand-stitch neck ruffles to gown. Sew a 12-inch piece of grosgrain ribbon to end of stitching on each side. 4. To wear, tie ribbon behind neck. Leave top 3 layers of tulle loose in front of body, and pull other layers around waist, forming a skirt shape. Pin them together in back; tie ribbon around waist as a sash. Wear the gown over a pink unitard. Tulle won't unravel when cut—no hemming required.

"Sarasota, Florida (CNN) -- As children, they had a front row seat to history,­ to an event they did not understand. Startled and confused, they watched after the president of the United States receive the news that their country was under attack by terrorists. Today, as teenagers, they're reliving that moment with the death of the man who plotted those attacks, Osama bin Laden. ""It's obviously a relief,"" said Chantal Guerrero, 16. ""I think justice was served, because to do something like that, to so many innocent people, is not a normal thing or a moral thing to do,"" she said. ""I think the right call was made."" Chantal has lived with the specter of bin Laden since her once in a lifetime meeting with President George W. Bush was suddenly cut short by the September 11, 2001 attacks. ""You could just tell on his face that something happened,"" she said. ""I bet half of our class didn't even know what the World Trade Center was. I knew something not regular was going on."" The president came to Emma E. Booker Elementary School to tout education and celebrate the school's rising reading scores. As the class was preparing to read ""The Pet Goat"" to the president, Chief of Staff Andrew Card whispered in Bush's ear that the United States was under attack. Minutes later, ""he had to excuse himself to leave and he left the classroom,"" said Mariah Williams, 16, a junior at Sarasota Military Academy. ""All of the kids were leaving early and there was a bunch of confusion and people scared and stuff."" The rest of the story is history. But the tale of 9/11 has been woven in and out of their young lives ever since that Tuesday in September of 2001, when the president came to visit. ""I was really shocked because I didn't expect them to catch him at all because it's been 10 years"" Mariah Williams said of bin Laden. But what they also didn't expect was the fast track to maturity that has come with their place in history. Lenard Rivers is a junior defensive back on Sarasota High School's football team. He was age 7 when he shook the president's hand in 2001. The events of that day made a lasting impression. ""I know that anything can happen at any moment and things can change real quick,"" he said. For Guerrero, the almost-10-year saga, and her place in that classroom on that fateful day, was surreal and amazing, she said. ""I think it helped me realize and be a little more serious and learn how to deal with things more firsthand at a younger age,"" she said. ""It gives me a better appreciation for authority in this country, like our military, at a younger age as well."" Guerrero is an honors student who's looking forward to a career in music and dance. She says she will always remember that day, but Osama bin Laden's death at the hands of Navy SEALs is not the end of the impact. ""Maybe it was a little bit of closure, but it's not finished, because you're never going to be able to bring back those people that those families lost,"" she said. Guerrero has visited ground zero several times over the years, including about six months after the attacks. Her mother, Angeline Guerrero, thought that it was important to put that tragic day into perspective. The whole experience, she said, has helped her daughter grow up faster. ""She's an achiever and I really think it has to do with the impact it had on those kids that were there,"" Angeline Guerrero said. ""I think they just see the world differently."" But, she adds that the death of bin Laden is not the final chapter in this story, or in the war on terror. ""I don't think it ends anything because I always think there are others out there,"" she said. ""It ended him, but he still has people out there. I think it closed a chapter.""","""I think justice was served,"" says Chantal Guerrero, 16 .

His tireless struggle for freedom earned him the respect of the world. His humility, his compassion, and his humanity earned him their love. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Mandela family. To them we owe a debt of gratitude. They have sacrificed much and endured much so that our people could be free. Our thoughts are with his wife Mrs. Graca Machel, his former wife Ms. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, with his children, his grand-children, his great grand-children and the entire family. Our thoughts are with his friends, comrades and colleagues who fought alongside Madiba over the course of a lifetime of struggle. Our thoughts are with the South African people who today mourn the loss of the one person who, more than any other, came to embody their sense of a common nationhood. Our thoughts are with the millions of people across the world who embraced Madiba as their own, and who saw his cause as their cause. This is the moment of our deepest sorrow. Our nation has lost its greatest son. Yet, what made Nelson Mandela great was precisely what made him human. We saw in him what we seek in ourselves. And in him we saw so much of ourselves. Fellow South Africans, Nelson Mandela brought us together, and it is together that we will bid him farewell. Our beloved Madiba will be accorded a State Funeral. I have ordered that all flags of the Republic of South Africa be lowered to half-mast from tomorrow, 6 December, and to remain at half-mast until after the funeral. As we gather to pay our last respects, let us conduct ourselves with the dignity and respect that Madiba personified. Let us be mindful of his wishes and the wishes of his family. As we gather, wherever we are in the country and wherever we are in the world, let us recall the values for which Madiba fought. Let us reaffirm his vision of a society in which none is exploited, oppressed or dispossessed by another. Let us commit ourselves to strive together -- sparing neither strength nor courage -- to build a united, non-racial, non-sexist, democratic and prosperous South Africa. Let us express, each in our own way, the deep gratitude we feel for a life spent in service of the people of this country and in the cause of humanity. This is indeed the moment of our deepest sorrow. Yet it must also be the moment of our greatest determination. A determination to live as Madiba has lived, to strive as Madiba has strived and to not rest until we have realised his vision of a truly united South Africa, a peaceful and prosperous Africa, and a better world. We will always love you Madiba! May your soul rest in peace. God Bless Africa. Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika.","South African President Jacob Zuma says Nelson Mandela died Thursday .

"Charlotte, North Carolina (CNN) -- Republicans avoided a major headache on Tuesday night when Thom Tillis, the North Carolina house speaker and establishment favorite, won the Republican Senate nomination outright, dodging a protracted summer runoff fight against a grassroots-backed opponent. With an assist from big-spending outside groups, Tillis dispatched his two main primary rivals, tea party-backed Greg Brannon and the Baptist pastor Mark Harris, with relative ease, clearing the 40% mark needed to skirt a July runoff election. Tillis moves on to face Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan, one of the Senate's most endangered incumbents, in what's certain to be among the most negative -- and expensive -- races of 2014. 2014 midterms: Six factors between now and election day . But that wasn't the only story line unfolding on Tuesday. Here are five takeaways from primary night in North Carolina. 1. Republican establishment passes early test: The GOP establishment — that galaxy of Washington-based political operatives, national party committees and business groups who care first and foremost about winning — promised early on that they wouldn't let controversial candidates jeopardize their chances of re-taking the Senate this year. North Carolina was the first test in their mission to make sure that no Todd Akins, Christine O'Donnells or Richard Mourdocks would be on the Senate ballot in 2014. The Chamber of Commerce and the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads spent north of $2 million propping up state House Speaker Thom Tillis when the candidate himself lacked the resources to go on statewide television. A few weeks ago, most Republicans in North Carolina were predicting that Tillis would not be able to break 40% of the vote, thereby forcing a July runoff election. But with the help of outside spending, a largely error-free campaign and the inability of his underfunded grassroots challengers to land a punch, Tillis surged late and cleared the runoff hurdle easily. Republicans are breathing easier, confident they have the candidate with the best shot to beat Democrat Hagan. Key races to watch in 2014 . 2. Democrats open up the extremist playbook: The Democratic National Committee fired off a memo to reporters right after Tillis secured the GOP nomination. ""Thom Tillis: Extreme, Scandal Plagued Conservative: Bring It On,"" it was titled. No surprise there: For the better part of a year, Hagan's campaign has been planning to paint Tillis as a right-wing ideologue who, as state house speaker, curtailed voting rights, slashed education budgets and fought to limit women's access to contraception and abortion. They were just hoping he'd have to slog through a nasty Republican-on-Republican runoff first. Now the general election begins. Democrats will work overtime to render Tillis unacceptable to suburban women and middle class voters by hitting him on issues like women's health and wages. Tillis plans to tie Hagan to President Obama and his health care law at every turn. If that sounds like the dynamic of pretty much every other federal race in the country so far this year, well, that's because it is. 3. Rand Paul stumbles: Rand Paul gambled — and lost. After spending much of the last two years making nice with the GOP establishment as he lays groundwork for a 2016 presidential bid, Paul confounded Republicans by making a last minute trip to Charlotte to campaign for Brannon, a controversial tea party candidate who turned out to be Tillis' most serious primary opponent. Paul called Brannon a ""hero"" and a ""dragon slayer"" at a rally outside the NASCAR Hall of Fame on Monday, saying he would shake up the status quo in Washington. Brannon supporters hoped it would bring a last minute burst of energy to their upstart campaign. But for Paul-watchers, the appearance was a head-scratcher. A bloody Tillis-Brannon runoff was precisely the scenario that Washington Republicans who might help Paul in 2016 — including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, his fellow Kentuckian — were hoping to avoid. And while Paul had already endorsed Brannon, he was further grafting himself onto a flawed candidate who was recently found liable by a jury for misleading investors in a failed tech firm. The Kentucky senator said his endorsement was about principle. But Paul has also developed a reputation as a canny political operator who is taking a methodical approach to the presidential race. He didn't look very savvy in North Carolina, where he put his political muscle to the test but couldn't pull his favored candidate over the finish line. Paul was quick to save face. He endorsed Tillis on Facebook soon after the race was called, and urged Republicans to unite behind him. 4. Immigration fight fizzles: Rep. Renee Ellmers is a rare specimen: A House Republican who backs immigration reform, including a path to legalization for undocumented immigrants. She calls it ""an earned legal work status."" Conservatives, of course, call it ""amnesty."" Ellmers, a nurse from North Carolina's 2nd District who was elected in 2010 with tea party support, has been unapologetic, tangling with her constituents over the issue in town hall meetings and calling conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham ""ignorant"" during a recent on-air debate about immigration. Her immigration reform cheerleading drew the attention of a pro-immigration reform group backed by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which ran television ads on her behalf. But she also drew a conservative primary challenger: a radio talk show host and GOP perma-candidate named Frank Roche. Roche hit Ellmers hard, framing his entire candidacy as a referendum on Ellmers' support for immigration reform and her willingness to work with the GOP establishment. Roche's poorly funded campaign gave Ellmers a scare, but in the end she skated to a primary win. 5. Anti-war Republican survives: Rep. Walter Jones, a 20-year incumbent from the state's coastal 3rd District, faced perhaps the toughest challenge of his long career from Taylor Griffin, a Republican strategist and former George W. Bush administration official from Washington who returned to New Bern to run for the seat. Griffin's critique of Jones centered on the congressman's libertarian drift. Jones famously broke with his party over foreign policy during the Iraq War, calling it a mistake and predicting that former Vice President Dick Cheney will someday rot in hell. Jones became an ardent supporter of Ron Paul, voted to regulate Wall Street, and has been a regular thorn in the side of House Republican leaders like John Boehner, who kicked him off the House Financial Services committee in 2012. Griffin labeled Jones the ""most liberal"" Republican in Congress, a questionable line of attack considering Jones' fierce social conservatism. But Griffin worked hard and had the support of hawkish outside groups who ran blistering television and radio ads against Jones, and he picked up a a late endorsement from Sarah Palin. But it was probably too late. Jones, with his deep ties to the district, survived. Republicans in North Carolina, however, believe Griffin scuffed Jones up enough to make him vulnerable in 2016. That's if he doesn't retire first. GOP establishment 1, tea party 0 after NC Senate primary .

"(CNN) -- As Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin E. Dempsey is the top-ranking officer in the United States armed forces, the most powerful fighting machine the world has ever known. The Irish-American general married his high-school sweetheart, Deanie. They have three children, Chris, Megan and Caitlin. We even know the names of their sons- and daughter-in-law, as well as those of their grandchildren. I have no need to know these personal details, but it's a great comfort that the U.S. military feels it should make them freely available. It's part and parcel of the transparency and accountability that maintains trust in an open society. This trust is never absolute, and often betrayed. But there are peaceful mechanisms to question it, to tear it down and to restore it. Now consider China. As part of the triumvirate running the Central Military Commission up until his retirement in 2012, General Xu Caihou was of a comparable level of seniority to Dempsey. But all we know of him from official biographies is the dry details of his rise through the ranks. When he became the latest ""tiger"" caught in President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign last month, we were suddenly confronted with stories about his family's role in the sordid graft -- including a multimillion-dollar pre-paid debit card given to his daughter as a gift. She was arrested, along with her mother, according to media reports. Such high-profile cases are designed to lend credence to Xi's vow to root out corruption at all levels, taking down the tigers as well as the flies. His biggest scalp to date: former Politburo Standing Committee member Zhou Yongkang. Officials are reported to have seized at least $14.5 billion from his family, friends and associates. But the cases also highlight a fundamental flaw in China's political system: the state-sponsored veil of secrecy that shrouds the links between power and wealth, links that typically begin with the family. These ties are a problem for societies everywhere. Forbes in August exposed how Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of Angola's president, built a $3 billion fortune on ties to her father. Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan is embroiled in a corruption scandal involving his son. In China, this matters more. For a start, the success of its increasingly global economy acts as a potent advertisement for the Communist Party's political model. The Party's paranoid control of information about its leaders and their families is coupled with a massive state apparatus dedicated to repressing a free press that could otherwise be relied on to expose those ties. Former Chinese premier Wen Jiabao talked often of the need to ""govern in the sunshine,"" only for his family's corruption to be exposed in the New York Times in 2012. Earlier that year, the wealth Xi's family had amassed was documented by a team of Bloomberg journalists -- of which I was one. Both organizations continue to suffer well-reported repercussions from digging around in the forbidden zone that surrounds the ruling elite and their families. While Barack Obama's kids are photographed strolling along China's Great Wall, Xi's daughter, Xi Mingzhe, studied under a pseudonym at Harvard. There were unconfirmed whispers of an internship at a Wall Street bank. This kind of information matters far beyond the tittle-tattle of society pages in newspapers. Without knowing the ties binding wealth to power, it's impossible to truly understand the motives that guide policy and the deployment of capital. When North Korean leader Kim Jong-un last year purged and executed his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the official account included charges of corruption. Yet there were few commentators who saw anything but a campaign to remove a political opponent. For sure, North Korea is a grotesque and bankrupt mutation of China's political model, but at a fundamental level they remain alarmingly alike. Why should we be willing to accept Xi's rationale for the ongoing purges in China, and so hasty to reject Kim's? In truth, we can't and shouldn't believe either regime. There is one simple way for Xi to prove without doubt that he's the real deal: publish the family trees of the Politburo on the Communist Party website and introduce a public register of interests for all officials so that they can truly be under the supervision of the people. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Richardson.","Latest China corruption scandal: $14.5 billion seized from people around ex-security chief Zhou Yongkang .

"(CNN) -- Basketball Hall of Famer and former Los Angeles Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that he had arguments with Donald Sterling about his views on race. ""He would say, 'Well, that's the way I feel,"" Baylor said in his first national television remarks about Sterling since the scandal unfolded. ""Occasionally it might come up about players."" Baylor, who lost a lawsuit alleging he was fired by the team because of his age, said Sterling never directed racist language at him. But when asked if the longtime owner who now is banned for life from the league was a racist, Baylor didn't pause. ""Of course he is,"" Baylor said in an interview telecast on Wednesday. ""There's no doubt in my mind now."" Baylor's wife, Elaine, elaborated. ""He's not running around with a white robe on,"" she told Cooper. ""He's not that blatant. He's a very smart man, but he communicates how he feels and what he wants, especially to people who work for him. So you know where he is and what he wants."" Elgin Baylor said that he feels vindicated by the racist remarks that were released in an audio recording on TMZ's website last month even though he lost in court. Baylor's suit originally included the accusation that he was canned because of racism but that was taken out of the lawsuit. ""Justice has been served,"" he said. ""Now they know what Donald is like, and the things I said before about Donald are absolutely true."" One of those things Baylor had related was how Sterling on ""many occasions"" would bring women into the locker room and look at the players in the showers. ""Look at those beautiful black bodies. That's what he used to say,"" the NBA legend said. Baylor said he told Sterling several times to quit before the owner finally did so. The former GM, who spent 22 years directing player acquisitions, also told CNN how Sterling asked him to go out early in his career and scout playgrounds in the inner cities to see if he could find any talented players. The NBA is in the process of forcing Sterling, who has owned the team since it was in San Diego in 1981, to sell the franchise. Baylor foresees a potential legal fight. ""Donald likes the limelight, whether it's good or bad,"" he said. Baylor was the Clippers GM during many of their worst seasons. He joined the team in 1986 after a career in which he scored 23,149 points, which puts him 33rd on the list of all-time scorers in the NBA, and a stint as the coach of New Orleans Jazz. The Clippers were the joke of the league, though, and only made the playoffs three times. He was named NBA executive of the year in 2006 when the Clippers made the second round of the postseason, but two years later, he said he was fired. The team said he resigned. The audio recordings brought back memories, Baylor said. ""It didn't surprise me ... at all,"" he said. ""That's the Donald Sterling I know.""","Elgin Baylor once sued Sterling for age discrimination, but lost .

"(CNN) -- OK, I confess. I traveled to Japan carrying with me a number of preconceptions. For many years, my work in journalism and a lifelong passion to see the world have allowed me to explore scores of countries, but I had left Japan far from the top of my list. Big mistake. I did not expect a particularly fascinating place: I had vague images of Tokyo, a giant megalopolis of concrete buildings, of exorbitant prices, with heavy traffic and streams of salarymen in identical outfits filing to work every day. I pictured modern. I pictured not terribly interesting. I could not have been more wrong. Japan, as it turns out, is a captivating country, a kaleidoscope of ancient traditions swirling alongside modern technology. It is a land of creativity, of hip funkiness and conservative beauty, of business efficiency and dizzying fantasy. It is a place that can pamper your senses, often in the most unexpected ways. How did Japan surprise me? Let me count a few of the ways. Stylish in ways you have never seen . Yes, sure, there are men in gray suits. But the eyes have no time to rest on the boring or mundane. The Japanese are fashion-conscious, and many are dazzlingly creative in their personal appearance. A ride in Tokyo's subway or a walk down any major street will bring you face to face with looks that reveal detailed attention to beauty and a person-as-canvas philosophy. And it's not just in Tokyo. In Kyoto, for example, the ancient capital, one sees the super-hip youngsters but also the chic girls all done up, literally head to tabi-socked toe in traditional kimonos, walking through the old geisha district of Gion, as if trying to cut through the fog of time and sneak quietly into another era. These are the make-believe geisha, spending a few hours wrapped in the resplendent clothes of the past, meandering the streets alongside real geisha. If all I could do is watch the people go by, that alone would be worth another trip to Japan. Travel Snapshots: Japan . Technology meets tradition -- and fantasy . There was a time long ago, before everything was made in China, when every piece of technology seemed to come from Japan. Consider that Japan had the superfast bullet train, the Shinkansen, almost half a century ago. Japan is still a technology powerhouse. Brands like Sony, Panasonic, Nintendo and Toshiba sell their inventions around the world and in Japan, where technology and tradition sometimes create their own surreal world. The best place to see this is in the Tokyo district of Akihabara, known also as ""Electric Town."" Akihabara is, on the surface, a maze of electronics stores. You can buy robots, televisions, video games. But there's much more happening. As you walk down the streets, you notice people wearing baffling costumes. Akihabara has become home to what the Japanese call ""otaku,"" people with passionate interests in areas such as technology, role-playing video games and that singularly Japanese art form, manga comics. The neighborhood is home to countless manga stores and is filled with ""costume cafes."" You see girls dressed as French maids and other other fantasy characters. This is the world of ""cosplay"" (costume play), in which people play act characters from the stories they love. It's a blend of future and past, of technology and fantasy. In other areas, you see the curious Japanese affinity for ""cuteness"" kawaii, worthy of a full separate treatise. Not just big buildings and highways . Tokyo is big, so big it's hard to comprehend. The entire metropolitan area, a 35 million-person megalopolis, is the world's largest. But despite the oceans of humanity, Japanese architecture includes intimate, warm, exquisite buildings and parks that don't make you feel like an ant about to be crushed. Still, the masses of people are something to behold. And the place to behold them is the world's busiest pedestrian crossing, outside Tokyo's Shibuya station, which has deservedly made its way into many films. Besides the gasp-inducing view of thousands of people pouring in all directions when Shibuya's light changes, it's astonishing that traffic flows neatly when the light changes again. The Japanese generally follow the rules, and that keeps everything moving. Look at Osaka, or any major city, for evidence that the Japanese have built spectacular high-rises, great highways and a rail network rivaled by few, but they have also created other awe-inspiring structures with a powerful spiritual dimension. Beyond the urban jungle, there are exquisite gardens and temples. About 30 miles from Tokyo, in the old Shogun capital, Kamakura, stands one of the most breathtaking Buddha statues I have seen. The giant Buddha of Kamakura moved a traveler of his day, Rudyard Kipling, to admonish, ""O ye who tread the Narrow Way ... be gentle when the 'heathen' pray, To Buddha at Kamakura!"" Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples grace the landscape throughout Japan but nowhere in more moving, soothing and restoring fashion than in Kyoto. Like the rest of the country, Kyoto, the capital of Japan for a thousand years, is a city of contrasts. With nearly 1.5 million inhabitants, it is a modern metropolis. But the world has not seen a city quite like this. There are thousands of gabled Shinto shrines and serene Buddhist temples throughout the area. Some are right in the middle of town. And then there's the enchanting Gion district, with its low-slung wooden buildings and its enigmatic, centuries-old rhythms. In Gion, geisha still ply their often-misconstrued trade. The white-faced geisha, or geiko, as they are called here, are trained in the traditional Japanese arts of music, dance and tea ceremony. Their services are provided to entertain usually powerful men in Gion's old tea houses, mysterious and alluring behind their delicately latticed door fronts along Gion's narrow streets. The temples of Kyoto, with their elaborate gardens, languid willows, small lakes and countless red-orange torii gates, came as a soothing, moving surprise, a monument to Japan's quest for a unique spiritual beauty. But just as you are tempted to think of Kyoto as a remnant of history, of traditional arts and ancient religions, one discovers that Kyoto is also the birthplace of the Nintendo Wii and of cutting-edge novelist Haruki Murakami, as well as home to technology developers and brilliant 21st-century minds. Expensive? Yes. Affordable? Yes, that too . Among my preconceived notions of Japan, high prices took a crucial place. It was one of the reasons I postponed visiting, though I share Edna St. Vincent Millay's creed, ""there isn't a train I wouldn't take, no matter where it's going."" Japan is expensive. So expensive, at times, I thought my head would explode. As when I saw, for example, a single melon, beautifully positioned in its gift box, selling for $150, alongside boxed grapes, selling for about $8 for EACH grape. A taxi from Narita airport into Tokyo can run $350. You can pay $500 for a Wagyu steak, and a cup of coffee can set you back $8. But it doesn't have to. Forget taxis. Japan has efficient, affordable public transportation. And never mind the fancy restaurants if you want to stay on a budget. A rainbow of beautifully presented, relatively affordable food is available everywhere. Giant department stores, ""Depatos,"" have dazzling basements offering every food you can imagine, along with some you never did, from colorful sushi to sweet unagi (eel) to okonomiyaki. And the prices are not bankruptcy-inducing. The cleanest place in the world . In Japan, the virtue of cleanliness has spiritual origins. The Japanese place such a value on it that you suddenly discover it affects all aspects of life. Japan may be the last place on Earth where it is common to see women -- and occasionally men -- wearing white gloves. It may also be the first place where people regularly wear surgical masks, giving all of us bare-faced ones a better chance of dodging viruses. And no review of Japan's virtues would be honest without mentioning Japan's toilets, a marvel of modern technology and a cause for profound gratitude from travelers. This is no place for a disquisition on Japan's sanitary technology other than to offer a heartfelt arigato. Thank you. Arigato and bows all around to a country that prizes aesthetic principles, with countless people happy to help a confounded visitor and quick to oblige with preconception-busting, extraordinary surprises at every turn.

"Bangkok (CNN) -- Ousted Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra faces impeachment by the country's Senate, following her indictment by an anti-corruption body the day after a top court removed her from office. Members of the National Anti-Corruption Committee unanimously decided to indict Yingluck for dereliction of duty over her government's controversial rice subsidy scheme, NACC member Wicha Mahakun told reporters in Bangkok Thursday. The Senate will now vote on whether to impeach her. Asked how the 46-year-old could be impeached when she had already been dismissed from the premiership, Wicha said the case still needed to be reviewed by the Senate, as Yingluck could be banned from holding political office for five years if impeached. Analysts had speculated that Yingluck's replacement as caretaker prime minister, Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, may also be implicated in the affair, but Wicha did not announce any measures against the new premier. An NACC committee was also considering whether to file criminal charges against Yingluck, but had not yet found sufficient evidence, he said. The program, introduced in 2011, pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their rice, but has run into financial problems. Critics say it has wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with large stockpiles of rice it can't sell without losing money. Yingluck has previously said she was only in charge of developing policy around the scheme, not its day-to-day implementation, accusing the commission of unfair treatment. READ MORE: Yingluck denies corruption allegations over rice program . 'Political freefall' The news broke as both sides of Thailand's political divide are vowing mass rallies in Bangkok in the wake of the former prime minister's ousting, with analysts warning the country faces ""political freefall"" and the potential resumption of violent clashes. As tensions and rhetoric escalated Thursday, officials confirmed a grenade had been thrown at the house of one of the Constitutional Court judges whose ruling Wednesday forced Yingluck Shinawatra and nine cabinet ministers from office, in what her supporters see as a ""judicial coup."" Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, security advisor to the Prime Minister, said nobody was hurt in the early morning attack on the home of judge Jumpot Kaimook. ""It landed on his garage,"" he said. The court removed Yingluck, who was elected in 2011 and had been serving as caretaker prime minister until elections could be held, after finding her guilty of violating the country's constitution for reassigning a senior security official in 2011. The official was replaced by the then national police chief, whose role in turn was given to Priewpan Damapong, a relative of Yingluck. Damapong is the brother of the ex-wife of Thaksin Shinawatra, Yingluck's brother who was overthrown as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction. 'Polarization to intensify' The dismissal of Yingluck, who has been replaced by Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Niwatthamrong, has deepened Thailand's protracted political crisis, which has occasionally spilled over into deadly violence. Analysts say the move has heightened the risk of clashes between opposing camps, and made near-term compromise solutions unlikely. ""The post-Yingluck polarization is likely to deepen and intensify,"" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, political scientist at Chulalongkorn University. ""We are now looking at a political freefall... Much worse looks likely in the near term, before we can hope for improved circumstances in the longer term."" Analyst Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates, a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, said the court's removal of an elected prime minister on what he described as ""fairly weak"" grounds was viewed by the government's supporters as a case of politically motivated judicial overreach. ""They consider it a way to usurp democratic elections,"" he said. Yingluck is the third Thaksin-linked prime minister to be dismissed by the Constitutional Court, which also dissolved Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party in 2007, raising suspicions among government supporters that the institution was biased against them. Thitinan said the appointment as caretaker prime minister of Niwatthamrong, seen as closely affiliated to Yingluck and her brother, was poor judgment, especially when another deputy prime minister, Pongthep Thepkanchana, would have been a more acceptable compromise candidate. ""He lacks the stature and networks to see through an interim caretaker administration,"" he said. ""Nevertheless, no matter who comes in as the new caretaker, the tensions will mount."" Widening divide . Thailand's widening political divide pits anti-government, predominantly urban ""yellow shirt"" protesters against the pro-government, mainly rural and working class ""red shirts."" The yellow shirts, drawn mainly from Bangkok's middle class, royalist establishment, allege that Yingluck is her brother's puppet and seek to rid Thai politics of her family's influence. Led by the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), they began their protests in November, outraged by her government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for the return of Thaksin to the political fray in earnest. Parliament was then dissolved in December ahead of a February general election that was disrupted by anti-government protesters, and subsequently ruled invalid by the Constitutional Court. The yellow shirts are seeking a new government -- but not through elections, which the opposition Democrat Party has boycotted, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals makes widespread reform necessary before any meaningful vote can be held. ""They claim the Thaksin clan as they call (it) is corrupt and has dominated the country's politics, and the only way forward is to remove the Thaksin influence from politics and not have elections,"" said Quaglia. PDRC leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the Democrat Party, has instead called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" But Quaglia said the opposition's real motivation for avoiding elections was clear. ""The Democrat Party say 'No, we can't have elections,' because they know they will lose those elections."" In contrast, the red shirt supporters of Yingluck and her brother, many of whom hail the north and northeast of the country, accuse the court of bias against their side. Hundreds of protesters from the anti-government PDRC gathered in Bangkok Thursday as they have for six months, calling on supporters to join them for a mass rally Friday to push for a new government. PDRC spokesman Akanat Phrompan told CNN his movement did not recognize the legitimacy of the caretaker government. ""Currently there is no government to govern this country, so we must find a way to appoint a new government."" 'Breaking point' Meanwhile, the red shirts are planning their own rally in Bangkok Saturday to protest what Quaglia said they saw as ""a judicial coup."" In the wake of the court's ruling Wednesday, supporters at the red shirts' Bangkok headquarters were defiant. ""This is the breaking point now, everything is leading up to the breaking point,"" Kanthira Ketawandee, a Bangkok piano teacher and Yingluck supporter, told CNN. ""I would say Yingluck has died (in) her duty for democracy."" Thida Thavornset, a red shirt leader, urged supporters to join Saturday's rally. ""We won't give up until we win."" Elections are scheduled for July 20, but Thitinan said he believed it was ""unlikely"" that a vote would proceed in the wake of recent developments. ""The PDRC appears intent on pressing on for an appointment government of its preference, which can only galvanize red shirt protests,"" he said. ""A showdown is looming.""","Ousted Thai PM Yingluck Shinawatra will face impeachment proceedings .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Nearly seven decades after the end of World War II, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected Thursday to call for long-standing limits on the country's military to be eased to allow it to come to the aid of allies under attack. Abe's drive to revamp Japanese security policy comes at a time of rising tensions with China and concerns over North Korea's nuclear weapons program. But the prospect of a historic reinterpretation of the country's pacifist constitution has caused unease both within Japan and abroad. The United States, Tokyo's main ally and the nation that oversaw the adoption of the constitution in 1947, has supported the idea of Japan's military taking on a more assertive role in the world. As things stand, Japan can only use its military, known as the Self-Defense Forces, to defend itself. Article 9 of the constitution, written in the aftermath of Imperial Japan's defeat by the allies, says the Japanese people ""forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes."" If, for example, a U.S. ship came under attack in the Western Pacific, Japan would not be able to offer military help unless it was also threatened. Public opinion divided . Abe, who is eager to strengthen Tokyo's alliance with Washington, wants Japan to be able to participate in collective self-defense and take a more proactive role in peacekeeping missions. He set up an advisory panel on Japan's security policy, which delivered its report to him on Thursday. Abe is expected to announce his response to the panel's conclusions and outline how he plans to proceed. He is unlikely to try to change the constitution, a formidable political challenge that would need the backing of two-thirds of both houses of Parliament and a referendum. Instead, he is expected to propose a reinterpretation of the existing text. Opinion polls suggest Japan is deeply divided over the idea of such a change, with different surveys showing drastically different levels of support and opposition. The constitution, considered by many Japanese to have kept the country out of war since 1945, is widely respected. Using national security arguments to reinterpret the Constitution on the issue of collective self-defense would ""in effect, eviscerate the constitution,"" warned a commentary published Wednesday in The Asahi Shimbun, a leading English-language daily newspaper in Japan. U.S. support . But one of Abe's advisers, Tomohiko Taniguchi, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last month that Japan has adopted a ""strange interpretation"" of the constitution for ""historical reasons."" ""Everyone, every individual, and every nation"" has the right to ""act collectively with your like-minded peers,"" he said. A reinterpretation would still require the support of Abe's governing coalition, including the New Komeito Party, which is considered to have a strong pacifist leaning. The U.S. government, facing complex security challenges around the world, has made it clear it favors a change in Japan's military stance. ""The United States welcomes Japan's efforts to play a more proactive role in contributing to global and regional peace and stability, including reexamining the interpretation of its Constitution relating to the rights of collective self-defense,"" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said during a visit to Tokyo last month. Chinese criticism . However, China, whose rising military spending has been cited by Japanese officials as a reason to adapt, has voiced criticism of the suggested changes. ""Abe's goal, while stripping a nation of its pacifist identity, simultaneously serves to endanger the lives of the nation's citizens as their country remilitarizes and, for all intents and purposes, becomes 'war ready,'"" China's official news agency Xinhua said in an analysis article last week. Some commentators in the West have also expressed concern about the way Abe appears to be going about the policy overhaul. ""The government's 'reinterpretation' is the most profound challenge to the pacifist constitution since 1947,"" a column in the British magazine The Economist said this week. And an editorial in The New York Times warned that ""such an act would completely undermine the democratic process."" CNN's Will Ripley reported from Tokyo, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to outline plans to change defense policy .

"(CNN) -- A man who smashed a truck through the lobby of a Maryland TV news station and proclaimed himself God Tuesday was arrested hours later -- watching the ordeal unfold on the local news, authorities said. The unidentified 29-year-old man, described as mentally ill, was taken into custody without incident after his actions forced the lockdown and evacuation of WMAR and a nearby parochial school in Towson, near Baltimore, police said. Baltimore County Police Chief Jim Johnson told reporters that SWAT team officers closed in on the suspect as he was ""watching different channels"" in a station editing room -- ""watching you report this story as this incident unfolded."" Aware that the suspect was watching on TV, Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz said, authorities decided against releasing any information publicly until after the incident. The official Twitter account of Baltimore County Public Safety said the first call from WMAR was received at 11:45 a.m. There was a report of a disturbance, with a man banging on the door trying to get in. Within minutes, authorities said, there was another call about a truck crashing into the station lobby. Police said the suspect had ""contact"" with a security guard before making his way to the second-floor editing room. ""The individual was ranting and raving incoherent statements,"" Johnson said. ""It was clear from the very beginning that we were dealing with an emotionally disturbed subject."" Mike Marion, a commercial production producer at WMAR, told CNN that he was in his office when he heard a loud sound. ""I heard someone rattling the door in a violent manner and screaming started: 'Let me in, let me in, I'm (expletive) God. You have to let me inâ€Ž,'"" Marion said. ""I saw a young ... male in his 20s, no older than 30, blue oxford shirt with a black sling backpack, get into a large racing green landscaping truck. He backed it out of [the] visitors' space ... began ramming the building ... smashed through first section of atrium...The last thing I saw, the truck was fully in the lobby."" Marion said he never saw the suspect get out of the truck. The building was evacuated as officers searched for the suspect. No injuries were reported. All the while, WMAR journalists could relay information only via Twitter and the station's website. By mid-afternoon, a makeshift newsroom had been set up about a mile north of the station -- but the reporters still had no way to broadcast. Police said the truck was stolen Tuesday from a subcontractor with the State Highway Administration. Inside the station, police found sheaths for machetes believed to have been used by workers in the highway truck. They also recovered a satchel with unknown contents. The suspect had a golf club but no firearms, police said. Johnson said tactical officers responded to an ""active shooter"" incident, moving slowly and cautiously to the second floor. ""We could view him watching TV,"" the chief said. A dog was used to subdue the suspect, who was taken for a psychiatric evaluation before facing criminal charges, police said. The motive was unknown. CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","Suspect in custody after slamming into TV station .

"(CNN) -- There is mounting evidence that the electoral threat from the tea party is fading. In the power struggle between the tea party faction of the GOP and the ""establishment,"" the establishment is winning. Party primaries are an imperfect way to measure the direction in politics. The news from one week can be overshadowed by what happens a few weeks later. Primaries are just snapshots of the political landscape at a given moment. But at least this week the news for tea party advocates was not good. The primaries are providing evidence as to how much of a threat the Republican leadership really faces when opponents attempt to unseat them for moving too far to the center. House Speaker John Boehner faced a twin tea party challenge from Republicans who claim he has been too willing to compromise. The tea party campaign in his district picked up some steam after the speaker made disparaging remarks about colleagues who were holding up the immigration bill. Tea party candidates J.D. Winteregg and Eric Gurr both went after him. But Boehner enjoyed an easy victory Tuesday, putting aside speculation that discontent with his recent statements about immigration and the budget might cause him problems. There was never a genuine threat that he would be unseated, but a strong showing by his opponents would have been enough to send some shock waves to Washington. It didn't happen. A more serious contest is taking place in Kentucky, where on May 20, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces off against tea party Republican Matt Bevin. Thus far, all the evidence suggests that McConnell will do just fine in the primary. The primaries are also telling us something about the status of immigration as an issue in the GOP. The immigration reform legislation that passed the Senate has been held up by a faction of House tea party Republicans, equaling about 30 to 40 members, who have been steadfast in their refusal to let a bill pass. The opposition as well as threats of political harm made against anyone who dares speak in favor of reform has been a major barrier to passing legislation. Yet the evidence is still thin that taking a hard-line, anti-immigration stance is the only way for a Republican to survive. As Politico recently noted, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's pro-reform group FWD.us has argued that the threat has been exaggerated, pointing out that few Republicans who have supported immigration reform have lost. GOP establishment 1, tea party 0 after NC Senate primary . ""Purely from a quantitative standpoint, the percentage of GOP primary voters who are hostile to what we might call ... all manner of immigration reform is pretty low,"" said Jon Lerner, a pollster working for Zuckerberg's organization. Two Texas Republicans, Sam Johnson and John Carter, survived their primaries despite working on the immigration bill in the House. In his primary in March, Johnson won with more than 80% of the vote. This week in North Carolina, Rep. Renee Ellmers defeated Frank Roche, a former currency trader, who targeted her for support for more liberal policies toward immigrants. ""If an individual wants to come to this country to work, to provide for his family and to contribute to his community, he should be allowed to do so,"" she wrote. Roche attacked her for supporting ""de facto amnesty."" Ellmers won. The victory provides more evidence that proponents of immigration reform, and there are many, can move forward with legislation and survive. As one expert at Cornell Law School told CNN, ""If the primaries in spring and summer show immigration is not that big an issue with activists, then Republicans will feel they can go out on the limb and support reform."" The final lesson Tuesday has to do with the organizational and financial muscle of the tea party. Is it mostly bark, but no bite? This has been an issue that has dogged the tea party since it emerged in 2010. Can these activists really match the money and resources of the establishment? In certain campaigns, establishment organizations, allied with business, have been putting substantial amounts of money to shape the outcome. They spent big to support conservative candidates who would be viable in the general election against Democrats. In North Carolina, the primary between Thom Tillis, Mark Harris and Greg Brannon for the Republican candidacy in the race for the Senate seat currently held by Kay Hagan has been the center of attention. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky traveled to North Carolina to announce his support for Brannon. Groups such as American Crossroads -- Karl Rove's organization -- have invested millions to back their candidate, Tillis. Once again, the establishment won. Tillis secured well over the 40% threshold he needed to avoid some kind of runoff. His victory offers more fodder for those who have argued that tea party organizations such as the Tea Party Patriots and the Madison Project have been ineffective, squandering resources by spending more on fund-raising and direct mail than on their candidates. Brian Walsh, who had worked for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, even downplayed their ability to shape the grass roots. ""Their influence in terms of on-the-ground activity and spending money is greatly overstated. ... Their influence has generally been in the echo chamber, with talk radio and blogs."" It's important that this trend should not be seen as a victory of ""moderate"" Republicans over ""far right"" Republicans. The truth is that the entire GOP has shifted to the right, and these are all contests between different factions of conservative Republicanism rather than a true ideological war within the party. The tea party still has a lot to prove. This week's primaries only made its case that much harder. There are still opportunities for tea party Republicans to show they can deliver a punch on the campaign trail. But more poor showings at the polls will continue to strengthen the Republican establishment in its effort to quash the tea party as a political power in its caucus.","Julian Zelizer: In battle between tea party and establishment, the tea party is losing .

"(CNN) -- Archeologists in the historic city of Luxor, Egypt have unveiled two massive ancient statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III to the public. The newly restored quartzite statues, one of which is more than 11 meters high and weighs 250 tonnes, can be found at the funerary temple of Amenhotep III. They join a pair of already famous giants at the temple known as the Colossi of Memnon -- two 16-meter-high images of King Amenhotep III seated on his throne, also made of quartzite. The unveiling was presided over by German archaeologist Hourig Sourouzian, who heads the temple of Amenhotep III conservation project. The two new statues, discovered during excavations at the site, were originally in pieces before being restored and raised to their current standing position at the temple. According to the World Monument Fund (WMF), the temple of Amenhotep III was erected between 1390 and 1353 B.C. for the pharaoh. It was 100 meters wide and 600 meters long, but only the lower sections of the structure remain. The Colossi of Memnon, which mark the entrance of the temple of Amenhotep III, are the most visible remains of what was once the most richly ornamented of all Theban monuments, says the WMF. ""The temple structure was originally destroyed by earthquakes, and, since it was never fully excavated, the site was overgrown with vegetation and threatened by seasonal floods and agricultural development,"" says the organization. ""These problems were compounded by an increase in surface salts from rising groundwater, a by-product of the construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s."" Luxor, 635 kilometers from Cairo, is divided by the Nile into two areas commonly referred to as the East and West Bank -- the latter home to some of Egypt's most prized ancient temples and monuments. The unveiling comes at a time when Egypt's tourism sector is fighting to pull itself out of a slump due to political instability that's lingered since the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. According to the Daily News Egypt, Tourism Minister Hisham Zaazou said on Saturday that the tourism sector is completely collapsed, adding that great changes are needed to improve conditions.

"(CNN) -- A wildfire scorching Southern California prompted authorities to urge thousands to evacuate on Tuesday, though authorities appear to have gotten a better grip on the blaze as the day wore on. ""At the point that the fire is right now, we have a pretty good handle on it,"" San Diego Fire Chief Javier Mainar told reporters early Tuesday evening. ""We hope to do some more work through the night and into tomorrow, but I think that the largest part of the emergency has passed."" At one point late Tuesday afternoon, San Diego County announced on Twitter and its emergency department website that ""more than 20,000 homes and residences are being evacuated due to the Bernardo Fire."" But in a news conference Tuesday evening, County Sheriff Bill Gore that only 5,000 evacuation notices had been issued; he said that the 20,000 number may have come from an assumption of four people in each residence. Authorities initially said that most of the evacuations were in San Diego city limits. But by the evening, San Diego Police Chief Shelley Zimmerman estimated about 300 homes were still evacuated in select areas. Earlier, parents were told to pick up their children from three elementary schools because of the fire and an evacuation center was moved from one high school to another. Mainar, though, said he didn't see any reason now why classes in those elementary schools would not resume Wednesday. The fire began at 10:45 a.m. (1:45 p.m. ET), fanned by strong winds, according to the fire chief. ""It has been, to say the least, a very challenging day for local fire agencies and law enforcement agencies,"" Mainar said. ""It is unusual in May to have wind driven fires like this that prove to be such a challenge to contain."" For all those challenges, authorities said they don't know of any injuries or fatalities tied to the blaze. It had burned 800 acres and was 5% contained as of 7:50 p.m., according to CalFire. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for areas around San Diego through 8 p.m. Wednesday. As the agency noted, ""a red flag warning means that critical fire weather conditions are either occurring now or will shortly,"" with strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures feeding into ""extreme fire behavior."" Temperatures in the Southern California city are forecast to peak in the mid-90s Wednesday and Thursday with no sign of rain, before cooling somewhat later in the week.

"(CNN) -- Two registered sex offenders are accused of raping and killing four women in Southern California while the men were wearing GPS ankle-bracelets, authorities say. ""The GPS was in fact intact, attached to these suspects during the commissions of the crimes,"" Anaheim Police Chief Raul Quezada told reporters Monday. Steven Dean Gordon, 45, and Franc Cano, 27, were scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday, but the hearing was postponed until May 19 at the request of a defense attorney, authorities said. The two men were arrested Friday night. Their ankle monitors and the women's cell phone records helped authorities link the cases to the suspects, police said. The body of Jarrae Nykkole Estepp, 21, of Oklahoma, was found at an Anaheim recycling plant on March 14, Anaheim police said. The disappearances in Santa Ana of the three other women are being treated as homicides, although their bodies have not been found. Kianna Jackson, 20, was last reported seen on October 6; Josephine Vargas, 34, on October 24; and Martha Anaya, 28, on November 12. Both men had been convicted of sex crimes involving children: Gordon in 1992 and Cano in 2007. Each man had checked in with police every 30 days, as required, and authorities had no reason to watch them more closely, Anaheim Police Department spokesman Lt. Bob Dunn said. A state Department of Corrections official would not say what authorities may have known about the suspects' activity. ""Due to the complexity of the investigation, we are not at liberty to speak on those, but, however, the questions are coming forth to headquarters in Sacramento and, as time permits or we're allowed to, they will respond to your questions,"" Charles Dangerfield told reporters.

"San Diego (CNN) -- Mitt, we hardly knew ye. Or should I say, ""primo!"" As much as it embarrasses me to admit it, given some of his views and how he expresses them, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee and I could be distant cousins. Romney's father, George, was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, and so was my grandfather, Roman. Que? You didn't know that Mitt Romney was half-Mexican? It's true. In fact, if he makes it to the White House, in addition to becoming the first Mormon in the Oval Office, he could also be the nation's first Hispanic president. Don't laugh. Technically, Romney is just as ""Mexican"" as former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who was born of a Mexican mother and American father. When Richardson ran for the White House in 2008, he was often touted by the media as someone who would become the nation's first Hispanic president. Yet, I would imagine that a lot of Americans aren't aware of this branch of the Romney family tree, and that's because it is not a detail that Romney usually talks about publicly -- and especially not on the campaign trail. That changed this week when Romney -- in talking about his father, a self-made man who worked his way up from nothing to become head of American Motors Corporation, governor of Michigan and a Republican presidential candidate in 1968 -- told a crowd at the Rochester Opera House in New Hampshire that his father was born in Mexico and came to the United States at 5. Romney's great-grandfather, Miles Park Romney, fled the United States and crossed into Mexico in 1885 to escape religious persecution. He helped build the Mormon enclave of Colonia Juarez in Chihuahua. Miles Park Romney never became a Mexican citizen, and neither did his son, Gaskell, or grandson, George. They were all denied Mexican citizenship because statutes on the books in Mexico denied that right to American settlers and their offspring. Speaking to the crowd in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney compared his father's story to those of countless other immigrants who have come to this country seeking economic opportunity. My grandfather, a Mexican citizen, also came to the United States legally as a child in the early 1900s with his family, trying to escape the chaos of the Mexican Revolution. It was during the same time that Romney's grandfather, Gaskell, returned to the United States with his family, also legally and presumably for the same reason . Now, hold on to your sombrero. I'm an American, born in the United States to parents who were born in the United States. In fact, three of my four grandparents were born in the United States. And yet, growing up, people in my hometown in Central California referred to me and other Mexican-Americans like me as ""Mexican."" That was the shorthand. But comparing bloodlines, you could say that Romney is more ""Mexican"" than I am. After all, Romney is just one generation removed from our ancestral homeland; I'm two. This is ironic given that I've spent the last 20 years criticizing politicians who twist the facts, propose simple solutions and pick on those who don't have a voice. And Romney has spent the last several months doing precisely that, just like he did during his failed 2008 presidential bid. He has used illegal immigration as a weapon against Republican opponents who propose reasonable solutions and in the process portrayed illegal immigrants, most of whom come from Mexico, as takers who come to the United States for free public benefits and ought not be rewarded with ""amnesty."" We can expect Romney to continue that theme over the next week as he campaigns in South Carolina, where Republican primary voters will cast ballots on January 21 and where illegal immigration is a bigger issue than in Iowa or New Hampshire. Lawmakers in the Palmetto State recently passed a tough Arizona-style immigration law that requires local and state police to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect to be an illegal immigrant (read: Latinos). It's an approach that is wildly unpopular with Latinos and which has the blessing of most of the Republicans running for president, including Mitt Romney. And that's one reason why Romney, even if he is the GOP nominee for president, doesn't have much of a chance with Latino voters. Political experts say that a Republican would have to earn at least 30% of the Latino vote to win the White House. Given how he behaved in the primaries, Romney will be lucky to get 20%. In fact, a recent poll of Latino voters by the Pew Hispanic Center put the figure at 23%. While it found a high level of anger with President Barack Obama among Latinos over his aggressive deportation policies, the poll also found that -- in a Obama-Romney matchup -- the Democrat would easily beat the Republican, 68% to 23%. That's saying something given that, according to the survey, Obama's job approval rating with Latinos is just 49%. The takeaway: You want to make Obama more popular with Latinos? Easy. Pit him against Romney. Listen to Lionel Sosa, a San Antonio-based advertising executive and Republican strategist who has advised George W. Bush and John McCain. A few months ago, Sosa told The New York Times that Romney had blown his chance with Latinos. ""(Romney) can make as many trips to Florida and New Mexico and Colorado and other swing states that have a large Latino population,"" said Sosa, ""but he can write off the Latino vote."" It was Romney who recently promised to veto the Dream Act if he's elected president and if Congress passes the bill. The legislation, which would allow undocumented students to stay in the country legally if they complete a college degree or join the military, is extremely popular with Latinos. It was Romney who first attacked Texas Gov. Rick Perry for signing a law that allows illegal immigrants who live in Texas to pay in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. And it was Romney who later attacked former House Speaker Newt Gingrich for declaring that the GOP shouldn't support splitting up families and proposing a pathway for the undocumented to work legally in the United States. It was Romney who, in the debates, came across as naive by suggesting that the illegal immigration problem could be solved by simply putting more ""boots on the ground"" and as dishonest by not acknowledging the contributions that illegal immigrants make to the local, state and national economies. And it was Romney whose campaign put up, in New Hampshire, an offensive television ad that attacked Perry by linking him to Mexico and former Mexican President Vicente Fox, because Fox happened to agree with the Texas governor on letting illegal immigrants pay in-state tuition. So the candidate who winds up vilifying Mexico is the same one whose father was born in Mexico? Who can make sense of this? Listen up, Primo Mitt. You've made your bed. You're persona non grata with Latino voters, and it's your own fault. You can't win without them, but they can help make sure you lose. We don't care where your family's from. What matters is where your heart is. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","Mitt Romney told a crowd in New Hampshire of his father's Mexican roots .

Footballers are on display to the world, with a global audience of millions expected to tune in for the June 8-July 1 tournament in Poland and Ukraine. But rather than a desire to distinguish themselves from the crowd, Cashmore believes getting a tattoo is more footballers wanting to fit in with his peers. ""The majority of tattoo-wearers decorate their bodies because is it voguish, almost a membership to the Y-generation,"" said the academic, who is conducting research into how people view the future of Britain. ""It's less a desire to stand out, more an eagerness to blend in. As I said before, it functions as a permanent bodily membership card."" Cashmore says there is no one type of person who is more likely to get a tattoo than another, because different people have varying reasons for deciding to get ink done. ""There's no single impulse,"" he said. ""I have a friend who approaches tattoos like a collector: one he had carved in LA, one from Tokyo, Stockholm and other points on the world map. ""Others commemorate the birth of children, weddings or other notable days. Or their affiliation: my gym is in West Bromwich and West Bromwich Albion tattoos are abundant. ""At my gym, there is hardly anyone under the age of 45 -- and a few older -- without some tribal marks on their arms."" Cashmore thinks the apparent rise in people getting tattoos is closely linked to the importance that modern society places on the body and personal grooming. ""We care and tend for our bodies now in a way that would have been regarded as obsessive as recently as 15 years ago,"" he said. ""Think about the rising number of cosmetic surgery procedures in the UK, the money we spend on grooming products (especially male), the time we spend in the hairdressers, at the gym, tanning salons. ""We depilate (the removal of hair), oil, and pierce our bodies -- not for any specific function, but just because we are narcissists.""","Euro 2012, co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine, kicks off on Friday June 9 .

"(CNN) -- Twelve suspected al Qaeda militants were killed Thursday, said a high-level Yemeni government official who is being briefed on his nation's ongoing counterterrorism operations. The official characterized the operation as ""open warfare between the Yemeni military and al Qaeda."" ""It's a very tough fight,"" said the official. ""So far, dozens of Yemeni soldiers have been killed or wounded and dozens of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) members have been killed or wounded."" This is all part of a crackdown resulting in the deaths of more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 to 21, Yemeni officials have said. Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, according to a Yemeni official. The high-level Yemeni government official said Thursday that ""decisive battles"" are ongoing, with troops ""conducting ground operations still in the toughest areas."" He called the operation ""unprecedented."" ""They are pushing through and establishing security parameters in Baida and Hadramout and around Shabwa and Abyan, but this is still a tough battle,"" this official said. ""If you go in like this, all the way, and don't make it through, that could be devastating."" While the official noted the operations were going better than expected in Abyan, with the Yemeni army advancing there, he acknowledged that things in Shabwa ""aren't going as well."" ""It seems like the AQAP militants were ready for the operations,"" said the official. ""Resistance has been stronger and casualties among Yemeni military have been higher. Reinforcements are on their way."" The official said the country could use even more support from its from its allies, specifically bringing up ""our Saudi and American friends."" U.S. special operations troops have played a role in the offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. But no Americans took part in combat, a U.S. official has said. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","Official: Yemen's military is conducting an ""unprecedented"" operation against al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- A rare working model of the Apple 1, the tech giant's first desktop computer, sold for more than $671,000 over the weekend at an auction in Germany. The computer, along with a letter from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs to its original owner, is believed to be one of only six working Apple 1s and one of only three on the open market. The buyer, who chose to remain anonymous, is from the Far East, according to Uwe H. Breker of Auction Team Breker, which auctioned off a roster of vintage tech Saturday in Cologne. The Apple PC was expected to bring at least $400,000. But Breker said it's no surprise that it fetched more than 50% more. In November, his team auctioned a similar model for $640,000. Sotheby's New York sold one last year for $375,000. Prices for the rare devices have gone up since Jobs' death in 2011. In November 2010, Christie's auctioned an Apple 1 for $212,000. ""It's not only the technology of the world's first ready-to-use PC,"" Breker said in an e-mail to CNN. ""It's more the symbol of the American Dream -- the story of two dropouts who had a superb idea ... and 35 years later their company is the richest and highest-valued company ever."" Jobs and Steve Wozniak famously created the Apple computer in Jobs' family garage, building the device by hand and financing the company through the sale of Wozniak's fancy calculator and Jobs' VW camper van. About 200 Apple 1s were built, and fewer than 50 are believed to exist still -- most of them not in working order. Saturday's lot also included the letter from Jobs to a Fred Hatfield at Computer Data Systems in Columbus, Ohio. Dated January 18, 1978, the letter offers Hatfield the chance to trade in his Apple 1, and $400, for an Apple II. He obviously did not take Jobs up on the offer.","Only 200 Apple 1s were made, and only six are believed to be in working order .

"(CNN) -- Joe Torre, the fifth-winningest manager in major league baseball history, announced Friday he is retiring at the end of the season. The 70-year-old Torre will leave the Los Angeles Dodgers in the hands of his hitting coach, Don Mattingly, who has 2,318 victories fewer than his skipper. In his 29 seasons, Torre has managed the Dodgers, the New York Mets, the Atlanta Braves, the St. Louis Cardinals and, most famously, the New York Yankees. In the Bronx, Torre won four World Series titles and six league crowns but left New York after 12 years when he angrily rejected the Yankees contract offer after the 2007 season. The Dodgers went to the playoffs the first two seasons Torre managed the team, but are just 72-75 this season. ""It's not easy to just say you don't want to do something any more,"" Torre said. ""Baseball has been my life and hopefully will continue to be my life in some other capacity."" Torre said he will talk to Dodgers General Manager Ned Colletti next month about what his future role with the team will be, but it's best that Mattingly step in for the 2011 season. ""I think in this situation the ball club will be better served by Donnie,"" Torre said. Torre said it was still fun to manage, but he realized it was time to leave the game he entered in 1960 as a player with the Milwaukee Braves. Torre will likely go into the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager but he was also a very good hitter. In 1971, he was voted the National League MVP when he hit a league high .363 with the St. Louis Cardinals. Colletti was asked if any other candidates were interviewed for the job and said he discussed the issue with Major League Baseball about the hiring process before extending the offer to Mattingly without talking to any other prospective hires. Mattingly, 49, is a managerial novice, having only led the club a few times after Torre was ejected. The Dodgers had announced recently that he would manage this fall in an offseason league for up-and-coming young players. Mattingly, who was one of the most popular Yankees ever when he played, had interviewed in the past for the Yankees' position when Torre left and in the past offseason when the Indians were hiring (Manny Acta got the job). Mattingly has been a coach on Torre's bench for seven seasons. ""Are you ready?"" Frank McCourt, owner of the Dodgers, said to Mattingly after thanking Torre for reinstilling a winning attitude. ""I'm ready,"" Mattingly said. ""I know you're ready,"" McCourt said. ""I have a confidence in myself. I've been around the game a long time, not necessarily in the manager's seat,"" Mattingly said. ""I know people are going to question it, and that's understandable. But I know I can do it."" Mattingly said he will look for a veteran coach to step into his role. Torre is the third long-time manager to announce his retirement this season. Bobby Cox, fourth all-time in wins, will retire after the Atlanta Braves' last game. Lou Piniella left the Chicago Cubs in August to be with his ailing mother. He was 14th on the victories list.","Los Angeles Dodgers' Joe Torre to retire from managing after 29 seasons .

"Perth, Australia (CNN) -- The underwater hunt for wreckage of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has started in the southern Indian Ocean, the Australian agency coordinating search efforts said Friday. But the area where two naval ships are deploying sophisticated technology remains nothing more than an educated guess at where the plane may have hit the water. The Royal Navy survey ship HMS Echo and the Australian naval supply ship Ocean Shield are searching along a single 240-kilometer (150-mile) track, said retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the head of Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. The Ocean Shield is equipped with the TPL-25, a giant underwater microphone that will listen for the pings from the flight recorders and the Bluefin-21, an underwater robot that can scour the ocean bed, looking for signs of wreckage. Time is running out in the efforts to detect the pings, as the batteries that power the recorders' beacons are expected to run out in the coming days. And there are no big, new clues behind the area where the underwater search is concentrated. It's based on the same kind of analysis of radar, satellite and other data that investigators have used to determine a series of shifting search areas in recent weeks. ""The area of highest probability as to where the aircraft might have entered the water is the area where the underwater search will commence,"" Houston said at a news conference Friday. ""It's on the basis of data that arrived only recently, and it's the best data that is available."" 'Just a guess' Until searchers can find a confirmed piece of debris from the plane, which would give them a clearer idea of where the main wreckage might be located, there is no certainty the technology is being pointed in the right direction. ""Really the best we can do right now is put these assets in the best location -- the best guess we have -- and kind of let them go,"" U.S. Navy Cmdr. William Marks told CNN. ""Until we get conclusive evidence of debris, it is just a guess."" A huge search is also continuing above the waves. Friday's area of focus covers about 217,000 square kilometers (83,800 square miles) of the Indian Ocean, 1,700 kilometers (1,050 miles) northwest of the western Australian city of Perth, authorities said. A total of 14 aircraft and nine ships will scan the area over the course of the day. Officials have warned of a potentially prolonged hunt for the missing passenger jet, which vanished nearly four weeks ago with 239 people on board. Long days spent combing vast tracts of ocean have so far turned up no traces. 'We cannot be certain of success' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday described the search as ""the most difficult in human history"" and warned there was no guarantee the missing plane would be found. ""We cannot be certain of ultimate success in the search for MH370,"" he said at a news briefing in Perth, the western city that is serving as the hub for search operations. ""But we can be certain that we will spare no effort -- that we will not rest -- until we have done everything we humanly can."" Abbott was speaking during a visit to Perth by Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who met with members of the search teams who have been scouring a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean for traces of the jetliner. ""They told me of the difficulties of a search like this, of distance and weather and of maintaining morale over a long period,"" Najib said. His visit came on the 27th day of the hunt for the passenger jet, which disappeared March 8 over Southeast Asia. Investigators are yet to provide an explanation of why the plane flew way off course or pinpoint exactly where it ended up. Officials say that an analysis of the available data suggests the jet's journey finished in the southern Indian Ocean. 6 missteps in the investigation . 'Till hell freezes over' Weeks of combing vast areas of ocean have turned up plenty of floating junk, like old bits of fishing gear, but so far no sign of the plane. Authorities say they will persevere despite the challenges. ""We'll keep going till hell freezes over,"" Kim Beazley, Australia's former defense minister and current ambassador to the United States, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""It could take months, it could take years."" Malaysian officials held a briefing for Malaysian relatives of those aboard MH370 Thursday evening at a Kuala Lumpur hotel, but those present told CNN nothing new had emerged. Mohammad Sahril Shaari, whose cousin Mohammad Razahan Zamani was a honeymooning groom on the plane, said the three-hour session had felt like a ""waste of time."" He added, ""I was hoping for some news that they had tracked the plane or some parts of it, but nothing like that happened."" Selamat Bin Omar, the father of another passenger, Malaysian civil flight engineer Mohammed Khairul Amri Selamat, said officials explained in detail the satellite data that has led investigators to the search area in the southern Indian Ocean. But, he said, ""They could not tell us if the plane crashed. They said they were still looking into it."" Ocean Shield: A mission of hope in search for Flight 370 . Police investigation continues . With the hunt at sea so far proving fruitless, there are no signs of a breakthrough in the investigation into those on board the plane. All 227 passengers have been cleared of any role in hijacking or sabotage or having psychological or personal issues that might have played a role in the plane's disappearance, the inspector general of Malaysian police, Khalid Abu Bakar, told reporters Wednesday. Police said a review of a flight simulator found in a pilot's house proved inconclusive. And senior Malaysian government officials told CNN last week that authorities have found nothing about either of the two pilots to suggest a motive. There have been no such public comments about the other 10 crew members, however. Investigators are still questioning relatives of all of those on the plane -- having already interviewed about 170 people -- as well as those who may have had access to it. That includes scrutinizing those who prepared food for the flight, those who packed the cargo, and those who were to receive the cargo in China. ""Everything from beginning to end,"" said Khalid, stressing that getting answers won't be easy or quick. ""We have to clear every little thing,"" he said. ""You cannot hurry us in whatever we are doing."" His comments were echoed by K.S. Narendran, who spoke to CNN's Erin Burnett from India. His wife, Chandrika Sharma, was on the flight. ""This is an event that is so unprecedented and I think that is so significant that it can never be allowed to get off the screens, get off the radar,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- West Bromwich Albion may have thought they had done smart business when signing Nicolas Anelka on a free transfer last year, but he cost them dear on Monday. The Frenchman's controversial ""quenelle"" gesture in December has prompted the club's main sponsor to announce an end to their ongoing deal. After weeks of inactivity because of injury, Anelka celebrated his first English Premier League (EPL) goals of the season, against West Ham, by making a gesture that many believe is a Nazi salute in reverse. Linked to rising anti-Semitism in France, the ""quenelle"" has sat uncomfortably with West Brom's club sponsors Zoopla, a property website co-owned by a Jewish businessman, Alex Chesterman. On Monday, Zoopla said it will not renew its two-year deal beyond the end of the current season, so turning down the possibility of a one-year extension with the team lying thirteenth in the EPL. ""Zoopla has been reviewing its position over the past few weeks in light of the actions of striker, Nicolas Anelka, during the match against West Ham over the Christmas period and has decided to focus its attention on other marketing activities after this season,"" the company said in a statement. Anelka has insisted that the gesture, which involves pointing the right arm straight down and touching that arm with the left hand, was a dedication to his friend -- controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala, with whom the move is widely associated. ""(The) meaning (of) quenelle: anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this story! Of course, I am neither racist nor anti-Semitic,"" the footballer tweeted after the incident. Media reports in England last week had suggested that Zoopla wanted Anelka to be dropped for Monday night's match against Everton but the forward started a game that ended 1-1. When West Brom announced the partnership with Zoopla in May 2012, an official described it as ""the most comprehensive deal in the club's history."" The club reacted to Zoopla's statement by saying it had been aware that the sponsorship deal could end at the end of the current season and so ""has been planning accordingly"". Anelka is not the only sports star to be embroiled in controversy over the ""quenelle"". Several other French athletes -- basketballer Tony Parker as well as footballers Samir Nasri and Mamadou Sakho -- all having apologized for any offense caused when they were pictured making the gesture. It was popularized by Dieudonne, who ran in the European elections as an anti-Zionist and who has been fined several times in France for anti-Semitic commentary, a charge over which the 47-year-old faces an investigation by the Paris prosecutor's office. The French government recently banned one of Dieudonne's live performances, successfully doing so in Nantes earlier this month despite some intense legal wrangling. Anelka, meanwhile, is still waiting to hear his fate as the English Football Association concludes its investigation into the incident, which could result in a lengthy playing ban. After making the gesture at an EPL match in London on December 28, Anelka agreed to a West Brom request to avoid any repetition of the gesture.","West Brom lose backing of sponsors Zoopla in row over Anelka goal celebration .

"London (CNN) -- With her flaming red hair, Marilyn Monroe figure, and lurid green snake casually coiled around the arm, Jo-Jo Cranfield looks like a real-life muse emerging from a Salvador Dali painting. It's impossible not to stare at the neon python on her left wrist. But take a closer look and you'll discover that the reptile slithers in and out of the flesh like a psychedelic needle and thread. Cranfield is an amputee. And her fantastical arm -- described as everything from cool to creepy, and erotic -- is the work of a London designer reinventing the way we see prosthetic limbs. From stereo legs to feather arms, Sophie de Oliveira Barata's Alternative Limb Project crosses into the realm of surrealist art, yet with a very important function. ""It's drawing attention to their disability in a positive way,"" said de Oliveira Barata. ""Rather than people seeing what's missing, it's about what they've got. ""Having an alternative limb is about claiming control and saying 'I'm an individual and this reflects who I am.'"" Superhuman . De Oliveira Barata's remarkable work was thrust into the international spotlight last year when model and singer Viktoria Modesta wore her Swarovski crystal leg at the London Paralympics closing ceremony. Artificial limbs are usually designed to be as inconspicuous as possible. Yet here was an amputee proudly stretching her bejeweled leg before a stadium of flashing cameras and millions of TV viewers across the world. ""Generally the whole technology is moving towards trying to recapture a lifelike limb that looks realistic and also acts realistic in motion,"" said de Oliveira. ""In this instance I'm doing the complete opposite and I think it does capture that whole childlike imagination -- it's like being a superhero with super powers."" Read this: Are bionic superhumans on the horizon? Loud and proud . For Latvian-born Modesta, who had her left leg amputated below the knee as a teenager due to ongoing health problems, alternative limbs are as much a way of expressing herself as the clothes she wears. ""Being a self-confessed fashionista, things that I'm into tend to change all the time, and like most key pieces in my wardrobe I would only wear it a number of times,"" she said. ""The first time I wore a limb that was so obviously bionic, it gave me a total sense of uniqueness and feeling mutant human in the best way possible."" Interactive: Explore the bionic body . Similarly Cranfield, who tends to wear her snake arm on nights out with friends, says it makes her feel powerful and sexy. ""I wanted people to have to look at me twice with amazement,"" said Cranfield, a motivational speaker and para triathlete, who was born without an arm below the elbow. ""I'd rather people just asked me outright how I lost my arm. This is so out there -- like I'm wanting you to look at me -- that it makes people feel OK to ask questions."" A special effect . After studying special effects prosthetics for film and TV, de Oliveira Barata worked with a realistic prosthetics company for eight years, continuing to experiment with artistic limbs in her spare time. In 2009 she contacted Modesta with her unique idea for an alternative limb company, and the pair began collaborating on a groundbreaking stereo leg, replete with speakers and stiletto shoe. The prototype was a success and de Oliveira Barata's clients now range from ex-military men looking for a sci-fi leg to children wanting a secret compartment to store their pencils. The bespoke limbs cost between $4,600 and $21,000. Materials vary according to each design, but must be durable, lightweight, and water resistant. In Britain, the National Health Service currently only funds realistic limbs. But De Oliveira Barata argued that alternative prostheses could be just as beneficial. ""The dominant thinking is that a new limb should be as close a match to the previous limb as possible,"" she said. ""But until technology gets to the point where you can have a realistic looking limb in movement and aesthetics, there will always be this uncanny middle ground. ""Having an alternative limb embraces difference and can help create a sense of ownership and empowerment."" Moving with the times . Not just aesthetically pioneering, de Oliveira is now working on a new series of limbs with alternative functions. Swiss army knife arms with fold-out tools, nightclubbing legs that light up to music, and cooking arms with different attachments for kitchen appliances, are just some of the futuristic designs she's been working on as part of the project with special effects students at Hertfordshire University, in England. There is something undeniably playful about the project. After all, one of Cranfield's favorite tricks is walking around with her snake arm poking out the top of her bag. ""It provokes some strange reactions,"" she admitted. ""But I've never wanted to just fit in -- I've always wanted to be different.""","London designer Sophie de Oliveira Barata creates artistic limbs for amputees .

"(CNN) -- The Venezuelan government detained 243 protesters in a swift, predawn operation targeting four campsites set up at public squares around Caracas, the capital. Officials say the Thursday operation involved more than 900 members of the Venezuelan National Guard and police. But anti-government demonstrators who witnessed the operation complained about the way it was carried out. Pedro GÃ³mez, one of those staying at a campsite, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that ""the National Guard showed up and destroyed the campsite. They came against us in a totally violent way."" Venezuelan Peace and Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez said he had no option but to deploy security forces to ensure public safety. ""Beyond the protest movement they intended to maintain at the campsites, they had become generators of violence in those sectors of the city; they had committed acts of terrorism,"" Rodriguez said. In a televised conference, the minister also said security forces found illegal drugs, explosives, tear gas and weapons at the campsites belonging to many of the detained demonstrators. Clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces have left more than 40 people dead and around 800 injured since February, according to officials. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz said Thursday that 32 of the dead are civilians and the rest members of the National Guard and police. The crisis is cause for concern beyond Venezuela. The United Nations human rights office is voicing concern about the way security forces cleared the protesters' campsites at the four public squares. Rupert Colville, spokesman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, called on the Venezuelan government to ensure the right of freedom of expression. ""We unequivocally condemn all violence by all sides in Venezuela. We are particularly concerned at the reported excessive use of force by the authorities in response to protests,"" said Colville. In Washington, senators introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Venezuelan government officials who, they claim, are guilty of human rights violations. Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio was one of those leading the charge, making serious accusations against top Venezuelan government officials. ""There was a young man sodomized in Venezuela by government forces. There have been women that have been threatened,"" Rubio said. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro called the bill an act of aggression against Venezuela and promised a bold response, including shutting down Venezuelan consulates around the United States. ""If we have to close down consulates, if we have to close down the embassy in order to defend Venezuela, who is going to be affected? Huh? Those [Venezuelans] who live in the United States,"" Maduro said at a public event broadcast live on national TV. Venezuelan immigrants in Florida were not intimidated. Natalia Tovar, a Venezuelan-born Miami resident, was getting ready to travel to Washington. She told CNN affiliate WSVN she was making the journey in support of the bill, which includes economic sanctions against specific Venezuelan officials. ""Some of the other sanctions recognize Venezuela as a dictatorship, which it is, because right now we have high levels of censorship, we have scarcity, there's a medical crisis,"" Tovar said. Maduro says protesters are ""fascists and extreme right thugs"" who are trying to destabilize the government to promote a coup. Protesters call Maduro a dictator who has ruined the Venezuelan economy with failed socialist policies. The attempted rape of a young student on a university campus in the southwestern city of San Cristobal galvanized students, who took to the streets to speak against crime, shortages, blackouts and a dire economic situation.","Venezuelan authorities detain 243 protesters .

"(CNN) -- Is it ""Titanic"" for the faithful? ""Noah,"" starring Russell Crowe and directed by Darren Aronofsky, opened in theaters today, and the critics have plenty to say about the epic. For the most part, it appears the critics appreciate the efforts of both Crowe and Aronofsky -- who is best known for controversial films such as ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Black Swan"" -- even if they don't think the pair quite pull it off. Jordan Hoffman of Screen Crush says, ""This film's inscrutable oddness -- and the willingness to take chances -- brought me to a place that could not have predicted. During the film's third act I had no idea how this movie was going to end. Seriously. Even more exciting, once the credits rolled, I had to spend some time to work out how I felt. In fact, I'm still thinking about it."" ""Dark"" is how Nathan Adams of Film School Rejects describes the big-budget flick. ""There's a tension that runs through the whole film about who you should be rooting for, or if it's even possible to root for anyone in this situation,"" he writes. ""Noah goes to such dark places over the course of the movie that it's impossible to keep relating to him as a protagonist (sometimes to the point of comedy, intentional or otherwise), and it becomes necessary for the narrative to switch its viewpoint from character to character."" The headline for Alonso Duralde's review for The Wrap reads, ""Darren Aronofsky's biblical 'Waterworld' mostly runs aground."" Duralde says that ""Unlike the thousands of CGI beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on 'Noah,' Darren Aronofsky's highly-anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl; in no way is it a straightforward Bible tale (and given the brevity of Genesis' account of the flood, such a thing would be next to impossible) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak-out that fans of 'Black Swan,' 'Pi' or 'The Fountain' would expect from its director and co-writer (with Ari Handel)."" HitFix's Drew McWeeny writes that ""Noah"" ""is not just one of the most ambitious films I've seen this year, it's one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. It's a movie that is spilling over with ideas and images and emotional explorations of the metaphysical."" Opinion: Is 'Noah' sacred enough? Ty Burr of the Boston Globe says the film is ""equal parts ridiculous and magnificent."" And while noting that Crowe ""turns out to be perfectly cast in the title role,"" Burr writes that ""The parts of 'Noah' that don't work really, truly don't. But the parts that do almost sweep you away in the flood."" As the Washington Post notes, the film has had its fair share of controversy, including complaints that there is a lack of mention of God in the film. Post film critic Ann Hornaday calls it a slightly different take on the biblical story and writes, ""The result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist, a go-for-broke throwback to Hollywood biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace, as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement. ""Viewers may not agree about what they've seen when they come out of 'Noah,' "" she said. ""But there's no doubt that Aronofsky has made an ambitious, serious, even visionary motion picture, whose super-sized popcorn-movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the story's more reflective implications, but never drowns them entirely."" Likewise, Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cautions, ""My advice: Hold off on burning Aronofsky at the stake till you see Noah, a film of grit, grace and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core. The Brooklyn-born Aronofsky and his Harvard roomie and writing partner, Ari Handel -- 'two not very religious Jewish guys,' says the director -- are hellbent on making their Noah relevant for believers and skeptics alike.""","Darren Aronofsky's ""Noah"" opens today .

"(CNN) -- Colorado lawmakers on Wednesday approved a bill that would create financial services cooperatives specifically for licensed marijuana businesses in the state. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is expected to sign the bill, according to his office. The legislation comes three months after the Justice Department issued rules for the first time allowing banks to legally provide financial services to marijuana merchants. Because marijuana is illegal under federal law, banks have been ""reluctant"" to provide services to licensed pot sellers, according to the bill, HB 1398. As a result, these businesses often operate on a cash-only basis, a practice that Hickenlooper calls ""an invitation to corruption and criminal activity."" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in January that forcing marijuana businesses to be cash businesses, because they can't access banks, is a public safety problem. ""Huge amounts of cash, substantial amounts of cash, just kind of lying around with no place for it to appropriately deposited is something that would worry me from just a law enforcement perspective,"" he said. Colorado became the first state in the nation to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, allowing pot stores to open for business on January 1. Under the bill, cannabis credit co-ops cannot refer to themselves as credit unions or banks and do not need deposit insurance. The co-ops will be subject to taxation, according to the bill.

"(CNN) -- It's already capable of carrying more passengers than any other commercial aircraft, but the Airbus A380 could be about to squeeze in a few extra. In a move that adds a dose of economic reality to airline dreams of luxuriously pimped superjumbos, the plane's manufacturer says that next week it will unveil a new 11-seat-row economy-class configuration. By raising the three seats next to each window a few inches to take advantage of extra fuselage space, Airbus says it will create enough room to accommodate five people in the middle of the plane. While the prospect of spending a long haul flight stuck in the middle seat might be unappealing for passengers, Airbus says it makes sense for airline revenues. ""Several customers are saying they are interested in looking at ways of making the aircraft more productive,"" Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon tells CNN. Murdo Morrison, editor of Flightglobal magazine, says the new configuration indicates that financial realities are catching up with airlines, which once promised to fill their A380s with casinos and double beds. He says sales of the European manufacturer's flagship have been disappointing since the plane was launched in October 2007. ""With the price of fuel going up so much, the focus for airlines is economizing and trying to get as many passengers as possible into an aircraft,"" he tells CNN. Raised capacity . Dubon says the extra seats, which won't compromise on the existing 18-inch width of current chairs, would raise economy-class capacity by 7%. This would mean 30 more seats in a standard cabin layout, but even when full would put the A380 well short of its maximum load capacity. ""The middle seats will be the last ones filled,"" he says, adding that the center seats could prove popular with families. Airbus declined to reveal which airlines were pushing for increased capacity, but says 11-seat mockups will go on display at the Aircraft Interiors Expo in Hamburg, Germany, from April 8-10. Morrison says that while few passengers will rush to claim the center seats, there will be no significant increase in discomfort. ""The drawback of any five-seat block is, if you are in the middle, you've always got two people to climb over, but you've already got that if you're in the window seat of a block of three,"" he says. ""Ultimately it is the airline's decision -- they have to get the balance between adding seat capacity and what the passengers will put up with. ""If you pack in too many it becomes claustrophobic and that could have a detrimental affect on the airline.""","Airbus says it will unveil new economy class seating configuration that puts 11 seats in a row of its A380 superjumbo .

"(CNN) -- A man can do a lot of things in 13 years. Cornealious ""Mike"" Anderson was able to open several construction businesses, start a family, coach his son's football team and volunteer at his church. What he wasn't doing most of that time was serving jail time. Convicted of taking part in a robbery at a Burger King in St. Charles, Missouri, in 1999, Anderson was given a 13-year sentence. When his appeals ran out in 2002, he was supposed to report to prison, but the call never came. Corrections officials didn't discover the clerical error until July, when his original sentence would have ended, and they sent U.S. marshals to arrest him. On Monday, Anderson walked out of the Mississippi County Courthouse a free man, given credit for the 4,794 days between his conviction and when he was arrested last year. ""I walked by faith this whole time, my family and I,"" Anderson told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday. Judge Terry Brown said he didn't see any point in keeping Anderson, 36, in prison. ""I believe continuing to incarcerate you serves no purpose, would be a waste of taxpayer dollars and punish a good man,"" Brown said at a 10-minute court session. The tears flowed when the judge granted Anderson's release. Hugs came from his wife and daughter, his mom and his attorney, video from affiliate KMOV showed. ""I was young, and that's something I don't even like to talk about,"" he said. ""That's not who I was. It was just something that should have never happened."" No arrest warrant for him . At the time of the crime, he was 22 years old, and he said he could not fathom spending the next 13 years in prison. At the time, his attorney warned him that authorities had not arrested him because they thought he was already in jail. The U.S. Marshals Service told the attorney that they couldn't arrest Anderson because there was no arrest warrant for him. But the mistake will be found, the lawyer said, telling Anderson to be ready to be picked up at any moment. But the years went by, and that day didn't come for 13 years. ""You know, them pulling me back was motivation, but my main motivation was (that) I turned my life around,"" Anderson said. ""I gave my life to the Lord, and I didn't want to do anything that displeased God."" Attorney General Chris Koster said setting him free was the right thing to do. ""From the outset, I have proposed a solution that balances the seriousness of Mr. Anderson's crime with the mistake made by the criminal justice system and Mr. Anderson's lack of a criminal record over the past 13 years,"" he said. Monday's outcome ""appears to appropriately balance the facts as we understand them."" Anderson's plight attracted international attention. A Change.org petition lobbied for his release in recent months and attracted more than 35,000 signatures. For his wife, LaQonna Anderson, it means her husband is back home and their family complete for the first time since July. ""I'm very, very, very happy,"" she said. ""I thank everybody for all their support."" CNN's Jennifer Feldman and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Cornealious ""Mike"" Anderson was convicted of robbery in 1999 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- It's not every day that a sheriff's deputy responds to a call on a water buffalo attack, especially in Florida, where they simply don't exist. But in the Florida Keys,  a man frantically called 911 early Friday after the stuffed water buffalo head hanging on his wall fell on top of him as he slept in his living room recliner. The animal head was so heavy he couldn't move it, but he was able to reach his nearby cell phone to call for help, according to deputies with the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. ""I was just sitting there and watching the news and kabbam,"" said Jim Harris, 56, of Islamorada, Florida. ""Then it had me pinned, and that really sucked,"" he told CNN. Sheriff's deputies removed the buffalo head so that paramedics could attend to Harris. ""It weighed at least a couple hundred pounds,"" said firefighter paramedic Kyle Burkel. ""It mostly damaged his pride,"" said Burkel. ""He said to me, what are the odds of this happening ? I said, '""You were sitting under a buffalo head, so they were probably pretty good.'"" Harris was taken to nearby Mariner's Hospital where he was treated for minor injuries and sent home to rest -- on his recliner . On the 911 calls, Harris is heard shouting out his address. ""I'm trapped,"" he breathlessly tells operators. ""I think a f------ buffalo fell on me,"" he told them. Harris, who owns a water filter company in the Keys, rents the home from a friend.  He says he's getting rid of the water buffalo head. ""I f------ got my ass kicked by a buffalo, imagine if it was alive,.what they could do.  Oh my god,"" he said. Today, he says he's feeling the after effects of his run in with this long dead animal. ""My neck, my shoulder, my back, my face.  I feel like i've been in the ring with Ali,"" he said. Firefighter's say one of Harris' arms was pinned by the huge head. ""He even had a glass of milk sitting on his night stand, and the only thing he could reach was his phone,"" said Burkel. Alive, water buffalo can weigh up to about 2,500 pounds and grow to about 6 feet tall and about nine feet long.  Their heads including their horns can be about six feet wide. The gigantic animal is native to south Asia, where some still live in the wild, but some are kept in herds all over the world, mostly for meat or cheese production. ""This is karma,"" said Harris. ""Someone shot this thing and now it's payback, but he got the wrong fella.  I didn't shoot him.""","Huge animal head fell from wall, pinning man beneath .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- The second son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared via a video link Sunday at his trial at a court in Tripoli, where he and dozens of former senior regime officials face charges for crimes they are accused of committing during the 2011 revolution. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, once his father's heir apparent, has been held in the western mountain city of Zintan by the militiamen who captured him in 2011. The group has refused to hand him over to the central government, citing security concerns and lawlessness in the capital. The trial was held under tight security with roads leading to Tripoli's al-Hadba prison blocked off by security forces and gunmen positioned on the building's rooftop. The judge read the charges against the defendants, which included the killing of protesters -- a crime punishable by a death sentence -- and other alleged crimes to try and suppress the 2011 uprising. Among the 23 defendants present at the hearing were Abdullah al-Senussi, the elder Gadhafi's brother-in-law and former spy chief, former Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi and the regime's head of foreign intelligence, Buzeid Durda. Eight other defendants held in the city of Misrata also appeared via video link at the trial. After more than two years in prison, Senussi, who was extradited from Mauritania, appeared frail and had lost weight. Gadhafi seemed relaxed and frequently smiled during the two-hour proceeding. In response to the judge's question on whether he had a lawyer, Gadhafi responded twice, saying, ""I have God"". He later said he did not have a lawyer, and the court ordered one to be appointed for him. The International Criminal Court in the Hague indicted Gadhafi and Senussi on war crimes, but Libya refused to hand them over, arguing they had to face justice in their own country. Although the international court granted Libya the right to try Senussi last year, his ICC-appointed lawyer was appealing the ruling. Some defendants complained about not having enough access to their lawyers, and Senussi asked the court to allow foreign lawyers to represent him because Libyan lawyers, he said, were not able to do so. Rights groups have raised concerns about Libya's ability to provide the defendants with a fair trial. ""The case of 30+ former Gadhafi officials has been problematic from a procedural point of view from the onset as some defendants, including Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and Abdullah Senussi, both held in isolation in different locations, still do not have access to a lawyer and were not able to review court documents,"" said Hanan Salah, a Libya researcher for Human Rights Watch. ""In cases involving the death penalty, it is more important than ever to adhere to fair trial standards."" There have also been concerns about the use of the video link in this trial. ""Every defendant should have the right to communicate and consult without delay and in full confidentiality with their lawyers before and during a trial. The current arrangements in which some defendants are physically separated from the court and their lawyers cast doubt over respect for these rights and some defendants risk being mere spectators in their own trial,"" said Salah, who was observing Sunday's proceedings in Tripoli. The judge adjourned the trial to May 11.","Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was the heir apparent before father, Moammar, was ousted .

"(CNN) -- Draped in a white shroud, the body of a man is engulfed in flames atop a massive pile of wood, the insatiable fire churning out ashes for hours. A few yards away, a group of mourners chants prayers as the stench of burning flesh guides a billowing cloud of black smoke high into the Indian sky. This is a traditional Hindu funeral pyre -- an ancient ritual that goes back thousands of years in which devotees cremate bodies by burning firewood in an open ground. ""The smoke is all around the ground,"" said Ankur Agrawal, a 31-year-old iron merchant who recently attended the final rites of his uncle at a cremation ground in the city of Moradabad in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. ""There is a lot of consumption of wood,"" he added. And it's because of this that these ceremonies, designed to release the soul from mortal flesh, pose a threat to the living, according to some environmentalists. Fifty to 60 million trees are burned during cremations every year in India, according to Mokshda, a Delhi-based NGO working to reduce the environmental impact of funeral pyres. ""When you are burning those trees, you are emitting about eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide or greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Mokshda director Anshul Garg. Air pollution and deforestation are not the only environmental threats caused by cremation: They also generate large quantities of ash, which are later thrown into rivers, adding to the toxicity of their waters, according to Mokshda. More than seven million Hindus die each year in India and the sight of corpses surrendering to the flames of traditional funeral pyres is part of the country's daily cycle of life. New Delhi has about 400 traditional cremation grounds, while Mumbai has around 300, according to Mokshda. In order to tackle the environmental problems stemming from these sites, the Indian government and environmental groups have, over the years, promoted the use of electric systems as an alternate way of cremation. But these systems, which burn no wood and generate no smoke, have by-and-large failed, mainly due to financial and religious reasons. They were expensive to run but, crucially, traditional rituals -- such as kapal kriya, where a stick or long bamboo pole is used to crack open the burning skull to free soul from its earthly existence -- were impossible. Mokshda, however, claims it has created an alternative system that addresses these problems: It says its affordable, energy-efficient ""Green Cremation System"" generates minimum air and water pollution, while taking into consideration the religious needs of Hindus. The wood-based system consists of a man-sized grate beneath a roof and a chimney, which reduces heat loss. The wood is placed on the metal base, which enables better air circulation around the flames. Garg says the benefits are manifold: It takes up to two hours and 150-200 kilograms of wood to burn a body completely, while a traditional pyre takes six hours and burns 500-600 kilograms of wood. As a result, he says, the cost is reduced significantly and emissions are cut by up to 60%. Jay Lakhani, director of the UK-based Hindu Academy, which looks at the religion in contemporary society, says such initiatives have a positive impact on the wider community. He said: ""All these are welcome moves because this is hanging on to tradition as well as making sure the environment is safeguarded. ""There are many such institutions in India that are trying to be environmental-friendly and also of course if you can do it in a more economical way it will be cheaper for the families, so it benefits everybody."" For Agrawal, who attended a cremation using Mokshda's innovation about two months ago, one of the big advantages of this system is that mourners can continue to fulfill all traditional rites. ""It has such kind of quality,"" he said. ""It allows us to perform all the rituals."" Mokshda, which began operations in 1992, says it has installed 42 units across the country, mainly in urban areas, and plans to increase the number to 50 by next year. Yet, the group's expansion has not been without issues: Garg says Mokshda is facing problems from the ""wood mafia"" -- people illegally cutting down trees to sell for funeral pyres. ""They even go to the extent of threatening our people,"" said Garg. ""If they (our people) go to install and promote these systems we get threatening calls: 'You don't come in our city, don't put up these systems or we will hunt you.'"" But despite the challenges, the group says it is optimistic about the future. It has convinced the government to come forward and provide funding and also engaged the corporate sector to help install its green cremation units under their corporate social responsibility plan. So far, Mokshda has surveyed over 2,000 cremation grounds across India and has conducted seminars and workshops, asking people for feedback so they can improve their system. ""We are now promoting it on a larger scale,"" said Garg. ""It has the sentiments and the feelings of the people at heart, so we have taken their feedback, their views on how it has to be developed and how it can be promoted. ""While we are doing the rituals for the dead, we should take care that we're not affecting the survival of future generations.""","In India, an estimated seven million Hindus die each year; many are traditionally cremated .

"London (CNN) -- A suspect named by British media as entertainer Freddie Starr faced further questioning from police Friday in connection with an investigation into sex abuse claims involving late BBC TV host Jimmy Savile. Starr, a well-known comedian in the United Kingdom, was arrested on suspicion of sexual offenses Thursday, British media reports say. Police did not release the suspect's name, identifying him only as ""Yewtree 2,"" but said he falls under the ""Savile and others"" strand of their investigation, dubbed Operation Yewtree. He was released on bail early Friday but returned to face further questions in the afternoon. In media interviews last month, Starr denied the allegations against him, which were made in a TV report. Read more: British police make first arrest in Savile investigation . He told Channel 4 News: ""I want a police investigation. I want one. I want them to come and question me -- anything they want to ask."" He was the second UK celebrity to be arrested in connection with the inquiry. A London man, who British media reported to be 1970s pop star Gary Glitter, was arrested Sunday, also on suspicion of sexual offenses. Read more: How celebrity child sex scandal has rocked the BBC . A TV documentary a month ago detailed allegations of sexual abuse against Savile, who died last year. Police investigating the scandal are dealing with about 300 apparent victims, Cmdr. Peter Spindler told reporters. Savile's targets were apparently mostly girls in their mid-teens in what Spindler said was ""alleged abuse on an unprecedented scale."" The British TV icon died in October 2011 at age 84. But authorities have said they are preparing an arrest strategy for others, still living, against whom allegations have been made in connection with the Savile case. Jimmy Savile: National treasure in life, reviled 'sex abuser' in death . Countless Britons who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It"" have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month. The reputation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, his former employer, has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions about how his abuse went undetected, and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations against him last year. ""Now the BBC risks squandering public trust because one of its stars over three decades was apparently a sexual criminal; because he used his programme and popularity as a cover for his wickedness; because he used BBC premises for some of his attacks,"" BBC Chairman Lord Patten wrote in an editorial published Sunday in the Daily Mail. Read more: Former BBC chief explains dropped Savile investigation . The BBC has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries. NatWest Bank confirmed this week that the distribution of Savile's estate, most of which he is reported to have left to a charitable trust, ""has been put on hold."" It has been suggested the money could be used to pay compensation to some of his alleged victims if they file legal claims. Last Saturday, Savile's family made its first public statement since the claims of sexual abuse of underage girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero. Savile's nephew, Roger Foster, had defended his late uncle -- who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young Britons -- in a newspaper interview before the allegations first emerged in the TV documentary a month ago. Read more: Relatives of disgraced Savile voice their anguish . But as those few claims snowballed into hundreds, the family had to face up to the horrific truth: that the man they were so proud of as a media star and tireless charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past. ""I watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle. This wasn't the man we knew and loved,"" Foster said. ""We began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle. How could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing? ""Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts? How could anyone live their life doing the 'most good and most evil' at the same time?""

"(CNN) -- Residents of a North Dakota town got the all-clear to return home after a fiery crash this week involving a derailed train and a second one carrying crude oil. The wreck sent massive flames into the sky. Residents vacated homes amid fears of dangerous smoke. Crews will be able to access the site near the town of Casselton on Wednesday, where they hope to collect the rest of the data needed to finish their probe, safety investigators said. But information taken from recording devices has been revealing, said National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Robert L. Sumwalt. A video camera at the head of the oil train recorded the crash as it slammed into a car of a derailed grain train. ""We looked at the last 20 seconds of the forward facing video from the oil train. And basically it shows the collision sequence,"" Sumwalt said. Derailment, then crash . When the oil train arrived, the other train transporting grain and soy bean had already derailed, and one of its cars was lying in the oil train's path, he said. The oil train slammed into it and burst into flames. All oil trains in the United States are also outfitted with event recorders, but the crash scorched those mounted in the front of the train. ""We are not optimistic that we will be able to retrieve data from those two recorders,"" Sumwalt said. The ones in the rear engine are intact, and NTSB officials hope to reveal its data Wednesday. On the ground, they will search for signs of the cause of the derailment, including marks on wooden cross ties and on rails, Sumwalt said. Overheated wheels? They will also examine data from hotbox detectors, which are located along the tracks and pick up unusual sources of heat. They want to see if the grain train had overheating wheels or axels or whether it had equipment dragging on the ground. Early Tuesday, crews had tested the air for toxic fumes emitted when flames and pillars of smoke towered into the sky near the town. Their all-clear meant that residents could return home Tuesday afternoon. Nearly two thirds of the town's some 2,500 residents had vacated their homes after authorities issued a voluntary evacuation order. After the collision, the sheriff's office said that there were no injuries and everyone was accounted for. CNN's Steve Almasy, Aaron Cooper and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Video shows oil train colliding with a derailed car .

"(CNN) -- Only a week after David Letterman surprised viewers with his on-air vow to step down from late-night TV in 2015, CBS moved with stunning speed to anoint and announce his replacement: Comedy Central's Stephen Colbert. Colbert, who has hosted ""The Colbert Report"" since 2005 in the tongue-in-cheek character of a pompous political conservative, was quoted by Bill Carter of The New York Times as saying he would be appearing on CBS as himself, not his comic alter ego. Signing the quotable and often controversial Colbert, with his legion of ""Colbert Nation"" social media fans, clearly is a gain for CBS. But for fans of Colbert, and for Colbert himself, it's much more of a risk. The CBS thought process is easy to deconstruct. Either the network was going to give the ""Late Show"" slot, when it opened, to Craig Ferguson, who has toiled loyally in the time slot following it for as long as ""The Colbert Report"" has been on cable, or to someone else. Ferguson will be 52 next month -- but Colbert, also next month, will turn 50, compared with ABC's Jimmy Kimmel and NBC's Jimmy Fallon, who later this year will turn 46 and 40, respectively. So the issue isn't so much age as, perhaps, buzz, with Colbert's social media savvy giving him the edge. The question now becomes, though, how much edge can Colbert bring to CBS, especially without the once-removed antagonistic persona of his Comedy Central blowhard? Bill Maher offended too many people when he was on a late-night broadcast show, ""Politically Incorrect,"" but the same act has thrived, and taken root, on cable's HBO. Going in the opposite direction, how many edges must Colbert sand off to maintain or increase a loyal audience on CBS? In character on ""The Colbert Report,"" Colbert is such a smart and funny interviewer that, even out of character, he should prove much better in that department than either of the late-night Jimmys. But unless he generates the same sort of viral videos, most of them musical, that Kimmel and Fallon have presented so successfully, Colbert may struggle to compete. Colbert is a very strong singer -- even Stephen Sondheim thinks so, and cast him in a concert version of ""Company"" -- so he could do that sort of thing. But does he even want to? And will his Comedy Central audience even follow him to CBS? Success in one arena doesn't necessarily translate after a move to another venue. Just ask Oprah. Personally, I like what CBS is gaining here. The potential for Colbert, who's such a phenomenal workhorse on his current show, to craft a new show for CBS is enticing, and the unknown factor of what he will bring to the program as himself should generate plenty of publicity. For CBS, the move makes sense. But for Colbert, the transplant could be tricky. Young viewers -- and he certainly has them -- are fickle, and those who watch him on the more subversive Comedy Central may not be inclined to switch to the less cool CBS just to follow him. And many, like myself, will miss ""The Colbert Report"" greatly. There's no show on TV quite like it. (The logical replacement for Colbert, thinking one more step ahead, would be former ""Daily Show"" correspondent John Oliver, but his new current events comedy show begins later this month on HBO -- so he may or may not be available when the slot opens next year.) And in addition to losing ""The Colbert Report,"" viewers also are all but certain to lose ""The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson"" when his current contract expires -- so that's two entertaining late-night programs that we're losing, just to get a replacement for Letterman. Whether it all ends up being a good exchange for viewers depends on those other replacements, and how good Colbert ends up being at playing a formerly unseen and untested role: himself. My guess is that, as himself, Stephen Colbert will produce and star in a very good show indeed. But with the show being on CBS in the multimedia climate of 2015, my worry is whether that will prove to be enough.","David Bianculli: Colbert slated to replace Letterman; great for CBS, risky for Colbert .
He says Colbert brings new late-night essentials: social media savvy, buzz .
But Colbert could lose edge when he drops persona; will fans follow him, he asks?
Bianculli's bet is that Colbert, a smart interviewer, will likely do well as himself ."
"(CNN) -- The Dallas Zoo has two new cheetah cubs. And the big cats have their own puppy to help them shape up. The cubs, Winspear and Kamau, are part of the zoo's program to create awareness about endangered African animals. Zoo officials believe the Labrador retriever will keep the cubs in line as they grow up away from the wilderness. ""Zoological experts have found that because dogs are naturally comfortable in public settings, Amani will provide a calming influence for the cubs, as well as another playmate as they grow to adulthood,"" the zoo said in a statement. In a tribute to its role, the puppy is named Amani, which is Swahili for peace. Cheetahs are an endangered species. Their numbers are estimated to be about 10,000 in the wild, the zoo said. Winspear and Kamau were born in July at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia. Their puppy companion is about the same age. Before their new adventure, a team from the zoo spent nearly two weeks in Virginia bonding with the cubs. ""It is a thrill to be able to tell the story about cheetah conservation and to educate Dallas Zoo guests about this magnificent species,"" said Sean Green, vice president of Guest Experiences for the Dallas Zoo. ""Winspear and Kamau will become important animal ambassadors for the Dallas Zoo, building appreciation and awareness about cheetahs to more than 900,000 visitors each year."" The balls of fur will not be small forever. When fully grown, they weigh about 140 pounds and stand 3 feet tall. A cheetah is the world's fastest land mammal, and can go from 0 to 60 mph (96 kph) in three seconds. Other zoos have coupled cheetahs with dogs, including the San Diego Zoo, which has been pairing pups with big cats for years. ""Not just any dog would do. We needed one with personality, composure and pizzazz.,"" the San Diego Zoo says on its website. In such couplings, it says, the dog is the leader.","Zoo: Puppy will be a calming influence as the cubs grow up away from the wilderness .

The whole time I was going through radiation, I had a really bad sore throat and I thought I was just smoking too much. After the radiation was complete, in June 2000, I lost my mother in August and in December I discovered the tumor on my larynx. They told me they were going to remove my voice box, but all I heard was cancer. I didn't hear the part about them taking something from me.  So I woke up in ICU and the nurse asked me if she could get me anything, and I was in really bad pain, and I opened my mouth to speak and nothing came out.  Not even a breath. I have a hole in my neck now, and I'm called a laryngectomee. It's just shocking. You can't wrap your mind around it. That's when I faced the reality of what happened. That was my worst moment.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Adam West became a pop icon with his original portrayal of Batman 45 years ago, but the actor is now offering a different portrait of the caped crusader. West will drive the original Batmobile to a Beverly Hills, California, art gallery for the opening of the first exhibit of his paintings and drawings depicting his vision of Batman and his crime-fighting world Friday evening. ""The pictures are pretty raw and untamed, just like me,"" West said as he prepared for the exhibit, which will run for a month at the David W. Streets Beverly Hills Art Gallery. West is a ""cultural pop art expressionist,"" said gallery owner Streets. ""This is a huge genre coming out of pop culture, American television history and culture,"" Streets said. ""It's really a tremendous art form and really fun."" The energetic 82-year-old West said it was time ""to open up a new phase"" of his career. ""After 45 years of doing all this nonsense, who better to bring it to life in paintings or drawings than the guy who created the character for film,"" West said. ""People seem to like it and respond to it."" One painting titled ""The Birth of Batman,"" is a surrealist depiction of the pain and agony of a young Bruce Wayne's transformation from an orphan to a superhero, he said. ""Batman saw his parents murdered in front of him as a little boy and, of course, he had to train for many years to create the kind of avenger crime fighter that he is,"" West said. ""So, this represents a really tough birth."" Another frame holds what West said is his ""sense in some kind of dream of Bruce Wayne."" West has kept busy in recent years attending fan conventions, but he still is in demand as an actor. He is a regular on ""Family Guy,"" playing Mayor West on the animated Fox series. ""In a very real sense, I represent pop culture in an iconic way,"" West said. ""It's been very good to me, so anything I can do to help the fans to tumble along -- it's good."" West began painting ""without anyone knowing, except the folks in my household, about 40 years ago,"" he said. Few people have seen his art work until now. ""I'm flattered that they want to pay money for my pictures,"" he said. ""It's terrific."" The gallery opening Friday night promises to be a reunion for the original Batman cast with the first Catwoman, Julie Newmar, and sidekick Robin,played by Burt Ward, also expected.","Adam West began painting privately 40 years ago .

"(CNN) -- Usher Raymond's 5-year-old son is out of the hospital a week after a near-fatal swimming pool accident, his mother's lawyer said Tuesday. Usher Raymond V was rescued and resuscitated by a sound tech worker who dove into the pool to free the child from a drain at the music mogul's Atlanta home on August 5, according to police. He was rushed by ambulance to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta hospital, where he was treated until his recent release. The lawyer did not reveal any details of his injuries. ""I don't know if my son is going to have a brain defect,"" Tameka Foster Raymond testified Friday at a hearing in which she asked a judge to grant her temporary custody of the two sons she has with the singer. Usher has primary custody of the children. ""I don't know if his heart is operating correctly. I don't know if my son's going to be 100% the boy he was before this incident."" A judge rejected Foster Raymond's emergency request, finding that the pool mishap was not crisis situation requiring that Usher's two children be taken from him. Usher's ex-wife argued that the boy's aunt, Rena Oden, who was caring for the child at the time of the accident, is incapable of keeping up with the two children. Foster Raymond testified that she does not trust the childcare of Raymond's aunt. Fulton County Superior Court Judge John Goger did not agree. ""What happened here was an awful accident and ... I'm not certain that had any single person been at the poolside that one person could have done any better than Ms. Oden. And Ms. Oden did impress me as a capable caregiver,"" Goger said. ""Based on the evidence I heard, not one person could have done any better than Ms. Oden."" The judge instructed Usher to keep his ex-wife informed about his whereabouts and who is taking care of the children. Usher, as he is known in his career as a singer and actor, testified that he waited an hour to inform his ex-wife that their son had nearly drowned in a swimming pool accident because ""the first thing to do was to respond to the emergency. ... My son was hysterical and in the back of an ambulance."" Foster Raymond also said Usher does not keep her informed about what is going on in the children's lives. ""They come home with bags of medicine. I don't know why or what illness or who's taking them to the doctor. ... He doesn't confer with me regarding anything, nothing,"" she told the court. Usher won primary custody of the couple's two children, Usher V and 4-year-old Naviyd, last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster Raymond accused the singer of being an absentee father. Foster Raymond filed in May for a custody modification. That case hadn't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened Monday, so Foster Raymond filed Tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter. Usher's former stepson, also Foster Raymond's son, died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year. CNN's Nischelle Turner contributed to this report.","The 5-year-old was treated for a week at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital .

"(CNN) -- Early Sunday, as the sun ascended to the winter sky, the very last American convoy made its way down the main highway that connects Iraq and Kuwait. The military called it its final ""tactical road march."" A series of 110 heavily armored, hulking trucks and Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles carrying about 500 soldiers streamed slowly but steadily out of the combat zone. A few minutes before 8 a.m., the metal gate behind the last MRAP closed. With it came to an end a deadly and divisive war that lasted almost nine years, its enormous cost calculated in blood and billions. Some rushed to touch the gate, forever a symbol now of an emotional, landmark day. Some cheered with the Army's ultimate expression of affirmation: ""Hooah!"" ""It's hard to put words to it right now,"" said Lt. Col. Jack Vantress. ""It's a feeling of elation,"" he said, ""to see what we've accomplished in the last eight-and-a-half years and then to be part of the last movement out of Iraq."" Once, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were in Iraq, the main highway was better known as Main Supply Route Tampa and soldiers trekked north towards Baghdad and beyond, never knowing what danger lurked on their path. Analysts: Questions remain as U.S. troops leave . On this monumental day, the Texas-based 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division's main concern was how to avoid a traffic jam on their final journey in Iraq. Staff Sgt. Daniel Gaumer, 37, was on this road in August 2003. It was his first time at war. He was frightened. There was not a lot of traffic at that time, he recalled. He remembered a lot of cheering by Iraqis, even though the situation was tense. Sunday morning, the air was decidedly different. ""It's pretty historic,"" he said about the drive south, hoping he will not ever have to come back through this unforgiving terrain again. Once there were bases sprinkled in the desolate desert between Nasiriya and Basra, American soldiers hidden from view behind walls of giant mesh Hesco bags filled with dirt and sand to stave off incoming fire. On this day, the roads, the bases were in Iraqi hands, the sands in the bags returned to the earth. Once, almost nine years ago in March 2003, U.S. tanks and armored personnel carriers had thundered north, with the drive and determination needed to decapitate a dictator. Timeline: Key dates in the war . On this day, heading south towards Khabari border crossing, the soldiers took stock of their sacrifice. In another war, there had been little joy or even emotion as final jet transports lifted Americans from Vietnamese soil. Sunday saw the end of the largest troop drawdown for the United States since Vietnam. Those men and women who fought in Iraq may not feel they are leaving behind an unfinished war or returning home to a nation as deeply scarred as it was after years of Vietnam. But many crossed the border harboring mixed feelings and doubt about the future of Iraq. ""The biggest thing about going home is just that it's home,"" Gaumer said. ""It's civilization as I know it -- the Western world, not sand and dust and the occasional rain here and there."" A month ago, Adder, the last U.S. base before the five-hour drive to the Kuwaiti border, housed 12,000 people. By Thursday, the day the United States formally ended its mission in Iraq with a flag-casing ceremony in Baghdad, under 1,000 people remained there. The 3rd Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division officially transferred control of Camp Adder to the Iraqis on Friday, though it did not really change hands until the last American departed early Sunday morning. Group seeks to help returning vets find jobs . At its height, Adder housed thousands of troops and had a large PX, fast-food outlets, coffee shops and even an Italian restaurant. Now a ghost town, the United States gave 110,000 items left at Adder to the Iraqis, a loot worth $76 million, according to the military. In her last days working in a guard tower in Iraq, Sgt. Ashley Vorhees, 29, dreamed of seeing her three children and eating crispy chicken tacos at Rosa's Mexican restaurant in Killeen, Texas. She also looked forward to not having to carry her gun with her to the bathroom. Vorhees, a combat medic, spent her first tour of Iraq with her husband, also a soldier. ""When Osama bin Laden was captured and killed, my mom was like 'Does that mean that everybody is coming home now?'"" Vorhees said. ""We actually had it a lot better than the people did who did the initial invasion,"" she said. ""We're just thankful that we're not getting attacked every day."" When the war was at its worst in 2006, America had 239,000 men and women in uniform stationed in more than 500 bases sprinkled throughout Iraq. Another 135,000 contractors were working in Iraq. The United States will still maintain a presence in Iraq: hundreds of nonmilitary personnel, including 1,700 diplomats, law enforcement officers, and economic, agricultural and other experts, according to the State Department. In addition, 5,000 security contractors will protect Americans and another 4,500 contractors will serve in other roles. The quiet U.S. exit, shrouded in secrecy until it occurred, closes a war that was contentious from the start and cost the nation more than $800 billion. President Barack Obama, who had made a campaign promise to bring home American troops, reflected on a greater cost as Sunday's exit made good on his word. According to the defense department, 4,487 service members were killed in the war. More than 30,000 were wounded. In all, 1.5 million Americans served their nation at war. ""All of them -- our troops, veterans, and their families -- will always have the thanks of a grateful nation,"" Obama said in his weekly radio address Saturday. It's impossible to know with certainty the number of Iraqis who have died in Iraq since 2003. But the independent public database Iraq Body Count has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and October 2010, with four out of five dead being civilians. And the question of how Iraq will fare in the months ahead, without U.S. troops, is also impossible to answer. Even before the last soldiers had left, political crisis was erupting in Baghdad. The powerful political bloc Iraqiya said it was suspending its participation in parliament, which would threaten Iraq's fragile power-sharing arrangement. Iraqiya accuses Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki of amassing power. The withdrawal of U.S. troops stirred conflicting emotions on the streets of Baghdad. In the predominately Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya, where Saddam Hussein made his final public appearance in 2003, a man said residents were afraid, tense and worried about Iran's influence. He refused to appear on camera or give his name because of what he said was the sensitive nature of the situation. In a Shia neighborhood on the other side of the city, one man said he supported the toppling of Hussein's regime, but felt too much blood was shed afterward. ""The U.S.A. went through and they ruined this country, (bringing) with them many troubles. And now they're going, and ... more trouble's coming,"" said the man, who asked to be called Abu Ali for security reasons. But for the last U.S. troops out, the message was clear . Col. Doug Crissman, their commander, spent the past few weeks speaking to the soldiers in each of his companies. He told them he was proud of his troops and they should be proud of what they had accomplished. And, he wanted his soldiers to take care of themselves back home as much as they did in Iraq. In the months before the brigade deployed in February, it lost 13 soldiers to accidents, some because of driving under the influence of alcohol. At least one death was a suicide. ""Quite frankly we lost more soldiers in peacetime in the nine or 10 months before this brigade deployed due to accidents and risky behavior ... than we lost here in combat,"" Crissman said. ""We want every soldier that survived this combat deployment to survive redeployment and reintegration."" Capt. Mark Askew, 28, said he was worried about the well-being of his soldiers, many of whom have done multiple tours of Iraq and felt the stress and sting of war. Was the loss, the grief, worth it? For Askew, it will all depend on how Iraq's future unfolds -- whether democracy and human rights will take root, whether Iraq will be a steadfast U.S. ally. It will depend, he said, on how Iraq shapes its own destiny. CNN's Ingrid Formanek reported from the Iraq-Kuwait border, Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon from Baghdad and Moni Basu from Atlanta.","NEW: The withdrawal of U.S. troops stirs conflicting emotions on the streets of Baghdad .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer is putting fatherhood ahead of next month's French Open. The world No. 4 says being at wife Mirka's side for the birth of their third child is more important than competing at the clay court grand slam in Paris. Federer has played in a record 57 straight grand slam tournaments. The last major he missed was the U.S. Open in 1999. But the 17-time grand slam winner told reporters at the Monte Carlo Masters: ""It's a priority for me to be there (at the birth) to support my wife. ""I've played enough tennis matches. Missing a tournament or missing a match wouldn't change anything for me."" Federer and Mirka became parents to twin girls Charlene Riva and Myla Rose in July 2009. The 32-year-old revealed on Twitter on Christmas Eve that the Swiss sweethearts were expanding their family in 2014. But Federer would not reveal his wife's due date or whether the couple were expecting another set of twins. The world No. 4 is currently competing on the Monte Carlo clay after a two-year absence from the principality's Roland Garros warm-up event. ""As we don't know when it [the due date] is going to be yet, I'm happy playing at the moment,"" he added after his 6-0 6-2 win over Marin Cilic on Wednesday. Federer said it was too early to say whether he would definitely play at the French Open, which begins on May 25th. The former world No. 1 won the French Open title in 2009 to complete the rare feat of winning all four grand slam trophies. If he opts to skip the tournament he could miss out on a big pay day. Organizers of the French Open announced that the prize fund has increased by $4m in 2014. The total prize money on offer is now $34.6m. The winners of the men's and women's singles titles will each receive $2.3m, which is a 10% increase on last year's prize pot.","Roger Federer says he could skip French Open for birth of new baby .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish security forces barricaded the commercial center of Istanbul in an attempt to stop May Day celebrations from taking place in the city's iconic Taksim Square. Police fired plastic pellets and used tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to disperse May Day demonstrators who tried to defy the ban and reach the city center. Protesters responded by throwing stones and bottles and shooting fireworks at riot police. Similar clashes erupted in the Turkish capital Ankara and the port city of Izmir. Turkish authorities went to great lengths to prevent people from gathering in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. Citing security threats by extremist groups, the government shut Istanbul's subway system, stopped many commercial ferry services between the European and Asian halves of the city, and blocked vehicular traffic on some of Istanbul's busiest roads. ""Intelligence units have received information that illegal terrorist organizations and their extensions are going to resort to violence against security forces. This situation would create circumstances that would not only disrupt public order and security but also seriously threaten the rights and freedoms of our citizens,"" the Istanbul governor's office announced in a written statement released Wednesday night. The governor's office also justified the ban, arguing that May Day rallies would hurt Istanbul's image as a tourist destination. ""Taksim Square and the surrounding area are not suitable for high attendance gatherings and demonstrations,"" the governor's office wrote. ""In Taksim vehicular and pedestrian traffic is intense and the area has great tourism potential with 24/7 tourist hotels, so negative developments in this area would negatively impact the country economy, tourism potential and the marketing image of our country."" But the shut-down of the city center left many foreign tourists bewildered, as police turned them away from barricades. Some visitors could be seen dragging suitcases through empty and barricaded streets in a confused search for hotels. ""Closed,"" a police officer said, turning away an elderly European couple trying to enter Taksim Square. The sprawling pedestrian area was all but deserted throughout the day on Thursday, with the exception of security forces, a handful of journalists, and wandering flocks of pigeons. For decades, May Day, or International Workers Day, has been a day of tension between leftist Turkish labor unions and security forces. Taksim Square holds particular importance to leftist parties, because dozens of people were killed there in a May 1, 1977 rally in which gunfire triggered a deadly stampede. In 2011 and 2012, the ruling Justice and Development Party allowed leftist groups to rally in Taksim for the first time in decades. The gatherings were festive and peaceful, decorated with giant posters of those who died in 1977. But in 2013, the government banned the annual rally, sparking a day of violence that has spiraled into the most politically turbulent year of anti-government protests Turkey has seen in more than a decade. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been in power since his party first won parliamentary elections in 2002. He frequently denounces his critics, accusing them of being terrorists bent on overthrowing his government. His supporters argue Turkey has grown more democratic during the Erdogan era. They point to his party's sweeping victory in local elections last March, when Justice and Development Party candidates won at least 43% of the national vote. ""We have moved away from a state that saw its citizens as a threat,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Besir Atalay in a speech earlier this week. But many human rights groups and press freedoms organizations argue the Erdogan government has grown increasingly intolerant of public displays of dissent in recent years. This week, the U.S.-based human rights organization Freedom House downgraded classification of Turkey from ""Partly Free"" to ""Not free."" ""Constitutional guarantees of freedom of the press and expression are only partially upheld in practice, undermined by restrictive provisions in the criminal code and the Anti-Terrorism Act,"" Freedom House said. They also said, ""Turkey remained the world's leading jailer of journalists in 2013.""","Turkish authorities went to great lengths to prevent public gatherings in Istanbul .
They used tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators who defied ban .
A ban last year led to a year of anti-government violence and demonstrations ."
"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In what a U.S. military official calls an ""inadvertent encounter,"" a Chinese submarine hit an underwater sonar array being towed by the destroyer USS John McCain on Thursday. The USS John S. McCain, left, anchored at the port of Incheon 40 km west of Seoul, Korea in March 2004. The array was damaged, but the sub and the ship did not collide, the official said. A sonar array is a device towed behind a ship that listens and locates underwater sounds. The incident occurred near Subic Bay off the coast of the Philippines. The official, who declined to be named because the incident had not been made public, would not say whether the U.S. ship knew the submarine was that close to it. However, the Navy does not believe this was a deliberate incident of Chinese harassment, as it would have been extremely dangerous had the array gotten caught in the submarine's propellers. The Navy has complained in the past that Chinese vessels, including fishing boats, have deliberately tried to disrupt U.S. naval activities in international waters near China. In one widely publicized incident in March, five Chinese vessels maneuvered close enough to the USNS Impeccable to warrant the use of a fire hose by the unarmed American vessel to avoid a collision. The Navy later released video of that incident.","The array was damaged, but the sub and the ship did not collide .

"New York (CNN) -- ""Inspiration exists,"" runs a famous quote attributed to Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. ""It just has to find us working."" And at the Maker Faire, which took place in the grounds of the New York Hall of Science recently, there was plenty of evidence of that hard work. The Maker Faire is a glorious celebration of nerdiness. When exhibitors aren't talking excitedly about Ram or Javascript, or the correct proportion of catalyst to reactant in the conversion of vegetable oil to biofuel, they are showcasing the truly incredible benefits to be reaped from locking yourself away in your room or garden shed for years on end. Brian Patton, for example, a middle school teacher from Trenton, New Jersey, has spent his time building a singing robot. With pipe cleaners for eyebrows and doll's eyes, the robot is synched to a computer program that Patton wrote himself and allows him to control 17 tiny motors that alter the features of the animatronic face. He moves the features of the face in time to the song by moving a mouse and records each motor individually. The recordings can be played back simultaneously to get the full effect. Watch Erno Rubik on Make, Create, Innovate on Tuesday October 9 on Quest Means Business . The e-puppeteer has an application in mind for his creation -- a teaching aid for children with autism. ""There is already quite a lot of anecdotal evidence that autistic kids respond better to robots than to adults,"" Patton says. ""The robot could be a sort of surrogate teacher for them. They could learn by singing along with it."" Not all the musical performances at the fair were as complex as Patton's robots, and some of the best innovations on display were the most simple. Read more: 'Li-Fi' provides a light bulb moment for wireless web . It's surprisingly easy to turn vegetable oil into biofuel as Ben Jorritsma, from Sussex County, New Jersey demonstrated. Collecting used vegetable oil from local restaurants to make biofuel at his family farm, Jorritsma claims to make enough to power 20 tractors. ""Most of the production cost is for the methanol, which is used as the reactant,"" explained Jorristsma. ""You need potassium hydroxide as a catalyst. Basically all you're doing is breaking apart polymers to thin the oil down so that it won't clog your engine."" Sponsored by ""Make Magazine,"" the Maker Faire began in San Mateo, California in 2006 and has since spawned events in Detroit and San Francisco -- which attracted 100,000 visitors last year. Read more: $30 gadget lets you control computer with your eyes . This is the third time the show has come to New York where it received the endorsement of Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who declared the week leading up to this year's fair ""Maker Week"" in the city. One of the best things about the event is the spirit of openness that seems to pervade, with exhibitors incredibly generous about sharing their hard-earned knowledge. Special FX expert Marc Fields, for example, hosted a seminar explaining some of the how-tos of creating movie props. He showed how paints containing powdered metal can be splashed with acid to create metal oxides that give the effect of natural rusting, and how to make fake tree bark from a mold ingeniously colored using carpet scrapings. ""I want people to see that they could go home and do a lot of this stuff themselves,"" said Fields, who has built props for enclosures at the Bronx Zoo and worked on Hollywood movies such as ""Cold Mountain."" This DIY ethos is probably the strongest theme binding all the participants. Near the end of the day, I meet Jason Naumoff, an event organizer based outside San Francisco. A few years ago, Naumoff put together a competition that offered entrants the chance to build a machine in just 72 hours from ""conception to reality."" Now sponsored by the energy drink maker Red Bull, the theme of this year's competition was ""games"" and included a centrifuge made with a golf cart engine that spun players at up to five times the force of gravity. ""When you leave people to their own devices and don't constrain them, the results are mind-blowing,"" Naumoff said.","Maker Faire in New York provides a platform for inventors to showcase their ingenious ideas .

"(CNN) -- Oracle Team USA's improbable America's Cup comeback gathered further momentum on Monday after a fifth straight win over challengers Emirates Team New Zealand. Emirates Team New Zealand have been one win away from clinching the Auld Mug since last Wednesday, but Oracle Team USA never looked like losing Monday's race at San Francisco Bay. The New Zealanders still hold an 8-6 advantage over their American counterparts in the best-of-17 series. The Americans started their defense of the cup on minus two after being punished for illegally modifying their catamarans. In order to prevent defeat, Oracle Team USA need to win the final three races of the competition, starting with race 17 on Tuesday, with race 18 scheduled to take place the same day should it be required. ""We've got a huge wave of momentum. The boat's just going fantastic,"" Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill told the official America's Cup website. ""That was a tough start, we had starboard entry and it was a tough time."" Emirates Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker remains confident his team can win the series despite Oracle's recent charge. ""We're very upbeat here, we know we can win,"" said Barker. ""The Oracle guys sailed a pretty flawless race. ""There were no opportunities to get back in it. We did a better job on the downwind legs staying close, but not enough today.""","Oracle Team USA win race 16 of America's Cup .

"(CNN) -- It is a cricket match with no bouncers, rain never stops play and the outcome is preordained. It is the complete antithesis to the recent Ashes series. While England and Australia's batsmen were trying to spend hours at the crease every time they batted, the annual Bramble Bank fixture is a race against time -- the only thing liable to stop play is the tide. It is quintessentially English, a land to have spawned more than its fair share of sporting eccentricities. On the surface of it, this match is supremely pointless -- and actually, that remains the same even if you dig below the surface. For about an hour every English summer typically on an August evening, two teams in full cricketing whites from rival yachting clubs bedecked in life jackets leave the mainland and are ferried out on speedboats to a sandbank in the middle of the Solent, an area between the port city of Southampton and the Isle of Wight. It is a protrusion in the water that emerges above the surface only briefly on any given day and one that most sailors avoid like the plague. Just ask the captain of the Cunard Liner QE2, which ran aground on her approach to Southampton on her last voyage in 2008 and was stuck for 90 minutes before being pulled clear by four tug boats. Mark ""Tommo"" Tomson is a different kind of captain, and he has already admitted defeat well before he will once again lead the Royal Southern Yacht Club against the Island Sailing Club in the Bramble clash. ""It's our turn to lose this year,"" he explains, ""even if we score more runs and take more wickets."" The result is preplanned because the ""defeated"" team has to host a big dinner for the two sides after the event, which takes some organizing. The match in question is entirely dependent on the tide. In some years, such as 2013, the sandbank never appears so the game goes on with water lapping against the players' ankles -- or, in some cases, knees. A quaint afternoon of village cricket this is not; there are no picnic hampers and no cream teas, just gallons and gallons of water. For most of the year, Bramble Bank stays underwater but during the equinoxal tide -- usually at the end of August or the beginning of September -- it usually emerges above the surface for a day or two. The time of day varies and, although the match usually takes place at 6 p.m., it has been known to happen as early as 6 a.m. too. ""It's an interesting experience,"" says Tomson with a chuckle. ""It's great fun and we've had some good and bad moments. We've had some amazing beautiful evenings with huge amounts of sand and mud exposed, hundreds of square meters. And then we've been up to our ankles like last year. ""It can be miserable on occasions with the weather, but we usually manage to drum up enough enthusiasm."" Among the more celebrated regulars in the match, which takes place using the usual cricket bat and ball, is Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to circumnavigate the globe single-handed in 1968 and the oldest person to do so aged 67 in 2006. ""I think I've been playing in the match about five years now,"" he says. ""It's totally bizarre, isn't it? But really that's the fun of it. It isn't really taken too seriously -- well, not by me. I'm just happy if I manage to connect with the ball. Really, I'm not a brilliant cricketer."" The funny thing is that the cricketers in question do take it seriously, with pride at stake if nothing else. Clips of previous matches are readily available on the internet, and the batsmen unleash all manner of heavy hitting while the fielders plunge themselves into a much wetter outfield than on any waterlogged grass pitch. Also, as much as is possible, they stick to the gentlemanly conduct of cricket, batsmen walking -- actually wading -- if there is any doubt as to whether they are out or not. Cricket is usually synonymous with fine weather conditions wherever it is played on the planet. Not for the Bramble Bank match. Regularly the wind lashes across the field of play, waves too, and the backdrop isn't typical either. Just a few meters away, windsurfers and sailors pass by in their vessels, with international container ships also visible in the distance, their captains surely bemused by the bizarre spectacle taking place in the middle of the sea. ""We usually have a lot of boats and canoes that come up and watch but these are locals,"" Tomson says. ""Sometimes I wonder what the ocean liners coming past must think. One year we had three liners come past in quick succession. I'd love to have known what, say, the Americans on board must have thought watching these mad men!"" The first match is thought to have been played in the 1950s at the behest of pioneering British boatmaker Uffa Fox. Fox designed lifeboats to be dropped from aircraft to rescued aircrew or navy personnel in World War Two, and played an integral role in changing the design of boats for dingy racing. On top of that, though, he had a penchant for adventure and humor, once leading a group of Sea Scouts across the Channel from England to France and up the River Seine without their parents' consent. Fox died in 1972, not long before the cricket match become cemented as an annual event in the 1980s. Today, it starts with one of the two sailing clubs challenging the other to a match, a challenge that is always gratefully received. But with the result already been decided -- regardless of the runs scored and wickets taken by each team -- due to the logistics of the following feast, it further begs the question of, ""What's the point?"" But Knox-Johnston explains: ""You can't not have a preordained winner -- I'm not sure the caterers could cope. Really, part of the fun is the dinner afterwards."" However, not all of the 300 or so spectators who attended last year took part in the evening's celebrations, they merely moored their boats on the bank for the hour or so of play that took place. There is some consolation, however, and an opportunity for those watching to quench their thirst at one of the shortest-lived pubs in England, the Bramble Inn -- which opens for business on the sandbank for the brief duration of play. With the tide quickly reconverging on the sandbank, the match is limited to six or seven overs per innings. ""It's very sportsmanlike, so everyone gets a turn, but it can all end very rapidly,"" Tomson says. ""It's quite surreal when you suddenly find yourself in the middle of the sea with water up to your chest and rising, and you're a few meters away from the boat to take you home."" So what exactly is the purpose of it all? ""Well, the aim is to not kill any spectators!"" adds Tomson, before pointing out that there have been no deaths so far. And as a qualified doctor, he has been on hand to attend to the occasional injury to player and spectator alike over the years. As for the caliber of the cricket, former Island Sailing Club captain John Hounslow, a solicitor by trade, insists it is mixed. ""I was captain by default and haven't played proper cricket for 20 years,"" says the sometime wicketkeeper. ""It's semi-social and semi-sporting."" It may not be No. 1 on most people's sporting calendar, but more than half a century since its inception this novel contest -- which regularly makes a splash -- looks here to stay.","A cricket match with a difference is held on a sandbank off England's south coast .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi's coronation as the FIFA World Player of the Year has been praised by his fellow-professionals, as the Argentine playmaker was handed his award at a star-studded gala ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland. The Barcelona star won three times as many votes as second-placed Cristiano Ronaldo, the 2008 winner, from the coaches and captains of men's and women's national teams -- completing a stunning year for the 22-year-old. ""Messi is an incredible player,"" Chelsea and England captain John Terry told CNN. ""He is an absolute nightmare to play against -- so thankfully I don't have to play against him very often. ""He really has got some amazing ability and there are only a couple of players in the world who can do the things that Messi does. ""Good luck to him on the award, he deserves it."" Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard, who like England compatriot Terry was named in the FIFA World XI for 2009, also believes Messi was a worthy winner. ""He certainly got my vote. Messi is a genius, a magician on the pitch who can do special things with a football. He deserves the award and I am very pleased for him. ""On current form, over the past 12 months, he is certainly a worthy winner."" Former French international David Ginola, like Messi a player who could do magical things with a football, also believes the Argentine was a worthy winner. Speaking exclusively to CNN, Ginola said: ""Messi has been the top player of 2009. He really is a player that you want to pay money to go and watch. ""He has so many talents, so many qualities and every time I have seen Barcelona play, he has been a delight to watch. ""When Messi gets the ball you expect him to do something special and he deserves the award as he is always providing something special on the pitch. ""It is a dream to watch a player like him, so thank god in the 21st century we have a player like him who can deliver such quality.""","Fellow-professionals praise Lionel Messi after his FIFA World Player of the Year victory .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- An amusement park sits in the ear of a rhinoceros; a five-star hotel takes the place of its eye. Another city takes the awkward image of a giraffe, with a golf course on its chest and a sewage treatment plant on its tail. The government of Southern Sudan this week unveiled urban blueprints to rebuild cities in the shape of animals, raising eyebrows across the globe. The man behind the plan, Housing and Physical Planning Ministry undersecretary Daniel Wani, says the attention has given his ambitious proposal a boost of new energy. ""The reaction has been very good. We have been getting calls from everywhere,"" Wani says in the Southern Sudan capital of Juba. ""Generally, the feedback we are receiving indicates that we are on a positive track."" The $10.1 billion multi-decade project to re-create Southern Sudan's 10 state capitals into elaborately-shaped dream towns may sound Dubai-esque -- only Southern Sudan is no Dubai. Actually, it is one of the poorest places on earth. The undeveloped region -- which lacks any paved roads outside its three main cities -- is part of Africa's largest nation, Sudan, which is ruled by the Khartoum government South Sudanese fought against for most of the past half century in two long civil wars. But Southern Sudan expects to achieve independence next year through a January secession referendum promised in a 2005 peace deal that granted the war-torn region self-rule until the vote. Even without the unique city designs, the multi-billion dollar price tag alone was sure to turn heads. Southern Sudan's total budget for 2010 is less than $2 billion, 98 percent of which comes from the oil revenues it hopes will fund its postwar re-construction. Critics think South Sudan's expected oil bonanza could be getting to its head. ""There are so many priorities they should be focusing on before they should be attempting such a thing. It's not cost effective,"" says Ben Jerome Gama, 28, a South Sudanese living on a dirt road in Juba where the city's erratic electricity supply has yet to reach. ""There is a lot to address -- in health, education, infrastructure."" Others think the idea could help put an aspiring new nation on the map. ""If it happened, everybody would come to see the country. It would mean we are developed,"" says Ochira Bosco, 27, who works in a Juba restaurant. But Bosco says his government should budget for more pressing matters first. ""If they build these and we still don't have hospitals or proper schools or good roads, that would not be good,"" he says. Wani defends his plan, saying that one must start planning for the future today. And for those who consider the giraffe or rhino city designs silly or impractical, they should think bigger, says the official, who holds a doctorate in civil engineering from University of Leeds in the United Kingdom. ""The shapes are what is innovative about the whole idea, that is what is attracting all the attention,"" Wani says. Eventually, the government hopes to get more than 70 percent of the project financed privately. Businessmen from Japan and Abu Dhabi have already flown in to discuss joining the investor pool since the plans were unveiled. The proposal has yet to be finally approved by the nation's executive Cabinet, and investors will not begin work until a $500 million guarantee materializes from the Bank of Southern Sudan. But the man who envisions giving Southern Sudan a unique aerial view is confident his idea will soon turn stones on the ground. ""We are implementing the plan, definitely,"" he says.","The $10.1 billion project aims to re-create 10 state capitals .

"(CNN) -- So much for Instagram? Facebook on Thursday launched a photo-sharing app called Facebook Camera, which aims to make it simpler for the social network's users to upload and browse photos on smartphones. The news comes only weeks after Facebook spent $1 billion on a similar photo-sharing app called Instagram. And only days after the company's initial public offering got a lukewarm reception from Wall Street and raised the eyebrows of financial regulators. The company says the app, which will be available late Thursday for Apple iOS devices, makes Facebook photos more fun and accessible. ""When you launch the app, you'll see a feed of just great photos from the people you care about,"" the company said in a press release. ""You can swipe to see more of any album or tap to enlarge an individual photo."" The app lets users crop photos and add colorful filters. And people who use the app also can upload multiple pictures at once. ""Just select the shots you want to share by tapping the check-mark on each photo and then hit post,"" Facebook's statement says. ""You'll have a chance to add a caption, say where you were and tag friends before you share."" The app gets generally good marks from early reviewers, who say it is much faster than the primary Facebook app and displays photos in a large, crisp fashion. But the comparisons to Instagram are confounding tech bloggers, who are trying to figure out to what degree Facebook was influenced by the company it purchased. Mike Isaac, a writer at the blog All Things D, calls the app ""Instagram redux,"" since the release comes so closely on the heels of the company's purchase of that startup. While there are key similarities between the apps, he writes, Facebook ""was most likely working on this product long before buying Instagram was ever a real possibility."" The New York Times' Bits blog also says the similarities between the apps could be overstated. ""It might seem strange for Facebook to release a camera application with built-in filters just weeks after announcing plans to buy Instagram, the social photo app,"" the Times writes. ""But Facebook Camera is aimed at a different audience. Instagram has 40 million users, while Facebook has 900 million. This leaves a large swath of people who are not on Instagram but are actively taking photos and uploading them to Facebook. The filters in Facebook Camera were developed by Facebook and are not borrowed from Instagram."" At the blog VentureBeat, Sean Ludwig writes that Facebook Camera was ""clearly influenced by it [Instagram]. Once the Instagram deal does close, we expect the lines to blur even more,"" he says. Ellis Hamburger, writing for The Verge, had a more critical take: . ""Had the Instagram deal never occurred, Facebook Camera wouldn't really be much of an Instagram competitor anyway, lacking any mobile-only social circles, hashtagged sharing around specific topics, tilt-shift, and interesting filters, for that matter,"" he wrote.","Facebook launches a 'Camera' app on Thursday .

It is being compared to Instagram, which Facebook recently purchased .

"Perth, Australia (CNN) -- ""I'm an engineer, so we don't talk emotions too much."" Those were the words of Capt. Mark Matthews of the U.S. Navy shortly after the Australian Defense vessel Ocean Shield had discovered a series of pings in the southern Indian Ocean. Perhaps he didn't want to discuss his feelings. But he had a twinkle in his eye, a bit of what he called ""cautious optimism."" I've seen that same glimmer shining through on the faces of dozens of others involved in the arduous search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. It's been there through each new lead, and even through some of the setbacks. The search for the missing Boeing 777 has gone on for eight weeks now. We've all had to learn a new technical language: from Inmarsat satellite data and the ""Doppler Effect,"" to the TPL-25 and Bluefin-21. We've heard countless theories about where the plane might have gone and who might have been flying it. Both the science and the science fiction have, at times, almost drowned out what this search is about at its core: solving the mystery of what happened to the 239 men, women, and children who were on board MH370. Closure . It takes people to find clues and to follow the trail of where they lead. People who are working tirelessly across borders and time zones, putting their lives on hold with the aim of bringing even the smallest bit of closure to the families of those who have been lost, and to prevent their nightmare from ever happening again. Some, like Capt. Matthews, might humbly say that they're just doing their jobs. Others remain anonymous, like the international team in Kuala Lumpur, who did much to give the search a tangible focus, even if that focus has shifted several times. I've been covering the missing flight for CNN for more than 50 days in Malaysia and Australia. I can't pretend that what I do compares with the dedication of the hundreds of service members from China to New Zealand, who have flown tirelessly day after day over millions of square kilometers of the Indian Ocean. I can't pretend that I understand the pain of Selamat Omar, who lost his 29-year-old son, or Danica Weeks, whose husband, Paul, disappeared on the way to start a new job in Mongolia. But as a journalist, I've felt at least a small part of their confusion and frustration. I recall the difficulty in getting a candid response from Malaysian authorities in the early days of the search -- the way they sidestepped almost all tough questions during that first week after the plane vanished. I remember the Chinese family members who were brave enough to try to take their quest for answers public and were dragged out of the press room in Kuala Lumpur, screaming and crying. Thinking about their grief, the expressions on their faces that afternoon, still hits me hard. Human spirit . There have also been moments that have made me proud to be telling this story -- moments that have to do with the human spirit. The card from a 7-year-old on the Wall of Hope inside Kuala Lumpur International Airport, which said she was ready to greet the MH370 passengers as soon as they landed safely. The moment I saw the pinger locator and Bluefin-21 robotic submarine on the dock at Garden Island in Western Australia, I felt a sense of awe and honor standing just steps away from keys that still have the potential to unlock this puzzle. And the moment search chief Angus Houston told the world ""I'm now optimistic that we will find the aircraft ... in the not too distant future. But we haven't found it yet because this is a very challenging business."" A voice of reassurance and reason, even if the challenge soon outweighed the optimism. Over the past eight weeks, I've witnessed something. It's called hope. It was in the words of the housekeeper who answered the front door at Captain Zaharie's house in the Kuala Lumpur suburbs. It was in in the wake of the Ocean Shield as it pulled away from the dock at Stirling Naval Base and made speed for the search area. It was there when I sat a few feet away from the Malaysia Airlines CEO on Day 4, and it was there when I spoke to Captain Matthews around Day 44. Just a few days ago, I felt it again, when I returned to Pearce Air Force Base outside Perth. As I stepped onto the tarmac, I recalled the first time I'd done so, more than a month earlier, to welcome back one of our reporters after she'd taken part in an 11-hour search flight. Solving the mystery . Almost 350 flights later, the massive air search was over with no trace of MH370. Planes from seven countries were lined up in formation at Pearce. Flight crews from Australia to Malaysia to South Korea traded stories, reflecting on the moments behind them, before pausing to recognize the task that still lies ahead. I remember what a young American pilot who flew on the P8 Poseidon search plane told me: that his greatest disappointment after weeks of looking out over the vast open ocean was not being able to give the families what they needed the most. And that if he could continue the search, he would, until the day he found something. After all these weeks, it's a feeling that remains strong as ever -- the hope and the belief that we may eventually be able to solve this mystery, and that the families of 239 passengers and crew will one day have the answer to a crucial question: Why?","The search for the missing Boeing 777 has gone on for eight weeks now .
No closer to solving mystery of what happened to the 239 men, women, and children .
Despite frustration, searchers remain determined to bring closure to relatives of passengers ."
"(CNN) -- He smiles. He stares. He sits without apparent expression. Who is he? That's the question historians are trying to answer after a collection surfaced of some 450 photo booth portraits, taken of the same man over what appears to be decades. No one knows who he is or why he made, and kept, the photographs. ""Not knowing is very mysterious. It's like an abstract painting. You're going to fill in the blanks yourself. You bring to it what you know, and if we don't know anything, we sort of make up a story,"" said Donald Lokuta, a photography historian and owner of the collection. The photographs are being shown as part of ""Striking Resemblance: The Changing Art of Portraiture,"" an exhibition on display through July at Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Lokuta bought the prints a year or two ago at an antiques show in New York. He was immediately drawn to the images and to the mystery behind them. The photographs were taken in a Photomatic photo booth. They are small. Most have metal frames, though some of the later ones have either cardboard or plastic frames. Lokuta guesses the photographs were made over a roughly 30-year period, starting in the 1930s. He speculates on why the man made so many and talks about the prints' appeal. ""He was either hooked on self-portraits and kind of wanted to see himself in a photograph constantly, or he worked for the company maintaining the machine,"" said Lokuta. The theory that he worked in maintenance for the photo booth company mirrors the plot of the French film ""Amelie,"" as CNN.com readers have noted. ""It's the same guy, and he's getting a little older, and a little older and a little older. Then his hair is messed up, then his hair is neat. Then he's smiling a little bit, then he's not smiling. Then he's wearing a winter jacket, then he's wearing a sports jacket,"" Lokuta said. ""It's just so familiar. It's like looking at yourself in the mirror every morning."" A potential lead . After purchasing the photographs, Lokuta got curious about where they might have come from. He got in touch with Nakki Goranin, author of ""American Photobooth."" Besides being a wealth of knowledge about that particular chapter of U.S. history, Goranin owns some images of the same man. Turns out, the people who sold Lokuta the collection had previously sold a few of the photographs on eBay. Goranin bought those prints, which stand out because unlike the 445 that Lokuta has, Goranin's photographs show the man with children. She tracked down the sellers, who told her the photographs came from an auction in Michigan. ""I have a strong suspicion who the gentleman is,"" said Goranin, ""but I'm not 100% sure."" She declined to give the name of the man she thinks appears in the photographs until she can do more research. Selfies show 'ongoing portrait' Zimmerli curator Donna Gustafson believes that having a story to go along with the man's face would be interesting. ""Having a name to attach to the face would maybe in a way close the book on it, but on the other hand, might open a new book or a new chapter,"" she said. Gustafson and Lokuta are friends. She knew as soon as he showed her the photographs she wanted them for her portraiture exhibition. Gustafson says she doesn't really have a favorite from the collection. ""What I love the most is how all of them sort of blend into an ongoing portrait of someone over time,"" she said. Gustafson also loves the mystery. ""We just really don't know much about the man except that he seems to have enjoyed having his photo -- his selfie -- done, and he saved them all,"" she said. ""He seems like such an average guy, but this clearly sort of catapults him out of average into really interesting because why would he do this? And how is it possible that we have 445 pictures of a man and we know nothing about him?""","A collection of some 450 photo booth portraits are on display at Rutgers University .

"(CNN) -- A baseball tradition is about to end. This week, Major League Baseball announced it would no longer allow the use of chewing tobacco when fans are present. If you've got it, says the league, you've got to conceal it. Since baseball became a professional sport in the mid-19th century, players and coaches have been tucking tobacco between their gums and cheeks and spitting out brown saliva. It's a ritual that has permeated the game. Atlanta Braves coach Bobby Dews remembers the first time he was offered a ""chaw"" of tobacco, as they call it. It was 50 years ago when Dews left his junior year at Georgia Tech to sign a deal to play shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals' minor league team. He got a $20,000 signing bonus. ""Everyone was chewing tobacco in the minors,"" Dews says. ""It was almost like an initiation. You knew the major leaguers did it."" And everyone in the minors dreamed of the majors, including Dews. Dews' first day on the team, an older player offered him some tobacco. Why did so many players use it? ""I don't know. Maybe they thought it would help you be a better ballplayer. Or maybe it just made you feel like a better ballplayer,"" Dew recalls. ""I tried it. It made me sick right out of the chute. Lucky for me."" Dews played with the Cardinals farm team. Just like his father, who played more than a decade in the minors, Dews dreamed of playing in the majors. He recalls a story about chewing tobacco that his father passed down that may shed light on the roots of that baseball tradition. ""It was a couple years before I was born: around 1937 or '38, shortly after they built the old ballpark in Durham, North Carolina,"" Dews said. ""My father was in the bullpen a lot. He was a catcher. The ballpark's right field wall backed up to the Bull Durham Tobacco Factory. Young ladies who lived near the stadium would flirt with the guys in the bullpen and occasionally throw 'em tobacco."" Could that be where the term bullpen derived? Bull Durham chewing tobacco? The story sounds like good old-fashioned folklore. ""This is a story I've lived with,"" says Dew. ""You hear stories in your family so much they become true. I don't know."" Dews' father left home during the Great Depression and became a minor league player by 16. During World War II, Dews' father was playing for the Atlanta Crackers in AA baseball. Then he was drafted by the Army. After the war, he signed up for the Army Reserves, which periodically interrupted his 13-year baseball career. Dews' father had combat infantry badges from World War II, Korea and Vietnam. He didn't chew tobacco. But he smoked. And he drank. ""When he came back from Vietnam, he quit,"" Dews said. ""He never smoked or drank again."" Dews' grandparents raised him warning him that the men in the family had problems with alcohol. ""I was afraid to start drinking. I didn't want to become an alcoholic. I had a great desire to excel. I didn't have my first drink until I was 30."" And so, Dews, without chewing, without smoking, without drinking, played the minors and dreamed of the majors. After playing for 10 years, he realized, the St. Louis Cardinals were never going to call him up from the farm league. They told him, 'we don't want you to be a major league player. We want you to be a major league coach.' That meant coaching for a long time in the minors. So he honed his skills in the minors, developing young talent the way he wishes he'd been developed, learning from the mistakes that the men who should have been his mentors made. ""I was 30-something. I hadn't made it to the majors. A minor league manager for St. Louis was a lonely job. You didn't have a staff of coaches. By then, I thought I could handle anything. So I started having a few beers to relax after the game."" Before he got too deep into drinking, Dews made a call for a new job, a new route to the majors. The Atlanta Braves answered the call. Dews became the team's third-base coach. But his ascent hit a very big roadblock. The one his family warned about. In 1988, upper management realized he had a problem with alcohol. He was determined not to be derailed. ""I found myself in a rehab center in St. Simon's Island, just in the nick of time,"" Dews said. ""I'd spent a lot of time trying to get to the top of this game, so I was gonna get help. It's not like it's going to go away. I'm not drinking. But I'll always be an alcoholic."" Dews made it back to sobriety. And he made it back to the majors. He's been coaching with the Atlanta Braves for the past 37 years, with over half a century working in baseball. A number of years were as a pitching coach, in the bullpen, where his father had spent so much time as a catcher. Even before Major League Baseball announced this week that there would be no more tobacco chewing within sight of the fans, teams would bring in well-known players such as Bill Tuttle, a former Detroit Tigers outfielder, to tell players about his tobacco chewing days and the throat cancer he battled. The league was committed to advising players on the dangers of smoking and drinking. Dews has continued to follow in the tradition of his father. Like his father, Dews writes books. His latest is ""Unpublished Poets."" Like his father, he didn't chew tobacco. Like his father, he quit drinking and is proud to say he hasn't had a drink in 25 years. Unlike his father, Dews made it to the majors and remains with the Atlanta Braves. At 71, Dews still goes to spring training and coaches all the home games. ""I help coaches if they have questions -- if I can help them -- through my experience."" Bobby Dews dreamed of the majors. He kept dreaming, until he got there.","Major League Baseball: Chewing tobacco not allowed when fans are present .

"(CNN) -- Having cycled around the world and then swum the length of Britain, adventurer Sean Conway is taking on an altogether different challenge -- to restore a historic wartime ship which was set for the sailing scrapyard. As well as saving a piece of maritime heritage, Conway says there was a more practical necessity behind his unusual purchase. ""Basically my swim from Land's End to John O'Groats left me flat broke and I need somewhere to live,"" he told CNN. ""I'm 32 and have had to move back in with my mother. ""People have the impression that adventurers and explorers are all rich but nothing could be further from the truth."" Conway has sold the support boat that was his constant companion during his 900-mile (1400 km) four-and-a-half-month swim up the west coast of Britain last year to fund his purchase of Lady Sybil H, a six-berth motor yacht with historical connections. Titanic connection . It was made in 1931 by famous Belfast shipbuilders Harland and Wolff, who were also responsible for the ill-fated Titanic. ""I love the history behind this,"" said Conway. ""It has a double teak hull and being 82 years old was more of an attraction for me than just having a boat to live in."" Conway is writing a book and capitalizing on his new-found celebrity (""the last month or so have been crazy"") to help fund the project, hoping to equip Lady Sybil so he can live completely self-sufficiently. ""That means solar panels and a wood-burning stove and other environmentally-friendly features,"" he said. There is a ""growing demand"" for wooden boats of this type, according to Paul Leinthall-Cowman, the owner of Classic Yacht Brokerage which sold Conway his piece of history, said . ""It's like owning a classic car, they stand out from the crowd,"" he told CNN. Leinthall-Cowman has dealt in boats which have belonged to royalty and foreign heads of state, but it is doubtful he would have had such an unusual customer as the intrepid Conway. ""He actually brought Lady Sybil during the middle of his epic swim and had not actually set eyes on her,"" he revealed. Online purchase . Conway takes up the story: ""I saw it on eBay and thought, 'They must have got the price wrong,' so I got my mother Badette to check it out. Living nearby, Badette was able to arrange a quick viewing and the purchase was completed. ""It needs a lot of work and it's not habitable at the moment,"" Conway admitted. Leinthall-Cowman, who has a special affection for Lady Sybil H and wanted her to go to a ""good home,"" said he had no doubt Conway could achieve anything he set his mind to. ""He's an extraordinary guy who breaks the mold,"" he said. ""To do his swim on a shoestring budget makes it a remarkable achievement and it took quite a while for the penny to drop with a lot of people."" Conway and his four-strong support team left Land's End on the southwestern tip of England on June 30 -- only able to start their adventure because of late help from swimwear manufacturer Speedo. By his own admission ""a pretty average swimmer,"" the combination of difficult weather and his lack of experience put them behind schedule. Herculean task . Conway's coach Mark Kleanthous, himself a 36-time Ironman triathlete, had done his best to teach him better technique but knew he faced an herculean task even with such a determined athlete. ""He was below average as a swimmer, great fitness but with heavy dense legs that dropped in the water,"" he told CNN. Helped by continuous tips from Kleanthous, Conway made painstaking progress along England's west coast, averaging about 15 km per day spent in the water. He was severely hampered by tides, and especially jellyfish. Conway was stung so often he grew a ""ridiculous"" ginger beard to protect his face with lashings of Vaseline. Conway, who once climbed Mount Kilimanjaro dressed as a penguin, cut an almost comic figure with his emaciated body -- his weight plummeted to below 10 stone (63 kg) -- topped by a giant and straggling mass of ginger hair and beard. But his determination to succeed was no laughing matter and, as he neared John O'Groats at the northern tip of Scotland, his feat began to capture the media's attention. After completing the final agonizing stretch in freezing cold waters on November 11 (""way behind schedule,"" said Kleanthous) Conway could perhaps perhaps afford to rest on his laurels and bask in the glow of his success. New challenge . But for a man who needs to test himself in everything he does, from building a home on an old ship to raising money for his charities with his incredible endurance tests, it has not taken long for him to get itchy feet. ""My next challenge is running from Cairo to Cape Town,"" he announced in a matter-of-fact way about a 7,000-kilometer journey across the continent of Africa. Not one to let the grass grow under those feet, Conway has already purchased a website domain to publicize his attempt. After his swimming and cycling feats, it would complete an ""ultimate triathlon"" and he is planning to attempt the final leg in 2015. He will again enlist the help of Kleanthous, who has run 75 marathons plus completing a triple Ironman where the final leg was a 126-km foot race. Kleanthous is warning that this will be the ""toughest challenge"" yet for Conway. ""From first meeting Sean I knew he could cycle around the world and possibly swim the length of Britain, but this will be much harder despite him being slight in stature,"" he added. ""Running long distances day in, day out is very destructive on the muscles and joints."" Rhino run? Not only that, Zimbabwe-born Conway -- whose father is a rhino conservationist -- has been dabbling with the idea of running for an animal charity. But even he may baulk of running the whole thing in a rhino suit. ""Perhaps they can make me a lightweight version,"" he joked. Assuming sales of his book and other media work bears fruit, Conway may also have the time between his training to restore Lady Sybil H to former glories. The 63ft Pinnace was a real work horse of the RAF Marine fleet, being used for the recovery of torpedoes, sea survival exercises and ferrying duties for service personnel. She was professionally converted to a motor-yacht in the late 1940s and owned by the same family until recently. Conway has already registered her with Britain's National Register of Historic Vessels ahead of the further works. Cowman-Leinthall hopes the peripatetic Conway will use Lady Sybil H on Britain's extensive network of canals to best ""show her off to the public."" Simple philosophy . For now Conway will keep his mother company and prepare for his next epic adventure, but he is keen to emphasize that he is not some ""super human"" individual and does not take himself too seriously. ""I don't have titanium bones and I was not good at sports at school,"" he said. ""My message is anyone can do this."" But Kleanthous believes his protÃ©gÃ© does indeed belong to a special breed of individuals who can push themselves to the limit and beyond to achieve their goals. ""Humans have a natural instinct to explore and see what is possible,"" he said. ""Some people dream but only a few go and find out what is possible."" Conway certainly falls into that category.","Sean Conway has cycled around the world and swum length of Britain .

"(EW) -- Cue the faux-surprise. Female-targeted films ""A Fault in Our Stars"" and ""Maleficent"" wiped the floor with the competition, forcing Tom Cruise's more teenage boy-friendly ""Edge of Tomorrow"" into a third-spot opening. Women made up a staggering 82 percent of the opening-weekend audience for the adaptation of John Green's YA novel about teenage cancer patients -- comparatively, ""Twilight's"" initial audience was only 75 percent female. The film made $48.2 million, vaulting it alongside ""Love Story"" in the firmament of emotionally and financially resonant weepies. That's less than the $56 million ""Divergent"" made its first three days out, but that other Shailene Woodley-starring YA adaptation cost a whole lot more. Of course, ""Fault's"" success will probably level out in the coming weeks once the film's steadfast fanbase decides that their eighth bawl-filled screening is enough. (It was a 52 percent drop from Friday to Saturday alone.) But even considering just this weekend, the adaptation is an unqualified success for Fox and stands as more not-quite-shocking evidence that when you target movies at a demographic that's typically underserved -- particularly in the summer months -- you can reap pretty big dividends. Especially when that demographic represents half of the world's population. 'The Fault in Our Stars': Are those tears of joy, critics? Another female-driven success, ""Maleficent,"" dropped only 52 percent to snag second place with $33.5 million. With a two-week total of $127.4 million, the film is lagging behind other CG-heavy Disney reboots like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" both of which featured ""Maleficent"" director Robert Stromberg as their production designer. But with a strong international gross and still yet to open in the major Asian markets, the Jolie-starring fairy tale looks to be headed for a more-than-comfy global total somewhere in the half-a-billion range. Despite good reviews and Cruise's 100-watt smirk, the sci-fi action flick ""Edge of Tomorrow"" disappointed with $29.1 million, $8 million less than the similarly packaged ""Oblivion"" did last year. Directed by Doug Liman, the film stars Cruise as a PR flunkey-turned-soldier who finds himself rebooting every time he dies. But even if Cruise can't outsprint a pair of young cancer victims to the top of the U.S. box office, he can still flex his Hollywood appeal overseas where ""Edge"" took the No. 1 spot with a much healthier $82 million. 'Edge of Tomorrow': A new day for Tom Cruise? ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" raked in another $14.7 million to make its total $189.1 million. In a superhero super-brawl, this means that ""X-Men"" will almost definitely end up making more than ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" but it'll have to work pretty hard to top ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier."" Meanwhile Seth MacFarlane's ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" continues to flounder after it had a hard time getting its gun out of the holster its first weekend. There were tumbleweeds in the movie theaters this week too, and its second-weekend gross of $7.2 million brings its total to a meager $30.1 million. It appears there isn't much gold in them thar hills. 1. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" — $48.2 million . 2. ""Maleficent"" — $33.5 million . 3. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" — $29.1 million . 4.

"KANSAS CITY, Kansas (CNN) -- Army Spc. Jeremy Hall was raised Baptist. Army Spc. Jeremy Hall, who was raised Baptist but is now an atheist, says the military violated his religious freedom. Like many Christians, he said grace before dinner and read the Bible before bed. Four years ago when he was deployed to Iraq, he packed his Bible so he would feel closer to God. He served two tours of duty in Iraq and has a near perfect record. But somewhere between the tours, something changed. Hall, now 23, said he no longer believes in God, fate, luck or anything supernatural. Hall said he met some atheists who suggested he read the Bible again. After doing so, he said he had so many unanswered questions that he decided to become an atheist. His sudden lack of faith, he said, cost him his military career and put his life at risk. Hall said his life was threatened by other troops and the military assigned a full-time bodyguard to protect him out of fear for his safety.  Watch why Hall says his lack of faith almost got him killed » . In March, Hall filed a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, among others. In the suit, Hall claims his rights to religious freedom under the First Amendment were violated and suggests that the United States military has become a Christian organization. ""I think it's utterly and totally wrong. Unconstitutional,"" Hall said. Hall said there is a pattern of discrimination against non-Christians in the military. Two years ago on Thanksgiving Day, after refusing to pray at his table, Hall said he was told to go sit somewhere else. In another incident, when he was nearly killed during an attack on his Humvee, he said another soldier asked him, ""Do you believe in Jesus now?"" Hall isn't seeking compensation in his lawsuit -- just the guarantee of religious freedom in the military. Eventually, Hall was sent home early from Iraq and later returned to Fort Riley in Junction City, Kansas, to complete his tour of duty. He also said he missed out on promotions because he is an atheist. ""I was told because I can't put my personal beliefs aside and pray with troops I wouldn't make a good leader,"" Hall said. Michael Weinstein, a retired senior Air Force officer and founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, is suing along with Hall. Weinstein said he's been contacted by more than 8,000 members of the military, almost all of them complaining of pressure to embrace evangelical Christianity. ""Our Pentagon, our Pentacostalgon, is refusing to realize that when you put the uniform on, there's only one religious faith: patriotism,"" Weinstein said. Religious discrimination is a violation of the First Amendment and is also against military policy. The Pentagon refused to discuss specifics of Hall's case -- citing the litigation. But Deputy Undersecretary Bill Carr said complaints of evangelizing are ""relatively rare."" He also said the Pentagon is not pushing one faith among troops. ""If an atheist chose to follow their convictions, absolutely that's acceptable,"" said Carr. ""And that's a point of religious accommodation in department policy, one may hold whatever faith, or may hold no faith."" Weinstein said he doesn't buy it and points to a promotional video by a group called Christian Embassy. The video, which shows U.S. generals in uniform, was shot inside the Pentagon. The generals were subsequently reprimanded. Another group, the Officers' Christian Fellowship, has representatives on nearly all military bases worldwide. Its vision, which is spelled out on the organization's Web site, reads, ""A spiritually transformed military, with ambassadors for Christ in uniform empowered by the Holy Spirit."" Weinstein has a different interpretation. ""Their purpose is to have Christian officers exercise Biblical leadership to raise up a godly army,"" he says. But Carr said the military's position is clear. ""Proselytizing or advancing a religious conviction is not what the nation would have us do and it's not what the military does,"" Carr said. The U.S. Justice Department is expected to respond to Hall's lawsuit this week. In the meantime, he continues to work in the military police unit at Fort Riley and plans to leave as soon as his tour of duty expires next year.","Army Spc.

"(CNN) -- Police in Malaysia are holding 11 people on suspicion of involvement in a militant group responsible for planning acts of terror, police spokeswoman Asmawati Ahmad said Sunday. There is no indication that the group, arrested last week, has any connection to the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, she said. The detainees are also suspected of having links to terrorists in other countries. Police plan to detain other suspects as a preemptive measure, Asmawati said. The arrests were made in the city of Selangor, just outside the capital Kuala Lumpur, and in the state of Kedah, which borders on Thailand. The neighboring country has closed and closely monitored the border with that region of Malaysia in a crackdown on terrorism, according to the CIA World Factbook. The violence in Thailand stems from ethnic Malay Muslim separatists. This year, they began targeting Thai Buddhist woman, killing them and mutilating their bodies, Human Rights Watch has reported.

"(CNN) -- The Italian navy said it rescued more than 1,000 migrants from several overcrowded boats in the Mediterranean between Tuesday and Wednesday morning. The migrants, who included women and children, had set off from the North African coast and were not equipped with life jackets, the navy said. They are now being taken by ship to the port of Augusta, on Italy's Mediterranean island of Sicily. On Tuesday, three other navy ships disembarked 1,049 more migrants rescued since Monday in the ports of Augusta and Pozzallo, also in Sicily, the navy said. Italy is a major gateway into Europe for migrants who come by sea from North Africa in hope of reaching EU soil. Shipwrecks off the shores of Sicily and the tiny island of Lampedusa are common, thanks to the frequent use of overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. But despite the dangers, migrants keep coming. Some are from African nations, particularly Eritrea and Somalia, while others have fled war-torn Syria, officials say. According to the European border agency Frontex, more than 12,000 illegal migrants were detected off Sicily and 8,000 off Lampedusa in the third quarter of last year. Many of those arriving on Italy's shores have set sail from Libya, the agency said.

"Archaeologists working under the direction of the Israeli Antiquities Authority have uncovered a 1500-year-old road running through the center of Jerusalem's Old City. Excavation director Dr. Ofer Sion said the discovery lends further credence to the accuracy of what is known as the Madaba Map - a Byzantine period mosaic map of the Holy Land that depicts an entrance into Jerusalem that leads to a single central street. Archaeologists working in Jerusalem have made various finds to suggest the Madaba map was geographically correct, but the road depicted in the mosaic had not been found. ""It is proof of this beautiful map and for this street from the Byzantine period"" Sion told reporters at the dig location. The ancient road was found near the Jaffa Gate of Jerusalem's Old City 4.5 meters under current street level when municipality workers initiated an infrastructure improvement project. The road dates from the period when Jerusalem was under Christian control and was constructed with large flagstones of more than a meter in length. Sion said the road connected the western wall of the city to the eastern side of Jerusalem and commented that at that time ""hundreds of thousands of people are reaching the city, pilgrims from all over the world, and they are coming to Jerusalem and entering through the gate and going down the center, to the market of the city. They are going down in this street..."" Next to the road archaeologists also discovered a stone foundation which supported a sidewalk and a row of columns. In a written statement Sion remarked ""It is wonderful to see that David Street, which is teeming with so much life today, actually preserved the route of the noisy street from 1,500 years ago"". Other artefacts discovered in the excavation included coins, pottery vessels, and five bronze weights that are believed to have been used by merchants for weighing precious metals. The Madaba map, is large 8 X 16 meter mosaic located in the apse of the church of Saint George in Masdaba, Jordan. It is the oldest known cartographic representation of the Holy Land and at it's center is a detailed depiction of Jerusalem in the 6th century C.E.. The mosaic has served as a guide to historians and archaeologists as to what Byzantine period Jerusalem may have looked like and depicts many landmarks that survive until this day including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and Damascus Gate.","Ancient road uncovered running through Jerusalem's center .

"(CNN) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that he will not resign in the wake of his department being accused of deadly delays in health care at some of its hospitals. ""I serve at the pleasure of the president,"" Shinseki told the newspaper when asked whether he would step down. ""I signed on to make some changes, I have work to do."" The White House stood its ground when asked whether Shinseki will continue to lead the department. In its daily briefing -- a question-and-answer session dominated by lengthy discussions on the conflict in Ukraine, abducted Nigerian schoolgirls and the White House climate change report -- press secretary Jay Carney offered only a few sentences when asked whether Shinseki's job was safe. President Barack Obama takes seriously the allegations that veterans died waiting for care at the Phoenix VA hospital, Carney said, reiterating that the VA's inspector general is conducting an independent probe into the allegations. ""The President remains confident in Secretary Shinseki's ability to lead the department and take appropriate action,"" Carney said, repeating the White House response this week to two veterans groups' calls for Shinseki's ouster. Shinseki said Tuesday that is ""very sensitive to the allegations"" coming from the Phoenix probe. ""I need to let the independent IG (inspector general) complete his investigation,"" he told the Journal. Calls for his resignation . On Monday, the nation's largest veteran organization, the American Legion, and another veterans group, Concerned Veterans for America, called for Shinseki's resignation. The calls came after months of CNN exclusive reporting on U.S. veterans who have died awaiting care at VA hospitals across the country, including in Phoenix. ""It's not something we do lightly. But we do so today because it is our responsibility as advocate for the men and women who have worn this nation's uniform,"" said Daniel M. Dellinger, national commander of the American Legion. Added Pete Hegseth, CEO of the Concerned Veterans of America, in a statement: . ""We're proud to stand with The American Legion as they take this courageous and historic stand. As America's largest veterans organization, their moral authority on this issue is unimpeachable. We applaud their demands for accountability at the very top of the Department of Veterans Affairs."" Dozens of deaths . Shinseki told the Wall Street Journal that he would increase the communication among the leaders atop his department and veterans and address what appears to be a lack of faith in top management. ""If veteran service organizations are voicing concern about that, I will accept I have work to do to bolster confidence in their health care system,"" he said. CNN has been reporting on delays in care and patient deaths at VA hospitals for the past six months, including at hospitals in South Carolina, Georgia and Texas. After CNN's coverage, the VA acknowledged in April that 23 veterans had died as a result of delayed care in recent years, but sources tell CNN that number could be much higher. In an exclusive report two weeks ago, CNN interviewed a retired VA doctor from Phoenix who charged that more than 40 American veterans have died waiting for care at the VA hospital there. Throughout the network's reporting, CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Shinseki, but in the six months that CNN has been reporting on the delays, Shinseki has yet to speak to CNN. CNN is not alone in getting virtually no response from VA officials. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, issued this statement late Monday: . ""For nearly a year, we have been pleading with top department leaders and President Obama to take immediate steps to stop the growing pattern of preventable veteran deaths and hold accountable any and all VA employees who have allowed patients to slip through the cracks. ""In response, we've received disturbing silence from the White House and one excuse after another from VA."" VA spokesman Drew Brookie's statement, released late Monday, read: . ""The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) takes any allegations about patient care or employee misconduct very seriously.

"(CNN) -- A bear attacked and killed a worker at an oil sands plant in western Canada Wednesday, authorities said. The attack took place at a Suncor Energy base plant, 200 miles north of Edmonton. The female employee was killed by a mature male black bear in the North Steepbank Mine, described as a ""remote part of the main plant,"" CNN network partner CTV reported. ""We are shocked by this very unusual incident and there are no words to express the tragedy of this situation,"" said Mark Little, a Suncor executive vice president. ""All of us need to focus on personal safety and I would urge everyone to be extremely vigilant in dealing with wildlife."" The company said the woman's name won't be released without the consent of the family. Suncor said is cooperating with ""appropriate authorities and will complete a full investigation"" into the incident. Between 1900 and 2009, 63 people were killed in 59 black bear attacks in Canada and the United States, according to a 2011 Journal of Wildlife Management report. The study concludes that as human populations and developments rise, so have bear attacks. The bear in the Wednesday attack was put down. Barrie Harrison with Alberta Occupational Health and Safety told CBC News that officials are now looking into whether the employee was alone when the attack occurred. ""I do know that, certainly from an Occupational Health and Safety perspective, this is the first that I'm aware of having a worker either seriously injured or killed by a bear of any variety,"" Harrison said.

"New York (CNN) -- Officials have now identified all three people killed in the hot air balloon fire and crash at a Virginia festival. They are the 65-year-old pilot, Daniel Kirk; and two passengers: Natalie Lewis, 24, and Virginia ""Ginny"" Doyle, 44. Both Lewis and Doyle were members of the University of Richmond women's basketball program, the university said. ""We are deeply saddened by the tragic event and the loss of Ginny. Words cannot express how we feel or our remorse,"" the Doyle family said in a statement Monday. ""She touched the lives of many and lived life to the fullest. She will be greatly missed and holds a special place in all our hearts."" What authorities still do not know is what caused the balloon to drift into power lines, catch fire and crash Friday night. Police and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. Norm Hyde, spokesman for festival host Meadow Event Park, said Federal Aviation Administration inspectors were on site Friday, checking balloons and safety records before the balloons took off. All the balloons' safety records were up to date, he said. Weather conditions are one of the elements investigators are looking at, NTSB air safety investigator Heidi Moats said. There was no inclement weather at the time and, so far, officials don't believe those conditions played a role in the crash, Geller said over the weekend. Thirteen hot air balloons had been soaring on the eve of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival in Doswell, and three were landing close to each other. Two landed safely, Geller said, but as the third balloon descended, it hit a power line, sparking a fire that spread quickly. The pilot began doing his safety maneuvers and ""took every step to manage the situation,"" Geller said. But then there was an explosion, and the basket and balloon separated.

"Editor's note: As part of CNN's Defining America project, CNN iReport is conducting a cultural census. We're asking people to share a self-portrait, show off their handwriting, tell us what they typically eat for dinner, and more. This piece is part of our series focusing on the self-portrait project. It was inspired by the fact that the self-portrait assignment was the most popular of the five cultural census assignments, with around 500 submissions. CNN -- After scavenging through thousands of strangers' Facebook photo albums, you learn a thing or two about how to represent yourself online. ""You can tell who puts in the effort to curate their online profile and who doesn't,"" says New York artist Matt Held. With the help of wife Joelle Held, he has painted 75 portraits based on real Facebook pictures, and in the process gained an intimate look at some of the best and worst kinds of photos you can post. If you use social media, you've no doubt seen a few people who are a little shy about the whole profile picture thing. Maybe they leave up the pale blue default avatar or hide in a massive group of nubile co-eds. Or, perhaps they have an outdated photo -- or keep changing it every day. Before you update your profile, think about what images you use to represent yourself. ""Nobody wants to see you making out with your boyfriend,"" Joelle Held quipped. The Helds' Portrait Painted project ran from 2008 to 2010, and the Facebook photos they used were selected from the 5,000 or so new ""friends"" they made along the way. Many of the Helds' subjects made the paintings their default photos because they were such a unique creation that told so much about them. No surprise, social media sites are becoming more and more important for networking and socialization. New friends and potential employers alike could be encountering your profile photos and information before actually meeting you in person. Profile photos are all the more important now. Matt Held says he was looking for amateur-style images rather than glossy compositions from professional photographers. ""I was looking for that sort of everyday photo, but there had to be something quirky about it whether it was a prop they used or their hair was bright blue."" Share a photo of yourself as part of the cultural census project . A profile picture conveys a sense of identity, and nowhere is this more apparent than on Facebook, which even has the word ""face"" in its name. Inspired by the tradition of scholastic facebooks designed for students to identify each other, the site began as a place where college students could put names to faces and vice versa. Whether you're searching for a new friend or reconnecting with an old pal, photos help bridge the gaps between individuals, says Meredith Chin, manager of product communications for Facebook. They also help distinguish one John Smith from another. Chin recommends using a photo of yourself if possible. However, it's quite common to see people post photos of an inanimate object or their dog. ""Being able to see someone's face is really important,"" says Chin. ""It's also a big part of expressing who you are."" She notes that this self-expression extends to becoming part of a community and feeling a sense of belonging. The Facebook team has noticed a few trends over the years. In the aftermath of the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, students uploaded photos with the school colors as a show of support. Mother's Day and Father's Day bring photos of parents to profile walls every year, and spontaneous memes and trends sometimes pop up around holidays and news. President Obama's inauguration inspired many Facebookers to post artsy photos of themselves filtered in the style of Obama's campaign logo. ""When you see your friends doing something or express an opinion about something ... you're a lot more inclined to offer your own experience or share your own opinion,"" Chin says. Facebook generally keeps tight wraps on profile photo information, but other sites have actually produced graphs and visualizations based on their data aggregations. The dating site OkCupid maintains a blog called OkTrends, and it's a fun place to study profile anthropology. Christian Rudder, OkCupid editorial director, says sites like Twitter give people 140-character status nuggets, but potential dates have less to work with. ""A dating site is one of the few places where a stranger is trying to make a judgment about you and a profile picture is all they have to go on,"" Rudder says. After hours of combing through all the photos on the site and manually tagging them according to various criteria, he's noticed a few things that seem to help users get more messages, which was a metric for defining what constitutes a ""better"" profile image. A few basics go a long way. Skip the flash; use natural light instead. Don't get super close, and make sure you're in an interesting or meaningful setting. Worry less about technology and more about the composition of your shots. ""With the advent of high-quality, not too expensive, kind of pro-am cameras, people are able to take better pictures."" The data also suggests you might be able to get away without showing a photo of your face, so long as your chosen image is interesting and eye-catching. Whatever you choose, be true to yourself. Be the way you really are. Don't try to be a suit if you're really a T-shirt. ""You've got to ask that secondary question: What am I about and who do I want to meet?"" That means putting some thought into what you hope to say about yourself with your profile. If you're a world traveler and want to interact with others like yourself, Rudder says post a photo from one of your recent adventures. Same goes for other hobbies and pursuits. Or, if it so happens you're looking for romantic exploits, the numbers say you might want to consider posting something tastefully suggestive. Seriously. And as much as people gripe about shirtless photos, Rudder says they seem to work in the dating arena. ""Those people do get lots of messages, that's for sure."" Looking back on their favorite paintings, the Helds say photos with an original, creative approach make the best impression. Matt Held suggested showing some of the environment in profile photos to add context. He gave an example of skaters who showed an urban and industrial environment, an ""almost perfect"" snapshot of their life. Another memorable image the Helds recall was a man in a pink bunny suit. The resulting painted portrait seemed to hint at inner sadness beneath the rabbit-eared smile. Things to avoid? Intimate moments, private parts and anything tacky. Go easy on photos of your kids, and avoid putting up photos of yourself in your underwear. And if children are using Facebook, it's especially important to exercise caution with what they're posting online. But the most important rule of all might be to remember that the Internet never forgets, so put some thought into what you share. ""That stuff really does stay there forever,"" Matt Held says.","Profile pictures represent you online, and help people know they've found you .
Your photo should include clues about your life, say some .
Facebook users on occasion change profile photos en masse as part of social movements .

"(CNN) -- An elaborate kidnapping plot that targeted a Wake Forest, North Carolina, man ended with his dramatic rescue in Atlanta by an FBI hostage squad about midnight Wednesday, law enforcement said Thursday. Frank Arthur Janssen is receiving medical treatment but is safe after being held captive for five days by five people who face federal kidnapping charges, according to law enforcement officials who held a news conference in Wake Forest. The kidnappers sent demands to Janssen's family ""for the benefit"" of Kelvin Melton, an inmate at Polk Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, read an affidavit in support of a search warrant related to criminal complaints against the defendants. Melton is serving a life sentence without parole, said FBI North Carolina Special Agent John Strong. It was not immediately clear for what. Janssen's daughter, an assistant district attorney in Wake County, had prosecuted Melton, officials said. The affidavit details threats sent via text to Janssen's wife and daughters, a drama that underscores Strong's description of the kidnappers at the news conference. He called them ""very dangerous people."" On Monday at 1:51 a.m., Janssen's wife, Christie, began to receive text messages from a phone number with an Atlanta area code, the affidavit says. The messages said her husband had been kidnapped. One text said her husband was in the trunk of a car en route to California. Another threatened her, saying that if she contacted law enforcement, ""we will send (Janssen) back to you in 6 boxes and every chance we get we will take someone in your family to Italy and torture and kill them ... we will do a drive by and gun down anybody...and throw a grenade in your window."" If the kidnappers' demands were not met, her husband would be hurt, the texts promised. The five facing charges are: Jenna Paulin Martin, Tiana Maynard, Clifton James Roberts and Jevante Price -- also known as ""Flame"" -- and Michael Montreal Gooden -- also known as ""Hot"" -- according to court documents. Don Connelly, law enforcement coordinator with the U.S. attorney's office, said pleas have not been entered. Authorities said that none of the defendants has retained counsel. Threatening texts to wife . On April 5, a woman knocked on Janssen's door, and when he opened it, several people jumped him and used a Taser to subdue him, according to the affidavit. The attackers dragged him to their car and took off, crossing into Georgia, the document shows. Janssen's wife knew that her husband was going out for a bike ride Saturday, but when she came home that day after a shopping outing to find he'd not returned, she grew alarmed, according to a news release from Wake Forest. She saw what appeared to be drops of blood outside their house, it said, and called police. On April 9, Christie Janssen received another text from a different number that also had an Atlanta area code, the affidavit said. That message included a photo of her husband bound and seated in a chair. Another text came: ""Tomorrow we will call you again an (sic) if you can not tell me where my things are at tomorrow i will start torchering (sic)"" Frank Janssen. ""If we find out the police seen this will kill both people now and go for you (sic) family,"" the text read, suggesting that another person had been abducted. One of the numbers connected to the kidnapping was identified as transmitting messages from Polk Correctional Institution, according to the affidavit, and the user of that particular number placed 99 calls to Melton's daughters. Melton's girlfriend told law enforcement that that number belonged to the inmate, the affidavit said. 'Get a bag, put it over his head' Law enforcement monitored calls between that number and another involved in the kidnapping, the affidavit detailed. According to the document, two male callers could be heard saying: . ""The first spot we are checking out is close to the house."" ""We want to make sure it's in a secluded area and the ground is soft so we can go 3 feet deep."" ""Get a bag, put it over his head, and stuff something in his mouth."" ""However you feel like doing it, just do it."" ""Make sure to clean the area up. Don't leave anything. Don't leave any DNA behind."" ""Get some night time medication and make him go to sleep."" ""Make him drink the whole bottle of Nyquil."" ""Let's do it in the wee hours of the morning."" ""Make sure it is not a half-assed job. Get bleach and throw it on the walls. Maybe do it in the closet."" After that conversation, authorities tried to enter Melton's prison cell to find the phone number used in the communications. Melton tried to bar the door and smashed the phone, the affidavit says. Later, at 10:40 p.m. April 9, law enforcement monitored a conversation between two callers who stated, ""FBI helicopters are outside. We gotta get rid of holmes."" A woman can be heard saying, ""I'm not going anywhere, FBI are all over."" While the search was on for Janssen in Atlanta, law enforcement traced one of the phone numbers to a residence in Austell, Georgia, belonging to Tiana Maynard. She was not there, but her children were, and law enforcement took them into protective custody, the affidavit said. Shortly after Janssen was rescued, Clifton Roberts drove a blue Chevy Tahoe with Maynard and Jenna Martin to a police station to get Maynard's children. Inside the Tahoe, law enforcement saw picks, shovels and a .45-caliber pistol, according to the affidavit. In connection with the search of Atlanta residences linked to the threatening text messages, officers questioned Price and Gooden, the affidavit details. Price ""revealed his awareness of the kidnapping and acknowledged that he and Gooden were supposed to be the 'night watch' over the victim,"" the document states. Price led agents to the Forest Cove apartment complex in southeast Atlanta, where Janssen was rescued, according to officials. A father reunited with family, a shaken DA office . Janssen has been reunited with his family, officials said Thursday. After he was freed, doctors evaluated him, Strong said, adding that he is receiving medical care. The FBI in Charlotte and Atlanta, the Wake Forest Police Department and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation are continuing to investigate the case, along with other law enforcement agencies in North Carolina and Georgia. Ned Mangum, district attorney for Wake County confirmed to CNN that Colleen Janssen works in his office. ""This is different from anything we've ever had to my knowledge in the state of North Carolina,"" he said. ""I've been in this court house for 16 years, and unfortunately, from time to time, there are threats made to courthouse officials. You rarely see threats against people's family and certainly rarely see something with this much precision."" He said his staff is ""incredibly professional"" and handles serious cases, but ""this one really affected us because it's one of our own,"" he said. ""I've never seen our office as anxious as the past several days, and I'm so proud of them for not saying anything to compromise the investigation.""","FBI: Frank Arthur Janssen was abducted from his home five days ago .

"(CNN) -- If the pings reported by the Chinese and Australians turn out to be from Malaysia Flight 370's data recorders, we may be on the road to finding the plane and solving the mystery of its disappearance. But even if that is the case, we'll need to resolve a larger issue: Incomprehensible as it might seem to the flying public, it is almost equally perplexing to airline pilots that a 650,000 pound airplane can disappear with barely a trace. Considering that the 777 is one of the most sophisticated and highly regarded airliners in the world, it doesn't make sense. Nor does it make sense that in this information overload world of cell phones, Twitter, and Facebook, that communication could break down to such a degree. So, how does one explain this anomaly? More importantly, how does one prevent a Malaysia Flight 370 mystery from happening again? First, a basic understanding of airspace is required from the standpoint of radar and communication. In most parts of the world, radar is available and operating to track both civilian and military airplanes. Primary radar sends a signal from a ground-based station using that big, screen-like rotating antenna that one sees at the local airport. The signal bounces back from the airplane and back to the antenna, ""painting"" a dot on an air traffic controller's screen. With the use of an on-board transponder, the radar signal ""interrogates"" the airplane by use of a four-digit discrete code that gives it a specific identity. The code is assigned by air traffic control. In addition to the flight number, or tail number, an airspeed is displayed on the controller's green scope. All airline flights are issued a discrete code. For the most part, a transponder code remains the same throughout an entire flight. The code sometimes changes from airspace to airspace or country to country, but it has to be re-assigned by air traffic control and not by the discretion of a pilot, unless an emergency is declared. Communication with the air traffic control facility that is tracking the transponder code is normally required. Typically, communication is in the form of direct radio contact. With some exceptions, radio contact with air traffic control is always available when a flight begins the landing phase of the trip. But in remote parts of the world, especially over water, no ground-base radar facility exists. Radar has distance limitations. Radio communication also has distance limitations. As an example, portions of South America have no radar coverage. Portions of that continent have gaps and poor quality radio communication facilities, especially between countries or airspace. This was mostly likely the situation in the corner of the world flown by Malaysia Flight 370. It would be understood for pilots and controllers experienced with the route to be aware of such gaps in radar coverage and communication. No alarm bells would be immediately sounded. After a period of time when the flight failed to call at the expected point, the controller would attempt contact on the assigned frequency. If that attempt failed, the controller would attempt contact on the emergency frequency monitored by all aircraft. And if that contact was unsuccessful, the controller would use an airplane near the lost flight's route as a ""relay."" This was alleged to have been done through a flight bound for Narita, Japan. The Narita airplane was approximately 30 minutes ahead of Malaysia Flight 370. The pilots indicated that all they received was an unintelligible reply that they couldn't attribute to Malaysia Flight 370. The result would not have been untypical considering the distance between airplanes. So, now what? Pilot: Why Flight 370 may never be found . Well, those of you who have been following the story have heard about the ACARS, the automatic communication and reporting system, on board. Yes, the ACARS should have functioned by using either a dedicated radio frequency or a satellite signal to automatically send position data, among other parameters. The amount of parameters is dictated by the program subscribed to by the airline. For whatever reason, the unit failed, only performing a ""handshake"" with the satellite. But another system on board could have saved the day, or at least more accurately pinpointed the position for air traffic control. What is the system? It's called, ADS-B, short for automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast. In contrast to radar, the airplane sends its own signal to the satellite, which returns the signal to a ground base station, which transforms it to a target display on a controller's screen. This system is already in use, and will be completely mandated for all of the North Atlantic tracks between North America and Europe. Even over the desolation of the North Atlantic, an airplane can never be lost. ADS-B will be required for all airplanes operating in the continental United States by 2020. The flaw is that each air traffic control facility has to be equipped with the ADS-B system for it to function. And the flaw in ACARS is that the system will not report if it malfunctions. To the best of my knowledge, the ACARS system is not connected directly to the battery, which would maintain its operation during a major electrical failure. What's the difference between ACARS and ADS-B? Simply stated, ADS-B is an air traffic control function. ACARS is an airline company function, offering a variety of optional downloadable data parameters for dispatch and maintenance purposes. So, do we require these systems to prevent another airplane disappearance? My view is yes. Although many countries are adapting an ADS-B system, mandating it all over the globe would be a difficult process. Most airlines have an ACARS system but it would require modifications to re-wire into an emergency (electrical) bus. And it would require airlines to subscribe to the higher level of data downloading. The technology for streaming aircraft data via a satellite has been discussed in the wake of this tragedy, but it appears bandwidth would have to be increased. The issue of data security would also have to be addressed. Many folks have suggested modifications to the black boxes. But the black boxes are after-the-fact technology. Their use is forensic. Let's fix the problem before it happens. The objective of a new regulation should be to prevent a similar situation from occurring again, not to find easier methods to pick up the pieces. And in this circumstance, the objective is to never let an airplane disappear again.","How can a 650,000 pound airplane disappear for weeks?

"(CNN) -- Racism is headline news again. This time, America's conversation on race is focused on whether Donald Sterling is a racist -- and on his apology. But I'm not clear where we go with that conversation: It feels like a never-ending cycle of accusation and defense and less about long-lasting solutions. After all, Sterling is invested in not being seen as a racist and saving his business. When a debate becomes about whether one person is racist, what are the rest of us supposed to do with that? If we want to have a more useful discussion on how to move beyond racism in America, there are more productive ways to do it. First, we have to resist concluding that condemning racist slurs is all that is required to end discrimination. Second, to achieve racial equity, we need to be able to do three things: talk explicitly about race; focus on the impact of policies and practices and the intentions behind them; and support power-building in marginalized communities. Racism has evolved over the past 50 years, and our collective understanding of what constitutes justice, how discrimination functions and how to best address it needs updating. Racial bias is often hidden, unintentional and systemic. That means that it is actually possible to create racist impact, even if there's no easily identifiable racist behind the curtain. The notion that racism is always intentional, individual and overt feeds the false assumption that colorblindness is then the appropriate solution. But the absence of apparent, or even coded, hostility does not necessarily indicate the presence of fairness. That's why we have to be able to ask explicit racial questions. Rather than avoiding racial difference, we should engage it, with the goal of creating actual equity in our workplaces, schools and all the other spaces in which we spend our lives. In the food industry, for example, there is widely accepted racial hierarchy in high-end restaurants. Anyone walking into a three-star restaurant can see that often, the people who have speaking parts at the front of the house are white, while those working for lower wages in the back of the house are employees of color. The Restaurant Opportunities Centers United (ROCUnited) has documented such segregation in New York City, New Orleans and Miami. The organization has challenged prominent restaurant owners and chains to address racial exclusion through new employment practices, which often involve actually formalizing hiring practices such as posting jobs internally first before going external or holding performance reviews. Informality works against equity by making room for all kinds of problematic individual judgments, such as discrimination against applicants with non-European foreign accents. The lack of rules is in itself a kind of policy. A good example is Tom Colicchio, the owner of Craft and a host of ""Top Chef."" He has a combination of formal employment practices and full intention to build an integrated workforce. Saru Jayaraman of ROCUnited notes that Colicchio ""has a good reputation among workers in the industry for being a conscientious employer in this regard, and diners in his restaurants get a visibly different experience of the workforce."" An employer's clear intention to make room for people of color and willingness to apply that intention to recruitment, hiring, training and promotion of employee is the combination that enables real change. The second thing we need to create genuine racial equity is to look at the impact of our institutional practices. When the rules of an institution are written down, we call them policies, but unwritten rules also shape institutions, in the form of repeated individual behavior, traditions, rituals or common approaches to problems. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid called for the NFL to take a stand against owner Dan Snyder -- who insists on preserving a team name that many consider racially insensitive -- the way the NBA did against Donald Sterling. Snyder has continued to defend his recalcitrance in the name of ""tradition"" and to prove his lack of animus toward Native people by establishing a foundation. If I stretch, I can accept that Snyder has no real animus toward Native Americans. Yet, the fact is that stereotypical sports mascots dehumanize the people they represent. Holding onto such a symbol bolsters an image of Native people on which other people negatively act. Lastly, we have to recognize that people who have been marginalized need power to generate racial equality. The tools that create the presence of equity, not just the absence of hostility, have little chance of being implemented in situations where people of color are not organized for collective power. One such tool is the Racial Equity Impact Analysis, which allows us to predict bad outcomes and change course. It works like an environmental impact analysis, which requires any building project to account for potential pollution, noise, traffic and other environmental factors. This worked in Minneapolis, when the Education Equity Organizing Collaborative, a coalition of communities of color, pressed the school board to conduct a racial impact review of proposed school closings. In a rare reversal, the analysis led them to cancel the closing of a community school serving Somali students and to expand the school options available to Native Americans. Now, the Minneapolis Board of Education has adopted a policy of conducting impact analysis on all decisions that affect student learning and resource allocation. None of that would have happened if communities of color weren't organizing themselves. If we want racial equity, we have to want that kind of power-building, too. As we debate issues such as voting rights and affirmative action, the effect on a community's ability to assert its interests has to be part of our calculation of what makes good policy. As a nation, we've come a long way on race, as evidenced by the fact that Sterling was not only condemned by individuals but also sanctioned by an institution. There's nothing stopping us from using these news stories to launch a forward-looking, highly effective, unifying approach to our persistent racial problems. We can generate fairness -- not just punish hostility -- if we have the courage to be explicit, focus on the rules and their impact and encourage power building among people of color. That's what it means to be brave. It's an American virtue. We can feel encouraged to see it in action every day, and we should never stop pushing for more. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rinku Sen.","Comments by public figures such as Donald Sterling have provided fuel to discuss race .

"(CNN) -- A third consecutive unblemished round fired Korea's Noh Seung-yul into the lead of the Zurich Classic in New Orleans on Saturday. The bogey-free feat means Noh is the first player to complete 54 holes at the TPC Louisiana course without dropping a shot. Noh's third round score of 65 also helped him streak past overnight leader Ben Martin, who carded a 73 to slip four shots back and into a tie for fourth place. The Korean has been playing with yellow and affixed to his cap as a mark of respect to the victims of the fatal ferry accident in the waters off the south coast of his home country. Three consecutive birdies from 14 through 16 were the highlight of the round and ensured Noh would end the day leading Keegan Bradley, who now resides two shots back in second place on 16-under-par. Robert Streb is a further shot adrift in third after recording a third round score of 68. Fourth-placed Martin had led the event over the first two days after knocking out a course-record 62 on Thursday but the 26-year-old American found the going much tougher after the cut. His sole birdie on Saturday came on the seventh hole. China Open . Alexander Levy will take a three-shot lead into the final round of the China Open after a 2-under-par round of 70 in difficult conditions at the Genzon Golf Club in Shenzhen Saturday. The 23-year-old Frenchman built upon the course record 62 he shot on Friday and now sits three clear of second placed Alvaro Quiros of Spain.

"(CNN) -- The man at the center of an immense art find suspected to have been looted during the Nazi period has spoken publicly for the first time, saying he longs for the art to be returned to him. In an extensive interview with the German magazine, Der Spiegel, published online on Sunday, Cornelius Gurlitt describes how he has never mixed with other people and sees the more than 1,400 pictures that he inherited as his only friends. The son of a Nazi-era art dealer talked to Der Spiegel while travelling out of Munich to see his doctor. Since officials entered the 80-year-old's flat in 2012 and removed his paintings, many of them masterpieces, his life has become even more lonely. ""I am not Boris Becker. I am something very quiet. I only wanted to live with my pictures,"" he says. The vast stash of paintings found in the apartment by the likes of Picasso, Matisse and Chagall, some previously unknown, others that had been presumed lost forever, is thought to be worth upwards of $1 billion. His father Hildebrand Gurlitt who was partly Jewish, survived the war as one of only four ""degenerate art"" dealers permitted by Adolf Hitler. Gurlitt Sr., by all accounts a savvy wheeler and dealer, removed the huge collection from his house in Dresden during the devastating bombing in the final days of World War II, and moved it to what later became West Germany. ""My father knew ... the Russians were coming closer,"" he tells Der Spiegel. Gurlitt defends his father's war-time dealings, saying ""maybe he was offered something privately, but he would not have taken it. It would not have been good for him."" Gurlitt Sr. died in a car accident in 1956, and left all his paintings to his surviving family. His son Cornelius remembers helping his father remove them from the family house in Dresden, and driving them west in a truck. ""I never had anything to do with the acquisition, only with saving them."" Cornelius Gurlitt never married, never made friends, and eventually moved to Munich with his mother when he was 27. Until she and his sister Benita died in recent years, he had never lived alone. He remains cross with Benita for dying ahead of him. ""She could have inherited everything, and she would have known how to deal with everything. Now everything is so miserable,"" he says. Gurlitt says he has no lawyers, and no one to help him. ""They are portraying everything wrongly. I will not talk to them, and I will not return anything voluntarily, no, no. The prosecutor has enough evidence to exonerate me."" Gurlitt does not own a mobile phone and has never used a computer. The auction house Lempertz in Cologne told CNN that Gurlitt sold them a painting by Max Beckmann in 2011. A spokesman for the auction house described Gurlitt as a somewhat helpless, confused man, easily to be taken advantage of if anyone so desired. For now, Gurlitt lives alone and is isolated once more in his Munich flat. For days after news of the incredible find broke, he was holed up there, with the doorbell ringing nonstop and people putting notes and letters under his front door. But all he wants is the return of his art. ""What kind of state is this that shows my private property?"" he asks. ""They have to come back to me.""

"(CNN) -- A federal jury has rejected a lawsuit by actor Stephen Baldwin and a New Orleans businessman that claimed actor Kevin Costner and others tricked them out of millions of dollars in a dispute stemming from the 2010 Gulf oil spill, an attorney for Baldwin said Friday. Baldwin and Spyridon Contogouris had said the fellow actor fooled them into selling their stock in a company that made oil spill cleanup machines the same week that BP placed a $52 million order for the technology. The decision against Baldwin was made Thursday evening. ""The jury was doing their best to understand everything in a ... seemingly complicated issue,"" Costner told CNN affiliate WWL. ""They were really smart,"" he said; it was ""my good luck that they saw the truth of the story."" Baldwin's attorney, James Cobb, said he was disappointed with the decision. ""We believe we put on a case sufficient for the jury to find in our favor,"" he told the station. ""The jury found the other way."" ""Stephen was confident and hopeful of a verdict, but he was disappointed,"" Cobb added. ""But he is accepting of it."" The oil separation technology was developed in the 1990s by a company created by Costner, but Baldwin became involved while in New Orleans to produce a documentary about the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in May 2010. Baldwin and Contogouris decided to sell their stock soon after getting it because of differences with other shareholders, according to the lawsuit. They signed an agreement to sell their shares to Patrick Smith, who then transferred them to a company partly owned by Costner, on June 11, 2010. BP announced on June 15, 2010, it would lease 32 machines from the company. If Smith and Costner had told them BP was placing a huge order, they would not have sold, the suit said. The 10% of the company that Baldwin sold for $500,000 should have been worth $3.8 million, while the 28% stake sold by Contogouris for $1.4 million was worth $10.6 million, the suit said. Lawyers for Costner and Smith say Baldwin and Contogouris sold their stock ""with eyes wide open, to get out of a soured business relationship and to invest in other ventures."" They knew that BP might place the order, a defense filing said. It was widely reported in the news and Costner testified about it to Congress two days before the stock sale.

"London (CNN) -- Herge's famous boy reporter certainly liked to stray from his native Belgium. Tintin's official profession may be that of a reporter, but he is just as much an explorer and archaeologist, dashing around the world to chase down ancient artifacts in addition to nefarious villains and a good story. Carrying on a venerable tradition of filmic archaeologists and adventurists such as Indiana Jones, the new Tintin film by Steven Spielberg, entitled ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn,"" mixes the story-lines of several of Herge's books and follows Tintin and friends hunting for centuries-old treasure. ""Herge was always interested in exotic locations and travel around the world,"" said Paris-based 'Tintinologist' and comic-book artist Jean-Marc Lofficier. ""Keep in mind that he comes out of the tradition of (French author) Jules Verne, whose characters are always traveling around the world and finding lost civilizations and incredible ruins,"" he continued. Lofficier, who is co-author of the Pocket Essential guide to Tintin, spoke to CNN about his favorite historical escapades and archaeological ""MacGuffins"" from the classic series of comic books, beloved around the world by adults and children alike. 'The Cigars of the Pharaoh' Published in 1934, this is the first Tintin adventure to have featured an archaeological premise, Lofficier says, explaining that the storyline was ""clearly influenced"" by the discovery of the tomb of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Tutankhamun by Howard Carter in 1922. The plot begins with Tintin meeting an archaeologist looking for the lost tomb of a mysterious Pharaoh and is driven by the appearance of a number of cigars bearing mysterious -- seemingly ancient Egyptian -- symbols. Moving from Egypt to Arabia and on to India, Lofficier says the book is ""a catalog of archaeological myths and popular clichÃ©s from the late 19th and early 20th centuries."" 'The Broken Ear' This book, published in 1937, charts the hunt for a South American idol that is stolen from the Museum of Ethnography in Brussels. ""It's kind of a fetish object, a small wooden idol with a broken ear,"" said Lofficier. ""We find out that there is some kind of a precious stone hidden in the idol and everyone is fighting over it."" ""Herge is using the complications of having various people try to seize the idol as a pretext for a travelogue around South America,"" says Lofficier, explaining that Herge was as interested in anthropology as he was archaeology, with Tintin coming into contact with native South American tribesmen along the journey. 'Prisoners of the Sun' Published in 1949, ""Prisoners of the Sun"" is a sequel to ""The Seven Crystal Balls,"" in which a group of explorers are struck down with an unexplained illness after discovering the tomb of a mummified Inca in Peru -- a storyline which echoes the supposed Tutankhamun ""curse"" that was much-discussed at the time. In ""Prisoners of the Sun,"" Tintin and friends are charged with rescuing their friend Professor Calculus from native tribesmen, who are angry about what they see as the desecration of their culture and are eventually revealed to be last remaining descendants of the Incas. ""At the end of the day, it is about the right of the Inca civilization to (protect their) culture,"" said Lofficier. ""Herge presents the other side of the issue, which is that these civilizations deserve to be respected -- which considering the time period, is very forward-thinking."" In the end, Tintin manages to secure the release of the kidnapped explorers and in exchange promises never to reveal the location of the remaining Incas. 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' Moving from ancient civilizations to pirates and buried treasure, ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" form the basis for the script of ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn."" Both chart Tintin and various other parties' attempts to unearth the lost loot of 17th century pirate, Red Rackham. ""Half of (The Secret of the Unicorn) is actually a flash-back to the great days of the pirates,"" said Lofficier, explaining that Tintin's friend Captain Haddock is the ancestor of the sea captain who killed Rackham all those years ago. At the end of ""Red Rackham's Treasure,"" after a voyage in a submarine resembling a shark, the treasure turns out to be hidden in Haddock's ancestral home. 'Flight 714' ""Flight 714 is the penultimate Tintin book and has a very strange ending,"" explains Lofficier. The book, published in 1968, is strongly influenced by the science fiction of the time, said Lofficier, and features an incredible plot device in which the gods worshiped by the ancient peoples of a volcanic island Pulau-Pulau Bompa are revealed to have been extraterrestrials. ""We are left with an ongoing mystery, (presented as) the ultimate answer to archaeology,"" said Lofficier.","Tintin as much an explorer and amateur archaeologist as a reporter .

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Police on Wednesday arrested Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for questioning in connection with the 1972 Irish Republican Army abduction and slaying of a widow, a move that could shake Northern Ireland's fragile peace. In a statement released shortly before he surrendered for questioning, the 65-year-old Adams vehemently denied any involvement in the killing of Jean McConville. The Police Service of Northern Ireland announced the arrest of a 65-year-old man whom they declined to identify but described as a suspect in the McConville case. Adams has long denied having any role in the death of McConville, a widowed mother of 10 who was reportedly killed by the IRA because the group believed she was a spy for the British army. ""I believe that the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice,"" Adams said in the statement posted on his party website. ""Malicious allegations have been made against me. I reject these."" The questioning of Adams was not unexpected. Adams said he told authorities last month that he was willing to meet with investigators. Long associated with the IRA, once considered the armed wing of Sinn Fein, Adams is a prominent Catholic politician who helped broker peace in Northern Ireland. Today, Sinn Fein is Ireland's second-largest opposition party. ""While I have never disassociated myself from the IRA and I never will, I am innocent in the abduction, killing or burial of Mrs. McConville,"" Adams said. Northern Ireland is part of the UK, and Protestant fighters wanted to keep it that way. Catholics were fighting to force the British out and reunify the north with the rest of Ireland. Known as the Troubles, the conflict lasted 30 years, ending in 1998 with the Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace. The agreement provided a political framework for power-sharing among the parties. The IRA admitted in 1999 to killing a number of people who have become known as ""The Disappeared"" -- those who vanished during the Troubles. Among the victims was McConville, whose remains were found partially buried on a beach in County Louth in 2003. She died of a single gunshot wound to the back of the head. McConville, 38, was taken from her home in Belfast in December 1972, her daughter, Helen McKendry, told CNN in 2012. ""They came about tea time and they dragged her out of the bathroom and dragged her out,"" said McKendry, who was a teenager at the time. ""...All I ever wanted was to know the reason why they killed my mother."" The investigation into McConville's killing was revived by authorities after the release of interviews given by members of the IRA, who implicated Adams. The recordings were made by Boston College as part of the Belfast Project, which is a collection of interviews conducted with former Northern Irish paramilitary fighters. They provide an oral history of the decades of fighting. Participants in the project believed their recorded interviews would be kept secret until their deaths. One of those featured was Brendan Hughes, a now-deceased former commander of the IRA, a Catholic paramilitary. Hughes told his interviewer about McConville: ""I knew she was being executed. I knew that. I didn't know she was going to be buried or disappeared as they call them now."" Hughes went on to allege Adams was involved: ""The special squad was brought into the operation then, called The Unknowns. You know when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular squad."" Adams has called the allegations libelous. Peter Taggart reported from Belfast, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Police announce the arrest of a man in the case but decline to identify him .

"(CNN) -- Africa is not a continent one immediately associates with ice. Historically, however, there have been three mountains that, until recently, could proudly boast some of the world's most majestic glaciers: Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya, and the Rwenzori Mountains bordering Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rwenzori has been dubbed the ""African Alps,"" the ""Mountains of the Moon"" and the ""snowy source of the Nile"" (the latter two descriptors were ascribed in 150 A.D. by noted astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy). Much has been written about their snow-capped peaks, but a recent expedition has found that the glaciers that have for centuries captured imaginations will soon be history. ""Unfortunately, I think it's too late for Rwenzori,"" laments Luc Hardy, an explorer and founder of Pax Arctica. ""It's not like there's a specific local cause that you could act on. It's pretty much all of us, all over the world, creating C02 in the air."" Hardy recently led a two-week expedition to Rwenzori in conjunction with Uganda's Makerere University Mountain Resource Center, Green Cross International and the World Youth Parliament for Water. His team set out to research the extent of the glaciers' recession, and the impact it might have on the surrounding communities. He isn't the only one concerned by the glaciers' demise. ""My guess is by 2030, there won't be any ice left on the mountain,"" says Richard Taylor, a geology professor at University College London. The glaciers, which had a combined area of around 2.7 square miles at the start of the 20th century, now occupy less than 0.4 square miles. Taylor estimates that the ice is declining by roughly 0.2 square miles per decade. ""Really, you're looking at a last chance to see,"" he says. Though Rwenzori doesn't get the same tourist traffic as Kilimanjaro or Mount Kenya (both of which are also suffering; Kilimanjaro has lost 84% of its ice since 1912, and two-thirds of Mount Kenya's ice cover has vanished), the modest numbers it does receive are likely to dry up with the ice. ""Many of the Bakonzo [the local tribe that live in the mountains] do depend on tourism. They provide nature walks and act as guides. With the glaciers receding, those local people will suffer from lack of jobs,"" says Richard Atugonza, a student at Makerere University's Mountain Resource Center, who took part in Hardy's Rwenzori expedition. Hardy has described the melting glaciers as a ""canary in the mine,"" with their decline illustrating how climate change is starting to impact the local environment. ""The glaciers indicate a rise in temperature in the region, and a warmer environment leads to an intensification of the rainfall systems,"" says Taylor. ""What that means is longer droughts and more intense floods."" Droughts could spell disaster for the local Bakonzo, who rely on the water from the local alpine rivers to irrigate their crops and provide hydroelectricity. The warmer weather could also severely alter the ecosystem and potentially usher in malaria (according to Taylor, this is a disease the Bakonzo have historically not had to deal with, perhaps because the alpine climate has traditionally deterred mosquitoes). ""It could be we will lose some very rare plant species at the summit,"" adds Taylor.","Uganda's Rwenzori Mountains have been described as the 'Alps of Africa'
Experts predict the range's once sizable glaciers will soon vanish .
That could mean less income for locals from tourism ."
"(CNN) -- The push to plug the plumbing problem from hell at Fukushima Daiichi is about to get some help from a U.S.-built robot designed to search for leaks from one of the Japanese nuclear plant's crippled reactors. Built in Colorado by California-based nuclear cleanup contractor Kurion, the refrigerator-sized robot will stick a 15-foot mechanical arm through a hole in the main floor of the reactor building. The arm is equipped with radiation-shielded cameras and capable of lifting 100 pounds. It can also carry cutting tools -- either a set of heavy-duty shears or a high-pressure water jet that can cut steel. Kurion custom-built the device to peer into the basement of the Unit 2 reactor building, most of which remains off-limits to humans. The reactor is believed to be leaking highly radioactive coolant water through a rupture in a donut-shaped chamber at the base of the reactor. Matt Cole, Kurion's engineering director, said the arm will be used to inspect three areas around that chamber, known as the suppression pool, for suspected leaks. If found, other robots -- some still to be developed -- will be dispatched to repair the damage, he said. ""I think it certainly will solve part of that mystery,"" Cole said. ""They know there is a leak because of the balance of water, but they don't know exactly where that leak is."" A nearly 50-foot wall of water slammed into Fukushima Daiichi in the historic earthquake and tsunami that struck eastern Japan in March 2011. The wave flooded the plant and knocked out power to the cooling systems of the three reactors that were running at the time. The result was the world's worst nuclear accident since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, as the reactors overheated and spewed radioactive particles into the environment. Though no deaths have been directly attributed to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, about 138,000 people who were forced to flee homes as far as 25 miles away are still living in temporary housing. The damage to reactors 1 and 3 was dramatically visible, as massive hydrogen explosions blew apart their concrete housings in the first days of the accident. But what happened in No. 2 has largely remained a mystery. Four days after the tsunami, operators reported hearing a bang from deep within the reactor, probably from another hydrogen explosion, and a spike in radiation levels. The unit's turbine plant soon filled with water that was loaded with nuclear wastes, backing up through service tunnels and spilling into the neighboring Pacific Ocean. ""Some places, the radiation is too high, so people cannot get in,"" said Mayumi Yoshida, a spokeswoman for The Tokyo Electric Power Company, which owns the plant. In other parts, workers who go in ""have to come out within a few minutes,"" she said. Three years later, operators are still having to pump more than four tons of water an hour -- 26,000 gallons every day -- into each reactor to keep them cool, Yoshida said. That water builds up in the basements of the reactor buildings, along with hundreds of tons of groundwater that seeps in every day. TEPCO has had to collect and store thousands of tons of radioactive water in tank farms around the site and is struggling to keep it from leaking back into the environment. Robots have been able to explore some of the buildings, but have yet to get a good picture of what happened to the suppression pool, Yoshida said. Estimates provided to Kurion indicate that dozens of gallons per hour are escaping from the leak its robot was designed to locate, Cole said. The device was designed to fit through doors in the damaged building and be installed in a first-floor space where radiation levels are elevated, but still accessible to workers, Cole said. From there, it will reach through the floor and into a basement where hourly radiation exposure would be dozens of times higher than what a typical person receives in a year, according to TEPCO figures. ""Success for us would be to get clear confirmation of where the leaks are, so that the next phase of the work can be planned,"" Cole said. Engineers eventually want to fill the primary containment vessel surrounding the No. 2 reactor with water, but to do that, they have to fix the leaks, Yoshida said. The device was shipped to Japan in early May and is expected to be in operation by late summer, Kurion says. The company already has built a system that chills and filters long-lived radioactive cesium out of the reactor coolant -- a mechanism it boasts of having put into operation within five weeks.
