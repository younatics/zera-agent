But Usher told Nylon Guys that he's given Bieber, now 20, all the advice he can and as the Canadian is now an adult, it's up to him to 'manage' his life. Usher, 35, said: 'I gave every bit of advice and always told him it was up to him if he really wanted this. Now that he has it, as an adult, it's his to manage. Buddies: Usher has mentored Justin Bieber to the heights of the music industry, but he hasn't kept the young man out of trouble . The Voice coach added: 'Do I turn my head in shame based off of what I see, what I know? Nah, I don't because it's all part of life's process. Am I in it with him? Yeah.' After being mentored by Diddy from the tender age of 15, Usher is an understandable advocate of the 'big brother' role in music. He explained: 'Artistic development made me who I am. Somebody took the time to help me find what it is that works for me as an entertainer and who I am as a music maker.' Mentor: Usher talked openly about his unruly charge to Nylon Guys .

"By . Daniel Martin . Stay optimistic: David Cameron will be told to resist copying Ukip, in light of a Conservative triumph in the Newark by-election . David Cameron will today be told to stick to an ‘optimistic’ message and resist becoming ‘Ukip-lite’ after his party successfully defended a by-election seat for the first time in 25 years. Conservative candidate Robert Jenrick held off the threat of a Ukip ‘earthquake’, winning Newark with a reduced majority of 7,403. It was the first time the Tories have successfully defended a seat in a by-election since William Hague won in Richmond, Yorkshire, in 1989. Ukip’s candidate Roger Helmer surged from a distant fourth in 2010 to second, but with 25 per cent of the vote he failed in his party’s aim of reaching 30 per cent. Mr Helmer admitted yesterday that the failure of ‘box office’ party leader Nigel Farage to campaign hard in the Nottinghamshire constituency may have impacted on the result – less than a fortnight after Ukip topped the European elections poll. Today a senior Tory minister will claim the campaign tactic of concentrating on the ‘long-term economic plan’ had been the right one. In a speech entitled Reasons to be Cheerful, Home Office minister Damian Green will say: ‘What Newark tells us is that the temptation to become Ukip-lite should be firmly resisted. 'The political battle of our times is between optimists and pessimists. Conservatives should be optimists believing that free markets and a strong society are the basis for a successful country in this century.’ Ukip’s rise in support pushed Labour into third place, while Lib Dem support was obliterated – leaving their candidate trailing in sixth place. Ed Miliband’s party saw its vote share fall – a disappointing result less than a year from  a general election in a constituency the party won during Tony Blair’s first landslide  in 1997. In a sign of the depth of concern in the Tory camp over the possibility of losing, the Prime Minister hit the campaign trail in Newark four times. Victory: Robert Jenrick, centre, was elected MP for Newark in Nottinghamshire, beating Ukip's Roger Helmer, left . Mr Farage accused the Tories of running a ‘nasty’ campaign, but insisted his party had still achieved one of its best by-election results. Nigel Farage’s lack of appeal to female voters helped the Tories win in Newark, a survey found. A . poll before the election showed the parties neck-and-neck among men . while nearly three times as many women would vote Tory compared to Ukip. It found 36.8 per cent of men planned to vote for Ukip’s Roger Helmer, with 36.2 per cent backing Tory Robert Jenrick. But only 16.8 per cent of women backed Ukip, against 47.6 per cent intending to vote Tory. ‘I think there’ll be an awful lot of Conservatives with a majority of less than 10,000 who will look upon this result in sheer horror,’ he said. ‘For Ukip, it’s still a good night’s work.’ Experts said that Newark – together with the recent local and European elections – provided no evidence that Labour was on track to win an overall majority next May. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Labour do not have the enthusiasm and depth of support in the electorate that make them look like an alternative government. 'It is not the sign of a party making progress, but a party which seems to be in retreat, and now retreating so far that if it goes any further there will be question marks about its ability to win the next election.’ Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems garnered just 1,004 votes and 2.6 per cent of the vote – bad enough for it to lose its deposit for the ninth by-election since joining the Coalition. Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to work between now and the election to say very clearly we have got a long-term plan, we are getting Britain back to work, we are cutting people’s taxes, we are helping hard-working people. The job isn’t finished yet but we are on the right track, let’s stick at it.’ PS . As his party suffered in Newark, Mr Clegg looked like he hadn't a care in the world as he fooled around for the cameras at a book launch for Lord Ashdown.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Rickie Lambert smiled when it was pointed out that his England strike rate is akin to Gary Lineker’s. ‘Say that to me again in 50 games’ time,’ he replied. The goals keep flying in but the Scouser has a nice line in self-deprecation. Lineker played 80 times for his country and scored 48. Only Sir Bobby Charlton has more England goals. Lambert has scored three in five. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Lambert talk about England and Liverpool . Dream: Rickie Lambert remains grounded despite his meteoric rise from non-league to international football . Sharp shooter: Rickie Lambert took his England tally to three from five games with a strike against Ecuador . He has broken into international football relatively late, with a debut last year at 31, but the instinct for goal remains unchanged and the fairytale rise goes on — from non-league to the Barclays Premier League, a move to his beloved Liverpool and the World Cup less than a week away. ‘You’ve got to dream,’ said Lambert. ‘You’ve got to believe, that’s what I’ve done all my life. I’m rolling with it at the minute. It seems like it’s not stopping. Who knows where it will end? ‘You can get carried away with people who say it’s a completely different world. You do believe that when you’re in League Two and League One but if you believe in yourself, it’s not. ‘You have to adapt to each level and it improves you when you’re in better teams. That’s what’s happened to me over the years. Every team I’ve played in has just got better and better. It’s become a lot easier. ‘The goal doesn’t move. It’s the same shape whatever level you’re at and the ball’s the same size and shape. It’s something we’ve practised all our lives. There are still aspects I want to improve and do better. ‘It’s getting to know your players as well. This is the first time I’ve played with some of the lads but we’re doing OK.’ Take a bow: The former Southampton striker scored on his debut for England against Scotland . Twice as nice: Rickie Lambert celebrates celebrates his second England goal - against Moldova . Lambert seems entirely at ease in this company. It is not simply the goal rate. His touch is good and he is strong in the air, giving England a different option.Most of all, he is aware of  others around him. He may not be the quickest but he reads the game and his movement is intelligent. He looks lean and fit and, importantly for the mood and balance of Roy Hodgson’s squad, he is content to play a supporting role to the likes of Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge — although his goals may yet prove equally important in Brazil. ‘It’s not about if I start against Italy,’ said Lambert. ‘It’s about the plan that Roy’s got. We’re all behind it and whether that’s starting or coming on as sub, we’re all behind the manager. ‘I’m desperate to do well. I’m a striker and any chance I get I want to score. It’s the best feeling in the world to score for your country.’ There are no pretensions. Lambert moves in superstar circles with the world’s most famous footballers but he is grounded by a decade in the lower leagues with Blackpool, Macclesfield, Stockport, Rochdale, Bristol Rovers and Southampton. Red alert! The 32-year-old has completed a £4m move back to his childhood club Liverpool . Just days before leaving for training camp in Miami, Lambert was finalising his £4million transfer from Saints to Liverpool, his hometown club, where he signed as a schoolboy before being released at 15.When asked to start up front against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium on Wednesday, he went out and smashed in England’s second goal in a 2-2 draw. ‘It’s been a life-changing couple of weeks,’ admitted Lambert, 32. ‘It’s been a life-changing couple of years. I’m trying to enjoy every second of it. ‘Walking into Melwood (Liverpool’s training ground), I couldn’t recognise it. I hadn’t been back since I trained there as a kid. ‘I hope it does give hope.

"By . Dermot Corrigan . Chelsea fans might doubt whether Fernando Torres will have much of an impact on the coming World Cup. But the Spain centre-forward has made a habit over recent years - at international level at least - of proving his critics wrong. When Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa was declared fit to make the final 23 man squad it seemed likely that Torres, who is also now set to be replaced by Costa at club level, would miss out on Brazil. The now 30 year old was however included – and now travels to try and win his fourth consecutive international tournament. Point to prove: Fernando Torres (centre) goes into this World Cup with question marks about his form . Fancy footwork: Torres (centre) tries to spectacularly flick the ball away from Spanish team-mate Koke (left) Practice makes perfect: Torres shoots at goal during a break in training with Spain this week . That is quite some record - especially considering that for many supporters in England Torres has long been a busted flush. Serious thigh and knee injuries meant he was already on the decline at Liverpool before his move to Chelsea in January 2010. Since then eight Blues managers have tried - and failed - to spark a return to the form which persuaded Roman Abramovich to pay the huge 50 million fee. Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque has been more patient than most but even he had lost faith by February 2012. Torres - who had gone 20 Chelsea games without a goal - was then dropped for Spain’s final friendly before the squad was named for that summer’s European Championship finals in Poland and Ukraine. A few months later the situation had changed again. Del Bosque’s first choice David Villa had not recovered from a broken leg. Torres had also scored at Barcelona’s Camp Nou on the way to winning that season’s Champions League. So ‘El Niño’ went to Poland and Ukraine, . where he started just two games. But still scored four times and ended . the tournament with both another winners’ medal and the ‘golden boot’. Lethal: Torres scores past Gianluigi Buffon as Spain beat Italy 4-0 to triumph Euro 2012 . This time around the story looks pretty similar. Torres has not had a good campaign at club level, with current Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho clearly not a fan. And the now 30 year old was not picked in any international squad during the 2013/14 season, with Costa, Fernando Llorente, Alvaro Negredo and last summer’s big Tottenham signing Roberto Soldado all rated better by Del Bosque. That was until fate again intervened - Costa was hamstrung, Negredo and Soldado woefully off-form, and Llorente not seen as a fit with Spain’s tiki-taka style. Leading the way: Diego Costa is expected to start up front for Spain during the World Cup . Look away now: Torres (right) has struggled for form and goals this season with Chelsea . So Torres returned for last Friday’s warm-up friendly against Bolivia in Seville, where he snatched at a number of presentable goal chances, but also converted a penalty to move to 37 goals in 107 international caps. The following morning he was confirmed in Spain’s squad for the tournament. It still seems most likely that Cesc Fabregas will be Spain’s central attacker for their opener against Holland in Curitiba on June 13. Costa looks first choice should Del Bosque opt for a traditional number nine later in the tournament. But given past experience nobody should bet against Torres making another mark at some point over the next six weeks.","Thirty-year-old Chelsea striker has struggled for form this season .

Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are carrying out DNA tests on scraps of clothing they found in a hidden pit just feet from where she vanished, it has been claimed. Forensic experts drafted in from the UK are said to be carrying out analysis of the 'non-organic' material, which was found near a hole in the ground on wasteland in Portugal's Praia de Luz resort. The find comes as officers said they need they need at least another week to search the strip of wasteland, which is just 1,000 feet from the Ocean Club complex from which Madeleine went missing on the evening of Thursday May 3, 2007. Scroll down for video . Investigation: The scraps of clothing are understood to have been found inside this concealed hole, which police officers found covered by corrugated iron. The items have now been sent for forensic analysis . Discovery: The hole has been been subject to intense police investigation since it was discovered on Wednesday. It is believed to have been used by children playing in the area for years . New phase: British police yesterday began inspecting sewers under wasteland minutes from where Madeleine was last seen as their Portuguese counterparts watch on . Manhole covers were lifted and cameras dropped down to survey the complex network of pipes . The hidden pit is on the southern tip . of the area British police have been given permission to search, . according to the Daily Mirror. It is said to have previously been used by local children as a play area. Referring . to the discovering of scraps of clothing, the newspaper quoted a source . as saying: 'It could be days before the significance of the items is . known... Several [items] are being analysed by the British team.' Scotland Yard has refused to provide . ‘a running commentary’ on whether any leads have so far been found. Yesterday . British detectives working in the Algarve resort pulled up manhole . covers and began analysing the network of sewer pipes using micro . cameras and fibre-optic cables. They . have yet to say whether they have found anything significant, but . Madeleine's parents - Kate and Gerry McCann - said they were 'encouraged . by the progress' of the search. The area British police have been given permission to search is not far from the apartment where the McCanns were staying. It is understood to have previously been used by local children as a play area . Experienced: Seven-year-old English springer spaniels 'Tito and Muzzy' from South Wales Police, who helped hunt for April Jones, were back on the land for a fourth day . Hot work: The dogs were covered in water and a wet blanket as their handlers ensure they did not overheat in the Algarve sun . The sewer system being searched was installed as part of failed plans . to build a hotel on the site before Madeleine disappeared in 2007, but after a planning battle it remained wasteland. The . search of the area for clues to what happened to the three-year-old . from Leicestershire is expected to go into a second week after British . police were granted an extra seven days by the Portuguese authorities to . keep searching. Sources said detectives had not realised just how hard and dry the land would be where they have been digging for clues. The . extension may also have been granted after surprise finds at the first . site, where a large concealed shaft was discovered by sniffer dogs. Officers also believed they had come . across a burial site late on Wednesday but this has since reportedly . been ruled out as an area of interest. Bones were discovered on the . site but tests showed they were from cows and pigs. Forensic approach: Police have split the wasteland into at least 12 areas of interest, using dogs, scanning equipment and fingertip searches . Vantage point: At the centre of the search site is a hill, where officers on horses and also with telescopes are taking advantage of the height to look for evidence . However, Mr and Mrs McCann yesterday . wrote online to well-wishers saying they are 'encouraged by the . progress'‎ of searches for their missing daughter. ‎Writing . on the couple's official Find Madeleine Facebook page, Kate and Gerry . McCann said: 'We are kept updated on the on-going work in Portugal and . are encouraged by the progress. 'Thank you for continuing to stand by us and supporting our efforts to get Madeleine home.'‎ . Mr . and Mrs McCann, who have not travelled to Praia da Luz, were previously . said to have been bracing themselves for 'significant news'. Meanwhile sniffer dogs used to hunt for murdered schoolgirl April Jones were again on the site hunting for evidence. The seven-year-old English springer spaniels – Tito and Muzzy – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time. On Wednesday they uncovered . concealed shaft covered with corrugated iron, yards from the spot where . Madeleine McCann vanished. Scotland Yard moved in to seal off the area . with large white tents. This shaft is understood to be the area where the 'non organic' material was discovered. Investigation: Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and 45-year-old Gerry McCann have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed and are said to expect 'significant news' on their daughter . Five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence. The shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was . covered with wooden planks, a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of . earth. A . local source said: ‘The discovery of the hole came as a surprise. Police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay . things.’ The . area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at . least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine. It was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen . walking in the direction of the site on the night that Madeleine was . last seen alive.","'Non-organic' material, believed to be clothing, was found in a hidden pit .

"By . Chris Cutmore . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Ross Barkley is emerging as a genuine contender to start for England at the World Cup after his bravura display against Ecuador, but Stuart Pearce insists he should not be in Brazil this summer at all. The former England Under 21 boss claims that Roy Hodgson is harming England's long-term chances of success by picking young players such as Barkley and Luke Shaw and leaving them on the bench, rather than handing them guaranteed game time in international age-group football. The 20-year-old Everton playmaker showed off his supreme natural talent during the 2-2 draw against the South Americans in Miami on Wednesday, capping a sparky performance by setting up Rickie Lambert for England's second goal with a cheeky nutmeg, powerful run and cushioned pass to the striker. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney: Barkley is an amazing talent and can light up Brazil . Emerging force: Ross Barkley is making a strong case for an England starting spot at the World Cup . No kid: Barkley looked at home alongside Wayne Rooney, Rickie Lambert and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . But Pearce, the former England defender who is now Nottingham Forest manager and coached the young lions at four European Championships between 2007 and 2013, believes Barkley has 'got a lot to learn' and would be better off tasting the style and pressure of international football below senior level before his eventual promotion. Selecting young players like Barkley 'means you consistently don't win anything in the underage groups and that means you can't win anything at senior level,' Pearce told the Guardian. Pearce pointed out that before the game against Ecuador Barkley had played less than 90 minutes for England this season. Shaw thing: The Southampton defender (right) was also handed a chance to shine against Ecuador . Lionheart: Stuart Pearce is a former England defender who has also managed the Under 21s . 'Does that mean he's had great experience sitting in the stands or does it mean that he's missed six or seven Under 21 qualifiers and the experience of international football? I know where I'd have left him,' said Pearce. There is a growing clamour for Hodgson to select England's rising stars over the likes of Wayne Rooney for the opening game against Italy in Manaus on June 14. To Barkley's advocates Pearce's comments could be seen as having a whiff about them of Alan Hansen's infamous assertion that 'you don't win anything with kids' before Manchester United's Class of 92 went on to dominate English football. But Pearce cited Spain and France as the models of success which England should follow. Both countries won major international age-group tournaments before going on to World Cup and European Championship glory. Pearce was also critical of Hodgson's selection of Shaw, the 19-year-old Southampton left-back chosen for Brazil over Ashley Cole, whose international career is now over after amassing 107 caps. 'Shaw has had a very good season but I personally would have taken Ashley Cole,' he said.","Pearce says Roy Hodgson should leave young players in Under 21 squad .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . A ‘lack of trust’ in his relationship with Chris Froome has been cited as the reason why Sir Bradley Wiggins will not be on the start line in Yorkshire for this year’s Tour de France. While Team Sky insisted on Friday that a final decision on team selection would not be made until the end of this month, Wiggins broke ranks to say he was ‘gutted’ not to be riding. He will not be alone, with British cycling now faced with losing its biggest star for the three days the Tour will be here in the UK next month. Losing its biggest star when he happens to be in top form, having recently won the Tour of California. ‘If Brad doesn’t ride it will be a disaster for the sport in this country,’ said one senior figure in cycling. ‘Here was a chance to showcase the sport here in England with the last two winners of the Tour, who are both British. But because they don’t get on, the one who’s most popular with the fans is not going to be there. It’s embarrassing.’ Absent: Sir Bradley Wiggins said he is gutted not to be racing in the 2014 Tour de France . The situation points to a complete failure by Sky’s management to resolve a problem that has existed between the two riders since the 2012 Tour. Sir Dave Brailsford has proved himself a master administrator for more than a decade. But Wiggins pointed out that he and Froome have been kept apart all year —  not racing or training together — and that he has therefore been denied any opportunity to prove he is prepared to play support rider to last year’s Tour winner. In an interview with the BBC on Friday, Wiggins said: ‘The team is focused around Chris Froome. I am gutted. I feel I am in the form I was two years ago. Now if I want to go to the Tour again, the reality is that I might have to go elsewhere. I also understand that cycling is a team sport and it is all about Team Sky winning and Chris is defending champion. ‘For the dynamic of the team, Chris has a say and we haven’t raced together all year. When you’re in the heat of the moment, you need guys you can trust and who have been there for you. Tensions can rise between two riders.’ Tension: Chris Froome (left) and Wiggins fell out during the 2012 Tour de France . Ambition: Wiggins hopes to race in the Tour de France again, and wants to return to the track for Rio 2016 . It would be wrong to portray Wiggins too much as the victim here because there has been a degree of stubbornness on both sides in resolving the situation. This despite claims by both riders that they had cleared the air during a training camp towards the end of last year. Sources close to the pair say the atmosphere is ‘dreadful’ when they are together, with Froome sometimes ‘intimidated’ by a colleague of Wiggins’s stature. But the key problem for Froome, says the source — after their very public spats in the wake of the 2012 Tour — is ‘a lack of trust’ within what is a team sport. With his contract expiring this year, Wiggins said he is considering his future at Team Sky having ‘spoken to a few people’ linked to rival teams. ‘Having missed the Tour again this year, I wouldn’t like to leave it there,’ said Wiggins, who also has his sights on a return to the track for the 2016 Olympics in Rio. ‘I’d love to go back at some point so there is the chance that I would go back to the Tour next year.’ Pedal power: Wiggins won the Tour of California earlier this year and is in the form of his life . While Wiggins is bitterly disappointed, this will not necessarily play well for Froome, either. As he explained in a recent interview with this newspaper, he has a say as to which nine riders make up the team and it is clear he has had a major influence here. In a separate interview with the French sports daily L’Equipe, Wiggins said: ‘After Paris-Roubaix and the Tour of California, I felt good physically, I was ready to go. But these last few weeks, it has become more and more clear that I will not be at the Tour.’ Wiggins said he last spoke with Team Sky principal Brailsford earlier this week — who suggested that he concentrate on preparing for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer. Home soil: The 2014 Tour de France will kick off in Yorkshire on 5 July . ‘It’s disappointing because it could have been my last Tour de France,’ said Wiggins. ‘I’ve had my doubts since April. I hoped my performances would get me a place. But then, after California, I knew that they were all off on an altitude camp, but I wasn’t involved, nor was I involved in the Tour reconnaissance rides. ‘The plan since the world championships last year was that, in an ideal world, Chris and I would ride together in the Tour and that everything would go well. I understood the role I would play, that Chris would be the leader and I was 100 per cent behind that. I wanted to play that support role. Then Shane Sutton (British Cycling’s technical director) told the press that I would have to fight very hard to win my place, that it was now Chris’s team and that Chris clearly had a say in selection.’ Wiggins also said he had spoken to the Orica-GreenEdge team about joining them next season.","Wiggins reveals he will not race in the 2014 Tour de France .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith . England's first day of training in Miami gave an insight into how meticulous Roy Hodgson's preparations to cope with the heat and humidity in Brazil have stretched. Several portable Lucozade cool boxes lined the side of the training pitch, with each bearing the names of individual players and containing tailor-made recovery drinks to cater for their different requirements. The Football Association's Dave Reddin, exercise scientist Chris Neville, Manchester United fitness coach Tony Strudwick and Arsenal nutritionist James Collins have worked with experts from Loughborough University to customise recovery drinks with different electrolytes depending on the amount of fluid that that players lose through sweat. Tailor made: England staff carry out cool boxes containing personalised recovery drinks for the team . Miami heat! England are training in the USA as part of their preparations to cope with high temperatures in Brazil . Form a queue: Gary Neville (3R) helps England staff line up the cool boxes while the players train . Th conditions in Miami were hot enough to warrant the use of industrial cooling fans to help the players adapt to what is to come in Brazil. Temperatures are expected to be in their 30s with humidity at between 80 - 100 per cent when England face Italy in their opening game in Manaus on June 12, and how England cope with those challenging conditions will be crucial to their performance. Preparations began with warm weather training in Portugal where players were asked to wear several layers of clothing. 'We did sweat testing,' said Hodgson. 'We have a T-shirt, a lightweight training tracksuit and on top of that the wet top. Three layers. Take a break: Jack Wilshere takes in some fluids alongside Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the sidelines . Lotta bottle: Frank Lampard takes a sip from his personalised recovery drink  at the Sun Life Stadium, Miami . Thitsy work: Players will need to keep rehydrated with temperatures in Manaus expected to top 30C . 'Apparently, it is individual. People sweat differently and need different drinks or whatever. The players went through today’s session with sweat pads on and they are being analysed and in terms of the extra heat we tried to generate. 'Because there are going to be uncomfortable moments and you’ve got to learn to get comfortable with that. England captain, Steven Gerrard, told the Metro that the conditions are likely to dictate how the team will play. ‘Coming from playing every week in England to a hotter, more humid climate where you’re sweating more is obviously going to affect the way you play,’ he said. Best laid plans: Roy Hodgson has left no detail to chance in his preparations for the World Cup . No 1 fan: Roy Hodgson and Adam Lallana stand in front of an industrial cooling fan beside the pitch . H2O: While players were given individual drinks, it appears the coaches had to contend with water . ‘Sprinting for long periods becomes more difficult and you need to take more breaks to breathe and get a sip of a drink to rehydrate. You need to place more control on the tempo of the game and ensure you don’t burn yourself out in the first half. ‘Each game and opponent requires a different plan, so yes, we will tailor our approach in Manaus to fit the requirements.’ Defender Leighton Baines said: 'The stuff with the sweat tests I have not experienced before. It is about ticking all the boxes and put us in the best place we can be, so we are prepared for everything.' Wrap up warm: England's preparations began with waring three layers while training in Portugal . Pass and move: Steven Gerrard insists that the weather will determine how England approach different games . Hot stuff! Increased temperature, heart rate and dehydration are three factors that will affect England . According to John Brewer, a professor of sport science at the University of Bedfordshire, three factors will play a part in Manaus - dehydration, increased temperature and rise in heart rate. ‘Players could sweat three litres an hour very easily in the heat of humidity of Manaus. Within half an hour or 45 minutes, they could easily become dehydrated. They have to start the game properly hydrated, they have to hydrate during the game. ‘What happens when you sweat is you don’t just lose fluid, you lose electrolytes – and it’s those electrolytes, the sodium or the salt particularly within the body which help the muscles and the nerves function effectively – if you lose too many of them your performance can suffer.’","England began training in Miami prior the the 2014 World Cup .

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . For young striker Jordan Moore, when the diagnosis finally arrived, it was brutal and unexpected. Despite having lingering doubts about a mole on his cheek, the-then 19-year-old had been told by no less than four medical professionals that there was nothing to worry about. Even when Moore finally convinced his doctor to arrange a biopsy, the information given out as he waited on his results was that there was a nine in ten chance that everything was fine. So when the Dundee United striker, who was on loan at Dunfermline at the time, learned in January, a month before turning 20, that he had melanoma skin cancer, it was news that would have shaken a far older man to his very core. Fighting spirit: Dundee United's Jordan Moore has overcome skin cancer . Instead, Moore steeled himself and stayed strong as parents Angela and Gordon fell to pieces in front of him at learning their little boy was suffering from the most dangerous skin cancer of all. After briefly succumbing to shock himself, the courageous Moore instinctively knew the key to overcoming the biggest battle of his life was straightforward. No matter what lay ahead, this impressive and eloquent youngster simply vowed that cancer would never be allowed ruin his childhood dream of becoming a professional footballer. 'It was just a little freckle to begin with but it grew into a mole', said Moore, who mercifully has been given the all-clear and is now on a mission to raise awareness of melanoma. 'People . were telling me to get it checked out because it was getting bigger but I . put it off. Then it started bleeding so I went to the doctor, but he . said it was nothing. I actually went to three or four doctors and they . all said the same thing – none of them thought it was anything to worry . about. They thought it looked like a regular mole. Hammer blow: Moore discovered the news while he was on loan at Dunfermline . 'But I kept going back until they took a biopsy in January.  I wasn’t prepared for what they were about to tell me because they said when the biopsy was done that there was a 90 per cent chance it was nothing. 'But when I went in for the result, with my mum and dad, they told me I had melanoma skin cancer, which is the worst kind you can get. The doctors were shocked. 'I didn’t know a thing about it so I Googled ‘melanoma skin cancer’ when I came out of the surgery. But that was the worst thing I could have done.  I read the first line and closed the page immediately because I didn’t want to read any more. 'I knew I had to be strong for my mum and dad but when they both burst into tears, that was harder for me. Then I went out and phoned (Dunfermline coach) Neil McCann and I started crying down the phone myself. Raising awareness: Moore is speaking up to warn people of the danger of skin cancer . 'My emotions took over, I didn’t know what else to do. But I was able to push myself on by thinking about my football. Nothing will stop me playing football. 'Being back fit and playing for United is what drove me on throughout the whole thing. I actually feel bad for people who don’t have a goal like that to aim at because it must be even more difficult for them to cope with something like this. I don’t know how they deal with it because mentally cancer is at you constantly. 'Now, all I want is to get fit for pre-season and score goals for Dundee United this season. If I get the chance I think I can do it. And all I can say to people out there is that if they have any moles they think might be something then definitely go out and get it checked.' For Moore, the pain of living with cancer was not confined to just mental torment. 'I had two operations, the second one lasted for 11 hours and was major surgery,' he said. 'They took lymph nodes out of my neck and I have scars on my neck. I don’t have any nerves on one side of my face and my bottom lip doesn’t work properly. 'But that’s nothing, and anyway having no feeling in one side of my face means I can take elbows to the face easier. 'I’ve been given the all-clear now. But I still get scanned every three months from now on and I have to check myself every week in case anything comes back. 'But hopefully that’s it for me now and I can focus on playing for Dundee United. I have just been looking forward to getting back to playing football. That’s all I want to do.' Side by side: Stevie Campbell (left) and Dave Bowman helped Moore during his dark days . Moore still marvels at the way the football families at East End Park and Tannadice rallied round for him. The youngster’s ordeal clearly placed the emphasis on ‘united’ at Dundee United, particularly when his teammates all wore Jordan Moore t-shirts in his honour during a thrilling 5-1 Premiership win over Motherwell at home in April. 'It was such a great feeling to see the lads wearing the t-shirts for me,' he said. 'When Nadir Ciftci scored and lifted his t-shirt up it definitely made me feel stronger. It made me know that everyone was behind me pushing me on. 'I had been told in the morning that they were doing something like that. I grew up with (Dundee United first team defender) John Souttar and the rest of the lads so they arranged it. 'I will never be able to repay everyone for the support they gave me. All the boys came down to see me in the hospital. They came in a mini-bus. The gaffer (Jackie McNamara), Sid (Simon Donnelly), Jacko (Darren Jackson) and the whole coaching staff came down as well. Support: Dundee United manager Jackie McNamara and his players rallied around Moore . 'Our captain Sean Dillon was up straight away and the Dunfermline lads came along too. There were so many people there all the nurses swarmed up to the ward as well to see us. Sometimes I had 15 people at once in the room but the nurses didn’t bother.' United youth-coach Stevie Campbell praised Moore for his mental fortitude in fighting such an illness at such a young age, and for raising awareness of such a deadly disease. 'It’s very admirable how Jordan and his family have coped with such an incredibly tough situation,' said Campbell. 'Jordan’s humour and positivity were a major help. When I told him the news had broken in the local paper, he said he knew but he was annoyed that they’d got his goals tally wrong. That’s just typical Jordan and it’s great that we are now talking about his football again. He’s a terrific striker and hopefully he’ s now got a great career in front of him.'","Moore was diagnosed with melanoma skin cancer while at Dunfermeline .

"By . Adam Digby . Two years ago, Andrea Pirlo was the man who defied his age to ensure his side progressed past England at Euro 2012, his outrageous chipped penalty punctuating an immaculate display of passing and vision. To remain that cool and calm in the face of such intense pressure was incredible to witness, but many wondered just how long he would remain at the top of his game. The bad news for England – and indeed any side who face Italy this summer – is that there is still no sign of the 35-year-old starting to wane. Audacious: Andrea Pirlo scores for Italy past Joe Hart at Euro 2012 with a 'Panenka' penalty . Catch him if you can: Pirlo leaves Milner (left), Gerrard and Rooney (right) in his wake . With many players, the idea of them losing ‘a yard of pace’ as they enter the autumn of their career is a genuine concern, but even the most ardent fan would struggle to remember Pirlo ever sprinting. However, while it will surprise no one to learn that his 131 passes were more than all four England midfielder’s combined in that Euro 2012 quarter final, the fact that he also covered more distance – a staggering 11.58km in a single game – is an eye-opening statistic. He plays the game in the same calm, calculated manner he approached that spot-kick against Joe Hart, never hurried and always able to find time and space to deliver an incisive pass. It is incredible to think that he has been a part of the last four title winning sides in Serie A, enjoying an undefeated season with Juventus in 2011-12 before helping them net a record 102 points this term. Men in black: Andrea Pirlo and Italy coach Cesare Prandelli arrive in Rio on Friday . The man Paul Scholes this week called 'the world’s greatest playmaker,' had another superb campaign, completing 88.5 per cent of his passes but there is so much more to his game than his ability to consistently find a team-mate with the ball. 'He’s one of those players who allows you to dream,' Gigi Buffon told reporters after watching his team-mate curl home a last-minute free kick to win a match against Genoa recently. That narrow 1-0 victory was viewed as the tipping point in this year’s title race in Italy, yet another punctuated by the greatness of the man in the Juventus no. 21 shirt. It was his fourth goal of the season as he headed towards his final tally of six, and all of them came from set-pieces around the edge of the area, highlighting yet another facet to his game that opponents would do well to heed. In that same interview, former Manchester United midfielder Scholes went on to say that England 'cannot repeat the mistakes of Euro 2012.' Midfield maestro: Pirlo is still Italy's main man even though he is 35-years-old . Evergreen: Pirlo celebrates scoring for Juventus against Lyon in the Europa League in April . Those errors appear to be commonplace outside of Italy, where people seem less aware of Pirlo’s all-round excellence. Of the England squad headed to Brazil, only Steven Gerrard (98) and Jordan Henderson (83) recorded more tackles (43) than the bearded Italian in 2013-14, while only the Liverpool skipper’s tally of 48 interceptions were higher than Pirlo’s 39. He may well be two years older than the last time he put England to the sword, but Andrea Pirlo continues to be the metronomic beating heart of Italy’s midfield.","Italian midfielder still going strong at the age of 35 .

England will storm the barricades of the All Blacks’ most forbidding fortress on Saturday, as an invading force stripped of half its firepower, but armed with a defiant mantra: ‘the greater the challenge, the greater the opportunity’.

Eden Park is the venue where visiting teams’ ambitions go to die. Pass it on: Freddie Burns is watched closely by his teammates as the ball is moved from left to right . Fortress: The All Blacks are unbeaten at Auckland's Eden Park  stadium for 20 years . Toughest test: Stuart Lancaster's England side face an almighty challenge in Saturday's match .

What awaits the men left standing in the path of the Kiwi juggernaut has the look of an ordeal, rather than an opportunity, but Lancaster has set a bullish tone ahead of this series opener. The loss of first-choice scrum-half Danny Care maintains the routine of every best-laid plan being systematically undermined by a combination of injuries and a calamitous fixture clash. This should have been the occasion for England to catch the hosts cold, before they settle back into their rhythm after seven months apart. Instead, the All Blacks have the luxury of finding their feet against chronically weakened opposition. Lancaster will send out a capable team, but how he would wish to have Luther Burrell, Owen Farrell, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes, Billy  Twelvetrees, Billy Vunipola and Tom Wood now, rather than belatedly in Dunedin and Hamilton.

Hair-raising: Marland Yarde looks for teammates as England prepare for a stern examination against the All Blacks in Auckland on Saturday . The All Blacks have 968 caps to England’s 367, along with the momentum from a perfect return of 14 straight victories in 2013. They have power, unparalleled skills, home advantage and the scent of blood in their nostrils.Lancaster’s men have hope, without the expectation. The match-day script is seemingly set for an emphatic defeat — but they refuse to accept that the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Freddie Burns typifies England’s predicament here. The fly half who has left Gloucester to join Leicester after a season scarred by collapsing form will be asked to wield the conductor’s baton in the No 10 shirt, and he is adamant that he can cope with the task. ‘I’m just excited,’ said the 24-year-old. ‘I don’t see it as a task you can get too nervous about. It’s a massive opportunity. ‘To play the All Blacks at Eden Park is something that you can’t be daunted by. We’ve been in camp for two weeks so we are chomping at the bit. The support the coaches have given me in being able to stay in camp and stay up to scratch with how the team want to  play has helped. It’s a case of me looking forward and seizing the opportunity.’ Lancaster justified Burns’ selection ahead of Danny Cipriani by suggesting that he had begun to climb out of his slump towards the end of the season. Burns . agreed, adding: ‘I feel confident now. In the last few games for . Gloucester I was getting back to myself. In this environment, where . everyone knows their roles, I feel back to my confident self. Prepared: New Zealand became the first team in the professional era to complete an unbeaten season in 2013 . Unbeaten: The All Blacks failed to lose last year, winning 14 of their test matches in 2013 . Bandaged: Brodie Retallick passes the ball during their training session at Trusts Stadium in New Zealand . ‘A big weight is off my shoulders. Last season has been put to bed. ‘I see myself as a player who thrives in the big games and big atmospheres. If I miss the first kick — which I won’t — I’ll have to move on and deal with it. I am more mentally strong now.’ He will also have to be physically strong, especially when the All Blacks’ monster centre, Ma’a Nonu, is rampaging around the midfield. Burns expects plenty of traffic coming his way and added: ‘I am sure to be targeted, but that is a gauntlet I have to relish.’ After a gaffe earlier in the week from New Zealand lock Brodie Retallick, who couldn’t name a single England player and referred to Courtney Lawes as ‘Michael’, the All Blacks were at pains to avoid dishing up more motivation to their rivals yesterday. One by one, the home players made diplomatic noises about their depleted opponents. ‘England are one of the best teams in the world,’ said full back Israel Dagg. ‘I’m sure whoever is playing will do a good job. It’s not going to be easy.’ Wing Ben Smith was similarly wary, adding: ‘England have shown they’ve got a lot of depth. A lot of the guys playing for them this weekend have played in the last 12 months and they will have a lot of motivation.’ Focused: New Zealand refuse to fall for the 'poor England side' front and expect a tough match . Roar: Sam Whitelock (right) pushing himself to the limit with his 'confident' New Zealand team-mates . Stretch: New Zealand look determined to extend their unbeaten run at Eden Park on Saturday . Lock Sam Whitelock suggested that the big visiting pack could cause problems. ‘If we don’t front up, we will be embarrassed,’ he said. And scrum-half Aaron Smith insisted the stereotyping of England in these parts as one-dimensional no longer applies. ‘They play a good brand of rugby now,’ he said. ‘England scored a lot of good tries during the Six Nations. They are a big animal and we have to show them respect.’ Sadly, English hopes of an upset have been shattered. Lancaster’s squad have sufficient fortitude to make a game of it but, ultimately, the gulf in experience and quality will be too great. If they can take the All Blacks to the edge then next week — when reinforcements are ready — the ordeal could become an opportunity after all. Tony Woodcock v David Wilson . The All Blacks loosehead is a Test veteran with 107 caps. The 33-year-old started all seven matches when New Zealand won the World Cup in 2011, scoring the crucial try in the final. He is a potent scrummager; a wily prop as well as a sturdy one. Wilson must resist Woodcock’s attempts to undermine England’s set-piece at the end of a season of considerable personal success. The giant Bath tighthead has responded well when deputising for the injured Dan Cole, but he was under the cosh in a scrum contest with Alex Corbisiero during his club’s recent defeat to Northampton in the Amlin Challenge Cup Final. Richie McCaw v Chris Robshaw . This is the clash of the captains, who lead their respective sides as opposing openside flankers. McCaw is the master of his craft – a legend of the modern era who has been named World Player of the Year a record three times. He is a renowned breakdown menace who attracts grudging admiration for his ability to keep referees onside while bending the laws to his will. Robshaw has become widely admired as England skipper and is an energetic, influential and increasingly dynamic figure, but he is not known as a poacher of turn-overs. He must resist the black tide in the rucks, but will count on assistance from the likes of James Haskell and Joe Launchbury. Ma’a Nonu v Manu Tuilagi . These wrecking-ball centres are not in direct opposition, as Nonu will wear 12 for the All Blacks and Tuilagi is at 13 for England, but they have similar roles. Both will be charged with generating space and front-foot attacking possession by blasting holes in the opposition defensive line. Nonu is a fearsome runner who has added layers of guile and artistry to his game. Tuilagi will serve as England’s attacking fulcrum and primary weapon. He is still developing the distribution range and awareness of his rival, but the strapping Tiger is an explosive force of nature in midfield, as New Zealand discovered to their cost at Twickenham in 2012.","New Zealand are unbeaten at Auckland's Eden Park since 1994 .

"By . David Kent . Daniele De Rossi wants to prove once and for all that he is a gifted player and not a 'thug' when he plays for Italy in his third World Cup. The Roma midfielder's reputation was tarnished in 2006 when he elbowed United States striker Brian McBride and received a four-match ban. De Rossi returned to play in the final against France, which saw the Azzurri clinch their fourth World Cup, but admits the incident still haunts him. Nice guy? Danielle De Rossi is determined to show people he is not a 'killer' or a 'thug' at the World Cup . 'I am ashamed of the elbow incident,' De Rossi said to Italian newspaper La Repubblica. 'However, I'm not a killer, nor a thug, nor envious if someone is better than me.' De Rossi was also left out of Italy's international friendly with Spain earlier this year after breaching Azzurri coach Cesare Prandelli's code of ethics. He was handed a three-match Serie A ban for punching Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi during a league game. 'I don't often react, but when it happens, it's bad,' the 30-year-old said. 'I'm also sure it will never happen again. 'I missed a call-up to the national team for the code of ethics, but I cannot nor do I want to play the victim. 'I repeat, elbows and punches are not my trademark.' Shameful: Daniele De Rossi was banned for four games after elbowing USA's Brian McBride at 2006 World Cup . Consolation: Daniele De Rossi (2L) returned for the final, which saw Italy beat France on penalties . After experiencing an early exit in South Africa four years ago, De Rossi knows Italy must be supremely focused from the start. They will take on England in their World Cup opener in Manaus on June 14 and will also face Uruguay and Costa Rica in Group D. And De Rossi does feel the need to prove himself again. 'In South Africa I didn't do well,' he said. 'I was burned out as with Roma we had pushed Inter Milan for the scudetto until the final game of the season. Hunger games: Italy's must be focused in Brazil after a shock early exit at the 2010 World Cup . 'The good feelings just weren't there. 'We were convinced we were going to progress from the group stages and our minds were already focused on the knock-out phase. However, our legs were way behind.' De Rossi also wants to make sure this World Cup goes well because of what Juventus playmaker Andrea Pirlo has meant to him in the national team set-up. He will never forget the reaction of the 35-year-old Pirlo after the elbow incident in 2006. Shoulder to cry on: Andrea Pirlo showed Daniele De Rossi compassion after his 2006 sending off . ""When in the World Cup in Germany I was destroyed by the four-match ban, Andrea invited me to have supper with his family and he didn't make me feel like a reject,' he said. 'This World Cup is a bit like a goodbye. This will be the last time I will play with Pirlo and I don't want to think about it otherwise I will get emotional.' De Rossi and Italy arrived safely in Rio de Janeiro on Friday and will take on Brazilian club . Fluminense in a friendly on Sunday hoping to end seven-game winless run.

"By . Mike Dickson . Follow @@Mike_Dickson_DM . Andy Murray had reduced a hostile Court Philippe Chatrier to the silence of the lambs after two sets of an extraordinary French Open quarter-final as he overwhelmed local hero Gael Monfils. Many of the Frenchman’s fellow Parisians filed out to find dinner or somewhere warm, disillusioned by the inferiority of their man. Within an hour, those left were roaring Monfils towards a fifth set — only to end up wondering why they had bothered. At 9.41pm, Murray completed the second turnaround of a bewildering contest by rampaging through an unlikely final set in just 24 minutes to go through 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 1-6, 6-0 in three hours and 15 minutes. On Friday the 27-year-old Scot has a repeat of his 2011 semi-final against Rafael Nadal, who somehow managed to finish earlier after losing the first set. He came back to defeat David  Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1, but at least he will not have the advantage of an extra day’s rest, as had seemed probable. Pumped up: Andy Murray celebrates as he beats Frenchman Gael Monfils in a deciding fifth set . Good game, good game: The two protagonists shake hands after a match that will live long in the memory . That . was a relatively routine affair compared to the madness being played . out on the main arena, the type that comes from having two of the . world’s most enigmatic performers facing off. Murray played superbly at . the start,  sticking to a clever gameplan to deny Monfils the pace he . loves but then opening his shoulders to thump winners when the . opportunity arose. It was hard to recall his backhand down the line . ever  having been so devastating. To Monfils’s credit, he turned it . around, and the debate became whether this would be the first time since . 2005, when Murray was a  callow 18-year-old with brittle legs playing . at his first Wimbledon, that the Scot might lose a five-set match from . 2-0 up. He has played 21 since, and  that record stands intact after . his explosive sprint to the finish line that came after he had looked . down and out in the fourth set, complaining after its conclusion that he . was being made to play on. Day in the sun: Andy Murray raced into a two-set lead but was pegged back by the unpredictable Gael Monfils . Serving up a treat: Murray was initially the aggressor but was pegged back by an inspired Monfils in front of a partisan crowd . The key to his transformation was . breaking in the second game of a decider which began at 9.17pm with the . light fading and the temperature dropping. Suddenly it was Murray who wanted to continue and he went on to beat an opponent who had the energy sucked out of him. Desperate . to finish so as not to face playing on a fifth day out of six ahead of . the Nadal clash, he hit out freely while Monfils, to the consternation . of his supporters, failed  to stem the haemorrhage of games in the . gloaming. Monfils said  afterwards he had been happy to finish the . match, while Murray insisted he was, too. ‘I was told we had 20 . minutes left, a maximum of six games,’ said the Scot. ‘It was very dark . at the end and thankfully he played a poor fifth set once I got ahead . after really raising his level in the fourth. ‘It was tough . conditions, very windy at the start and I began well. When the wind . calmed down he began to play so much better. He’s such an incredible . athlete, he gets to so many balls. It’s definitely a big achievement to . have got this far but it’s not what I came here to do. I set myself some . big goals.’ It will be very difficult but the Murray of the first, . second and fifth sets has a puncher’s chance against Nadal. The one of . the third and fourth faces a knockout. Breathtaking: Murray was brilliant when push came to shove with Monfils dazzling for two sets . Murray had walked on to a . mixture of the residual cheers for the preceding Monfils, mixed in with . boos to warn him of what might lie in store. His response was to smile, . but the most effective way of shutting the previously rain-sodden 15,000 . spectators out of the match would be with his racket, and that was what . he proceeded to do. And for the second match in  succession he . sportingly conceded a point to his opponent, this time as he tried to . close out the second set in a marathon game. A ball fell from his pocket . as he blasted a forehand into the net and umpire Jake Garner called a . let. Amid a cacophony of booing, the two players and the official . held a mid-court conference, which ended with the Scot giving away the . point, which he did not need to do. That became irrelevant as he went on . to close it out on an eighth set point to put himself in full command . and convince many of Monfils’s fans that this was no longer worth the . bother. Flashpoint: Murray and Monfils argue with the umpire as temperatures get a little heated on court . Power: Monfils hits a forehand as he fights back from two sets down to level the match . The deserters missed Monfils digging in admirably, cutting . down on the forehand misses and orchestrating those loyal stayers to get . behind him once he had saved three break points early in the third. They traded games evenly until the death, when he broke a frustrated . opponent. By then there looked to be not enough light left for Murray . to lose, but Monfils knew winning the fourth could offer him the . sanctuary of a night’s rest — although it was the stiffening Murray who . looked like he needed that more.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Maria Sharapova reached her third successive French Open final by battling past Eugenie Bouchard. Sharapova maintained her remarkable record in three-set matches by winning an 18th consecutive deciding set on clay in a 4-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory. The Russian won her first title at Roland Garros in 2012 before losing to Serena Williams 12 months ago. On form: Maria Sharapova fought back from a set down to overcome a stiff challenge from Eugenie Bouchard . Rising star: Eugenie Bouchard, 20, was playing in her second consecutive Grand Slam semi-final . Bouchard, . who was playing in her second straight grand slam semi-final, had lost . comfortably to Sharapova in the second round last year and demonstrated . again the huge strides she has made. She possesses the same steely-eyed determination as Sharapova and her mental strength is remarkable for a 20-year-old. The . Canadian said after beating Angelique Kerber in the fourth round that . she did not have a best friend in tennis, adding: 'I don't think the . tennis tour is the place to have friends. For me, it's all competition.' It . was a sentence that could well have been written by Sharapova so it was . no surprise that this was not a match for the faint-hearted. Bouchard . has improved significantly since making the last four at the Australian . Open in January, hitting the ball a lot more aggressively, and it was . she who struck first with a break for 2-1. Pumped up: Sharapova celebrates as she comes back from a set down to seal her place in the final . Sharapova . fought back to level at 4-4 but Bouchard forged ahead again immediately . and held to take the set, saving a break point with the gutsiest of . backhand winners onto the line. Sharapova . had recovered from a set down in both her last two matches against Sam . Stosur and Garbine Muguruza and set about doing the same, moving into a . 5-2 lead. But . the Russian's serve, never something to be relied upon, was having an . off day and, serving for the set, she twice double-faulted on set point. Rising star: Bouchard gets down low to play a forehand as she takes the first set over Sharapova . There was also a second-serve ace on a break point for good measure but on her third chance Bouchard pounced. The . 20-year-old was unable to resist when Sharapova broke again at 5-5, . though, and this time the seventh seed clinched the set when Bouchard . netted a forehand. Bouchard . had never lost a grand slam match in which she had won the first set . before but the sense was Sharapova's prowess in deciding sets would be . the crucial factor. Scene of success: Sharapova will play in her third consecutive French Open final on Saturday . The Russian moved ahead at 3-1, and for the first time Bouchard was making bad mistakes on the big points. She . held for 4-2, saving two break points, but in the next game missed a . routine forehand and a volley as Sharapova moved to within one game of . victory.

"A 19-year-old woman, identified as psychology student Danica Pringle, remains in a critical but stable condition after being trapped in a flaming car on Thursday night. The teenager from Cranbourne was sitting in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon which was seen speeding down the South Gippsland Highway alongside a blue Holden Commodore, before it smashed into a pole and burst into flames. The driver of the Ford, Brodie McGregor,18, from Lynbrook, lost control of his vehicle at about 11:30pm before smashing into his friend's car which was driving beside him, veering the two vehicles off of the road and finally colliding with a concrete pole.

Ms Pringle was left in a critical condition after the car she was in collided with a concrete pole and burst into flames on Thursday night in Melbourne's southeast . The 19-year-old was in the passenger side of a silver Ford Falcon (pictured) which is believed to have been involved in a drag race at the time of the incident . 'Police believe that the driver of the Ford, which was travelling in the inside lane, lost control of his vehicle and hit the Commodore,' Senior Constable Adam West said. 'Both cars ran off the road way, mounted the centre median strip and collided with a concrete pole. The teenage driver of the Ford escaped with minor injuries and was taken to the Alfred Hospital, however his passenger, Ms Pringle remained trapped in the car from which she could hear screaming. Neighbours who heard the crash, soon attempted to aid the group of friends by throwing water onto the flaming vehicle. However Ms Pringle remained trapped until emergency services arrived to free her. She was then flown to The Alfred Hospital where she remains in a life threatening condition with critical head injuries and burns to her arms, legs and back. The passenger in the Holden Commodore which was also involved in the race (pictured) was also rushed to hospital with serious abdominal injuries . The drivers of the cars were both taken to hospital however they only suffered minor injuries . Ambulance Victoria spokesman Paul Bentley  told the Sun Herald that paramedics arrived to the scene within four minutes where they found both cars in flames. 'The CFA managed to put out the fire pretty quickly but she was trapped for about half-hour,' he said.

"By . Phil Casey . England's Lee Slattery shrugged off a shoulder injury caused by a soft pillow to move into contention for a second European Tour title in the Lyoness Open on Friday. Slattery, 35, carded an eagle, five birdies and one bogey to return an impressive 66 at Diamond Country Club and lie just one shot behind playing partner Mikael Lundberg, who added a 68 to his opening 67. 'The bed this week is quite hard, which I usually like, but the pillow's soft, which I'm not so keen on,' said Slattery, who won the Madrid Masters in 2011. In contention: Lee Slattery's second round 66 moved him to within a shot of the lead at the Lyoness Open . Bad sleep: Lee Slattery shrugged off an injury to his shoulder caused by a 'soft pillow' 'When I got out of bed this morning I did a few stretches and felt something tweak in my shoulder. 'It felt a bit sore, then it got progressively worse and on the way in on the bus I wasn't even sure whether or not I'd actually be able to play today. 'But I went to see the physio as soon as I got to the course and he managed to loosen it up for me. He did a great job on it, so I owe him a thanks.' Lundberg, whose previous wins came in the Russian Open in 2005 and 2008, parred the first two holes but then birdied the next four in succession to move into a four-shot lead. The 40-year-old from Helsingborg, who failed to record a single top-10 finish last season and had to regain his card for the third successive year at the qualifying school, dropped his first shot of the day after a clumsy chip on the eighth. And although he holed from 30 feet for birdie on the 12th, that proved to be his last one of the day as he missed from three feet on the next. 'The greens were slightly softer at the start of the round, so that made life a little bit easier for us,' Lundberg said. 'I hit a lot of good shots early on and managed to make some putts, so that got my confidence up. Personal best: Lee Slattery's only other European tour victory came at the 2011 Madrid Open . Swede dreams: Mikael Lundberg leads the field, despite failing to register a top 10 finish last year .

'But it got tougher and tougher the longer the round went on because the course got really firm and fast towards the end. So whilst it may look and feel easy, it never is. 'I've been doing some great work with my new coach, Neil Jordan, over the last few weeks, and my game is feeling a lot more solid as a result. 'So while I didn't maybe expect to play this well here, it's not a complete shock to me either.'

"By . Adam Duggan . Prominent euthanasia campaigner Dr Philip Nitschke is being investigated by police, after two Melbourne women sent the controversial doctor a letter in an attempt to justify their alleged suicide pact . Police are investigating the deaths of two Melbourne women, who allegedly used equipment marketed by Exit International to commit suicide in March. The pair allegedly penned a note to the organisation's founder, Dr Philip Nitschke, prior to committing suicide. Dr Claire Parsons, 66, wrote that she decided to commit suicide after assisting to end the life of her friend Val Seeger, 75, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. Dr Parsons and Ms Seeger lived together as housemates in the northern Melbourne suburb of Viewbank. In the note, released by Exit International, Dr Parsons wrote of her distress in not legally being able to assist Ms Seeger in her alleged desire to be euthanised. 'Given the laws that exist at this time in history, what I am obliged to do, I will do, and do willingly,' Dr Parsons wrote. 'None of our actions has been taken lightly. But neither have they been taken with sorrow or regret.' 'For us, this has been an entirely rational decision, taken in full knowledge of contemporary research in the field and experience of working with people who have Alzheimer's.' Dr Nitschke admits the pair attended one of Exit International's Melbourne workshops in September. He also said they were quite open about their plan at meetings of their local Exit International chapter. According to the letter, the pair met 24 years ago when Dr Parsons, who completed post-doctorate studies at Harvard University, had come to Australia from the United States to further her career in health research. They moved in together after Ms Seeger's mother died, a few years after they met - when Dr Parsons was assisting in research at the hospital at which Ms Seeger served as Director of Nursing. At 50 years old, Ms Seeger was forced to retire due to a serious heart condition. But into her retirement, Ms Seeger volunteered alongside Dr Parsons at the Australian Red Cross' Emergency and Disaster programme. Not one to shy away from controversy: Dr Nitschke has said the pair were open about their plan during meetings at their local Exit International chapter . They volunteered until a few months prior to Ms Seeger's diagnosis with Alzheimer's Disease in March 2013. '[Ms Seeger] wishes to die having lived a life of joyful giving, at a time when Alzheimer's is not just robbing her of words or numeracy but when it starts to rob her of reason and clear decision making,' Dr Parsons wrote in the letter to Dr Nitschke. 'Being a technophone, she has also asked me to help her so she does not get this final step wrong and end up in a vegetative state despite her earnest wishes.' Discussing her reasoning for agreeing to assist Ms Seeger, Dr Parsons added: 'She does not want to die alone. No one does. Therefore, I have made a promise that I will be with her and help her should she need assistance.' It is believed Dr Parsons committed suicide after assisting to end the life of Ms Seeger. Courting further potential bad press: Dr Philip Nitschke pictured outside his Adelaide euthanasia advisory clinic, which he has admitted to wanting to expand to Melbourne . 'The police are obliged to charge me with aiding and abetting a suicide and I am not prepared to undergo the harassment and disgrace of prosecution. This leaves me no choice but to join my friend at her time of death,' the note reads. Speaking to MailOnline, Dr Nitschke said he was 'not too sure what the strongest motivation [for the suicide] was.' 'But if she's dying just because she feared prosecution, then that's tragic,' Dr Nitschke said. He said that although the pair purchased the equipment through his organisation, he did not receive the letter until after they had died. In Victoria, assisting a suicide carries a maximum five-year jail sentence. Six people have been prosecuted under suicide-related laws since 1997. Dr Nitschke has courted controversy over the years, through his prominent campaigns to have euthanasia legalised. He founded the 'dying with dignity' group Exit International in 1997 and currently runs a euthanasia advisory clinic in Adelaide. The Herald Sun reported Dr Nitschke was looking at potential sites for a clinic in the north Melbourne suburb of Essendon this week.

"By . Ryan Lipman . Australian-born former Grand Slam doubles champion and one-time Tennis Hall of Famer Bob Hewitt was indicted on charges of rape and sexual assault of minors on Friday. The 74-year-old  will go on trial in February, his lawyer told The Associated Press. Attorney Alwyn Griebenow said Hewitt denies two charges of rape and one of sexual assault of girls he coached in South Africa in the 1980s. Australian-born tennis star Bob Hewitt has been charged with child sex offences while he was coaching junior players in South Africa . The former tennis star attended Boksburg Magistrate's Court near Johannesburg and told the court he understood the charges, the attorney said. Hewitt was not asked to enter a plea. Griebenow said Hewitt would plead not guilty to all three charges at his trial. 'Mr Hewitt is relieved that we at least now have a trial date,' Griebenow said. He said Hewitt denied having any sexual contact with the alleged victims or making any sexual advances toward them and added that Hewitt was focusing on 'putting the record straight' at the trial. In South Africa, a defendant is served with indictment papers before his case is sent to a higher court for trial. Hewitt was charged last year and will stand trial from February 9 next at South Gauteng High Court, Griebenow said. He is accused of raping a girl under the age of 16 in 1981, raping another girl under the age of 16 in 1982, and sexual assaulting a third girl under the age of 18 in 1994. Hewitt missed a string of his early court dates citing ill health, but arrived for his hearing on Friday wearing a brown blazer and using a walking stick. Glory days: Hewitt won nine grand slam doubles and six mixed doubles titles in the 1960s and 1970s . His doctor said in court documents last year that Hewitt had a stroke in 2010, a heart attack in 2011, and also suffered from anxiety attacks and depression among other health problems. One of the alleged victims, Suellen Sheehan, has attended previous court hearings and was present again on Friday, according to South African newspaper The Star. 'We're finally in the home stretch,' she told The Star. Hewitt won nine grand slam doubles and six mixed doubles titles in the 1960s and 1970s, playing occasionally with former stars Arthur Ashe and Billie Jean King. He was inducted into the Rhode Island-based Tennis Hall of Fame as a master of the doubles craft after winning 15 Grand Slam titles. Hewitt also reached the semifinals of the men's singles at the Australian Open three times. He was indefinitely suspended from the hall in 2012 and his legacy stripped from the institution after an investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse.

"By . Emma Innes . Smoking marijuana can give men ‘man boobs’, an American plastic surgeon has claimed. Dr Anthony Youn, from YOUN Plastic Surgery, in Detroit, says cannabis could lower testosterone levels in men, leading to the development of excess breast tissue. He says ‘man boobs’ are caused by an imbalance in the body’s levels of testosterone and oestrogen. Smoking marijuana can give men 'man boobs', an American plastic surgeon claims . Writing for CNN, Dr Youn explained that when the balance is in favour of oestrogen, instead of testosterone, extra breast tissue is created - and that cannabis can help tip the balance. Dr Youn says ‘moobs’ – technically known as gynaecomastia – affect about 33 to 41 per cent of men aged 25 to 44. He says the condition also affects as many as 60 per cent of teenage boys and 55 to 60 per cent of over-50s. Most cases of ‘moobs’ resolve themselves within a couple of years but the removal of extra breast tissue is now the fifth most common plastic surgery choice for men in the U.S. 'Man boobs' are caused by an imbalance in the body's testosterone and oestrogen levels - and cannabis can cause testosterone levels to fall . Dr Youn says that in animals, marijuana results in falling testosterone levels, shrinking testicles and abnormalities in sperm. The effects of cannabis on testosterone in humans are not as clear, he says. However, levels of the hormone in men who use marijuana a lot have been found to be lower than in men who do not use it. For CNN, Dr Youn wrote: ‘So can smoking pot really give you man boobs? ‘Probably. Although the association between marijuana and gynaecomastia hasn't been conclusively proven, it appears very plausible. ‘For this reason, the majority of plastic surgeons I've consulted with routinely inquire with their gynaecomastia patients about cannabis use and recommend they stop smoking pot immediately.’ Dr Youn added that men who smoke marijuana and have ‘moobs’ should probably put out their joints.","Dr Anthony Youn says 'moobs' are caused by an imbalance in levels of testosterone and oestrogen - cannabis causes testosterone levels to fall .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . In these days of movie megastars and overly precious pop stars, we have all heard stories of celebrity guests who make outrageous demands of the hotels they frequent. But it seems that many members of the general public can be just as diva-like – and delusional – when it comes to what they expect of the places in which they stay. Ring ring: According to the survey, strange requests made by hotel guests have included goat bells to aid sleep . Outrageous orders and crazy complaints regularly stretch the patience of even the best-trained staff, according to a research conducted by flight comparison website Skyscanner. The survey – which questioned 400 hotel staff in 49 countries – reveals a world of grasping guests and cantankerous customers for whom no tantrum is too ridiculous. Skyscanner has compiled a list of the ten most unusual requests made by hotel guests – as well as the top ten most outlandish complaints. Woof woof: One guest complained that his dog was unhappy with the level of service at the hotel, and did not enjoy its stay, while another difficult customer wanted mineral water - not for drinking, but for the toilet bowl . The latter line-up includes far-from-happy customers appalled that their room did not come with a sea view, even though they were staying miles from the coast, a light sleeper angry that they had been kept awake by their own girlfriend’s snoring – and a peeved diner unamused to find that a vegetarian menu in a hotel restaurant did not include steak. 1. One glass of water on the hour every hour, through the night2. 15 cucumbers a day3. Toilet to be filled with mineral water4. Bath filled with honey5. Sound of goat bells to aid sleep6. Only the right legs of a chicken to be served7. A dead mouse8. Bath full of chocolate milk9. 16 pillows (for a single guest)10. Crocodile soup . 1. The sheets are too white2. The sea is too blue3. Ice cream is too cold4. Bath is too big5. Girlfriend’s snoring has kept guest awake6. Guest’s dog did not enjoy its stay7. Hotel has no ocean view (in London)8. There is no steak on the vegetarian menu9. Waiter is too handsome10. Mother of groom has not been given the honeymoon suite . Other fantastical flashpoints included a guest upset that the bath in their suite was too big, and an animal lover who wanted a discount because his dog had not enjoyed its stay. And some people, it seems, are never happy. One guest was moved to raise a concern about the waiter who served them at dinner – saying he was too handsome for their liking. The list of unlikely requests features a range of demands that would surely make the most riotous rock star or highly-strung actress blush. One guest wanted a glass of water to be delivered to their room – on the hour, every hour, throughout the night. Another insisted that they could not drop off into the land of nod without the sounds of the mountains – and could a range of goat bells be provided? No no: According to the research, a guest complained that the waiter serving them was too handsome - while another asked for chicken for their dinner, as long as they were served only right legs from available poultry . Another wanted a dinner of chicken. Not too outrageous, you might think – except for the fact that, the guest stipulated, only legs from the right side of the chicken should be served as part of the meal. Other food-themed blasts from the barely believable included a customer who wanted a bowl of crocodile soup, and a weight-watcher who asked for 15 cucumbers per day. Incredible en-suite-related wishes included baths filled with honey or chocolate milk. And spare a thought for staff at the hotel where a guest demanded a further bathroom-linked change to the room: they wanted their toilet to be filled with mineral water.","Survey of hotel staff in 49 countries reveals hotel guests' bizarre behaviour .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of a seven-year-old western Pennsylvania boy say he has been suspended from school - and could be expelled - after telling a teacher that he accidentally brought a toy gun to school. Chris Simak and Jennifer Mathabell say their son, Darin Simak, a first grader, was suspended from Martin School in New Kensington Tuesday. Mathabell says the boy left his regular book bag at a friend's house, so she packed him another one, not realizing the toy was in it. Suspended: First grader Darin Simak was suspended after he handed in a toy gun to his teacher which his mother had inadvertently sent him to school with in a backpack . Policy: Darin handed the toy gun in to the teacher because he knew it was against the rules, but was suspended anyway . The boy's parents Darin immediately gave it to a teacher because he knew it was against the rules. The school superintendent John Pallone says bringing a gun to school violates their policy at the highest level and requires suspension until a meeting can be held to discuss the issue and decide if punishment is necessary. Mathabell had to go and pick her son up from school and was told not to bring him in for classes Thursday, reports WTAE. She decided to take Darin to school as normal Friday because she doesn't believe he's done anything wrong. 'I'm sending him to school because he's entitled to be in school and be educated. The principal called her and told her to take her son back home and placed Darin in in-school suspension until his father could pick him up. School rules: Darin Simak's parents say he shouldn't be punished for doing the right thing, while the school district says bringing a fake weapon to school violates policy at the highest level . Indignant: Jennifer Mathabell took her son to school Friday but he was placed in in-school detention and his father had to pick him up again . The boy faces an expulsion hearing Friday. New Kensington-Arnold superintendent John Pallone wouldn't comment on Darin Simak specifically. The district's policy calls for a one-year expulsion for 'replicas of weapons' but also allows the superintendent to modify the punishment on a case-by-case basis. Darin Simak is confused, because he believes he did the right thing yet is still being punished for it. 'Of course I did [the right thing],' he told WTAE. Chris Simak told Fox News that his son 'did the right thing, and we're trying to teach him the right way, and now they're teaching him the wrong way.'","Darin Simak, a first-grader, has been suspended from school for bringing a toy gun to class .

Google claims its self-driving cars have now mastered motorway driving. But it said city driving has been a far greater challenge for the cars' computers and it will now be focusing on improving technology in this area.  Pictured is Google co-founder Sergey Brin after riding in a driverless car with officials . Chris Urmson, the project's leader, said test cars now can . handle thousands of urban situations that would have stumped them a year ago. ‘We're growing more optimistic that we're heading toward an . achievable goal - a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention,’ he . wrote. Urmson's post was the company's first official update . since 2012 on progress toward a driverless car, which has been underway within . the company's secretive Google X lab. The company has said its goal is to get the technology to . the public by 2017. Chris Urmson, the project's leader, said test cars now can handle thousands of urban situations. 'We're growing more optimistic that we're heading toward an achievable goal - a vehicle that operates fully without human intervention,' he wrote. Pictured is the company's onboard camera navigating city streets in California . Google isn't the only one working on driverless car technology.  Zürich-based Rinspeed has decided to pimp Tesla’s ride in its latest concept car for truly autonomous driving. Designed to be a car, office, living room and urban space all in one package, the XchangE electric vehicle aims to make driving completely stress-free. ‘Travelling in a driverless car will no longer require me to stare at the road, but will let me spend my time in a more meaningful way,’ said Rinspeed founder Frank Rinderknecht. The all-electric touring sedan features seats that can tilt, swivel and slide into more than twenty different seating arrangements. According to the company, ‘passengers will be able to assume virtually any seating or resting position when travelling in the car.’ To begin with, human drivers would be expected to take . control if the computer fails. The promise is that, eventually, there would be . no need for a driver. Passengers could read, daydream, sleep - or work - while the . car drives. Google maintains that computers will one day drive far more . safely than humans, and part of the company's pitch is that robotic cars can reduce . traffic fatalities. The basics are now in place. The task for Google now is perfecting the . technology strapped onto its fleet of about two dozen Lexus RX450H SUVs. Sensors including radar and lasers create 3D maps of a . self-driving car's surroundings in real-time, while Google's software sorts . objects into four categories. These include moving vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists and . static objects such as signs, curbs and parked cars. Initially, the car’s capabilities were fairly crude. A group . of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person. Now, the technology can distinguish individuals, according . to Google spokeswoman Courtney Hohne. To deal with cyclists, engineers initially programmed the . software to look for hand gestures that indicate an upcoming turn. The company has said its goal is to get the technology to the public by 2017. To begin with, human drivers would be expected to take control if the computer fails. The promise is that, eventually, there would be no need for a driver. Passengers could read, daydream, sleep - or work - while the car drives . Then they realised that most cyclists don't use standard . gestures - and still others weave down a road the wrong way. Engineers have taught the software to predict the behaviour . of cyclists based on thousands of encounters during the approximately 10,000 . miles (16,000 km) the cars have driven autonomously on city streets, Hohne . said. The software projects a cyclist's likely movements and plots . the car's path accordingly - then reacts if something unexpected happens. ‘A mile of city driving is much more complex than a mile of . freeway driving, with hundreds of different objects moving according to . different rules of the road in a small area,’ Urmson wrote. Before recent breakthroughs, Google had considered mapping . all the world's stop signs. Now the technology can read stop signs, including those held . in the hands of school crossing guards, Hohne added. This is the view the car sees when its navigating an intersection. Initially, the car's capabilities were fairly crude. A group of pedestrians on a street corner registered as a single person, for example. Now, the technology can distinguish individuals . A user, who is legally blind, sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed To date, Google's cars have gone about 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) in self-driving mode . Mean streets: Google cars have driven about 700,000 accident-free miles (1.1 million km)  on motorways in 'autonomous mode'. Google has been focusing on city driving for the past year. To-do list: Google's Lexus RX450H SUVs are retrofitted with lasers, radar and cameras rapidly learned how to handle thousands of urban driving situations.  Improvements are needed in merging and lane changes, turning right on red and handling bad weather. Local tests: So far, the tech giant has focused on street driving in Mountain View, California. The state, along with, Nevada, Florida, Michigan  and Washington, D.C., have formally opened public streets to testing of self-driving cars. The future is (almost) here: In 2012, Google co-founder Sergey Brin predicted that the public would be able to get hold of the technology within five years. This prediction has not been revised. Google, the carmaker: While Google has enough money to invest in making cars, that likelihood is remote.  Industry experts believe more likely options include collaborating with major car makers or giving away the software, as Google did with its Android operating system. While the car knows when to stop, when to start again is . still a challenge because the cars are programmed to drive defensively. At a four-way stop, Google's cars have been known to wait in . place as people driving in other directions edge out into the intersection. The cars still need work on other predictably common tasks. Among them, understanding the gestures that drivers give one another to signal . it's fine to merge or change lanes, turning right on red and driving in rain or . fog. ‘You can count on one hand the number of years until people, . ordinary people, can experience this,' company co-founder Sergey Brin said in 2012. He made the remarks . at a ceremony where California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation legalising . the cars on public roads in the state. To date, Google's cars have gone about 700,000 miles (1.1 . million km) in self-driving mode, the vast majority on motoways, the company . said. California's Department of Motor Vehicles is in the process . of writing regulations to implement that law. Nevada, Florida, Michigan and . Washington, D.C., also have written driverless car laws. Google has not said how it plans to market the technology. Options include collaborating with major carmakers or giving away the software, . as the company did with its Android operating system. While Google has the balance sheet to invest in making cars, . that likelihood is remote. Traditional automakers also are developing driverless cars.

But now a U.S. company claims that such tabletop trauma could be a thing of the past as it has invented a tall cup that is impossible to knock over. The Mighty Mug has been branded a 'tower of strength' and can reportedly withstand, hitting, pushing, slapping and poking without falling over and spilling its contents. Scroll down for video . A U.S. company has invented a cup that it claims is impossible to knock over. The Mighty Mug is tall but can withstand hitting, pushing, slapping and poking without tumbling over and spilling its contents . The mug has 'smartgrip technology' that stops it falling over but does not require users to push buttons or pull levers to enable the cup to leave the surface of a table or desk. When the smartgrip base is placed on a smooth, flat surface, a small amount of air is trapped beneath it, creating a vacuum that locks the mug in place and prevent the possibility of someone accidentally knocking it over. The vacuum is instantly released when a user lifts the cup - requiring no extra effort when they want to drink from it, unlike with some other designs. The cup has been a big hit in the U.S. and will be sold in the UK for £20. As well as its vacuum base, the mug has insulated walls to keep drinks hot or cold as well as a lockable, leak-proof lid, pictured right . The Mighty Mug also has insulated walls to maintain the temperature of hot or cold liquid and a leak-proof lid so that when it is locked the drink is sealed inside. It holds up to 500ml of liquid, is dishwasher and microwave safe and is made of eco-friendly biodegradable plastic that takes five years to disintegrate. The cup has been on sale in the U.S. where it was a big success and will now be sold in the UK too. Might Mug comes in three colours and costs £20.

Inactive lifestyles are also to blame for the negative impact on children's wellbeing, said the document from Public Health England . Children who spend more time on computers, watching TV and playing video games also tend to experience higher levels of emotional distress, anxiety and depression, it said. Last week, a study found half of all seven-year-olds do not get enough exercise - and girls are far less active than boys. Only 51 per cent of all seven-year-olds in the UK achieve the recommended hour of exercise every day, with the figure being just 38 per cent in girls compared with 63 per cent in boys. Half of this age group is also sedentary for an average of 6.4 hours or more every day, experts found.

The briefing paper was released to back a Public Health England campaign urging parents to rethink their children’s eating and exercise habits ahead of the new school term. The Smart Restart campaign includes tips to reduce time in front of TV, encourage walking to school and for pupils to have a healthy lunch. Professor Kevin Fenton, Public Health England’s director of health and wellbeing, said: 'There are many complex factors that affect a child’s wellbeing such as the wider environment they live in and their social, financial and family circumstances. The report found higher levels of TV viewing are having a negative effect on children's wellbeing, including lower self-worth, lower self-esteem and lower levels of self-reported happiness . 'But there are also some very simple things we can all do every day with our children to help improve their health and wellbeing. 'Smart Restart provides families with the inspiration and tools to do this. Our goal is to encourage families across England to sign up to Change4Life to make a healthy change to their new term-time routines, which will hopefully then become part of their everyday lives.' Lil Caprani, director of communications, policy and campaigns at The Children’s Society, said: 'When we asked children about their wellbeing as part of our Good Childhood Report, we found a strong association with being active and being happy.

Over the past few years, Irina seemed to have embraced the role as surrogate stepmother to the child and has been seen doting over the little boy on frequent occasions. However, since they started dating in May 2010, the couple regularly go for weeks or sometimes months without seeing each other. Irina is based in New York for her modelling work, but travels all over the world, while Ronaldo splits his time between Madrid and his native Portugal. Miss BumBum: Brazillian model Andressa Urach said Ronaldo, 28, slept with her in a hotel just 48 hours before a key Champions League semi-final . The day after: Real Madrid's Portuguese forward Cristiano Ronaldo playing in the Champions League semi final . Ronaldo said in a statement on Twitter last night: ‘I was informed that The Sun, faithful to its editorial line, will publish an article where is given voice to a so called Andressa - someone seeking the limelight on my account. ‘And I wonder why this happens one day before a very important game for my team. Deeply outraged by a situation intended, in vain, to affect my personal life. ‘I just want to clarify I was in fact at the Hotel Villa Magna on April 22 giving an interview to Manu Sainz, something the reporter himself is able to corroborate. Everything else is pure fiction and forgery.' Cristiano Ronaldo and girlfriend Irina Shayak seen going for dinner at a restaurant in Madrid before the Champions league semi final against Borussia Dortmund . The woman had told The Sun it happened a day after the £80million former Manchester United forward was pictured leaving a restaurant in Madrid with his girlfriend Irina Shayk. Speaking about their tryst, she said: 'It was incredible, his body's perfect, like a Greek god. He went on for hours and would not stop talking about my butt.' Miss Urach claimed Ronaldo told her he had dreamed about her behind and called her his 'little horse' before asking her to come to Madrid and meet up. Miss Urach told how the pair linked up at the city's £12,500-a-night Villa Magna hotel after she took a taxi there and waited for him in the lobby. The day before: Ronaldo was snapped leaving the restaurant with his girlfriend the day before the alleged tryst. She looked furious . He arrived in a grey Audi R3 and parked in an underground car park before taking a private lift to his room, from where he texted her his room number, The Sun reported.","Andressa Urach said striker slept with her just 48 hours before key match .

She then sells her breast pieces online with some fetching up to $500 (£300). Since creating her first painting in 2006, Marcey, from California, USA, has created thousands of pieces which she sells from her online shop under the nickname 'Boobie Painter'. 'My art is meant to be intimate, erotic, explorative and unique with a hint of whimsy - I call it chaotic yet contained abstraction,' she says.

'My newest style which is proving popular is the 'tittie twerk' where the canvas is primed in a solid colour and while it's still wet I use just about a quarter of my breast covered in paint and sort of jiggle it around.'

"By . Hugo Gye . A former American soldier who took part in the D-Day landings has returned to Europe for the last time to visit the English village where he was stationed before the historic mission. Bob Noody was captured in a historic photograph on his way to the front in Normandy, showing him as a young man overburdened with armour and weaponry. Now the 90-year-old is set to return to the beaches of northern France to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Mr Noody has spent this week in the . village of Aldbourne in Wiltshire, where he was stationed with Fox . Company, part of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne . Division. Scroll down for video . Return: Bob Noody pictured in the village of Aldbourne in Wiltshire, where he was stationed before D-Day . Historic: Mr Noody, second right, was pictured in the plane on the way to the Normandy landings . That regiment is the one immortalised in TV series Band of Brothers, which depicts the heroics of Easy Company towards the end of the Second World War. On his return to Britain, Mr Noody visited the Blue Boar pub in Aldbourne, which served as the officers' mess in the days before D-Day. He also met fellow veteran Cecil Newton, from the 47 Royal Dragoon Guards, in the town's memorial hall, which includes a display honouring the American troops stationed in Aldbourne. Cheers! Mr Noody raises his glass in the Blue Boar pub, formerly the officers' mess during the war . Pose: Mr Noody with a copy of the photograph which spread his fame around the world . This weekend, he will leave Britain and travel on to Normandy for the 70th anniversary commemorations. Mr Noody's trip to Europe was partly funded by an online campaign which raised $2,645 (£1,600) for his travel costs and expenses. Rob Stark, who organised the campaign and accompanied Mr Noody, wrote online: 'Bob Noody is an Airborne vet of WWII. He landed in Normandy on D-Day to help liberate the French and the world of Hitler's tyranny. 'Bob wants to go back to Normandy for the last time in 2014 which is the 70th anniversary of his drop into Normandy.' Meeting: The former U.S. Army soldier with Cecil Newton, a British veteran of the Second World War . Memorial: The two soldiers in front of a monument to the 101st Airborne Division in Aldbourne's village hall . Mr Noody originally wanted to be a priest before he was drafted into the Army in 1943, at the age of just 18. He became a paratrooper because it offered him extra pay, and joined Fox Company just in time for 'Operation Overlord', the mission to recapture France for the Allies. After training in Aldbourne, Mr Noody and his comrades took off from Upottery Airfield on June 5, 1944 - when he was photographed in an image which would become iconic of the strength and bravery of American troops serving in Europe. The brave soldier, who also fought at the Battle of the Bulge, was eventually awarded two Purple Hearts, the Bronze Star, two Presidential Unit Citations and the Croix de Guerre. However, his wife Elizabeth knew nothing of his heroics until she came across the famous photo in a magazine years after the war. Bob Noody was a member of 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, one of the most storied regiments of the U.S. Army. He served in the regiment's Fox Company - but it is Easy Company which is the best known of all, thanks to its heroics recorded in the TV series Band of Brothers. The company was involved in many of the key operations which took place towards the end of the Second World War. Drama: The cast of Band of Brothers, which portrayed Easy Company of 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division . Its members took part in the airborne landings in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944, which would long be remembered as D-Day. They also fought in Operation Market Garden, a failed attempt to break through the German lines in September 1944, and in the Siege of Bastogne, part of the Battle of the Bulge. Finally, they helped to capture the 'Eagle's Nest', Hitler's mountain retreat, in the final weeks of the war, one of the totemic victories which helped hasten the German surrender. Easy Company's exploits were dramatised in 2001 by Band of Brothers, a 10-part series produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks.","Bob Noody, 90, featured in historic photograph on the eve of D-Day .

"By . Jill Reilly . and Chris Brooke . The garlic is one thing. And we have learned to put up with the occasional whiff of onions or eye-watering Gitanes. But yesterday France outdid itself in the nose-wrinkling stakes when a cloud of foul-smelling gas drifted across the Channel, leaving swathes of Britain spluttering in disgust. Emergency services were deluged as householders, fearing some sort of environmental disaster was engulfing the country, rang the police, ambulance and fire brigades. Wind: The noxious smell wafted across the Channel this morning after a leak at a chemical factory in Rouen, the historic city of Normandy in north eastern France . But, as they held their noses and . slammed shut their windows, they were told in no uncertain terms that it . wasn’t the end of the world – it was just France. The gas cloud, said to smell of sweat . and rotten eggs, drifted over from a factory in the northern French . city of Rouen and caused an almighty stink as the day went on. After wafting over Sussex, Kent, . Hampshire and Surrey, it made its way north. By the afternoon, it was . causing misery across Oxfordshire and in to the East Midlands. The National Grid, responsible for . the nation’s electricity supply, said it had received an ‘unprecedented’ 100,000 calls by mid-afternoon. The news of the pong’s origins led to some mirth on Twitter. ‘It’s now official, France smells,’ wrote Twitter user Phillip Smith. The gas is thought to have leaked . from a plant run by Lubrizol, a company that makes additives for . industrial lubricants and paint, and is based near Rouen, 75 miles . north-west of Paris. Winds blew the invisible cloud south towards Paris on Monday before it turned back and crossed into England yesterday. Last night experts said the cloud, . made up of methyl mercaptan gas, posed no threat to public health . although it could cause nausea in some people. Mercaptan has a sulphurous smell and . is added to odourless natural gas as a safety precaution. A spokesman . for the Health Protection Agency said: ‘It is not toxic and has also . been diluted before entering the air over England, so people should be . reassured it will cause no harm. ‘It is an unpleasant odour which may cause some people to feel slightly nauseous but it will dispel naturally.’ Lubrizol’s operations director Pierre-Jean Payrouse admitted the gas smelled ‘very bad’. He told French radio that the plant was trying to contain the problem but the cause remained unknown. He said: ‘It’s not so much a leak as a product that has decomposed, which smells very bad and which is escaping. ‘An investigation is under way but our priority is to deal with the problem.’ The cloud was not only a headache for Britain. A French Cup soccer match between . Rouen and Olympique Marseille had to be postponed and some Rouen . residents have complained of migraines. The fire brigade in the county of Kent, warned residents to keep their doors and windows closed due to a gas cloud it believed had come from France and London police said it had reports of an acrid smell in southeast London. Investigation: Workers inspecting the premises of the Lubrizol company in Rouen, western France, where a chemical substance became unstable causing gas odors that are similar to those of town gas . Harmless: Officials at Lubrizol factory in France, which makes additives for industrial lubricants and paint, said the sulphur-like smell was from a harmless additive in natural gas . Noxious smell: As the gas cloud spread across Kent concerned calls came in from residents in Maidstone, Ashford, Dover (pictured)  and Folkestone . London's Metropolitan Police tweeted: 'We are aware of reports of a . strong, noxious, gas-like smell in some South East London boroughs. No . risks to public.' London Fire Brigade tweeted: 'We’ve been called to 25 gas incidents since 10.30am. The rotten egg smell is coming from France but has no risk to public #zutalors' Hastings resident Lucy Parker, 27, said: 'It is totally disgusting and makes you wretch.' Public service: Tweets from the London Fire Brigade about today's smell . Another local, James Boyes, 42, of Dover, Kent, said: 'The smell is just like the worst flatulent person ever standing with their back turned to you. 'It is truly, truly awful and the sooner they plug that leak the better for all concerned. Crew manager Andy Batchelor at Folkestone Fire Station said it had received 30 phone calls between 6.30am and 8.50am from as far as Dover, Lydd and Ashford this morning from members of the public reporting a smell of gas. He added: 'Transco believes there is a gas cloud sitting over south east Kent. 'Dover Coastguard have had reports from the French authorities saying there was a gas leak between Rouen and Paris. 'The prevailing winds have come from that area but it is not yet confirmed that the smell is from that source.' A report on the Kent Fire and Rescue Service website attributed it to the French stink. It . said: 'South Kent residents are being asked to keep doors and windows . closed due to a gas cloud that is believed to have come across from . France, following reports of a gas leak from a factory 75 miles west of . Paris. 'Kent Fire and Rescue Service is aware and liaising with partner agencies.'

"By . Chris Pleasance . The world's first male Liliger cub has been born at a private zoo in Oklahoma, USA. A liliger is the offspring of a male lion and a ligress - which itself is a cross between a male lion and a tigress. The adorable cub and his little sister together make up America's second litter of the rare hybrid animal. Scroll down for video . The world's first male liliger cub (right) has been born in Oklahoma, along with a sister (left). The children are the offspring of a male lion and a female lioness, which is itself the the product of breeding between a lion and a tiger . The are the second set of offspring to come from father Simba and mother Akara, who had another set of cubs in November last year . The little spotted cubs were born in the GW Interactive Zoo in Wynnewood, Oklahoma on May 31st. Their parents are Simba, a male lion and Akara - a female liger who gave birth to America's first liliger cubs in November last year. Zoo president Joe Schreibvogel said: 'One of the biggest purposes of what we're doing here, crossbreeding animals, is to educate the public. 'Crossbred animals do not produce dead offspring or genetically deformed offspring - inbreeding causes that and there is a big difference. 'Crossbred animals are genetically healthier - there has never been a recorded incident of a deformed crossbred baby. Zoo president Joe Schreibvogel (pictured) was keen to stress that the animals are crossbred rather than inbred, which means they will not produce dead or deformed offspring . 'We have researchers keeping track of the DNA and genetics very carefully so we can do this properly - none of this is done artificially. 'This litter proves that genetically hybrid cats are stronger than pure bred cats - and that they originate from the same species or they wouldn't be able to produce healthy offspring.' The liliger cubs weighed approximately 3.5 pounds and were 11.25 inches long. The zoo plans to build a special exhibit of the rare animals, but the new liligers litter will be kept separate from the other cubs for now. Joe added: 'They will be on exhibit in about six to eight weeks - we're excited to see their progress.' In many countries, such as Thailand, breeding rare cats such as lions and tigers is illegal as it does nothing to preserve either species. The offspring serve no purpose and cannot be introduced into the wild, so are usually bred only as a tourist attraction in order to make money for zoos, according to Liger.org. There are several ligers in U.S. zoos, but Oklahoma are the only zoo to breed liligers, a cross between a male lion and a female liger. The gender of the animal decides how the name is formed. While ligers are the mix of male lions and female tigers, tigons are male tigers and female lions. The controversial world of hybrids also includes 'leopons' - the spawn of female leopards and male lions, along with several zebra-horse-donkey zebroids such as zorses, zonkeys, and zonies. Camas are a mix of camels and llamas; grolars and pizzlies are combinations of polar bears and grizzlies; and there are also 'wolphins,' Bottlenose dolphins mated with false killer whales.","Male and female liliger cub born in Oklahoma zoo on May 31 .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A Wisconsin court has suspended a former state prosecutor's license to practice for four months after he allegedly sent a domestic abuse victim a series of racy texts as he prosecuted her attacker. Ken Kratz, who also works as a victims' rights advocate, allegedly made sexual remarks to social workers in actions the state's Supreme Court branded 'appalling'. 'This was exploitative behavior, . harassing behavior, and a crass placement of his personal interests . above those of his client, the State of Wisconsin,' the court wrote in a . collective decision. He was also ordered to pay $23,904 to cover the costs of the disciplinary proceedings. Suspended: Kenneth Kratz, pictured in 2007, is not allowed to practice law for four months because of racy texts he sent to domestic abuse victims. He was previously a DA and now works as a defense attorney . Kratz, who now works as a defense attorney didn't immediately return a message left at his office on Friday, but he argued in court filings he didn't deserve a suspension, saying he has suffered enough. Kratz's 18-year stint as Calumet County district attorney came to an end in 2010 after it emerged that he had sent a barrage of racy text messages to a 25-year-old woman a year earlier. The attorney, who was married at the time but is now divorced and has filed for bankruptcy, sent the messages to the woman, Stephanie Van Groll, while he was prosecuting her ex-boyfriend. Kratz, then 50, called Von Groll - who later identified herself in interviews - a 'hot nymph' and advertised himself as 'the prize' with a $350,000 house and a six-figure salary. Messages: Stephanie Van Groll was stunned when she received the racy texts from the DA . He asked whether she was 'the kind of girl that likes secret contact with an older married elected DA' and told her he wanted her to be 'so hot' and 'treat me so well that you'd be THE woman. R U that good?' She went to police, who referred the case to the state Department of Justice. That agency found Kratz hadn't . committed any crimes but told Kratz he should step aside from the . domestic abuse prosecution and self-report his conduct to the state . Office of Lawyer Regulation. Kratz . removed himself from the case, reported his behavior to the OLR and . agreed to resign as chairman of the state Crime Victims' Rights Board. OLR decided he acted inappropriately but didn't commit any ethical . violations and quietly closed his case in March 2010. An AP story on the case that September set off a firestorm of outrage. Kratz resigned in October 2010 as then-Gov. Jim Doyle began a little-used process to remove him from office. As the story emerged, more women came forward and accused him of making sexual remarks/ . One . social worker said he made a comment about oral sex to her before she . testified in court and later told her he wanted the case to end so he . could go to Las Vegas and have 'big-boobed' women serve him drinks. Another social worker said he told her that he thought a court reporter had big breasts. Moving on: Kratz, who is since divorced but now has a new girlfriend, has shared these photographs on Facebook of his 'new life'. He had argued that the suspension was too strict as he has 'suffered enough' The OLR reopened its case against him and Kratz ultimately filed a no-contest plea to six misconduct charges. The agency recommended the Supreme Court suspend his license for six months. A referee found a four-month suspension would be more appropriate, noting Kratz has never tried to justify his behavior, he was abusing prescription drugs and was seeking treatment for a sex addiction. The Supreme Court agreed with the referee's recommendation. 'The recommended four-month suspension is deserved,' the court wrote. 'In short, whatever his qualities and accomplishments as a lawyer, Attorney Kratz proved himself during the period in question to be sanctionably sophomoric.' Justices Shirely Abrahamson and David Prosser each wrote separately saying the court should review OLR's practices. Prosser also said Kratz, who has filed for bankruptcy, shouldn't have to pay the 'extravagant' costs of the process. He called the costs 'manifestly unfair.' Katz's Facebook page indicates he now has a girlfriend.","Ken Kratz, who was married but is now divorced, sent a domestic abuse victim a series of racy texts in 2010 and she reported him .

"By . David Mccormack . A special education teacher in Philadelphia has been accused of having a sex at least ten times with a 14-year-old student. Stephanie Amato, a teacher at Ethan Allen School, handed herself in to authorities at the Special Victims Unit on Wednesday night. The 30-year-old has been charged with offenses including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor. 'Fun with these kids!': Stephanie Amato, a special education teacher at Ethan Allen Elementary, Philadelphia, has been charged with offenses including statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor . According to the District Attorney’s office, Amato had been engaged in a sexual relationship with the boy during March and April of this year. The alleged encounters happened in her car and at her home. The two were allegedly sending explicit text messages and Amato told him not to tell. Tasha Jamerson, spokeswoman for District Attorney Seth Williams, called the sex ‘consensual,"" according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When the boy's father discovered the relationship, he pulled his son from the school. Stephanie Amato was released early on Thursday after posting 10 percent of bail set at $125,000, according to court records . Amato, 30, has been charged with offenses including involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, statutory sexual assault and corruption of a minor . The child's father, who we are not identifying, spoke exclusively to Action News. 'I was very upset. She took my kid's youth and I really want justice to take care of this woman,' he told WPVI. 'He's not doing too well, he doesn't want to go to school. He feels humiliated, since that happened he changed.' The allegations against Amato were first made in April, said Philadelphia School District spokesman Fernando Gallard. School officials then notified city and school police, and the teacher was removed her from the classroom pending an investigation. Amato, who has been a teacher for six years, was also barred from having contact with her students. On Tuesday she posted several photos on Facebook of her posing with some of her students. One picture is captioned ‘My fav students!!’ 'My fav students!!' On Tuesday Amato posted several photos on Facebook of her posing with some of her students . In another photo - captioned ‘Fun with these kids!’ - Amato is sitting in a car surrounded by four young men. An unnamed source at the school told the Inquirer that Amato would often spend time out of school with groups of her students. She is currently suspended with pay, but after an administrative hearing next week she could lose her pay. Parents were only informed of Amato's arrest through a letter sent home this week. Principal Cassandra Houston said that the district is 'working closely with the Philadelphia Police Department's Special Victims Unit to ensure that a thorough investigation is conducted.' Amato was released early on Thursday after posting 10 percent of bail set at $125,000, according to court records.

Under fire: High School parents were left outraged after watching an awards ceremony by drama teacher Teri Grimes (pictured), which contained swearing and a box of sex toys being presented as a prize . The upset mother vented her anger about Sunday's ceremony in the school hall, which she attended with her 17-year-old daughter, in an email to KOMO News. She said: ‘I sat there with my mouth open in shock and the final straw was when a joke was told on stage about a teacher, a lawyer and a priest on a plane. ‘The plane was going down and the teacher says we have to save the children. The attorney says ""f*** the children!"" and the priest says ""oooh… Do we have time for that???""' The parent, who walked out mid-way . through, added that the ceremony also contained awards for ‘horniest . stud’ and ‘horniest girl’, for which the prize was what appeared to be a . box of sex toys.

"By . Bianca London . The Best Song Ever truly was that for Sarah Turnbull when her waters broke during One Direction's gig last week. The 28-year-old was 39 weeks pregnant and thought she was having a small accident during the 1D sell out concert and stayed until the very end of the show. Little did she know that her waters had broken at the start of the concert and her baby boy decided to make his entrance into the world right in the middle of the gig at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland. New arrival: Sarah Turnbull went into labour at a One Direction concert at the Stadium of Light, Sunderland, last week, pictured with new son Thomas, daughter Emma, 7, and husband Peter . Sarah finally realised what was going on during the fireworks finale when One Direction's hit 'Best Song Ever' was playing when she popped to the toilet. Six hours later she gave birth to Thomas Setterfield, exactly one week earlier than her due date, in the early hours of May 29 after the gig the night before. Sarah and her partner Peter, 29, who works in the building industry, even considered naming him Harry after her daughter, seven-year-old Emma's favourite 1D member, Harry Styles. However, they finally settled on Thomas after Peter's grandfather. Admin Assistant Sarah said: 'I was determined to go to the concert even though I was heavily pregnant. I bought the tickets over a year ago for my little girl's birthday and I wasn't even expecting then. Family: Though the heavily pregnant 28-year-old felt a little discomfort during last week's Stadium of Light concert, she didn't realise her waters had broken until the fireworks finale . Newborn: Six hours after the concert finished, she gave birth to son Thomas Setterfield, who weighed in at just over 7 lbs . A few hours earlier: Sarah Turnbull with daughter Emma at their home in Glebe, Washington before they set off to the One Direction concert . 'Emma was desperate to go and when I surprised her she was over the moon as they are her favourite band. 'To be honest, I admit that I quite like One Direction but obviously went because she is obsessed with them. 'I felt fine on the day and even went to see the midwife who told me there was no signs of the baby being ready to come and that everything seemed normal, so I was completely shocked when I realised what was happening. 'My partner can't stand One Direction but we both actually quite liked the name Harry. Eventually we decided it was more sentimental to name him after Pete's grandad. Welcome to the world! Sarah can't wait to be able to tell Thomas about his dramatic arrival - she nearly named him Harry . Is he already a 1D fan? Sarah's family say that Thomas obviously mustn't have been able to stand the racket any longer so decided to enter the world . 'We could have given him that as a middle name, but had already decided on Christopher.' Sarah assumed that the baby was pressing on to her bladder and she had never experienced her waters breaking with her first child so was completely oblivious. She had no idea that her constant need for the bathroom was the beginning of her six hour labour. Sarah, from Glebe in Washington, said: 'My aim in the pregnancy was to get past seeing One Direction so I feel like I've achieved that even though Thomas cut it very close. 'I keep thinking that he must really like One Direction's songs and that's why he came early, he just wanted to be out and to listen to them and party with us. 'The rest of my family seem to disagree and say that Thomas obviously mustn't have been able to stand the racket any longer! 'I can't wait to be able to tell Thomas about his dramatic arrival. I'll definitely be making him listen to all of One Direction's songs when he is old enough. 'Even if he doesn't like them, I'm sure his big sister will make sure that he knows all of the songs off by heart!' Hello, brother! Little Emma has had quite the week, seeing her favourite pop group and meeting her new baby brother .","Sarah Turnbull's waters broke during gig in Sunderland .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Jason Belmonte, 30, has taken to Youtube to show-off a range of bowling tricks . A video of Australia's number one bowler, Jason Belmonte, showcasing some incredible tricks has blown the minds of viewers who have sent the video viral. With over two million views in less than a week, the video shows the 30-year-old professional achieve the impossible after teaming up with a Youtube comedy group Dude Perfect. The video starts with an impressive double strike, where the bowler from Orange in New South Wales, aims a ball high over 12 pins stacked on top of each other before hitting the conventionally arranged pins. Both sets of pins come tumbling down together. But the group moved far beyond the conventional bowling alley to showcase the bowler's amazing talent. Mr Belmonte and the group soon moved outside to a skate park to see what they could accomplish. Astonishingly, with only one roll of the ball, Mr Belmonte bowled the ball down a ramp, up and over a second ramp before it came up a third and final ramp – knocking down a number of pins stacked together. Scroll down for video . The professional bowler teamed up with Youtube sensation, Dude Perfect, to make a video showcasing his amazing skills . Setting up the scene: The video has since gone viral with over two million views in less than a week . Double strike! Mr Belmonte threw a bowling ball over a wall of 12 pins  before hitting the conventionally arranged pins just behind. With one throw, both sets of pins come tumbling down . 'Normal bowlers use one hand, I use two,' the bowler who plays on the US PBA Tour said of his unique 'shovel' technique. 'Double the power, double the spin.' Mr Belmonte's 'shovel' is a world first, with bowlers before him only ever using one hand in the sport. Numerous times within the video, the pro bowler even lined up his friends to lie down with their heads in the lane, with one saying: 'In Jason's words, it is literally impossible for him to hit me right here.' Luckily, or rather through a lot of skill, Jason’s words rang true, with the ball whizzing straight past them and hitting, yep you guessed it – a clean strike. Taking it one step further: The group then moved outside to a local skate park to see what tricks they could come up with . With only one roll, Mr Belmonte bowled the ball down a ramp, up and over a second ramp before it came up a third and final ramp, knocking down a bunch of pins . But one of the most impressive tricks showcased in the video was what Jason calls the 'flying eagle'. Setting up two lanes with one pin in each of the furtherst corners, Jason directs the bowing ball at a third pin in the left lane. Hitting the middle pin at the exact the right angle, the ball continues on to hit one pin, while the centre pin flies across the second lane to knock down the third. The group even successfully attempted what they believed to be 'the world’s longest strike'. Growing up in his parent's bowling alley, Mr Belmonte said he began bowling from the young age of only 18 months. By 16, he had won the under 18's National Masters and since then has won 20 medals all over the world. The Flying Eagle: Set up across two lanes with one pin in each of the furthers corners, Jason managed to hit another strike by hitting a third pin at just the right angle, sending it flying across the lane to knock down another pin . So precise, Mr Belmonte gets his friends to line up in a row to prove his incredible accuracy .","Jason Belmonte's Bowling Trick Shots video went viral in less than a week .

"By . Louise Cheer . Locals in a quiet country town have paid homage to the humble pumpkin by holding their annual festival to celebrate the vegetable they credit for saving them from a devastating drought. Residents of Goomeri in south-east Queensland, population 450, have taken part in a series of events involving the locally grown produce including pumpkin shotput, pumpkin bowls and the blue riband event of pumpkin rolling, which involves competitors hurling the orange food stuff down a steep hill in the centre of town. For the last weekend in May, the number of people in the normally sleepy truck stop swells to 14,000 as competitors flock from as far afield as Europe and other parts of Australia to join in the Goomeri Pumpkin Festival. Scroll down for video . Competitor Alex Banks gets ready to roll at the Great Australian Pumpkin Roll during the weekend's Goomeri Pumpkin Festival . Young entrants show off their rolling chops at the festival that features pumpkin-related activities . Celebrations - which began in 1997 to bring the community together after a devastating drought - culminate in the annual pumpkin roll, which has been dubbed Australia's version of England's centuries-old cheese rolling contest in Gloucestershire. Roads are closed and spectators watch from behind barriers as the vegetable is tossed down Hodge Street. There is no one more dedicated to the roll than Goomeri resident Margaret Geritz who was born on the street where the event is held. 'It's our eighteenth (festival), I missed the first one but I'm rolling my 17th time,' the 83-year-old said. The 450-person population of Goomeri grows to 14,000 at the festival that started in 1997 - to help local businesses who were heavily impacted by the drought . A casualty of the roll down Policeman's Hill. Police close roads to cater for the competition . Ms Geritz said she kept up the tradition because it was a lot of fun. The festival's success has come as a surprise to its co-ordinator Trish McArthur. Her daughter, Mandy McArthur - who is also on the organising committee - said her mum had eaten her words since the festival's popularity. Tens of thousands of spectators stand behind barriers to ensure no injuries or interference . Roads are closed off to make sure the pumpkins have a safe passage down the hill . 'It started out because we were in a really bad drought and had a couple of think tank meetings as to how we could get people into Goomeri as businesses weren't doing well with the drought,' Mandy said. 'There was a Canadian lady here who was rolling pumpkins down the hill to feed her cattle and she suggested we should have a pumpkin festival and Mum actually said 'it won't work'. 'In the first year we had about 30 stalls and 800 people turn up. Now that has grown to our maximum of 250 stalls and 14,000 people. Mum's eating her words a bit.' The event's popularity, in part, is due to the efforts of more than 120 volunteers. Some helped slice and dice half a tonne of the vegetable for the well-guarded secret pumpkin soup recipe - only available on the day. One of the events at the festival include the Giant Pumpkin Competition . As its name suggests, pumpkins are the theme of the weekend held at Goomeri in south-east Queensland .","The festival was started in 1997 after the town was crippled by drought .

"By . Snejana Farberov . In 14 short months, Texas teacher Roni Tarver went from size 22 to size 6 after shedding 100lbs - and all thanks to the power of dance with a dash of self-discipline. Tarver, 29, teaches agriculture science and lives in Hurst, Texas, with her husband of two years, Tom. Just over a year ago, the 5-foot-6 woman weighed 235lbs and was suffering from chronic lower back pain, which she medicated with 15 ibuprofen tablets a day. 'I cried every time I went shopping for clothes because I kept having to buy bigger sizes,' she wrote online. Extreme makeover: In a matter of 14 months, Texas teacher Roni Tarver went from size 22 (left) to size 6 (right) Heavy load: Tarver, pictured left and right with her husband, Tom, started out weighing 235lbs and suffering from chronic lower back pain . Speaking to CNN this week, Mrs Tarver said what made the situation even worse is that her husband never remarked on her drastic weight gain, which left her feeling guilty about letting herself go. One night in November 2012, Tarver was crying herself to sleep when she made the decision to turn her life around and lose weight. The next day, the high school teacher got down to work tracking her caloric intake, walking and riding a stationary bike. A couple of months later, Tarver mustered enough courage to go to a local gym, where she discovered Zumba - an increasingly popular form of exercise that incorporates dance and aerobics. Not before long, the gym's fitness room that hosted dance classes became her second home where Tarver spent most evenings cutting a rug to the sounds of Latin beats. ‘You really feel like you're in a club, dancing with people, but you don't have a hangover in the morning,’ she described the fitness regimen to the cable news network. Let's dance: Determined to get in shape, the 29-year-old high school teacher (right) discovered Zumba - a fitness regimen combining dancing with exercise . Incredible shrinking woman: Traver spent most evenings cutting a rug to the sounds of Latin beats - and watching the pounds melt away . A daughter of an aerobics dance instructor, Tarver took to Zumba like a fish to water. After 10 exhausting but productive months, her instructors at the gym suggested that Tarver should get certified and teach classes herself. Roni Tarver followed through, and for the past four months she has been teaching Zumba at the Fitness 200 gym in North Richland Hills. In an effort to get healthy, the 29-year-old also quit smoking and radically changed her eating habits, shunning fast food and all dairy - which was the hardest part of the process since she loved cheese. With the help of a calorie counter app she downloaded on her smartphone, Tarver monitored her food consumption, making sure her daily intake does not exceed 1,700 calories. Most days, her menu featured fruits and vegetables, a breakfast protein shake and a low-calorie frozen dinner. Success story: By the time Roni Traver (right) was done, she managed to lost 100lbs off her 5-foot-6 frame . Her weekly cheat meal of choice was two bacon and egg taquitos from a national fast food chain. When Roni Tarver set out on her quest for a slimmer body, she tipped the scales at 235lbs and wore size 22 pants. Just over a year later, the agriculture teacher slimmed down to 135lbs and was buying size 6 clothes. For her husband, Tom Tarver, a dispatcher at a valet service, Roni has always been beautiful, but he says her weight loss has made his wife healthier and happier. On her Facebook page Tuesday, Roni Tarver wrote that some people commenting on her story on CNN's website have been extremely cruel, but she was pleasantly surprised to discover that women she has never met were quick to come to her defense. 'It's a great day to be a woman,' she gushed.","Roni Tarver, 29, a teacher from Texas, started out weighing 235lbs and wearing size 22 pants .

A lonely middle-aged woman who became obsessed with a 15-year-old boy who she met at school before inviting him to do gardening work at her home has been spared a jail term for having sex with him. Kylie Fiona Henry, 40, was acquitted in November of raping the boy in her Adelaide home in April 2011, but was found guilty  of the less serious charge of unlawfully having sexual intercourse with him by a jury at the South Australian District Court. On Friday, Judge Paul Cuthbertson suspended a two year jail term and placed the former school canteen manager on a three-year good behaviour bond with conditions including she undertake 230 hours of community service. Kylie Fiona Henry, 40, received a two year suspended jail sentence on Friday despite admitting to unlawfully having sexual intercourse with a 15-year-old boy at her Adelaide home in 2011 . Henry was 38 when she slept with the victim, who was sleeping over at her home with his younger sisters who had befriended Henry's children. 'You were entrusted with the complainant's safety that night by his mother and used the opportunity to satisfy your own sexual desires,' Judge Cuthbertson said. 'You were in the position of parent. He was staying in your house with the permission of his mother.' More...

Monster of a mother: A birth control pioneer, she was revered as a parenting guru. But Marie Stopes treated her son, who died this week, with abominable cruelty . The victim had told the court Henry, a mother of three, had robbed him of his first sexual encounter and the incident had left him scared and confused. 'I felt ill. I can't trust women and I hate them,' he said. The court heard that Henry had first met the boy when he was in primary school. The court heard how Henry became obsessed with the boy after the incident, visiting his home nearly every day over the next three months . She then began a conversation with the boy's mother when he returned to the school to watch his younger sisters play sport, which led the boy to be invited to her house for some gardening work. After the incident, Henry became obsessed with the boy, visiting his home nearly every day over the next three months, the judge said. Henry's utterances to a friend on Facebook 'made it perfectly clear, you were obsessed with him and had a sexual interest'. 'You now admit your defence was an utter concoction,'Judge Cuthbertson added. She told the jury she did not have sex with the boy, but did have a passionate dream about them having sex. Kylie Fiona Henry's lawyer said her client's behaviour was not pre-meditated but had been an 'appalling lack of judgment'. Henry was a lonely, single mother, who suffered from low self-esteem, Judge Cuthbertson said. 'In some respects, you are a person to be pitied - life has not dealt you a good hand,' he said.","Kylie Fiona Henry avoided 2 years' jail despite having sex with 15-year-old .

"By . Associated Press . Secretary of State John Kerry has connected with relatives while in France and commemorated the 70th anniversary of D-Day in the small French seaside town that's home to his family's ancestral estate. A day after attending international ceremonies to mark the allied invasion of France in Normandy, Kerry traveled to Saint-Briac-sur-Mer in the neighboring province of Brittany, where his mother's family has long owned property. Kerry's connection to the town comes not through property alone but also through blood: his first cousin Brice Lalonde lives in the village and he was at Kerry's side throughout the Saturday ceremony. Scroll down for video . Paying respects: Secretary of State John Kerry lays a wreath at a monument dedicated to the three American soldiers who died in the effort to defend the seaside city of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer during WWII . Connection: Kerry's mother's family has had property in the town for a long time and he has cousins who live in the area (pictured Saturday) Lalonde is a former Green Party candidate for the French presidency. Three U.S. soldiers were killed during the liberation of the town in August, 1944, and Kerry placed a wreath at a monument 'To the Americans' that overlooks the harbor. In remarks later at the town hall, Kerry paid tribute to the soldiers and to the people of Saint Briac. He credited them with helping to save heirlooms from his family's estate, Les Essarts. The Nazis had turned the estate into their local headquarters during the occupation and destroyed it as allied troops approached after D-Day, June 6, 1944. Kerry, who first visited Les Essarts after the war when he was 4, told a crowd gathered for Saturday's ceremony that he remembered almost nothing being left of the house, 'just a stone staircase to the sky and an old, brick chimney.' Family ties: Kerry's first cousin Brice Lalonde (foreground) lives in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer and attended the ceremony with him on Saturday morning along with the town's mayor Vincent Denby-Wilkes (right) Reunion: The last time Kerry visited the area was when he was 4-years-old . 'I can still hear the sound of the rubble and broken glass that was crunching under our shoes as we walked through what used to be her house,' he said from the mayor's balcony. He was flanked by American and French flags and blowups of the famous 'Kiss of Liberation' photograph depicting a U.S. sergeant kissing a young French girl in Saint Briac as the town celebrated the end of Nazi occupation. The photographer, Tony Vaccaro, who was private in the unit, was present at the event. The mayor announced that the town hall was being named after Vaccaro, who cried when he heard the news. Les Essarts was rebuilt in 1954 in an effort that Kerry said was symbolic of the strength and resolve of France to rebuild after the war. Greetings: Kerry attended the official international D-Day ceremony in Normandy on Friday alongside President Obama and other world leaders before he went to the small seaside Breton village . With the locals: In remarks later at the town hall, Kerry paid tribute to the soldiers and to the people of Saint Briac . 'In a sense, that represents the story of France,' he said. 'Certainly this country saw tragedy during World War II as very few others did. But France rebuilt itself, brick by brick, and today she is as strong as ever,' Kerry told the crowd. 'To me, Saint Briac's World War II legacy isn't just about loss and destruction,' he said. 'It's a legacy of strength. It's a legacy of solidarity. Ultimately, it's a legacy of good prevailing over evil — of freedom prevailing over tyranny.'","Kerry attended the international D-Day ceremony on Friday in Normandy but then went to a seaside town where his family has roots on Saturday .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Michael Zennie . A friend of the 26-year-old gunman who opened fire on a Seattle university says the shooter is a' sweet kid' but is haunted by his struggle with addiction.

"By . Associated Press . Police in suburban Phoenix have arrested a married couple on suspicion of child abuse, accusing them of severely malnourishing two adopted daughters and forcing them to sleep in a backyard tent either nude or only in a diaper. According to Peoria police, the 13-year-old and 11-year-old girls also were subjected to strict punishment that included hour-long running sessions and memorization of Bible verses. Kimery Lynn Jorg, the girls' 53-year-old adoptive mother, said that the abuse was intended to 'train' the girls and teach them to be 'loving and nurturing'. Kimery and her husband Johann Glenn Jorg, 61, appeared Thursday night before a judge who set bond at $100,000 each. Horrible: Kimery Jorg (left) and her husband Johann (right) have been arrested for abusing and starving two of their adopted daughters and regularly beating them as punishment for minor slights . Child Protective Services visited the home May 30 and alerted  authorities after finding both girls emaciated. Officials said the 13-year-old, who was 4 feet 11 inches, appeared to weigh only 60 pounds. Aside from being underfed, the teen had abnormal growths on her legs and blisters on her feet from excessive exercise. She also had 'leathering' skin consistent with repeated beatings, according to a police statement filed in court. The teen was immediately hospitalized for severe malnutrition and local station KPTV reported that the girl's condition was similar to that of a 'concentration camp survivor'. The 11-year-old girl underwent a medical exam. Officials with Child Protective Services said an 8-year-old girl and 7-year-old girl also were removed from the home but authorities said they appeared healthy as the couple apparently favored them. Police said all four girls lived in abusive environments before being adopted by the Jorgs. Kimery Jorg told police she wanted to expose the two older girls to prison-like conditions for lying or stealing. When asked by police what the girls had stolen to prompt such punishment, the parents had difficulty recalling specific items but said that on a trip to Canada, 22 items went missing in their relative's house and Kimery Jorg blamed the girls. Deceptive: The family's home in Peoria, Arizona (pictured) would not suggest the horrible abuse that the young girls suffered, which included being swatted on the buttocks with a wooden paddle or having apple cider vinegar sprayed in their mouths . She also mentioned the theft of a single Mentos breath mint as another offense. The 13- and 11-year-old were forced to use a bucket and brown bags as a toilet. They were given diapers to wear as a reward for good behavior, police said. The 13-year-old had to sleep in a tent and had her hair shaved as discipline, police said. The two girls were fed 'prison food' of oatmeal, prunes or grits and salsa. Unjustifiable: Kimery Jorg said that her adopted daughters stole from her but when asked what they took, she could only recall a single Mento breathment being stolen . According to police, the couple thought their treatment was justified. Punishments included getting swatted on the buttocks with a wooden paddle or having apple cider vinegar sprayed in their mouths, police said. The number of times they were hit or sprayed was equivalent to their years of age. The girls also were forced to run outside in the heat for an hour and write and recite Bible verses. The running reportedly would go longer if any mistakes were found in the verses. The girls, who were home-schooled, also were forced to run outside in the heat for an hour and write and recite Bible verses. The running reportedly would go longer if any mistakes were found in the verses. Neighbor Jodi Brackett said all four girls appeared fine in a Christmas card family portrait in December. But she realizes now she hardly ever saw the two older girls, while she frequently saw the two younger girls riding their bicycles. 'I kept forgetting they had two other girls,' Brackett said. Brackett described Kimery Jorg as cordial and said the Jorgs once offered neighbors leftover food from a wedding. 'She was very nice — no red flag or anything,' Brackett said.","Kimery, 53, and Johann Jorg, 61, have been arrested after police found their two eldest adopted daughters emaciated and abused .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . Toronto Mayor Rob Ford 'appeared intoxicated' and invited an unidentified woman into his office for an hour when City Hall was closed for a public holiday just days before he entered rehab, according to a security report released Friday. The City Hall report, released Friday after a freedom of information request, said Ford was 'slurring his words, red in the face, and sweating profusely' when he asked a security guard to 'bring her up' just before 8 p.m. on April 21, Easter Monday. The report said the woman left Ford's office after an hour. Having trouble? Rob Ford is seen getting into a vehicle in this security camera footage from Easter Monday . 'Stumbling': the mayor's feet can be seen moving in the video. His brother Doug Ford has called the movements 'muscle spasms' from lifting weights . Ford remains in rehab for alcohol addiction after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack. Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials. That was just one of many public incidents of bad behavior that led the City Council to strip him of most of his powers. The mayor had become an international sensation, with late-night TV comedians in the U.S. repeatedly skewering him. The City Hall security report from April 21 said that Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and a city councilor, arrived later at City Hall and escorted his brother and a different security guard to the parking garage. 'The mayor can be seen stumbling and even falling on the ground before being seated in the vehicle,' the report states. Security footage shows Doug Ford in the driver's seat. Doug Ford attributed his brother's behavior to 'muscle spasms' that night. 'He had muscle spasms in his legs but that is about as far as I saw,' Ford said in an interview with the Toronto Sun. 'He was bench pressing a lot of weight and it was ripping up his legs and [he was] just trying to stretch his legs out to get the spasms away,' Doug added. 'He could barely even walk because they were so sore.' Mystery woman: the unidentified guest of Rob Ford, seen in this file photo, is 'a friend of the family' according to his brother . Doug told the paper the woman was 'a friend of the family.' 'It wasn’t some mysterious woman, I know her very well, Renata [Ford] knows her very well, Rob knows her very well,' Ford said to the Sun. 'There is no big secret about a woman showing up. I love how they twist everything it is just staggering.' Doug Ford didn't return messages to the Associated Press seeking comment. The Globe and Mail newspaper reported in late April that it viewed a second video of Ford smoking what appears to be crack cocaine in his sister's basement days before he entered rehab. The Toronto Sun said that it had obtained an audio recording of Ford making offensive remarks about other politicians at a bar a few nights later. Ford has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in October elections. His decision to seek treatment comes months after he announced he was finished with alcohol — only to have steady reports of more intoxicated behavior emerge. Doug Ford has said he expects his brother to return to the campaign by June 30.","Ford was 'slurring his words, red in the face, and sweating profusely' as he asked a security guard to have the woman brought to his office on Easter Monday .

"By . Associated Press . A Pennsylvania police officer who made headlines when he won a $1 million Powerball drawing last month has been suspended because of the alleged actions of his wife. Rankin Officer Matthew Brown is named in a criminal complaint charging his wife with working as a scheduler for a prostitution business. Their defense attorney David Shrager insist officer Brown and his wife, Jennifer, have done nothing wrong. Charged: The police officer Michael Brown who bought a $1 million Powerball ticket is named in a police complaint against his wife, Jennifer Brown, who faces charges, including promoting prostitution . Sordid site: Jennifer Brown allegedly was involved with 69 Entertainment and ran the daily operations as one of the schedulers of the agency. her police officer husband was a driver and worked as security . Shrager says the business in question provides 'bachelor party services', not prostitution. 'They're denying these charges. Certainly, I have not seen any evidence that would allow me to believe that there is enough for him to be charged,' said Mr Shrager. The officer, who has not been charged, is nonetheless named as being a driver and working security for the business. Jennifer Brown is charged with conspiracy to promote prostitution – a felony – and other counts, through an Internet site called sixtynineentertainment.com. Among ads for lap dances and strip teases, court documents say the adult entertainment agency posted Internet ads on Pittsburgh Backpage Escort, a site where prostitutes solicit customers. The complaint said the website is 'known by law enforcement as a site where known female, male and transsexual prostitutes post ads soliciting for customer/johns.' Suspended: Officer Brown applied last year for a job as a part-time police officer in Rankin and joined the department in November . Jennifer Brown's attorney, David Shrager, said his client has pleaded not guilty, and that the case lacks evidence and they're waiting for their day in court. Investigators said employees told them Jennifer Brown served as the scheduler who ran daily operations with Matthew Brown working as a driver. Police Chief Ryan Wooten says he’s taken Brown off the schedule until he and borough council decide what to do with the officer. 'It's surprising, very surprising. I wasn't aware of this,' said Rankin Police Chief Ryan Wooten to Action 4 News. Wooten said he hired Matthew Brown about a year ago before Brown's name showed up in the police complaint against his wife. Benefit of the doubt: Rankin Police Chief Wooten believes his officer will be proven innocent of any involvement but is suspending Brown until the investigation is completed . 'I mean, I did his background check. I'm going to say that's unfounded. You're going to have the good and bad. He's blessed with a lot of money. So someone is going to throw something negative in there, and that's the negative part,' said Wooten. Even if he is struck off, financially the Brown family will not be suffering financially after their recent windfall. Brown won the lottery back in May after playing the Powerball. He spent $6 on three Quick Picks and didn't realize he had won until a few days later. 'At first, I didn't believe it. I thought someone was playing a joke on me,' he told the lottery. After checking the ticket at the store, he called his wife, Jennifer, to tell her the news. 'She thought I was joking and hung up on me,' he said.","Officer Matthew Brown won the lottery but his wife, Jennifer, is charged with being involved with a website that promotes prostitution .

On Friday, a judge found probable cause to hold the 26-year-old without bail. Speaking to KING5, Ybarra's friend Jason Wells described the 26-year-old as a 'good kid' who was 'dislodged from reality,' at least in part due to his alcohol problem. 'He would say, ""I’m going to kill everyone,""' Wells said. 'I never took him seriously.' The Seattle Times reported that according to police, Ybarra had a fascination with mass shootings, particularly with the 1999 Columbine High School massacre. In . a statement filed in court, Seattle police wrote that Ybarra admitted . to detectives after his arrest that he wanted to kill as many people as . possible and then himself. Instead, . police say 26-year-old Jon Meis, a student building monitor, . pepper-sprayed and tackled Ybarra as he reloaded his shotgun with the . help of other students who were nearby. Students at Seattle Pacific University say Meis saved countless lives when he sprang into action Thursday afternoon. Meis, an engineering student, is engaged to be married and has 'everything to live for' friends said. But he risked his life and ended the murderous rampage. 'I'm proud of the selfless actions that my roommate, Jon Meis, showed today taking down the shooter. He is a hero,' tweeted Matt Garcia. Shooting suspect Aaron Ybarra, left, is led in chains to a court hearing at a King County Jail courtroom Friday, June 6, 2014, in Seattle . Unstable: Ybarra has longstanding mental problems and is now on suicide watch in jail . Classmate Briana Clarke told the Seattle Times that Meis, who was on duty as a hall monitor, sprayed the attacker in the face, grabbed him around the neck and then wrestled him to the ground. 'There were a lot of shells on the ground..it looked like he was planning to go the distance and Jon stopped him,' another student told KOMO-TV. Several other students then piled on the attacker and held him until police arrived. 'But . for the great response for the people at Seattle Pacific this incident . would have been much more tragic,' assistant police chief Paul McDonagh . said Thursday night. One of Meis' roommates, Ryan Salgado, told The Seattle Times he . seemed to be in shock afterward. A spokeswoman at Seattle's Harborview . Medical Center said Friday Meis wasn't injured, but was suffering from . mental anguish and was treated and released Thursday. Paul Lee was shot in the head and died at a nearby . hospital. Sarah Williams was struck in the neck and remains . in critical condition. Two . other students, Thomas Fowler and another man in his 20s, were wounded . but are in stable condition after sustaining minor injuries. Lee hailed from Portland, Oregon, and was a graduate of Westview High School. The 19-year-old’s grieving friends took to Twitter to express their disbelief at his violent and untimely death. ‘Paul . Lee. I can't even believe you're gone. Ante up, math class, and just . seeing you around campus and dancing with you brightened my life . immeasurably. I am blessed and honored to have known you. You will live . on through all of us and I expect you to teach us your dance from heaven . at 6pm tonight,’ Sarrah Rasmussen commented on Instagram.

His favorite pastime was dancing, and he belonged to several hip hop dance clubs in Portland and Seattle. 'Paul Lee was a ray of light in my classroom for three years,' Westview Japanese teacher Brian Bangerter said in a statement. 'It was impossible be around him and not feel happy. Everyone who knew him felt close to him.  He will always be remembered for his infectious positive attitude.  I know I will never forget him.' The gunman has been identified as Aaron Ybarra. Authorities say he is not a student and has no connection to Seattle Pacific University or to any of his victims. Detectives are still trying to determine why he targeted the college. KING-TV reports that Ybarra lives with his parents in the Seattle area. He has reportedly confessed to the . shootings and even bragged about the carnage he inflicted on the campus. Authorities say he did not expect to survive the rampage. His Facebook page says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness and attended Edmonds Community College prior to 2012. In the panic, police believed there was a . second shooter and searched for up to an hour, possibly delaying . medical attention for the wounded, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports. 'Hero': Jon Meis, 26, is being credited with stopping a murderous rampage when the gunman stopped to re-load . Ybarra, 26, says he is a former janitor at LA Fitness.

This sparked the ire of some residents, who believed that Buzi was attempting to scam them. 'Real-estate agents obviously don't like me buying right from the seller' Buzi told Palo Alto Online in a 2012 article. In addition to this business, Buzi is also listed as involved with multiple other enterprises. This includes an entity called the Pantera Group, listed as doing business in Redwood City, California. The business is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau, and results show up for it on sites like RipoffReport.com. In the late 90s, Buzi pushed a CD called 'How to Make Big Money on the Internet.'

"Suspect: Dennis Marx was shot dead as he arrived at court with an assault rifle . A former TSA employee, armed with homemade bombs and an assault rifle, was shot dead on Friday as he tried to enter an Atlanta, Georgia courthouse. Amateur video shot from a construction site across the road shows the gun battle between Marx and police officers. Dennis Marx had been due in court Friday morning to plead guilty in a drug case. He arrived at the courthouse wearing body armor in a rented SUV with both homemade and commercially made explosives, zip ties, water and other gear. He dropped homemade spike strips and used smoke devices in an effort to keep officers from reaching him, said Forsyth County Sheriff Duane Piper. Authorities were familiar with Marx, who had booby-trapped his home about 40 miles northeast of Atlanta when officers came to arrest him in the past. Bomb squads were carefully checking his home in a wooded area, fearing he may have set explosive traps around the property. Dennis Marx, a self-proclaimed Sovereign Citizen, is believed to have been plotting to take hostages at the courthouse, where he had been due to attend a hearing on drug and weapons charges. Deputy Daniel Rush, who was shot in the leg by the gunman, is being hailed a hero after he prevented Marx from gaining access to the building. Full-frontal attack: Dennis Marx's white van can be seen stopped in front of the courthouse building as the smoke bomb he set off begins to detonate . Tense: The smoke cloud grows as shots are fired and more law enforcement officers begin to descend on the scene . Fast response: It took the SWAT just 37 seconds to arrive on the scene. Marx was shot dead a short time later . Marx, who had links to an anti-government group, had arrived at the court building wearing a bullet proof vest and gas mask, and carrying weapons. When he pulled up in his car, the 48-year-old threw out spiked stop strips to prevent vehicles from reaching him. Deputy Daniel Rush confronted Marx, who was shot dead as he approached Forsyth County court at 9am ET. Before he was shot dead, Marx shot through his windshield, striking Deputy Rush in the lower leg. He also let off smoke grenades and pepper spray. Deputy Rush, who is being treated in hospital for his injuries, has been hailed a hero for stopping what police believe was an attempted hostage situation. Scroll down for video . WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Aftermath: A Georgia Bureau of Investigation worker passes by the rented SUV used by accused Forsyth County Courthouse shooter Dennis Marx . Bitter end: Marx had driven up to the courthouse and threw out smoke devices and homemade spike strips to prevent officers from reaching him. He was shot dead at the scene . Danger: Dennis Marx, seen in this undated photo, had arrived at the court building wearing a bullet proof vest and gas mask, and carrying weapons . Hero: Deputy Daniel Rush is credited with saving the day by confronting Marx before he could reach the court . Search: Members of a SWAT team swarm over the courthouse after the confrontation with Marx on Friday . Blocked off: Police cordon off roads surrounding the court house as detectives search for explosives . Forsyth . County Sheriff Duane Piper said Marx had arrived at the courthouse . armed with an assault rifle, homemade explosives, water supplies and zip . ties. 'He came for the purpose of occupying the courthouse,' Sheriff Piper told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'It would be a guess to think how many lives [the deputy] saved had he not engaged him right there. 'Mr Marx’s intention was to get inside that front door and to take hostages.' 'We don't know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him ... we have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse.' Sheriff Piper described the attempted attack as a 'frontal assault' on the court house, and said Marx and Deputy Rush were involved in a gun fight before Marx died. 'From the video, it looks like [Marx] saw that deputy, swerved to try and run over the deputy. The deputy engaged him. He was shooting at Mr Marx in the vehicle, Mr Marx was shooting through the windshield at the deputy,' Sheriff Piper added. Quick thinking: Deputy Rush was shot in the lower leg as he confronted Marx when the gunman headed towards the court building . Road block: Police use their cars to block access to the courtroom . A woman who had been acting as Marx's attorney in his forthcoming drug and weapons case, told WSB-TV she had withdrawn from his case yesterday. She claimed she had asked the 48-year-old gun trader to undergo a psychological evaluation, but that he refused. A SWAT team that had been on its way to a different call, were able to reach the courthouse quickly and secure the area. Ann Shafer, another attorney due to represent Marx at his drug hearing, said he had been due in court this morning, but failed to turn up. After waiting 40 minutes for her client, who she described as 'slightly unstable', Shafer left by the back exit, and heard the gun shots. 'I feel very lucky that I walked out the back of the courthouse instead of the front,' she told 11 Alive, adding that she immediately suspected Marx was behind the gunfire. Bomb-sniffing . dogs have been brought to the crime scene over concerns that an . explosive device could have been planted near the building. Response: Heavily armed members of the Sheriff's department clear the scene after Deputy Rush was shot in the leg . Marx was known to police, who said that his links to Sovereign Citizen groups had made them wary that a bomb may have been left. He worked for the Transportation Security Administration for at least a year, from 2002, an official told CNN. Deputies are also searching for explosives and booby traps at the house Marx had been living in for the past ten days. A no-fly zone has been put in effect near his Cummings residence, and explosives specialists have not yet entered the house, which police have described as 'a bomb'. The . Sovereign Citizen movement he claimed to be a part of began in the 1970s, and is made up of groups . who believe all branches of the U.S. government are illegal. Some members have been linked to the murder of police officers. Marx . had previously tried to make an official Second Amendment Complaint . against Forsyth County sheriff's office and SWAT teams. In court documents filed in August last year, Marx made 'sweeping' allegation against members of the police force over their use of search warrants, 'Yet he does not allege a specific example to support this claim or any of his other claims'. After the shooting, surrounding buildings and a nearby construction site around the Atlanta courthouse were evacuated, and a police officer could be seen patrolling the roof of the courthouse. Relief: An officer is hugged as he attends the scene of the shooting outside the courthouse . Investigation: The sheriff's department searched the area around the courthouse, above, and the home of Marx who was suspected of leaving explosive devices . Shooting: Police cars surround Atlanta courthouse on Friday morning after a masked gunman shot a sheriff's deputy . Abandoned: A SUV with three of its doors open was spotted at the steps of the courthouse shortly after the shooting . An abandoned SUV, with three of its doors open, could be seen in aerial footage of the courthouse. It appeared as if it had driven across a flower bed before coming to a stop. It is not yet clear if it is connected to the incident. Deputy Rush, who has served on the force for 25 years, was taken to hospital for a gunshot wound to his lower leg. A few hours after the shooting he posted a message on Facebook stating simply: 'I am ok.' He has been praised widely for his actions in quickly bringing to an end what could have been a potentially devastating situation. Friends, family and supporters took to social media sites to thank Deputy Rush for his selfless actions, and to wish him a speedy recovery.","Suspect named as weapons trader Dennis Marx .

"By . Becky Barrow . She said she wanted to live a farmer’s life, and bought the cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens and geese to prove it. But it seems Liz Hurley has finally tired of all that rustic simplicity. The actress and model has put her secluded Cotswolds farm on the market – and is set to make a £3million profit from the sale. 'Darling buds all the way': The sale of six-bedroom Ampney Knowle in the Cotswolds looks set to make Liz Hurley a profit of £3million . Snappy decor: The stuffed alligator, left, and four-poster bed in the star's bedroom . Six-bedroom Ampney Knowle has all the rural charm you would expect from a stone-built farmhouse set in 73 acres of green fields – ‘The Darling Buds of May all the way,’ says Miss Hurley. But inside, it has the unmistakeable marks of a celebrity owner. There’s the obligatory Aga in a vast Smallbone kitchen and a huge portrait of Miss Hurley and her 12-year-old son Damian in the lounge. But in the bedroom, things start to get odd. Perching on its hind legs is what appears to be a miniature stuffed alligator seemingly keeping an eye on a nearby four-poster bed. The animal theme continues in the sitting room. Anybody wanting to play the grand piano has a dead tiger to contend with – its mouth wide open, baring its fangs. Family friendly: The portrait of Miss Hurley and son Damian, left, in the lounge . Grrreat feature: A tiger skin draped across the grand piano . Rural idyll: Miss Hurley (right) has spoken with affection of the moment she first saw Ampney Knowle, which is surrounded by 73 acres of greenery . Nearby, a glass coffee table is supported by two topless figures. Outside is a tennis court and a garden filled with flowers. For a woman who is regularly photographed on the red carpet, Miss Hurley naturally has converted one of Ampney Knowle’s outbuildings into a ‘party barn’. She has thrown many parties, with guests able to stay in the ‘guest annexe’, a converted Cotswold stone stable block with three ensuite bedrooms and a large sitting room. Ampney Knowle, which has six bedrooms in the main house, also has two separate cottages and outbuildings. The 31-acre bluebell wood and 35 acres of farmland are not included, however. Sculpted: The home includes well-kept gardens, and an outbuilding used for parties . Annexe: The home includes a separate area in which visitors can stay in privacy . Approach: Miss Hurley once put the surrounding farmland to good use - then her interest waned . Distant: Miss Hurley's country paradise began to fade when her ex-husband tired of being far from the city . Miss Hurley, 48, expects the estate – being sold by estate agency Knight Frank – to sell for £6million. She bought it 11 years ago for £3.3million as she started dating her ex-husband, textile billionaire Arun Nayar. Describing the moment she first saw Ampney Knowle, Miss Hurley said: ‘[It was] the most perfect June day, a few months after I’d given birth to my son, Damian. The moment I stepped over the threshold, I knew I wanted to live here.’ For a time, the model embraced the farm life, stocking the estate with four labradors, two cats, three geese, eight chickens, 49 cows, 63 sheep and 82 pigs. She even began stocking her own sausages in Harrods. Unmistakable: Miss Hurley's Smallbone kitchen has the classic celebrity features such as a prominent Aga . Luxury: The bathroom fits the rest of the house's nuetral decor . Snug: Rooms higher in the house have authentic exposed wooden beams . Fine dining: The separate dining room has commanding views over the surrounding fields . But she gradually outgrew her rural idyll. Mr Nayar reportedly disliked living so far from the big city, and her interest in farming waned. Miss Hurley said: ‘I’ll miss sitting round the fire cackling with my friends, walking through the fields with my son, and the rose garden I created. But I’m taking my memories with me, so I’ll be OK.’ She now lives at Doddington Hall, a Georgian mansion in Herefordshire she bought with Shane Warne. When their relationship foundered last year, Miss Hurley – who is now dating hedge fund tycoon-turned-wildlife photographer David Yarrow - decided to buy Mr Warne’s share and stay on.","Star once longed for the farmer's life - so bought rustic Cotswolds home .

"By . Associated Press . Mexico's intellectual property agency has ruled in favor of a small local firm's rights to the 'iFone' name, saying that ads for Apple's iPhone have encroached on the trademark. The Mexican firm iFone S.A. de C.V. registered the name in 2003 to cover specialized telephone service for call centers and businesses, well before Apple registered the similar iPhone moniker in 2007 for its popular mobile handset. iFone doesn't make mobile telephones. Mexico's Institute for Intellectual Property ruled on Thursday that the two names are phonetically identical, and thus there was a trademark encroachment. Winners: Mexican form iFone S.A. de C.V. registered the name iFone in 2003 to cover specialized telephone service for call centers and businesses. They've won their trademark battle against Apple iPhone . The institute said several Mexican mobile phone carriers, including market leader America Movil, must pay a fine of about $104,000 and stop using 'iPhone' as a promotional name for their calling plans. But Apple is not specifically covered by the ruling, since it doesn't provide calling services, just handsets. Apple had previously argued the Mexican firm's trademark had lapsed. The ruling can be appealed, but the institute said about 68 percent of its rulings are upheld on appeal. Previous reports suggested the Mexican company might sue Apple for as much as $1.5 billion trademark infringement, but iFone executives did not return calls for comment on whether they planned to file any civil suit. It's not the first time Apple has faced disputes over the name. In 2013, Brazil's patent authority ruled the iPhone name in Brazil belongs to a local company called Gradiente SA. The verdict didn't forbid the global computer giant from using the name in Brazil. Reprimanded: Mexico's Institute for Intellectual Property has ruled that ads for Apple's iPhone have encroached on the trademark rights of a small local firm . Gradiente was the first to make cellphones in Brazil, and launched the first national smartphone in 2004. Their request to use the iPhone trademark was granted in 2008, and the company started making 'iphones', with a lowercase 'p'. The issue is reminiscent of one that arose in the United States in 2007. Cisco Systems had owned the iPhone trademark since 2000, and had been using it for a line of Internet-connected phones. Once Apple announced its intention to use the brand name, Cisco sued it in San Francisco federal court. The two companies settled out of court six weeks later, without disclosing the terms.","iFone S.A. de C.V. registered the name in 2003 to cover specialized telephone service for call centers and businesses .

"By . Dan Bloom . Boko Haram militants dressed as soldiers have slaughtered at least 200 civilians in Nigeria. Witnesses said the extremists rounded up the helpless villagers promising to protect them - the same tactic used to kidnap 300 schoolgirls in April - before opening fire until almost all were dead. Community leaders in the three northeastern villages claimed the military failed to intervene, even though it was warned an attack was imminent. Massacre: Militants dressed as soldiers rounded up residents of three villagers in northeastern Borno province (pictured in red) as shot at them 'continuously for a very long time' until all those gathered were dead . A community leader who witnessed the killings on Monday said residents of the Gwoza local government district, in Borno state, pleaded for the military to send soldiers to protect the area. He said they had heard the Islamist militants - who have taken over several villages in Nigeria - were about to attack, but help didn't arrive. After escaping the massacre and fleeing to Maiduguri, Borno's state capital, he said: 'We all thought they were the soldiers that we earlier reported to that the insurgents might attack us.' 'Then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead' - Community leader who escaped the massacre . The militants arrived in Toyota Hilux pickup trucks - commonly used by the military - and told the civilians they were soldiers 'and we are here to protect you all'. The tactic was the same used by Boko Haram militants who kidnapped more than 300 girls from a school in the town of Chibok on April 15, prompting an international campaign whose supporters include the U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama. After people gathered in the village centres on the militants' orders, the witness said, 'they begin to shout `Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar' on top of their voices. 'Then they begin to fire at the people continuously for a very long time until all that gathered were all dead.' The witness asked not to be named for fear for his safety. The killings happened on Monday in the villages of Danjara, Agapalwa, and Antagara. They are in the Gwoza . local government area, a regional political centre whose emir was killed in a . Boko Haram ambush on his convoy last week. Horror: The militants told villagers they were there to protect them, the same tactics used to kidnap almost 300 schoolgirls (pictured) from another village in April. No photographs have yet emerged of the slaughter . Boko Haram's violence has forced more than 250,000 people to flee their homes since March last year, according to Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA). But a report yesterday warned the latest horrific attacks in the north east could still be the tip of the iceberg. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), based in Norway, said the unrest could spread rapidly to other countries. Its director Alfredo Zamudio said: 'As the government struggles to contain the group’s southward spread towards Abuja, questions to the future of regional stability have been raised which have weakened Nigeria’s relations with Cameroon, Niger and Chad. 'The group is growing in its ambition, capability and reach, creating fears that it will become a regional destabilising force.' Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, added: 'What we have learnt from past experiences of managing the humanitarian impact of armed groups, such as the LRA, is that speed is of the essence. 'The longer such groups are allowed to continue these horrific abuses, the more visibility and notoriety they gain, the harder it becomes to control their spread and impact - they must be stopped, and they must be stopped now'. Emirs are religious and traditional rulers who have been targeted for speaking out against Boko Haram's extremism. Borno governor Kashim Shettima traveled on Saturday to Gwoza to pay his respects . to the fallen emir and was quoted as saying it was a terrifying ride. 'If . I say I was not petrified travelling through that ... road to Gwoza I . would be lying because that road had been designated a no-go area for . about two months now due to the incessant attacks and killings that . occur there,' the governor was quoted as saying by Information Nigeria. A . local journalist who was in the convoy - escorted by 150 soldiers - . counted at least 16 towns and villages that were deserted along the 85 . mile route. The slaughter was confirmed by both Mohammed Ali Ndume, a senator representing Borno and whose hometown is Gwoza, and by a top security official in Maiduguri who insisted on anonymity because he isn't allowed to speak to the media. It took a few days for survivors to . get word of the massacres to Maiduguri, the provincial capital, because . travel on the roads is extremely dangerous and phone connections are . poor or nonexistent. The . community leader wasn't shot because 'I was going round to inform people . that the soldiers had come and they wanted to address us,' he said. As people were fleeing, other gunmen lurking outside the villages on motorcycles mowed them down, he said. Militants . of Boko Haram, which wants to establish Islamic state in Nigeria, have . been taking over villages in the northeast, killing and terrorizing . civilians and political leaders. The Islamic fighters are making a comeback from a year-long military offensive which had been aimed at crushing them. The extreme Islamist group, led by Abubakar Shekau (pictured), has swept through northeastern Nigeria . Monday's attacks have been among the deadliest so far. Thousands of people have been killed . in the five-year-old insurgency, more than 2,000 so far just this year, . and an estimated 750,000 Nigerians have been driven from their homes. Nigeria's military has insisted that the big influx of troops and a year-old state of emergency in three states which gives them the power to detain suspects, take over buildings and lock down any area has the extremists on the run. But while Boko Haram has mostly been pushed out of northeastern cities, militants have been seizing villages with thatched-roof huts in the semi-arid region where they once held sway. Their black flags adorned with white Arabic lettering have been hoisted above simple village buildings, making vast parts of Nigeria no-go areas for the military.","Militants in Toyota Hilux pickup trucks said they would protect villagers .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Dozens of tourists were sent running to safety Friday night as a massive fire broke out in the kitchen of TGIFriday’s restaurant near Rockefeller Center. The flames started in the basement of the building on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets before quickly rising up through the roof of the six-floor building and sending a plume of smoke rising into the air above midtown Manhattan, authorities said. The blaze rose to three alarms just after 9.00 p.m., and well over 100 firefighters were trying to beat back the fire at one point, according to reports. Inferno: Flames shoot from the roof of the packed restaurant just after 9.00 p.m. Friday evening and light up the night sky . The view from Queens: Smoke rising from the fire, which could be smelled across the East River (pictured in the foreground) Fire officials told WABC the inferno did not engulf the building, but rather traveled through it’s ventilation system. At least 25 fire companies soon flooded Fifth Avenue and brought traffic to a halt. Pictures posted to Twitter from people on the scene show the flames shooting high into the sky and Fifth Avenue littered with fire trucks, hoses – it has been completely shut down. The smoke could be seen as far away as Queens and New Jersey, people in Long Island City reported smelling the fire, according to the New York Daily News. Transit officials were forced to reroute 11 bus lines that would normally traverse the major thoroughfare, an MTA official told WCBS. The fire was reportedly brought under control within an hour.

Offices occupy the fifth and six floors. No injuries were immediately reported, but a source told WNBC dozens of patrons were evacuated when the fire broke out. Fifth Avenue is lined with luxury retailers and high-end restaurants on the blocks surrounding the burning TGI Friday's.

"By . Dan Bloom . No student wants to look shaggy-haired and dog-tired in their yearbook photo. But Taxi Benke has a good excuse - he's a half-labrador, half-golden retriever service dog. The faithful companion was rewarded for his loyalty by a middle school in San Antonio, Texas, after looking after an epileptic seventh-grader for four years. Scroll down for video . Spot the dog: Taxi was rewarded for looking after epileptic Rachel Benke - with a photo in her yearbook . Companion: The dog goes everywhere with Rachel, her mother told Texas news channel KENS5 . It is not known which quote he gave for the yearbook - and what people will think of his hairstyle at the 20th reunion is anyone's guess. But for epilepsy sufferer Rachel Benke, the decision by the Northside Independent School District proved Taxi had entered everyone's hearts. It was a long road for the pet - a 'dropout' who did not make the guide dog program because he was too fond of attacking cats. Her mother Theresa told KENS5 Rachel had epileptic seizures from birth and her life was turned around after meeting Taxi four years ago. He now accompanies her everywhere, including at award presentations and birthday parties. 'We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel was terrified of animals,' she said. Saviour: On one school sports day Taxi became anxious immediately before Rachel had a seizure . 'Next thing you know Rachel bent down and just hugged him, and it's the cutest thing you've ever seen.' On one school sports day, Taxi became agitated and rushed towards the schoolgirl minutes before she had a seizure. 'He started pulling away from the aide as far as he could trying to get to Rachel,' she said. 'We don't know how he knew this, but he wouldn't let anyone near Rachel until the paramedics got there.' Taxi, however, does not take the prize for the most bizarre yearbook photo incident of 2014. Last week a high school in Utah secretly Photoshopped more clothes onto several of its students because it deemed them too sexy. The shocked girls only discovered after the yearbook was printed that many of them appeared to be wearing a different outfit. Wasatch County School District Superintendent Terry E. Shoemaker defended the decision - claiming students know the dress code and there was a sign warning them their pictures may be altered.

"By . Leon Watson . British foreign secretary William Hague today condemned President Bashar al-Assad's landslide re-election victory as an 'insult' to Syria. Mr Hague spoke out after it was announced al-Assad had won a new seven-year term with nearly 90 per cent of the vote. Mr Hague said: 'Assad lacked . legitimacy before this election, and he lacks it afterwards.' Washington added that the 'non-election' changed nothing and activists said it would spell only more war.

Syrian security celebrate Bashar Assad's presidential re-election in Damascus . Assad has been re-elected Syria's president with 88.7 percent of the vote after a poll labelled a farce by rebels fighting to overthrow him . Tens of thousands took to the streets in . government-held areas even before the results were announced on . Wednesday evening, waving portraits of Assad and the official Syrian . flag. Celebratory gunfire erupted in the capital and in loyalist areas across Syria. At least 10 people were killed as the bullets fell back to earth, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In opposition-held areas where no election was held on Tuesday, activists reacted with the Arab Spring slogan of 2011 that has been the rally cry of their uprising - 'The people want the fall of the regime.' Pro-government newspapers all carried front-page photographs of the re-elected president. Images of Assad in suit and tie, or more rarely military uniform, filled the programming of state television. The ruling Baath party's newspaper vowed that Syrians would show the same steadfastness against rebel attack in rebuilding their country that they displayed on polling day. 'After the historic vote, Syrians will accomplish a military, political and social mission, as well as the reconstruction of the country, by defying the mortars that are launched every day by the terrorists,' Al-Baath said in an editorial. Some 11.6 million of the 15.8 million eligible voters turned out in government-held areas, according to official figures, despite attacks that killed 24 people on polling day, according to the Observatory. British foreign secretary William Hague has described Assad's election victory as an 'insult' to the Syrian people . US Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in Beirut, called the election a 'great big zero' Critics charged that many of those who . voted did so more out of fear than commitment to Assad, whose family . has ruled Syria with a rod of iron for four decades. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the election a 'great big zero.' 'With . respect to the elections that took place, the so-called elections, the . elections are non-elections,' Kerry said on a lighting visit to . neighbouring Lebanon on Wednesday. He . said 'nothing has changed' as a result of the poll and urged Assad's . foreign backers to take action to bring an end to the three-year . conflict that has left more than 162,000 people dead.

'I particularly call on those nations directly supporting the Assad regime ... I call on them - Iran, Russia, and I call on Hezbollah, based right here in Lebanon - to engage in the legitimate effort to bring this war to an end,' he said. Russia earlier called for the speedy appointment of a new UN envoy to resume peace efforts after Lakhdar Brahimi, who brokered two rounds of abortive talks between the government and the opposition earlier this year, stepped down over the weekend saying his mediation had reached a stalemate. Brahimi had infuriated Damascus by criticising Tuesday's election as an obstacle to his peace efforts. But Moscow has in turn angered the West by vetoing four draft UN Security Council resolutions in defence of its Damascus ally. Opposition activists acknowledged wearily that the election was likely to prolong the conflict that has devastated their country and driven nearly half the population from their homes and sparked an exodus of nearly three million refugees abroad. An activist who spent nearly two years trapped under army siege in Syria's third city Homs said he believed in a peaceful solution, but that Assad's win made the prospects remoter than ever. 'Sadly the election means that the fighting and bloodshed will also continue, and no one knows for how long, while the refugees will stay in the camps,' said the activist who identified himself only as Thaer. 'The truth is that, even though everyone wants a political solution, that cannot happen with Assad in power... The war will continue, and the Syrians will continue to kill each other.'","Tens of thousands took to the streets to celebrate in the capital .

"By . Jill Reilly . Dozens of people are feared dead following an explosion in north-eastern Nigeria, with Boko Haram militants believed to be behind the attack. The attack took place last night after a village football competition in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state. It is one of the three states under a year-old emergency rule imposed by President Goodluck Jonathan to fight Boko Haram, which seeks to impose Islamic rule in Nigeria. The attack took place last night near a primary school where there are also a number of beer halls in the town of Mubi in Adamawa state . Othman Abubakar, a spokesman for the Adamawa state police, confirmed the explosion but he could not say how many people had been killed or injured. David Dauda, who witnessed the blast, said he saw at least 30 bodies following the explosion. 'The blast occurred shortly after people are dispersing from a football playing ground,' he said. 'People gathered there to watch a football competition and just few minutes after soldiers patrol vehicle left the place then we heard a blast.' The explosion occurred at around 6.45pm local time when many people were headed home to make a 7.00pm curfew imposed in the wake of earlier attacks. Nigeria's north-eastern region has suffered five years of increasingly deadly assaults by Boko Haram, whose fighters have targeted towns and villages in a string of bomb and gun attacks. At least 2,000 civilians have been killed in such attacks this year alone. Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for kidnapping more than 300 schoolgirls in the town of Chibok on April 15. The 250 girls are being held by Islamic group Boko Haram after they were abducted from Chibok, in north eastern Nigeria . Fifty seven girls are believed to have escaped, which leaves an estimated 272 still held captive. In another attack yesterday evening, also in Adamawa state, suspected Boko Haram members opened fire at people indiscriminately around the town of Madagali, according to witnesses. Boko Haram terrorists took more than 250 girls in a raid on their school in Chibok, in Nigeria’s north-east, on April 14. At the weekend a heartbreaking new video of the Nigerian schoolgirls shows them bravely speaking out about their ordeal for the . first time. The . footage, not released publicly but seen by The Mail on Sunday, was . taken in a jungle clearing a month after their abduction. The video, taken by an intermediary on . May 19, has been shown to President Goodluck Jonathan. It was intended . to serve as ‘proof of life’ for the girls and to encourage the President . to accede to the terrorists’ demands. The Nigerian government has been engaged in negotiations with Boko Haram's spiritual leader Abubakar Shekau in a bid to secure the girls' release .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . David Cameron and Angela Merkel have clashed in a meeting over the future of direction of Europe. Downing Street sources said the pair had a ‘candid’ exchange over the prospect of arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker becoming president of the European Commission. Mr Cameron has warned that Britain could leave the EU if he fails in his bid to block Mr Juncker’s appointment, which is backed by Mrs Merkel. David Cameron and Angela Merkel had a 'candid' meeting last night over who should become the next president of the European Commission . Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel sat across the table from one another at a breakfast meeting of G7 leaders this morning . The British Prime Minister and German Chancellor are usually close allies, including on future reform of Europe. Just yesterday Mrs Merkel gave a speech criticising those urging Britain to leave the EU. She told German MPs it was 'grossly negligent, actually unacceptable, how easily some talk about it not mattering whether Great Britain agrees or not, even whether Great Britain remains a member of the European Union or not. This is anything but irrelevant, unimportant or trivial.' However, she later met Mr Cameron for a bilateral meeting at the G7 summit in Brussels, where the pair had a frank exchange of views. They have been at loggerheads over the choice of a successor to Jose Manuel Barroso - with Mr Cameron vehemently opposed to Mrs Merkel's favoured candidate, the arch-federalist former prime minister of Luxembourg Jean-Claude Juncker. A No 10 source said: ‘They had friendly, candid and constructive discussions in keeping with how their bilaterals usually are and in the spirit of finding consensus.’ Mr Cameron had further discussions today on the issue with Mr Barroso, president of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi, No 10 said. Angela Merkel is pushing for arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker (left) to become the new EC president, but IMF chief Christine Lagarde (second left) has emerged as a compromise candidate favoured by David Cameron. Other politicians in line for Europe's most powerful position include Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt and Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny . Jean-Claude Juncker is the favourite to become the new European Commission President - replacing the outgoing former Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Manuel Barroso. The former Luxembourg prime minister was chosen as the candidate for the top job by the European Parliament's main conservative group, the European People's Party. The EPP emerged from last week's elections with the most seats - leaving Mr Junker in poll position for the EU's most powerful job. But the Commission President is chosen by European leaders including David Cameron - and not by the Parliament. MEPs do however have to confirm the leaders' choice for the job in a vote. The other candidates for the top EU job include the IMF chief Christine Lagarde. Miss Lagarde was finance minister under former President Nicolas Sarkozy before moving to the IMF at the height of the euro zone's debt crisis in 2011 to replace disgraced French politician Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Her term runs until 2016. A fluent English-speaker who headed a major US law firm before holding ministerial office in France, she is highly regarded by German leader Angela Merkel. Center-left Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt is also under consideration. The former MEP is the daughter-in-law of Neil Kinnock, the ex Labour leader and European commissioner. If Mrs Merkel was open to a French candidate for one of the top jobs, Paris might offer Socialist former Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault - a fluent German-speaker who was replaced in March but is well regarded in Berlin. Another candidate for the EU Commission President is the current Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny. The Fine Gael leader became Ireland's leader in 2011, so might be open to moving to Brussels. Mrs Merkel appeared to offer Mr Cameron a lifeline last night with a speech warning against letting Britain leave the EU, but they remain at loggerheads over the EC job . Mr Cameron seemed to be getting on better with US President Barack Obama during a working session of the G7 summit in Brussels . G7 leaders have gathered in Brussels for a summit, including (L-R) Italy's Prime Minister  Matteo Renzi, Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harperm, US President  Barack Obama, President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy, Germany's Chancellor  Angela Merkel, Britain's Prime Minister  David Cameron, Head of the European Commission Jose Manuel Barroso, France's President  Francois Hollande and Japan's Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe . The summit is supposed to focus on Ukraine and ensuring economic growth, but the European leaders have remained focussed on the future direction of the EU . Mrs Merkel has insisted she is ‘trying to ensure that Jean-Claude Juncker receives the qualified majority he needs to become the next president of the European Commission’. But her comments suggest she does not believe Mr Juncker can command a majority among European leaders. Italy, Sweden, the Netherlands and Hungary are among a number of EU countries said to share Mr Cameron’s concerns about the Luxembourger. Mr Cameron has branded Mr Juncker a ‘face from the 1980s’ who no-one has heard of. He fears that his bid to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU will be hampered if Mr Juncker hold such a key role. Mrs Merkel is reported to have sounded out French President Francois Hollande about nominating Miss Lagarde for the Commission job. Miss Lagarde, who will travel to London on IMF business tomorrow, would be a popular candidate in both the UK and Germany. But she is said to harbour ambitions of standing for the French presidency – which would be incompatible with taking the top job in Brussels. By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A former French prime minister has angrily called on Britain to leave the European Union - to stop it dying. Michel Rocard said the UK had only joined the EU to help big business - and called on it to leave before it caused further damage. Mr Rocard also accused David Cameron of 'pretending' to want to leave - and of provoking a crisis in order to serve the interest of Britain’s banks. Former French Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard, being greeted here by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at Number 10 in 1988, has called on Britain to regain its 'elegance' by quitting the EU . In a scathing article in the French newspaper Le Monde said: 'So leave, then, before you destroy everything.' The remarks by the 83-year-old Rocard comes amid growing anger of Mr Cameron's bid to block the former Luxembourg prime minister Jean-Claude Juncker from running the European Commission. Mr Junker is the lead candidate of the biggest group in the European Parliament - the Conservative European People's Party - which scopped the most seats in last week's European elections. Mr Cameron has publicly opposed the nomination of Mr Juncker, whose European People’s Party. France said before the election that the leading candidate of whichever party won the vote should be put forward for the job. The PM has dismissed a report in Germany’s Der Spiegel magazine that claimed he had threatened at an EU summit last week to bring forward a referendum on British membership of the EU if Mr Juncker became Commission president. The latest fall out between Europe and the UK threatens to turn nasty, the former French PM claimed. Former Socialist Prime Minister Michel Rocard spent 15 years in the European Parliament after leaving French politics . Princess Diana appeared to have charmed Mr Rocard on a visit in Paris in 1988 - but the former French PM said Britain had lost its esteem in the eyes of Europe . He said: 'Between you and us, the continental Europeans, there is a disagreement that is turning ugly. Europe is dying from it.' The Socialist Rocard has been a backer of closer European integration since the bloc’s founding in the decade after World War Two and spent 15 years as a member of European parliament after leaving French politics in 1997. He said Britain had lost the respect of its neighbours in Europe over its position on Europe. The former PM wrote: 'There was a time when being British was synonymous with elegance. Let us rebuild Europe. Regain your elegance and you will regain our esteem.' Britain – which joined the EU, then known as the European Economic Community, in 1973 after France’s General Charles de Gaulle had resisted a previous attempt to enter the bloc – has long been accused by some of the zone’s founder members of seeking to slow down European political union. Mr Cameron has vowed to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the union in 2017. Before the poll he has promised to 'renegotiate' the terms of Britain’s membership - by winning back powers from Brussels. Last week he accused the union of being 'too bossy'.","British PM and German Chancellor clash during bilateral at G7 summit .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Banks are expected to face a clampdown on long-term mortgages after a surge in borrowers taking out home loans for 30 years or more. The sharp rise is thought to be one focus of the Bank of England’s concerns over the London property market, where house prices have been rising at almost 20 per cent a year. The escalating cost of buying a home has pushed borrowers to take out longer loans, far beyond the typical 25-year mortgage. Experts at price comparison site Totallymoney.com anticipate mortgage rates to rise to 4.7% within two years, from an average of 3.7% now . In 2000, the proportion of mortgages of 30 years or more was just 1.6 per cent, but by 2012, 27 per cent of all new mortgages were for 30 years or more. This percentage is likely to rise still further. Now, the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee is expected to crack down on 30-year-plus  loans, especially where they extend into retirement. The International Monetary Fund last week urged the Bank of England to take action to cool the UK property market. Figures out this week will also show that borrowers are anticipating interest-rate rises by looking to fix their mortgages. The sharp rise is thought to be one focus of the Bank of England's concerns over the London and southeast property market . In the fourth quarter of 2013, 80 per cent of borrowers took out fixed-term deals, against 64 per cent the year before. Dominik Lipnicki, of brokers Your Mortgage Decisions, believes the reason for this is simple. He says: ‘Most people expect rates to raise over the next 12 months.’ Experts at price comparison site Totallymoney.com anticipate mortgage rates to rise to 4.7 per cent within two years, from an average of 3.7 per cent now.","In 2000, the proportion of mortgages of .

British armed forces are to take part in three military exercises in the Baltic area to provide ‘reassurance’ to allies in Eastern Europe, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said. HMS Montrose will take part in Baltops, the largest multi-national naval exercise in the Baltic Sea this year, to improve maritime security in the region, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. The Royal Navy frigate HMS Montrose has been deployed to the Baltic Sea for Nato military exercises amid continuing tension with Russia over Ukraine .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A British TV producer was killed in Qatar when a speeding motorcyclist hit her while racing a friend at high speed. Kerry Rome, 33, moved to Qatar to work for TV news station Al-Jazeera, and had been out with colleagues before being knocked down as she crossed the road at 2am, an inquest heard. She was the TV station's first female technical director, and moved to the Middle East for work with her husband Mark Harris, 35. Killed: Kerry Rome, pictured, was knocked down and killed by a motorcyclist in Qatar in 2012 . Police initially believed Mrs Rome's death was accidental - but it later emerged that the motorbike rider had no driving licence, and was racing a friend when he hit Mrs Rome on April 20, 2012. A 21-year-old man was convicted of killing Kerry in a Qatari court in 2012 with a judge describing his speed as 'excessive'. An inquest in Stamford, Lincolnshire, heard that the biker hit Mrs Rome - who had just stepped out into the road - while trying to under-take his rival. Moments after stepping into the road she was struck by the motorcyclist as he attempted to under-take his friend. Giving evidence, Mrs Rome's mother Margaret, 62, described the moment she found out about her daughter’s death as 'the worst phone call of my life'. She added: 'My lovely daughter Kerry would be here today if that reckless, dangerous motorcyclist had not been racing with a friend at 2am'. Mr Harris also paid tribute to his late wife, whom he had married just months before her death in an Elvis-themed Las Vegas wedding. 'Excessive': The motorcyclist was undertaking his rival in a street race when he hit Mrs Rome. A Qatari court convicted him of the killing . Mark, originally from Market Deeping Lincolnshire, said: 'Kerry was an amazing person. She was kind, generous, there to help and never had a bad word to say about anyone. 'We were career-oriented adults who relocated abroad to make a good life and good careers for ourselves. 'This was all taken away by a man who was out racing a motorbike with his friends.' A toxicology report carried out in Qatar found 296mg of alcohol per 100ml in Kerry’s blood, around three-and-a-half times the British drink-drive limit. Three of Mrs Rome's colleagues told the hearing she did not appear drunk on the night she died. Oliver Walker said: 'We had a few drinks but nothing major as we were dancing close to the stage. It’s not like we were pounding shots at the bar'. South Lincolnshire coroner Professor Robert Forrest said: 'It had appeared that the motorcyclist was undertaking one of his companions when the collision took place.' Middle East: Mrs Rome moved to Qatar for work with her husband Mark Harris . He added that there was insufficient evidence to produce a verdict of unlawful killing, instead recording the incident as a death caused as a result of a road traffic collision. A friend of the family said today: 'The family are obviously disappointed that the coroner effectively delivered a verdict of accidental death. 'It is the family’s position that Kerry was not killed in an accident. The motorcyclist hit her during an illegal road race. 'If he had not been taking part in an illegal activity Kerry would still be here today.' Kerry and her husband Mark moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2008 when she became the first female technical director of live news at Al Jazeera English. They then transferred to Doha in October 2011 when Kerry was promoted to Al Jazeera English’s head office. Speaking after the inquest, her mother said: 'She was such a vivacious person and so full of life. Considering how young she was she has done so much in her life. 'When we went out there and saw what life was like we realised how strong a person she was. We are all so incredibly proud of her and what she did.' Kirsty Rome, her sister, added: 'We were all really close, she loved her family. She did more in her 33 years than most do in a lifetime.'","Kerry Rome, 33, was killed around 2am on April 20, 2012 .

"By . Tom Latchem . Thank heavens Lorna Fitzgerald found fame as an actress - she'd have made her family's life unbearable if she hadn't. Lorna, who plays Abi Branning in EastEnders, says acting's been her goal ever since she can remember. 'I was every relative's nightmare - I'd perform plays for them,' she says. Lorna landed her dream role at the age of ten - six years after her ambition began . 'At first it's cute, but it would get to the point where Mum would say, ""Why don't you go upstairs?"" She took me to a theatre show when I was about four, and I was in awe of everyone on stage. So then Mum sent me to an acting school and it went from there.' And now after eight years in Albert Square she's involved in her biggest storyline to date, as the killer of tragic Lucy Beale is at large - and not even the EastEnders cast know who it is. But if Lorna did somehow find out, keeping it a secret wouldn't be a problem. For even after learning she'd won her role on the soap when she was only ten, she managed to keep the news from her school friends. 'I was called out of class and my mum told me in front of the head,' recalls Lorna, of the moment she found out she was about to be a major child TV star. 'It blew my mind. EastEnders is so big, and as a ten-year-old it was daunting, but I was so excited. But I couldn't tell my friends for about three months! I liked keeping the secret, though. I kept thinking, ""I know something you don't!""' Lorna says that a highlight of being in EastEnders is working with June Brown who plays her on-screen grandmother - Dot Cotton . After being introduced in 2006 with on-screen dad Max, mum Tanya and older sister Lauren, Lorna, now 18, has gone from strength to strength as Abi. She's been tipped as 'one to watch' by the critics as her character has enjoyed the ups and downs of the soap roller coaster: Abi's been hit by Deano Wicks's car, watched her parents' marriage unravel, discovered Trina Johnson's dead body, struggled with Lauren's drinking and had an on-off relationship with Jay Brown. Her hard work was recognised in 2012 when she won the Best Young Performance gong at the British Soap Awards. And now she's in the thick of the action as the hunt for Lucy Beale's killer continues. 'Anyone could be in the frame for her murder,' says Abi. 'It could be me, but we're all in the dark. That's why there's such a buzz. Everyone wants to find out. The challenge of playing a killer would be great. But then, if it were me, I'd probably have to leave.' Although relishing her prominent role on the soap, Lorna says she struggled with the attention that comes with being in EastEnders. 'It's fine now I'm used to it, but at first it was scary because I'd be shopping and strangers would say stuff to me,' she admits. And what's next? 'I love it here. I've been very lucky,' she says. 'But they could say I'm leaving at any time. My dream is to win an Oscar. You never know, I could be the first person to win one in Walford - EastEnders: The Movie!' Travel, Asia or South America?  I'd love to visit Thailand. There's a party scene and some culture too. Fancy restaurant or greasy spoon? Greasy spoon – I don't have nice enough clothes to go to a fancy restaurant. I'm in a tracksuit now! Drinks, cocktail or wine? I love  a cocktail. I don't like the taste  of alcohol, so the juice masks it. Film, Sliding Doors or Gladiator? Gladiator is my favourite film. It  has action, fight scenes, a love story – a bit of everything. Music, dance or pop? I listen to Kiss FM because I like a bit of dance music, but my tastes are quite varied. Gym or sofa? Sofa. I love slobbing out. I have a gym membership but it doesn't get used very often!","18-year-old Lorna has been in EastEnders since the age of ten .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Over a thousand mourners turned out to give a heroine's send off to a teenage hit-and-run victim who died after pushing her friend out of the path of an oncoming car. Friends and family paying tribute to Jasmyn Chan at her funeral at City Road Crematorium in Sheffield were told her selfless act was not something learned in a few seconds but rather 'a way of life'. The 14-year-old died last month when she was hit by a car just yards from her home in Sheffield, as she tried to push her friend Tia Tucker, 12, from danger. The horse drawn carriage carrying Jasmyn Chan's white coffin makes its way to the City Road Crematorium in Sheffield as people wait outside to pay their respects . Jasmyn, 14, left, died after pushing her friend Tia Tucker, right, away from the path of an oncoming car . Jasmyn's mother, Paula McCullie leaves the service yesterday, where her daughter was given a 'heroine's send off' A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and is on bail. Family, friends and well-wishers stood in complete silence as Jasmyn's white coffin arrived in a horse-drawn hearse. The hearse was followed by family and friends being driven in two limousines and a vintage motorised hearse carrying floral tributes. The coffin was carried into the crematorium to the Enrique Iglesias song 'Hero', followed by her family - each carrying a white rose - and Tia, who had a pink cast on her leg. Mourners who had been patiently waiting outside began to file in, but the huge crowd meant many stood in the sun and listened to the short service on loudspeakers. Jasmyn's selfless act was described as a 'way of life'. Her coffin, left, which her father Peter Chan helped to carry was taken into the chapel at the Crematorium to the Enrique Iglesias song 'Hero' It is thought that more than 1,000 mourners came to the crematorium to pay their last respects to the schoolgirl . The huge crowd meant many stood in the sun and listened to the short service on loudspeakers . Family and friends of the teenager  hugged in groups, sobbing as the made their way home from the funeral . At several points during the 25-minute service, the Reverend Mike Reeder made reference to the John Legend song 'All Of Me', relating it to the final moment before she died. He told the congregation: 'The split seconds that were left to Jas, she thought of someone else and pushed Tia out of the way of the oncoming car. 'This action is not something that is learnt in the split seconds before a decision has to be taken, it is a way of life and is as normal as breathing to those who have such a gift. 'Putting it another way, the actions of that split second were the very beat of her life.' Many floral tributes were left outside the crematorium, including this one of her nickname 'Jazzy' Mourners lay their own floral tributes to the teenager outside the crematorium in Sheffield . The Rev Reeder, the chaplain of St Luke's Hospice in Sheffield, added that while people can't bring Jasmyn back what they can do 'is give her a hero's send-off, which is what she deserves.' After leaving their white roses on Jasmyn's coffin her tearful family left the church to the Macklemore and Ryan Lewis song 'Same Love', a song Jasmyn had on repeat on her iPhone. Mourners hugged in groups, sobbing as the made their way home and several of the younger people attending the ceremony could be seen proudly wearing RIP JAZZY T-shirts. Dozens of floral tributes where also left on the ground outside. Police say the investigation into her death was continuing and they were still trying to find a blue-green Honda Civic with the registration P135 FEO.

"By . Wills Robinson . A couple used filthy machinery caked in blood to produce around 27,000 meals at a sausage factory. Owners of B&L Sausages Brian Wainwright, 45, and his 38-year-old . wife Lorraine, produced the food in a filthy barn which was covered in rat poison, manure and animal carcases. These images show the disgusting conditions discovered by Environmental Health inspectors when they raided the premises in Mixenden, West Yorkshire, last May. Revolting: These disgusting images show the filthy machinery which was used to make 27,000 meals in a sausage factory. Tools, including the mincer (pictured) were full of dirt and caked in blood . Guilty: Brian Wainwright, 45, who ran B&L Sausages was sentenced to eight months in prison for each offence, suspended for two years at Bradford Crown Court . Packages described the food as being 'Passionately sourced', but officials said the conditions were a 'high risk to public health'. Particles from an unsealed barn wall had fallen into the mincer and tools, including a meat cleaver and whisk, were found to be rusty and caked in filth. Officers even discovered dead cows and chickens on the floor while the farm’s dog ran off with a lamb’s head during the raid. Prosecutor Howard Shaw told Bradford Crown Court how the sausages, produced during the time spent at the barn between April and May 2012, accounted for approximately 27,000 meals. One cafe owner, not named in court, said the sausages 'had a strange taste and would stick to teeth when you bit into them'. Conditions: Environmental Health inspectors discovered raw meet hanging from the ceiling and a dead chicken in a bin . Mr Shaw added that there was no evidence of any food poisoning as a consequence of the breaches. Judge Colin Burn said: 'It is hard to imagine a more lethal environment for providing food for public consumption. 'It was undoubtedly a serious public health risk waiting to happen - it’s a miracle that no one was seriously affected.' Brian Wainwright, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, entered guilty pleas to a total of 14 allegations including one which related to his failure to put in place adequate procedures to control pests and prevent domestic animals from having access to places where food was prepared. Squalid: Health officials found bags strewn all over the floor as rat traps were discovered above work surfaces . Filth: Particles from an unsealed barn wall had fallen into the mincer and tools were found to be rusty . He also pleaded guilty to operating the food business without the approval of Calderdale Council at the barn and at a different site. Other offences included holding unsafe food for the purpose of sale, failing to ensure that food premises were kept clean and well maintained, failing to store raw materials and ingredients in appropriate conditions and failing to properly dispose of food waste. He also pleaded guilty to an offence of misleading consumers by selling pork and leek sausages which only had a meat content of 47 per cent when the packaging indicated they should have contained a minimum of 60 per cent meat. Wainwright’s wife pleaded guilty to two offences relating to her failure to provide information about suppliers of food to the company and businesses which had been supplied with products by B&L Sausages. Damning: Offences included holding unsafe food for the purpose of sale, failing to ensure that food premises were kept clean and well maintained, failing to store raw materials . Wainwright was sentenced to eight months in prison for each offence, suspended for two years and was ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service. He is also prohibited from managing a food production business. His wife received a fine of £750. Speaking after the case Calderdale Council’s Cabinet member for Economy and Environment, Barry Collins, said: 'People should be able to have faith that food businesses are following hygiene rules, and that the products they buy are safe to eat. When health is put at risk we won’t hesitate to take action.'","Brian Wainwright, 45, and his 38-year-old .

'I told my son this morning, `Your mother is powerless and helpless, after more than 20 years I don't even have the chance to appeal for support,'' Yin said in a phone interview from her home in Beijing, crying as she spoke.

Why must we be controlled so strictly this year?' Activists say this year has seen a longer and more restrictive clampdown than usual, reflecting the increasingly conservative political atmosphere under President Xi Jinping, who took office last year. 'I regret I can't to go to the square to pay tribute, but it warms my heart that those events and those sacrifices have not been forgotten after 25 years,' said veteran activist Hu Jia, who has been under house arrest for 101 days.

Yin said the authorities' monitoring of her family intensified this year, with round-the-clock police surveillance that started in April.

'You're not only re-opening my scars, you're spreading salt and chili powder into it,' Yin said she told her minders.'I said, `You are too inhuman.'' Authorities allowed relatives of some of those killed in the crackdown to visit their loved ones' graves, but they had to go quietly and under police escort, according to Zhang Xianling, a member of a group that campaigns for the crackdown's victims. 'The wound is still very deep. And though we might now shed fewer tears than in the past, our conviction is even stronger,' said Zhang, whose son, Wang Nan, was 19 years old when he was killed in the suppression. 'We must keep struggling until the end. We must pursue justice for our loved ones.' Beijing's official verdict is that the student-led protests aimed to topple the ruling Communist Party and plunge China into chaos. Protest leaders said they were seeking broader democracy and freedom, along with an end to corruption and favoritism within the party. Activist lawyer Teng Biao said the government's repression only betrayed its frailties and fear of dissent. 'Although the government appears stronger, they are more fearful, less confident and have less sense of security,' Teng said from Hong Kong, where he is a visiting scholar at the city's Chinese University. In the telephone poll of 1,005 people conducted May 17-22, 48.5 percent of people agreed that 'the Beijing students did the right thing in the June 4 incident,' down from 54.1 percent a year ago .

The Tiananmen protests remain a totem for political expression and Western-style civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony that retained its own liberal social and legal systems after reverting back to Chinese rule in 1997. The city holds an annual candlelight vigil to remember the Tiananmen victims that's attended by tens of thousands of people, with the numbers rising in recent years. Organizers said they were expecting about 150,000 people to attend Wednesday night's rally in a downtown park. For the first time, a pro-Beijing group, the Voice of Loving Hong Kong, was planning a counter-rally at the park's entrance in support of the military crackdown, in a sign of increasing polarization in the former British colony.

The survey on Hong Kong's attitudes toward the Tiananmen Square protests, which has been conducted since 1993, has a margin of error of three percentage points. Along with concerns about political unrest, China has recently been shaken by violence blamed on separatists from the far northwestern region of Xinjiang, adding to the increased security measures.","Heavy security across on the 25th anniversary of the suppression of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests .

"By . Jonathan Brocklebank . A rare picture of Charles Miller, the British gentleman who arrived in Brazil in 1894 with a football under each arm and introduced the country to the sport . It is a scene almost impossible to imagine today for reasons Scottish football fans will readily understand. A Scotsman arrives in a Brazilian port with a football under each arm, attracting quizzical looks from the locals who wonder what the spherical objects are for. The Scot demonstrates with a flash of his skills on the ball and the Brazilians gape in awe at the wizardry on display. Today, as Brazilian fans eagerly anticipate their country’s bid for a sixth World Cup win – this time on home soil – there is little any country, far less Scotland, can teach them about football. But 120 years ago, this is  essentially how the world’s greatest football nation discovered the sport. The man who stepped off the boat in Santos in 1894 was Charles Miller, son of a Greenock boatyard clerk who had left his home town to build a new life in South America. Coincidentally, he began playing the game in Sao Paulo at the same time another Scot, Glasgow-born factory worker Thomas Donohoe, was helping to popularise it in Rio de Janeiro. A statue was unveiled there last year to honour Donohoe’s role but historians now agree Miller was the first to organise a match played under Association Football rules in Brazil. And, far-fetched as it may seem, it is even suggested 5ft 5in Miller’s dribbling and passing style became the blueprint for the Brazilians’ trademark mode of play. He was too short to be any real threat in the air – but his trick of flicking the ball over his head with the back of the heel is still known in Brazil as ‘chaleira’, derived from the Scotsman’s name. Miller’s father had left his job in Greenock to strike out on his own in Brazil in the 1860s. By the time he met and married Charlotte Fox, daughter of the richest Englishman in town, he had already landed a job as a high-powered railway engineer. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro select teams pose in front of the train taking the Rio team home after the first ever match between the rival cities . Charles Miller is pictured in the middle of the front row of the Sao Paulo Athletic Club assembled in 1904 . His son Charles was sent to a boarding school, Banister Court in Southampton, for a ‘proper English’ education, and it was there he first kicked a football. On the . pitch, Miller earned the nickname Nipper for his deftness on the ball . and eye for goal and, at 17, he was spotted by the local St Mary’s side, . which later became Southampton FC. He then joined Corinthian, the legendary London amateur club, which boasted some of the best players in the world.

Charles Miller 'shows off the 'wizardry' that inspired people in Brazil to take up football 120 years ago. He is pictured with the ball in the Sao Paulo against Rio de Janeiro select match of 1901 . When Miller finished school at age 19, he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional. But it seemed he had a higher calling in South America. Miller was amazed to find football was practically unknown in Brazil. The British expat community’s pastime of choice was cricket, apparently much better suited to the tropical heat. The crowd watches on at a title play-off involving Sau Paulo AC and another side for the first league of Brazil in 1902 . But he did not see it that way. He waited until autumn, when the cricket bats had been put away, and seized his chance. On April 14, 1895, on a scrubby field on the floodplains of a river in central Sao Paulo – after some cattle were moved out of the way – Miller played in the first full football match on Brazilian soil. ‘What a nice little game,’ he said later of the encounter. His Sao Paulo Railway side beat the Gas Works team comfortably by 4-2. Mr Miller's Sau Paulo AC squad pose for a photo ahead of the title play-off match for the first league in 1902. Charles Miller is pictured second from left in the front row . A poster commemorating Sao Paulo Athletic Club's three championships in a row from 1902-1905. Charles Miller is pictured at the centre in the bottom . The Brazilian fans watched bemused as first the rudiments then the subtleties of the game were presented to them. They seemed to get it. One local journalist was on the right lines when he wrote: ‘It gives them great satisfaction or fills them with great sorrow when this kind of yellowish bladder enters a rectangle formed by wooden posts.’ In 1901, the country’s first league was founded in Sao Paulo and at its conclusion Miller’s Sao Paulo Athletic Club – a team of expats – and Paulistano, made up entirely of Brazilians, were tied. Son of a Scottish dad and an English mum, Charlies Miller was born in Sao Paulo less than 10 miles from the new Itaquerao Stadium . Charles Miller kicks off friendly between two of his old clubs Southampton and Sau Paulo AC in Sao Paulo in 1948 . A family photo in Sao Paulo with Charles Miller as a two-year-old sitting on the bench . They met in a play-off for the title. After Paulistano drew first blood, Miller scored twice to lift – and drink champagne from – the first ever championship cup. Miller was also behind rival cities Sao Paulo and Rio meeting up for the first time. But the biggest  victor of all was football. What began in Brazil as a game for the white elite and impeccably dressed supporters who greeted every goal with cries of ‘hip hip hurray’ became a game for the masses. Charles Miller is pictured sitting far right with members of the Hampshire County XI squad in 1894 . When Miller, pictured left with his Sau Paulo team and right with a Hampshire XI, finished school, he had scored a remarkable 45 goals in 34 matches in his latest season and was widely expected to turn professional . Before long, the sight of children kicking anything spherical around the streets was ubiquitous. They were infused with the rhythm, individualism and playfulness still evident in Brazilian football with stars such as Pele becoming household names. There is no doubt about the significance of Miller’s contribution to Brazilian football. By the time of his death in 1953, Brazil had hosted its first World Cup. ‘Few have captured the imagination of an entire nation like he did,’ said a news-paper obituary. Years later Brazil would go on to become global footballing superpowers.

"By . Hugo Duncan Economics Correspondent . House prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak and more than double the average for the rest of the country, official figures showed yesterday. The Office for National Statistics said a typical home in the capital is worth £459,000 – 24.8 per cent more than in January 2008. But prices across the rest of the UK are still 2.4 per cent lower than they were before the crisis, at £195,000, despite a rise of 5.1 per cent in the past 12 months. British capital: House prices in London are nearly 25 per cent higher than their pre-recession peak and more than double the average for the rest of the country, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday . Only London, the South East as a whole, and the East have seen house prices fully recover from the downturn, the report said. Prices across much of the North are still around 8 per cent lower than they were before the recession. Experts said the figures highlighted the divide between London and much of the rest of the UK, with a ‘two-speed’ housing market developing. Expert: Richard Sharp, of the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee, said the country was 'alert to risks represented by the acceleration of asset prices, particularly property' Paul Smith, of estate agent Haart, said: ‘London is most definitely a country of its own when it comes to property prices.’ He warned that much of the rest of the UK was ‘still getting over the battering it took back in 2008’. The report fuelled fears that a dangerous property price bubble is blowing up in parts of the UK at a time when vast swathes of the country are struggling to recover. Richard Sharp, of the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, said: ‘In the UK now, we are alert to risks represented by the acceleration of asset prices, particularly property, in part arising from the low interest rate environment.’ The ONS warned rising prices could mean ‘rising levels of indebtedness’ as buyers are forced to take on bigger mortgages, leaving them ‘vulnerable’ to higher interest rates. It said this could make the economy less able to ‘withstand further shocks’. The average house price for the whole of the UK fell 15 per cent during the financial crisis but is now 3.2 per cent above the January 2008 peak at £252,000. The value of a typical home in the South East is 3.4 per cent higher than it was in early 2008 at £309,000 while in the East prices are up 3.1 per cent to £265,000. But the average price in the North West is still 8 per cent lower than before the crisis, at £165,000, and in the North East house prices are down 7.9 per cent at £148,000. Jeremy Duncombe, of financial services firm Legal & General, said: ‘These figures highlight the two-speed housing market.’ The Mortgage Advice Bureau’s Brian Murphy said: ‘The Bank of England cannot ignore the fact that house prices in London and the surrounding areas are skewing the broader picture.’ Housing divide: A typical home in London is worth £459,000 - 24.8 per cent more than in January 2008.

Roy Hodgson praised the second-half impact of Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere following England’s goalless draw with Honduras – but he bemoaned the absence of Raheem Sterling. The Three Lions signed off from their World Cup preparations with a frustrating stalemate against the Central Americans in Miami, a match which was delayed for 30 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm. England did press for an opener following the half-time introduction of midfield duo Barkley and Wilshere and they were arguably the two biggest positives to emerge from the game.

And while Hodgson was cheered by their contribution, he conceded that not being able to call upon the suspended Sterling was a frustration. ‘I’m disappointed Raheem Sterling couldn’t play because in games like this, where you have the ball in and around the penalty area, players like him with that incredible dribbling skill can make the difference,’ he told ITV. ‘I thought that Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere added a great injection of attacking flair to our game. ‘We really did take the game to them in the second half in particular. ‘We pushed them back but unfortunately it was that last pass or last shot which didn’t go our way. ‘I will take the draw and that we got away without injuries and that we have experience against Central American opposition.’ He added: ‘It’s time for the real thing now.

A cross-party group of MPs and peers will table a report on Monday calling for an urgent Parliamentary inquiry into concussion in sport and funding for independent research to investigate the link between head injuries and early onset dementia.

Impressed: Labour Party MP Chris Bryant will praise the Mail on Sunday's Concussion Campaign . ‘Professional sport has dragged its heels for far too long over the risks associated with concussion,’ one contributor to the report told The Mail on Sunday. ‘All sports need to simplify the message and tell parents very clearly that concussion can kill.’ Last week we exclusively revealed that former England and West Bromwich Albion star Jeff Astle, who died in 2002 aged 59 suffering severe dementia, was the first English professional footballer to be diagnosed with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), found in American footballers. The Football Association promised a 10-year joint study with the Professional Footballers Association into head injuries following Astle’s death but our investigation found that the study was never completed due to woeful under-resourcing. ‘What the Jeff Astle case shows is that complacency and turning a blind eye is just not good enough,’ said Bryant. ‘We are letting players, especially young players down if we don’t take this seriously — and soon.’Astle’s family will be at the House of Commons on Monday, along with Peter and Carol Robinson, whose 14-year-old son Ben died in 2011 after sustaining serious head injuries while playing rugby but being allowed to play on. ‘If anyone present at the ground that day had understood the risks associated with concussion Ben would still be alive today,’ his father said. ‘It was Ben’s 18th birthday last week but instead of buying him a birthday cake I sent flowers to his grave.’ Wrong: Chris Bryant claims the Jeff Astle (above) case shows 'turning a blind eye' isn't good enough .","Cross-party group of MPs will call for inquiry into concussion in sport .

The former Manchester United manager, sacked after just ten months at United, has already had two offers from Premier League clubs and three from abroad – but is looking to return to a Champions League club. Moyes is enthusiastic about the prospect of managing abroad if a good opportunity arises – but if not, he will use the time to broaden his horizons and travel to prepare himself for his next job. Planning ahead: David Moyes, pictured here watching England's friendly against Ecuador in Miami, is keen to travel the world to learn more about football . Dejected: Manchester United failed to find their best form during Moyes' time at the helm . Nightmare: Moyes endured a disastrous time in charge at Old Trafford before being sacked in April . ‘I’m getting ready to work again,’ said Moyes. ‘I don’t know how I’ll be in a few weeks time when pre season starts. It’ll be the first time since I was 16 that I’m not starting a pre-season. But if a job doesn’t crop up which suits me, I’ll travel. ‘So many players come out of South America, I’d like to go and watch what they do. There’s more players from Brazil playing overseas than any other country and more in the Champions League than any nationality. So, there is a continual conveyer belt of them. Is it their development? Is the raw talent just better? And at the top level, any team you work for is going to have plenty of South Americans, so it would be good to understand the culture they’re from. ‘There’s got to be something to learn from youth development in South America, because if you get good young players you can build a club. You want to see where the good young players come from, their coaching and meet people involved in it - and that might help you sign them in the future. ‘I’d also like to go and look at the J-League. Places like Japan and Korea have emerging leagues and are producing more players and I’d like to see what they’re doing in that part of the world. They’re beginning to show signs of improving in talent development in a big way, as are the States. I’d just like to have a look around.’ Wanted man: Moyes has already received five job offers since leaving Old Trafford .

'I’ve spent most of my career in rivalry with Liverpool but part of me was glad, because Brendan was given the opportunity to go in there and change things around and because of that Liverpool have got their strategy in place and a good future.’ Role model: Moyes has been impressed with the work of Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool .","Moyes was sacked as Manchester United manager in April .

"By . David Kent . England's final World Cup warm-up game against Honduras was postponed after just 22 minutes due to an electrical storm in Miami. The players were ordered off the pitch at the Sun Life Stadium as stormy clouds appeared over the venue. Fans were also urged to move out of the stadium. A message displayed on the big screen read: ‘Due to inclement weather, with associated lightning, feel free to exit the seating bowl and move to the inner concourse.’ Threat: Lightning strikes in Miami after England's friendly with Honduras was suspended because of a storm . Danger: Fans were asked to leave the Sun Life stadium as the players departed the pitch . You're off: Referee Ricardo Salazar informs Jordan Hendersoon (right) and Wayne Rooney (second right) of his decision . Big decision: Referee Salazar blows his whistle as he prepares to tell players about the storm threat . The players went to the sidelines for what appeared to be a drinks break, only to be called over by referee Ricardo Salazar who informed them of his decision to impose a 30-minute match suspension. Both teams re-emerged at 5.44pm local time - 36 minutes after they began leaving the field - for a warm-up, with the scoreboard announcing play would resume at 5.51pm. The match restarted shortly afterwards with a Honduras goal-kick. The players had begun playing in temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and 59 per cent humidity - almost identical to the conditions in Manaus, where England's World Cup campaign starts in seven days. Speaking to ITV after leading his players down the tunnel, England boss Roy Hodgson said: ‘It’s a surprise. You don’t come across this very often. ‘I’ve encountered this on the golf course and you don’t continue if there is a storm around. ‘We can only accept and appreciate the referee’s decision. All we can do is wait for the 30 minutes.’ The Three Lions are due to depart for Brazil at 10.30pm local time and Hodgson was confident that the delay will not affect their plans. He added: ‘It’s a private plane so I would like to think we will be okay.’ Blow: England's players trudge off the field as fans of both countries look on from the stands .

Hodgson's men kept possession well in the early stages, perhaps in preparation for the style they will need to play against Italy next Saturday. Danny Welbeck managed the first shot of the day with just four minutes on the clock, stinging the palms of Noel Valladares but getting a knock for his troubles. The Manchester United attacker eventually stopped limping but the sight was a concern - much like Glen Johnson's early defensive play. Back in the side after James Milner played makeshift right-back against Ecuador, first his clumsy touch gave away a corner from which Victor Bernardez blazed over and then he was unable to prevent Carlo Costly clipping over a cross. They were, however, rare nervy moments for England returned to the attack, with Steven Gerrard skewing a strike wide before Valladares somehow spilled a 30-yard Wayne Rooney free-kick.

"By . David Kent . Every day Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent. Italian newspaper Corrierre dello Sport say that Real Madrid will bid £72million (90m euros) to sign Liverpool striker Luis Suarez. Despite no Italian clubs being linked with Suarez, the paper still decide to splash on the move because the striker will line up for Uruguay against Italy at the World Cup on June 24. Moving on? Barcelona's Xavi is wanted by Al Sadd in Qatar and Liverpool's Luis Suarez is a target for Real . Real's interest in Suarez is well known with Spanish daily Marca reporting the same facts - that Real will bid £72m - on Thursday. A day earlier they reported that Real president Florentino Perez had told manager Carlo Ancelotti that Suarez was the next galatico the club wanted to sign. Should Real manage to sign Suarez for £72m they will be getting a bargain as the striker was valued at £79million by the CIES Football Observatory in an independent study published this week. Brendan Rodgers will not want to lose his star man as Liverpool gear up for their first Champions League campaign in four years. But should such a huge offer come in, then the club's resolve will surely be tested. Meanwhile in Spain, Sport claim that Barcelona stalwart Xavi has been offered a four-year deal worth £10m to join Al Sadd in Qatar. The 34-year-old, however, prefers to stay in Barcelona. All change: Barcelona want Rakitic to replace Chelsea bound Fabregas but Benzema looks to be staying at Real . One player who looks set to be staying in Spain is French striker Karim Benzema, who tells Spanish daily Marca that 'If it was down to me I would stay at Madrid all of my life'. The Real Madrid star also reveals the reason boss Ancelotti is so successful is because he remains calm at all times. Benzema goes on to claim that the boos from the Madrid fans do not bother him because even club legend Zinedine Zidane suffered abuse from the stands. And importantly he says he has always had the support of Perez. The paper also carry a smaller story on Cesc Fabregas' increasingly likely move to Chelsea. They claim the move is almost done and that Barcelona are looking at Sevilla's Ivan Rakitic as a replacement. The same story is the splash for Mundo Deportivo, who go further and say Barcelona and Sevilla are in advanced talks over Rakitic and that Barcelona are merely waiting on the player's decision. They also report that Chelsea have put in a £27m (31m euro) bid for Cesc Fabregas. Mundo believe that Barcelona are also looking at Dortmund's Marco Reus and want him to link up with Neymar and Lionel Messi in what they are calling a 'fantasy forward line'. And finally, they boldly declare Spain's starting line-up for the opening World Cup match with Holland on June 13.

In the mix: Sami on the pitch ready to test the same heat England players will play in at the World Cup . Not . particularly tropical, you might say. But Lucozade’s Conditions Zone has . brought a taste of the Brazilian rainforest to east London. The . temporary indoor facility, which has its own 3G pitch, replicates the . temperature and humidity in Brazil — in this case Manaus. The plan . was to complete the Hoff Test — a 10-minute intensive endurance test . which incorporates work with a football — before going into a . small-sided game. In preparation, on-site specialists checked my weight and hydration levels. And then it hits you square in the face — the heat. As you walk into the Conditions Zone, it’s like stepping into a sauna. Within seconds, I was sweating — and that was before I had even started. Not to be boastful, I like to think I’m pretty fit. I exercise at least five times a week and watch my diet. But nothing could prepare me for what was to come. The Hoff Test is a series of runs, sprints and jumps with and without the ball. Five minutes in, I was gasping for air, desperate for the second half of the test to pass. You try not to slow down, but you can’t help but take your foot off the gas. It felt like my lungs would . burst if I didn’t. Mokbel: 'It hits you square in the face - the heat. As you walk into the Conditions Zone, it's like stepping into a sauna.' Getting going: Mokbel did a series of runs, sprints and jumps with and without the ball to test himself in the heat . By the end I was drenched in sweat, gasping for air with legs like jelly. Utterly exhausted — and that was after 10 minutes. The main thing that struck me was my lack of control over the ball as time wore on. Zig-zagging . in and out of cones during the first two or three minutes was fine, but . the quality with the ball at my feet gradually plummeted. You try to ensure that your touches are assured, but all I could really think about was: ‘When can I stop?’ Next came the small-sided game. It was only 10 minutes, but after the Hoff Test it was 10 minutes too long. The final tests: Sami says 'the final whistle was a sweet, sweet sound' after a tormenting challenge . Pacing myself was the key here, but shaking off what went before was easier said than done. The speed . of the game dropped dramatically towards the end, every player petrified . that a misplaced pass would lead to an unnecessary burst of speed to retrieve the ball. The final whistle was a sweet, sweet sound, as was the moment I stepped out of the Condition Zone and into the east London air. I lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes. So what effect will 90 minutes of play in the Amazon rainforest at Manaus, chasing 11 Italians, have on England on Saturday? The weigh-in: Sami lost a kilo in weight and 1.5 litres of fluid in just 20 minutes in the heat . Results: How will England players fare after 90 minutes of chasing 11 Italians on Saturday?","Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel was 'gasping for air' after just 10 minutes .

"By . Charlie Scott . Cristiano Ronaldo will miss Portugal’s penultimate warm-up game ahead of the World Cup as he continues to struggle for fitness. The Portuguese Football Federation confirmed Ronaldo has been ruled out of the clash against Mexico in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Saturday, along with defender Pepe and midfielder Raul Meireles. The Real Madrid forward has been struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there are serious fears he may miss Portugal’s opening game of the World Cup against Germany on June 16. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ronaldo train for the first time with the Portugal squad . Out: Cristiano Ronaldo is struggling with a knee injury and will miss Saturday's friendly with Mexico . Raising the bar: Ronaldo still has a little way to go before confirming his fitness for the finals . ‘The situation is evolving and our expectations are evolving constantly,’ Portugal boss Paulo Bento told reporters in Foxborough, when asked when the 29-year-old would be fit. ‘When he’s ready to play is a decision that will be made just like any other player, regardless of who it is. As soon as he is ready to train, we will make that announcement. ‘We have to prepare for Germany regardless. The decision of if he will play and when is up to me, the player and the doctors. Ronaldo is not the only good player we have.’ Portugal will play their final warm-up game on Tuesday against Republic of Ireland before flying from the United States to Brazil. Despite his injuries, Ronaldo has spoken of his desire to win the World Cup with his national side. And while the national team captain admits Portugal are not favourites for the World Cup – they have been drawn in a group with Germany, Ghana and the United States – he said he would like to win a title with the national team ‘one day’. Relaxed: Ronaldo missed the friendly with Greece but was in jovial mood alongside Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao . ‘We aren’t favourites but we will try to perform our best as always. We know we have a difficult group stage,’ he told sportlobster.com. ‘In my opinion, we have the strongest group of the World Cup, but we should take it one step at a time. ‘We have an important opener against Germany, before we face Ghana and finally the United States. Our goal is obviously to pass the group stage and then we’ll see. ‘It fills me with pride, satisfaction, pleasure and honour to represent and captain the Portuguese national team but it is also a big responsibility. ‘I hope I win a title with the national team one day.'","Real Madrid forward is struggling with knee injury .

"By . David Kent . He may have left the WAGs behind, but England manager Roy Hodgson has made one concession sure to please his players training in Miami for the World Cup. Tomato ketchup and brown sauce are back on the menu after being banned by former boss Fabio Capello. The World Cup campaign in South Africa four years ago was strictly sauceless as the Italian coach frowned on the high salt and sugar content of the condiments. Training days: England continue their preparations for the World Cup during their camp in Miami . But with the England players losing so much sweat training in the heat and humidity of Florida to prepare for the conditions they will face in Brazil, Hodgson has decided a little extra salt and sugar from the sauces will do no harm. Butter â€“ previously banned for its high salt and fat content â€“ is also back on the menu. Even in the cooler climes of Portugal and Burton-upon-Trent, the England management have tried to recreate Amazonian conditions by making the players wear several layers so they sweat more. 'We are allowed (ketchup and brown sauce) now,' said Ben Foster, who will start against Ecuador on Wednesday. 'The food is amazing. There are seven or eight different stations of everything you could want.' Foster also revealed that the players have been put through 'brutal' sessions on exercise bikes in saunas to improve their fitness. 'When we were in Portugal we wore underarmour, t-shirts, zip up tops and a wet top over that,' the England goalkeeper said. Saucy: England's players will be allowed ketchup and brown sauce during the World Cup . 'When it was 22 degrees (centigrade) the lads were losing 2kg in sweat in every training session. 'We are trying to replicate the heat and humidity (of Brazil) 'Even at St George's Park last week we trained in the morning, lunch, slept for an hour and then did bike sessions in heat chambers to get ready. 'We've been doing half hour sessions in there. It's brutal, really hard work. But no-one's grumbled or moaned about it, just got on with it.' Roy Hodgson has left no stone unturned in his bid to get the players in the best possible condition for the World Cup. The England boss has brought a . psychiatrist, sports scientists, fitness coaches and a nutritionist . along with him to Miami and they will all stop with the team until they . are eliminated from the World Cup.

"By . Paul Donnelley . Forget luxury machines and expensive beans, scientists have uncovered the secret behind the perfect cup of coffee - reasonably hard tap water. Coffee-loving experts used different types of water to find out how coffee flavours differed. They found water composition made a ‘dramatic difference’ to coffee from the same bean - with certain types of hardness boosting the taste. Scroll down for video . Coffee-loving experts used different types of water to find out how coffee flavours differed . High magnesium ion levels were found to increase the extraction of coffee into water, though high bicarbonate levels were bad for flavour. Sodium rich water - such as that produced by water softeners - was also not beneficial to taste, according to chemist Christopher Hendon of the University of Bath. ‘Coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted,’ Mr Hendon, a PhD student at the university’s Centre for Sustainable Chemical Technologies, said. Howcast.com . ‘Coffee beans contain hundreds of chemicals; the precise composition depends on the type of bean and how it is roasted,’ say the scientists . ‘The flavour of the resulting coffee is determined by how much of these chemicals are extracted by the water, which is influenced by roast profile, grind, temperature, pressure and brew time. ‘We’ve found that the water composition is key to the proportions of sugars, starches, bases and acids extracted from a particular roast.’ The coffee industry currently uses guidelines on the ideal water for coffee extraction from the Speciality Coffee Association of Europe, which puts emphasis on measuring ionic conductivity to quantify the total dissolved solids. However, the research found it was in fact the proportions of these ions that affected the extraction, and therefore the taste, of the coffee. ‘Hard water is generally considered to be bad for coffee, but we found it was the type of hardness that mattered - while high bicarbonate levels are bad, high magnesium ion levels increase the extraction of coffee into water and improve the taste,’ Mr Hendon said.","Water composition makes a ‘dramatic difference’ to coffee from same bean .

"By . Mark Mcghee . I began collecting Panini World Cup stickers with my five-year-old son Archie several weeks ago. This was my attempt to indoctrinate him into the  football world and to initiate his journey as a lover of the game - a journey which we all know will be full of ecstatic highs and lows of anguish. What better place to begin the wee lad’s journey than in Brazil? Home: Brazil will provide a brilliant backdrop to the World Cup, but don't expect them to win the tournament . To an extent, my mission has succeeded. He is aware that the World Cup is coming and that there are many teams taking part, but he still can’t get his head round why Scotland are not going to be there! Many more of us feel the same. I have enjoyed the process of  opening the little packets to reveal the next exciting group of players who will be there in Brazil to thrill us with their skills. For the amount of money I have now invested I could have sent him there to see the Final live! One regret from my playing days is that I never played in a World Cup. Perhaps I will have the  opportunity as a Scotland coach to go to one. As we left the pitch at Craven Cottage last week, Gordon commented on the performance of the Tartan Army that night. ‘Imagine going to a World Cup with that lot,’ he said. I dare to imagine! Support: The Brazil national team will be under pressure to perform on home soil . As the opening match approaches the excitement is growing. Who’s in each squad? Who’s left out? Who’s injured? Who will be the stars? Which team will be the surprise package? Ultimately, who will win this magnificent football fiesta? Many pundits have the host nation as the team to beat. I’m afraid I’m going to be a party pooper and  disagree. I believe that, having won Group A, they will exit at the first knockout stage, where they will lose to the team who finishes second in Group B - most likely Holland, but possibly Spain. Unlike some of the other contenders, I don’t believe they have strong enough attacking options. There are only six teams who can win the competition. I recommend that you extrapolate the draw on the wallchart included within today’s paper and I guarantee that most of us will arrive at very similar outcomes. Come together: A host of world class players including Mario Balotelli (above) will be on show . In the semi-finals, I have Germany playing the Netherlands and  Argentina facing Spain. I would love the Final to be between Spain and Argentina but the draw makes that seem unlikely. Keeping the best players healthy and fresh can be key to a prolonged run in the tournament. Those teams who enjoy a more straightforward group stage will benefit over those teams who have to fight every step of the way to make the first  knockout stage. England, Uruguay and Italy find themselves in just such a group and could suffer as a consequence.When Gordon took over the national team, we discussed at length what we could possibly do  to improve performances and results. During those deliberations, I mentioned that I was often struck by how much more sophisticated the playing style of many European club sides and international teams was in comparison to ours and, indeed, England’s. Teams place far greater emphasis on technique and on ball retention than many British teams do. The outstanding difference, though, is in the shape of teams and the variety and complexity of the movement that they achieve within their  various systems. The British model is far too rigid and relies too heavily on the strength of individual players than a more joined-up team performance. The individual is important and can often be the difference between winning and not winning but that is secondary to the team plan which is designed to make it as difficult as possible for the opposition to mark and track match-winning players. Pedigree: Chile's Alexis Sanchez will be one to watch during the World Cup in Brazil . It gives the flair players space and time to exploit the opposition’s weaknesses. That is the reason I believe England will once again struggle at a World Cup. England have some terrific players but their system and  strategy are too simplistic to upset the best teams in the world. England enjoy what is more like a boxing match than the chess game that Spain and Argentina will aspire to. I’ve been struck by the publicity that has been given to the  ‘legacy’ of Glasgow’s Commonwealth Games, something that looks like being an extremely positive event for the entire nation. The Games give us the opportunity to showcase our beautiful country and demonstrate what great hosts we are. In addition an infrastructure, which will benefit our children in the coming years, will be left for the nation to enjoy. Shame: Wales and Real Madrid star Gareth Bale may never get to play at a World Cup . What will be Brazil’s legacy? Several revamped stadia, some improved local infrastructure and the huge disappointment of being the hosts and not even making the Final. Hosting a World Cup is a  high-risk undertaking for any nation. The impact it has on a  country is no longer a positive  exercise in ‘cost and benefit’. The process of deciding how and where World Cups are held must be reviewed. The pantomime that is the proposed 2022 Qatar World Cup is further evidence that something fundamental in world football has to change for the sake of the game’s integrity and to make the finals affordable in the future. All that said, the backdrop Brazil will provide for football’s showpiece competition will make this the most spectacular World Cup ever. Talent: Neutrals will be hoping Luis Suarez can recover from knee surgery to take part in Brazil . New media, improved technology, global communications, the music, the colour and the Brazilian people will make this the greatest show  on earth. There are very few of the great players who won’t be there. Gareth Bale is the prime example. Like his fellow countryman Ryan Giggs, the Welsh superstar may never play in the finals. The World Cup finals provide us with the opportunity to see so many great players. Times have changed though as we see so many of them playing regularly in the English Premier League and in the  Champions League. Cristiano  Ronaldo, Neymar, Luka Modric, Xavi, Andres Iniesta, Robin van Persie, Yaya Toure, Luis Suarez. The list goes on: Mario Balotelli (love him or hate him), Edin Dzeko, Mesut Ozil and so on. Conspicuous by their absence from my hit list are any Argentinians. In my book, they come under a  separate heading. That of World Cup winners 2014. Star: Lionel Messi (right) deserves to win the World Cup for being the best player to have played to game . Maxi Rodriguez, Angel di Maria, Ezequiel Lavezzi, Sergio Aguero, Gonzalo Higuain. What other squad could have left out Carlos Tevez? Then, of course, they have Lionel Messi, for me the best player ever to have played the game. For that alone, he deserves a World Cup  winner’s medal. They have power, pace, a healthy measure of cynicism in defence and an abundance of attacking options. Crucially, they have the brilliant Messi. There are others to look out for. Some less known to us in Europe. Players who have the opportunity to make themselves household names. Look out for Alexis Sanchez of Chile, Xherdan Shaqiri of Switzerland, France’s Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani of Uruguay, Christian Noboa of Ecuador and also Enzo Perez. The Benfica man is one of the less recognisable names in the  Argentina squad but he will anchor the midfield and allow Messi the freedom to win the World Cup. I can’t wait for the show to begin. Pressure: All eyes will be on Neymar to see if the Brazilian can inspire his team to World Cup success .","Brazil will provide a brilliant backdrop to the World Cup but the host nation won't win the summer tournament .

"By . Brad Gilbert . Andy Murray says he will have studied some videos ahead of his match against Rafael Nadal and I am pretty certain what three of those showreels will have been. One will have been the first set he played against the Spaniard in last month’s Italian Open quarter-finals, which he won 6-1 and was, in my view, the best tennis Andy has ever played on clay. Two others will be the most recent victories of Novak Djokovic over Nadal — in April’s Miami final and the Italian final two weeks last Sunday. These were masterclasses in how to beat the world No 1. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Mike Dickson preview the semi-finals in Paris . Post-match: Andy Murray congratulates Rafael Nadal after the Spaniard beat him in Rome last month . Preparing: Murray plays a forehand during a practice session on Thursday as fitness trainer Matt Little looks on . The orthodox wisdom has been that the best way to play the great Spaniard is to go more to his backhand, but that has changed in my view and Djokovic, who has beaten him in their past four meetings, has had a lot of success hitting hard to Nadal’s supposedly stronger forehand side. Over the years, Nadal’s backhand has become an incredibly solid shot, partly because he is a natural right-hander. His defence is phenomenal on that wing. Another factor is that Rafa’s biggest weapon of all is the ‘inside-out’ forehand he hits when running around his backhand — these are both good reasons not to overdo the hitting towards that side of the court. Murray has to take the ball on in the way he did in Rome. At times in that match he really hurt Nadal with his backhand and by hitting hard and flat to him on both sides. It was a contest he could have won. Silverware: Novak Djokovic (right) holds the trophy after beating Nadal in the final of the Italian Open in Rome . I also think you will see the Scot use . the drop shot more than he did against Gael Monfils, who gets fired up . chasing into the net. I have really enjoyed watching Andy over the past two weeks and this is the first time I have seen him with his ‘mojo’ back since Wimbledon. There have been spells here when he has played superb clay-court tennis, with his movement outstanding and that backhand better than ever. Whatever the result today I think it will put him in extremely good shape for the grass-court season. Feeling good: Murray has played superb tennis on the clay of Paris during his run to the semi-finals . Can he beat Nadal? I do not sense any great vulnerability in the Spaniard, although his serve has not been quite as strong as previously. Clearly he is the solid favourite but if Andy manages to dictate for long enough then he has a chance. A word of warning is that if the predicted hot weather materialises that is good for Rafa, as it will add zip and bounce to his ground-strokes.","Murray's 6-1 first set against Nadal at the Italian Open last month was his best ever tennis on clay .

"By . David Kent . Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is in a state of disbelief as he comes to terms with his late World Cup call-up. France coach Didier Deschamps summoned Schneiderlin, along with Montpellier winger Remy Cabella, to fill the void left in his squad by injuries to Bayern Munich star Franck Ribery and Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier. While Ribery described his absence as 'like a death in the soul', for Schneiderlin it is a dream come true - but he admits he almost did not pick up the telephone to Deschamps on Thursday.

'I didn't answer the call to start with because I did not recognise the number,' the uncapped 24-year-old told L'Equipe. Once Deschamps made contact, though, he had exciting news for Schneiderlin. 'He told me two players were injured so I needed to be ready, and that he would contact me the next day to tell me if I must come,' said the Saints player. 'After that call, I needed a bit of time before I could sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about what would happen the next day.'He did not promise me anything, just that I needed to be ready.

"By . Kirk Maltais . Charges were filed Thursday in an investigation into an alleged swingers party last May that turned into a violent ruckus after an argument between the spouses of two Denver Police officers escalated into a full-blown altercation between the two cops, with punches thrown and a gun being drawn. Police say that officers Steven Sloan and Jeremy Ownbey, both members of the Denver Police Department since 2006, had gotten together, along with wives Stephanie Sloan and Jamie Ownbey, for an alleged swinger's party on May 19 at the Sloan's home in Aurora, Colorado. Both officers were off-duty at the time. All parties were drinking alcohol when an argument began between the Sloans and the Ownbeys. The Sloans asked the Ownbeys to leave, but on their way out, Jamie Ownbey allegedly punched Stephanie Sloan. Steven, in defense of his wife, then punched Jamie. The two husbands then began to fight. The altercation ended when Steven Sloan drew a handgun, prompting the Ownbeys to leave. Jeremy Ownbey later returned to the Sloan's house to talk to police, appearing visibly intoxicated and even admitting to police that he was drunk. Jamie Ownbey (pictured left) and Steven Sloan (pictured right), two of the four parties involved with the swinging party that ended with violence in Denver, Colorado . No sobriety tests were performed on Ownbey by the Aurora Police Department, who responded to the scene at 11:30pm that evening. Instead, officers drove Ownbey and his vehicle back to his home. On Thursday, Jeremy and Jamie Ownbey were both charged with two . counts of misdemeanor child abuse. Jamie was charged misdemeanor assault . and Jeremy with trespassing. The child abuse charges stem from the . couple allegedly leaving their two small children alone at home while at the Sloan's residence for the party. According to police, the officers also failed to ask Jeremy who . was watching his children while the party was taking place. According to court documents obtained by KUSA, the argument began when Stephanie felt that Jamie had been disrespectful at different points in the evening. According to the documents, Stephanie told police that Jamie was 'forcing' her to drink tequila shots, and at one point had taken off her top, exposing her lace underwear. In court documents, Both Jeremy and Jamie Ownbey had been involved in previous swinging with Steven Sloan.

"By . George Grant . Leeann Dempster has urged angry Hibs fans to focus on her bid to turn the ailing club around - instead of channelling their energies into ousting embattled chairman Rod Petrie. In her first extensive interview since becoming chief executive at Easter Road, Dempster assured sceptical supporters that she would be given complete freedom to do her job, without interference from the unpopular Petrie. And she cast doubt over Terry Butcher’s future as manager by refusing to confirm the Englishman would still be in charge of the relegated outfit when they kick off next season in the Championship. In charge: Leeann Dempster has assured Hibs fans that she will be in complete control of the club . Former Motherwell CEO Dempster, who only began work as Petrie’s successor on Monday, insisted she would prefer to  hold formal talks with Butcher first before deciding which direction the club would be taking in a highly-competitive second tier featuring Rangers and city rivals Hearts. Her arrival in Leith has coincided with the launch of a ‘Petrie Out’ campaign - fronted by a number of prominent former players and supporters’ organisations in an attempt to oust the 58-year-old from his non-executive role. A rally is planned for this morning outside the stadium, where Dempster is scheduled to meet a cross-section of fans represented on the Working Together umbrella group. However, she ‘categorically’ rejected fears from supporters - who blame Petrie for the club’s relegation - that she will not be allowed to bring about the changes necessary. Asked in an extensive interview what she made of the row that had greeted her arrival at the club, Dempster said: ‘It’s not been as I anticipated, let’s put it that way. It’s been a challenging first few days, quite possibly the most challenging a new CEO could face, but I’m not fazed by it. ‘We find ourselves in a very challenging position and we need to refocus, but it is what it is; I can’t change anything. I just need to get on with the job.’ In response to whether she would be allowed to conduct the changes she wants, she added: ‘I can be quite clear on that. I was running a football club, and let’s be honest a very successful football club, and when I was approached to come here that was one of my main concerns. Am I going to have the autonomy to go and do the job, the job that is required at this football club? ‘Let’s be frank, Hibernian hasn’t had the best on-field results in the last couple of years. It’s a matter of fact, we haven’t performed the way we need to. I saw an opportunity to come in and improve on that. On his way? There is no guarantee that Terry Butcher will still be manager at Easter Road next season . ‘I wasn’t going to walk away from a job where I had complete autonomy, the absolute support of the chairman to actually do the job that was required, the absolute support of the board to do the job required, to walk into another post where my hands were going to be tied. ‘I think I’ve got enough integrity, and I would certainly hope reputation, that people would know I wouldn’t do that. ‘I’ve got the ball now, the responsibility is on me, the focus needs to go on me. ‘The choices I make and the recommendations I make to the board are going to be the ones which are hopefully going to take the club forward and which I will be judged on. ‘To say that the chairman needs to go is, in my view, quite a simplistic approach and actually probably quite an unfair one. ‘I’m picking up the baton, if you like, and it’s me that is going to have to take that responsibility. ‘We’ve got a board of directors, we operate independently, and part of my viewpoint here is we have to start acting more like a football club than a corporate entity, and that is the direction I want to take us in. Baptism of fire: Leeann Dempsey, pictured with Rod Petrie, admits it's been a challenging start to her role . ‘Is it going to be my way forward? Categorically. I can be asked that question any number of times and it will be the same answer, and I have to be judged on that.’ Dempster was less clear on the future of Butcher, who was widely perceived to have escaped the axe despite presiding over the team’s relegation. The pair met last week when a number of players were being freed, but at that point Dempster was still officially an employee of Motherwell. She insisted that discussions with the Englishman - who arrived at the club in November when Hibs were seventh in the table - would not have been appropriate at that time. The duo have since spoken on the phone but will meet in person next week. Responding to a question on whether Butcher would still be in charge next season, Dempster pointedly failed to take the opportunity to firm up the former Motherwell and Inverness manager’s position. Bouncebackability? Hibernian players stand dejected after their Scottish Premiership Play Off final defeat . She told Hibernian TV: ‘I met Terry for the first time in the capacity of him being the Hibernian manager last week when I went to the training facility. At that time emotions were obviously very high and relegation had just happened. ‘I was still CEO of Motherwell at that point, so no decisions or formal discussions could take place. ‘So, Terry went off to finish his family holiday and has since come back. We’ve spoken on a few occasions since and there are plans to meet Terry next week. ‘Once we’ve had that conversation and we’ve come to a conclusion on the direction of the club I can come out and talk. ‘But it was far too early to say I would do anything at that point and as my previous role was still intact it wasn’t appropriate either.’","Leeann Dempster assures Hibs fans she's in complete control .

The Cobra beat George Groves on arguably the biggest night in British boxing history with an eighth round knockout last Saturday, bringing him to 12 successive world title fights. But Calzaghe, who retired undefeated in 2008 after victories over American greats Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones Jnr on US soil, thinks the man he never fought doesn't deserve such high praise.

Pundits tend to favour Calzaghe when asked who would win a hypothetical fight between the Pride of Wales and Nottingham’s finest, though Froch can arguably point to the more impressive CV. But Calzaghe says there is no debate to be had, insisting Froch isn’t in his league and arguing his potential fight with Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr would be a mistake. ‘A lot of people make comparisons to Carl Froch’s career to mine, but I don’t think there’s a comparison,’ he told Wales Online. ‘I was undefeated, went to America and conquered America. I defeated two legends out there at different weights. ‘I was the number one fighter, the number one champion at super-middleweight and light-heavyweight. ‘Froch has gone out to America and lost where he was bossed by Andre Ward.’ Opinionated: Calzaghe thinks Froch will never be truly great unless he goes back and finishes off Andre Ward .

He is a top fighter, but not a member of the elite. ‘If you are going to fight in America, go and fight the best guy and try and beat him. And the champion is Andre Ward. ‘But I don’t think Froch has the ability to do that. He has obviously had a great career.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Patrick Mouratoglou believes Andy Murray is on track to do well at Wimbledon despite the deflating way in which his French Open ended. Murray had impressed on his way to the semi-finals for only the second time at Roland Garros only to suffer his worst ever grand slam defeat at the hands of Rafael Nadal. The Spaniard, who will bid for a ninth title against Novak Djokovic on Sunday, took just an hour and 40 minutes to win 6-3 6-2 6-1, Murray winning only 10 points on Nadal's serve in the match. Deflated: Andy Murray was flattened in straight sets by Rafael Nadal in Friday's French Open semi-final . No hiding place: The Scotsman was completely overwhelmed by the Spaniard, losing 6-3 6-2 6-1 . King of clay: Nadal is on track for an unprecedented ninth crown at Roland Garros . Murray will now seek solace in the grass of home, beginning the defence of his Aegon Championships title at Queen's Club on Wednesday before preparing to step out on Centre Court as the reigning Wimbledon champion. The 27-year-old had certainly expected better of himself, particularly having come close to beating Nadal on clay in Rome three weeks ago. He hinted it might take him a while to get over the drubbing, but Mouratoglou believes Murray can feel very positive about his form. The Frenchman, who coaches Serena Williams, told Press Association Sport: 'I think everyone was surprised. 'They had this match in Rome that was so good and that Murray played so well. I think that's the match that put him back on track, even though he lost it. We expected at least a battle, and there was no battle at all. 'If you don't put doubts in Rafa's mind, if you don't press on his weaknesses, then of course he's so dangerous. I think Murray let him play, he gave him too much time and he didn't hurt him. 'It was a bad day for him but I think he was too tired. When you're tired against Rafa on clay, you have zero chance, that's it. 'I think it was a very positive Roland Garros for Murray because his game is back to a very good level, and he knows it. This match he forgot already for sure. 'He gained a lot of confidence through this tournament. He knows what he needs to improve because it was obvious in this Roland Garros. Much too many ups and downs, going from offence to defence too many times for no reason.' Guru: French coach Patrick Mouratoglou watches on at last year's Wimbledon Championships . Guru: The 44-year-old is the current coach of US tennis superstar Serena Williams . Attention will now turn back to when Murray will appoint a new head coach, having been without one since splitting from Ivan Lendl in March. He rated his chances of having someone in place before Wimbledon, the most stressful two weeks of his year, as 50/50. Mouratoglou said: 'We have this saying in France that it's better to be alone than with bad company. 'If he doesn't find the right person yet then he has to wait but for sure it's important to be back with someone with new goals, to have new things to work on in your game, to have a different voice, to have something new to bring excitement back. 'But I think he can do well also without the coach because he has so much experience. He's won two grand slams and he'll have all the crowd behind him at Wimbledon, and he's playing well again. 'He shouldn't panic. If he has someone it's better, but if he doesn't he can still do well.' Murray admitted he would rather have a few days off to lick his wounds and recover from the physical strain of two tough weeks on the clay rather than heading straight onto the grass. It is at least a much less physical surface while, if Murray needs his spirits lifting, returning to the scene of his greatest triumph should be just the thing. Watchful eye: Murray is on the hunt for a new coach following his split with Ivan Lendl . Mentor: The Czech legend helped turn Murray into a two-time Grand Slam champion . 'I expect to play well there,' said the Scot of Wimbledon, which begins on June 23. 'I'm really looking forward to going back. I think it will give me a lot of positive energy. 'I'm glad I'm back playing to a level that was able to get me through to the last stage of slams. I just need that extra few per cent so that I can give myself a chance to try and win them again. 'But the grass will obviously help me. It's a surface I have always enjoyed playing on. I think it's been my most successful surface over my career. 'I'm really looking forward to Wimbledon especially. It's only two and a half weeks away, so I don't have too long to wait.'","Mouratoglou believes Murray is on track to defend his Wimbledon title .

"By . Ian Laybourn . Castleford turned the clock back 28 years in putting holders Wigan out of the Tetley's Challenge Cup in an absorbing quarter-final at the DW Stadium. The Tigers demonstrated their sparkling Super League form is no fluke by pulling off a thoroughly-deserved 16-4 triumph to inflict on Wigan their first home Challenge Cup defeat since 1986. Castleford were also the victors that day on their way to lifting the trophy at Wembley for the last time and they now join Leeds and Widnes in the semi-final draw, which will be made after the last quarter-final between Bradford and Warrington on Sunday. Last four: Castleford players celebrate after beating Wigan 16-4 to reach the Challenge Cup semi-finals . Roar! Castleford Tigers congratulate  Lee Jewitt (C) after his late try sealed victory at the DW Stadium . The Tigers were clinging to a six-point lead when former Wigan prop Lee Jewitt burst through a tiring Warriors defence to score his first try for the club on only his third appearance three minutes from the end to seal a famous victory. Wigan coach Shaun Wane had accused the Yorkshiremen of 'disrespect' in the build-up but the Tigers had every right to feel confident after winning their last two matches against the Warriors and they were good value for the hat-trick. A downpour before kick-off made the handling difficult and no doubt contributed to a scrappy opening in which both teams squandered promising scoring positions by conceding penalties for obstruction, the rule that is seen as the current blight on the game. Video referee Ben Thaler angered the big travelling contingent by disallowing a try to Castleford full-back Luke Dorn on 28 minutes for the slightest of obstructions and produced ironic cheers when he gave the green light to winger James Clare's touchdown two minutes later. Diving in: Castleford Tigers' Kirk Dixon goes over for a try past Wigan Warriors Matty Bowen (R) It was the only try of the first half but the Tigers could have had three or four with steadier finishing and a touch more luck. The visitors failed to make the most of clear breaks from right winger Kirk Dixon and prop Andy Lynch, while a legal ball steal on Lynch by Wigan second rower John Bateman helped keep the Warriors in the game by half-time despite being totally outplayed. Spurred by Wane's interval pep talk, the holders visibly attempted to raise the pace of the game in the second half and they looked more threatening . Teenage wing sensation Joe Burgess, one of nine Wigan players called into the England squad, failed to take Liam Farrell's pass with the line beckoning and skipper Sean O'Loughlin got over the line only to have the ball knocked from his grasp. Sandwich: Wigan's George Williams is tackled by Castleford's Jake Webster (L) and Andy Lynch (R) Castleford were forced to scramble heroically to keep their line intact and were especially grateful to forward Oliver Holmes for a last-ditch tackle on George Williams after Dan Sarginson came up with a half-break. O'Loughlin, Michael McIlorum and Anthony Gelling were all held up agonisingly short but the pressure finally told on 62 minutes when Farrell took Williams' pass 15 metres out and spun out of a two-man tackle to touch down for Wigan's 100th try of the season. However, the holders failed to draw level when Matty Smith's conversion attempt went wide and with that went their last chance to keep their hold on the trophy. The Tigers had spurned a clear-cut chance when Dorn sliced through the first line of defence but captain Michael Shenton could not take his pass cleanly. Catch me! Castleford's Luke Dorn skips away from Wigan's Anthony Gelling (C) and Dom Manfredi (R) However, they demonstrated slicker finishing 11 minutes from the end to seal a memorable win. Dorn once more linked effectively from deep and centre Jake Webster came up with a superb one-handed flick pass which was taken brilliantly by his winger Kirk Dixon, who went over for all-important try. Sneyd could not add the goal but Castleford made sure when Jewitt, who joined the club last month from French club Limoux, charged over for his side's third try, with Sneyd kicking his second goal. Wigan finished a well-beaten side but will not have to wait to get their revenge, with the two teams meeting in Super League at the DW Stadium next Friday.","Castleford Tigers defeated Wigan Warriors 16-4 in the Tetley's Challenge Cup quarter finals .

Roy Hodgson prowled the turf in the searing Miami heat inspecting his England squad through his sunglasses, evoking the lyrics of Timbuk3 who claimed the future was so bright they had to wear shades. Hodgson fitted neatly into the role of the ‘crazy teacher who wears dark glasses’ and his players were the pupils ‘who love their classes’. Things were going great, although the most eye-catching among those players was undoubtedly Raheem Sterling, who cannot play against Honduras because he was sent off against Ecuador on Wednesday.

With thrilling ease and fearless spirit, Sterling would keep collecting the ball and snaking towards goal with a trail of bodies in his wake in the eight-a-side games set up by Hodgson’s coaching staff at the Barry University sports campus. He looked fantastic, free from concern over the red card and how it may affect his chances of featuring in the World Cup finals. Hodgson has shrugged it off, too. The England boss planned to play him from the start against Honduras. ‘I even held him back a bit on Wednesday,’ he said. ‘As you can imagine he was absolutely gutted to be sent off, as were we. ‘But he . doesn’t seem to have taken it to heart. The most important thing is he’s . still making me aware he’s a player who can inflict an awful lot of . damage on the opposition.

Hot, hot heat: The England players feel the heat in Miami during training .

"By . Louise Cheer . Foreign chefs, bricklayers and tilers will no longer require a sponsor to work in Australia come July in a bid by the Federal Government to fill labour and skills shortages. The three professions have been added to the Skilled Occupation List which means workers do not have to be sponsored by employers for a permanent visa. But the move has been slammed by unions who say the Government should be looking out for domestic workers instead of encouraging more overseas workers to come to Australia. Foreign chefs will no longer have to be sponsored to come work in Australia from July 1 . The changes were made following advice from the Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency based on labour market, education and training, migration and general economic and demographic data, and stakeholder submissions. Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection Michaelia Cash said Australian residents would always come first. 'The Abbott Government believes that where there is an Australian who is ready, willing and able to do the job, they should always be considered first,' she said. 'However, it would be simplistic to say that there is always an Australian willing and available to fill a particular position in various geographical locations within Australia, and it is the role of the skilled migration program to fill the gap where such shortages exist. 'It is important to remember that a business that is forced to close due to an inability to source vital skilled labour is a business that employs no-one.' A Department of Immigration spokesman said figures indicated chefs have been in shortage for the past 10 years, which threatens the sustainability of the hospitality and tourism industry. He also said the vacancy rate for the sector was more than four times the national average, according to industry experts. The union who represents chefs is United Voice and its acting national secretary David O'Byrne said he was 'very concerned' about the move. 'We don’t think labour issues within the industry need for this to occur,' he said. 'The hospitality industry is very good at and easily able to attract staff through the industry.' Mr O'Byrne said instead of going overseas for jobs the government should be investing in training and furthering career paths. 'In the era of Masterchef are you telling me there aren’t people who don’t want to become chefs? It just doesn’t make sense,' he said. Tilers and bricklayers have also been added to the Skilled Occupation List that currently has 188 jobs on it . Bricklayers and tilers have also been included on the list because of a predicted increase in demand coupled with a fall in apprenticeship completions. Based on 2012 projections by the Department of Employment, there will be a 13.4 per cent increase in the number of people employed as bricklayers over five years to November 2017 and a 17.3 per cent increase in the number of people employed as tilers occupation over the same period of time. Michaelia Cash, the assistant minister for immigration, hopes it will help address the skills shortage in these industries . But Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union's David Noonan said the Abbott Government's reasoning for adding the three occupations to the list were unfounded. 'In particular the building trades that the government intend to put back on the list are trades where there are no shortages and even the Master Builders Association have acknowledged that,' he said. 'It seems that the Coalition again is putting the Australian workers' interest last. 'Rather than ramping up migration in these areas they should be addressing the collapse in apprentice numbers in these trades. 'It’s extraordinary the Government would do this would do this based on the evidence and to the people who pay their wages.' The number of skilled workers to be taken in under the program has been capped at 43,990. To ensure these industries are not dominated by overseas workers, a ceiling cap of six per cent of the workforce is enforced for all industries, but the chef workforce will be dropped to three per cent for six months from July 1 and will then be reviewed. The department's spokesman said it would increase if no 'adverse behaviour' was identified. Currently there are 188 jobs on the Skilled Occupation List - including accountants, social workers, psychotherapists, fitter and turners, stonemasons and teachers. David Noonan of the CFMEU says the government was not looking after Australian workers by introducing the move .","The three professions have been added to the Skilled Occupation List .

Warren Ryan used the term 'old darky' during his commentary of May 23's clash between the Rabbitohs and Bulldogs . Late last month Ryan was suspended from the air after he compared a heated exchange between a referee and a player during a rugby league game to a scene out of the classic movie, Gone with the Wind, using the term 'old darky'. Ryan's colleague David Morrow was also suspended pending an investigation. The 73-year-old's resignation ends a career of more than two decades with the radio station. 'The ABC has suspended me pending an investigation, so I have resigned to save them the trouble of conducting it,' Ryan told Fairfax. Ryan said he outlined his reasoning for quitting the station in his letter. Sticking to his guns, the 73-year-old made no apologies for his remarks. 'In effect, I've brought forward my intended end of season retirement date.' Ryan also defended his colleague's involvement in the incident.

The 26-year-old, who lives in London with boyfriend Chris, has already forged a career as a  singer after being spotted by Take That star Gary Barlow in 2009. Since then she has released an album and sung the national anthem in front of her boyfriend and the crowds ahead of kick-off during last autumn's rugby internationals at Twickenham. Shaking things up: Classical singer Camilla Kerslake, pictured, is to star in a controversial new opera . Now Miss Kerslake is to take on her most controversial role to date after taking a starring role in a controversial new opera which includes plenty of sex, spirituality and plastic surgery. The work is the creation of composer Toni Castells and is due to be performed at this year’s Tête à Tête Festival. ‘It is not a traditional opera. It is a bit more about life and everything - and there are some potentially controversial songs,’ she explains. 'In the modern day things like sex, plastic surgery and spirituality need to be addressed. The classic opera is full of murder and adultery but what we are trying to say is more about modern issues. 'It’s to bring those issues out in the open. There’s a song called ""Fake Boobs"" which basically says it’s substance over the superficial. 'It is targeting people who are image obsessed who are so perfect on the outside but not so beautiful on the inside.' Rugby ace: Camilla's boyfriend is England rugby captain, Chris Robshaw, who is currently in New Zealand . Risk-taker: 'The classic opera is full of murder and adultery but what we are trying to say is more about modern issues.,' says Camilla, 26, pictured here . The opera, which is called Life from Light and was inspired by a BBC documentary exploring the origins of life on Earth, also boasts some toe-tapping tunes, according to Miss Kerslake. 'I loved the music,' she adds. 'It’s a real mish-mash of genres - you can just enjoy it for what it really is. 'It is basically an expression of human condition and is much more accessible to the average person on the street. This is a really exciting way to make opera more mainstream.' Miss Kerslake will make her Life from Light debut when she performs two songs from the opera at a charity gala in New Zealand on Saturday. Happy couple: During tomorrow's rugby match in Auckland, Camilla will be cheering her man on . Held in support of the Breast Cancer Aotearoa Coalition, the charity is one that's close to Miss Kerslake's heart, after it helped her mother, Deborah, 51, after she was diagnosed with the disease in 2011. Her appearance at the gala won't prevent her from cheering on her boyfriend Chris Robshaw the next morning however. 'I will be singing at a club at a charity do then dashing to Auckland for the England game before singing at another event the next day,' says Camilla. 'I’m off the plane then to the venue for my charity gig then I’m off the stage and straight onto the bus for the game. I will definitely be cheering on England.'","Camilla Kerslake, 26, from London, was spotted by Take That star in 2009 .

"By . Joe Brockman . Nat King Cole's family can never forget what it's like to be targeted by racists. Someone wrote the N-word in fire in the garden of their home, their dog was poisoned and there was a concerted campaign to get them out. And this wasn't in the racial cauldron of America's Deep South, but in the very liberal state of California. Nat King Cole was born into a deeply segregated society in Alabama, yet thanks to his huge talent he rose to prominence, overcoming hatred and bigotry from white supremacists. It is nearly 50 years since Nat died of lung cancer aged just 45, but today his three daughters are here to retell their story and introduce a  new generation to their father's courage – and music. Natalie, who followed her father into singing, says she hopes to bring home to people the truly shocking extent of the prejudice they – and all black people – had to face. Natalie wants to retell their story and introduce a  new generation to her father's courage and music. 'My parents tried to shield us from a lot of what was going on, but I remember one night when some people were letting off firecrackers in the rose bushes,' says Natalie, when I meet her and her younger sisters, twins Casey and Timolin in London. 'My mum went outside with a rolled-up newspaper to threaten them. 'And when my father was headlining in cabaret at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas we weren't allowed a room there because of our colour. We all had to stay at a little motel, including Dad. Back home, our Boxer dog Mr Cole died after eating poisoned meat that had been thrown over the fence. My father was devastated. He loved that dog.' Nat Cole was born in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1919 but his pastor father moved the family to Chicago when he was four to give them a better life than in the colour-segregated Southern states, which were dominated by the viciously racist Ku Klux Klan. Nat giving daughter Natalie, then aged seven, a music lesson in 1956 . He showed a prodigious talent for music from a young age and was soon regarded as one of the nation's best jazz pianists – he was nicknamed 'King' Cole because of the old nursery rhyme and it stuck. He first had success with the King Cole Trio but it was when he started singing that the group really began to do well. The hits kept coming: The Christmas Song, Unforgettable, Mona Lisa, Too Young are all still loved around the world. Nat would have been happy concentrating on his music but doing so as an equal to Frank Sinatra – his great friend and chart rival – was impossible. Even when, like Frank, Nat was performing in the big hotels, not only was he not allowed to stay there but he couldn't use the pool or even cross the casino floor. For many years he kept his head down; didn't complain and played to segregated or whites-only audiences. He even agreed to wear make-up to lighten up his skin for TV appearances so as not to offend white viewers. But still he was attacked. In 1948 he married his second wife Maria Ellington, the mother of Natalie, Casey and Timolin as well as  two children they adopted. When they bought their first house together in smart Hancock Park, Los Angeles, they were the first black family in the neighbourhood and many tried to hound them out. As well as the fire and the dog poisoning, the girls were rejected by the local school. All the neighbours had Nat's albums but no one wanted him living next door. A committee of property owners complained to him, 'We don't want any undesirables moving in.' He retorted, 'Neither do I. And if I see anybody undesirable coming in here, I'll be the first to complain.' 'Our father was a reluctant star, he loved what he did but didn't anticipate the success or the . issues. He wasn't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into . something bigger than he was' I ask his daughters why he stayed. Says Timolin, 'It was our mother. She wanted to raise the bar. That was the house she wanted and no one was going to push her out. She was also very light-skinned, which was a great advantage. She'd never really experienced racism before that.' Adds Natalie with a laugh, 'She never let anyone tell her what to do. She was a sophisticated lady who'd been to finishing school in Boston and as far as she was concerned she had more class and breeding than any of the people trying to push her out. She was a riot.' Nat was to . remain a reluctant figurehead of the civil rights movement when in 1956 . he became the first black host of a nationally syndicated TV show; the . Nat King Cole Show. From the start the show struggled to attract . sponsors so friends including Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Tony . Bennett and Eartha Kitt agreed to appear for free. But . white viewers in the South, outraged at seeing a black man hosting a TV . show, pressured the sponsors and advertisers to drop their funding of . it. They did. After . just a year Nat was forced to pull the plug saying 'Madison Avenue (the . New York headquarters of the big advertising agencies) is afraid of the . dark.' A recent TV documentary about his life – which included telling . anecdotes from Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett and Bruce Forsyth, who . regarded Nat as his hero – had this story at its heart. Nat King Cole with wife Maria Cole  and daughters Natalie and Carole and son Kelly at London's Savoy hotel in 1960 . 'Our father was a reluctant star,' says Natalie. 'He loved what he did but didn't anticipate the success or the issues. He wasn't trying to be a pioneer but his success turned into something bigger than he was. A lot of white folks couldn't get their brain around a black guy having his own show. They resented the fact that he was gifted and talented – but black. 'He paved the way for Oprah and Bill Cosby and all the young stars of today. But there was a lot of psychological stress and hardship. When he lost the show I think it made him sick. He hardly ever said a mean word or got angry. I think that's why he got ulcers.' He was also coming under pressure from the black community to stand up to segregation. 'They were outraged when he continued to perform in front of segregated audiences saying, 'I can't change the situation in a day.' Though he'd given money to groups campaigning in the South against segregation he was called an Uncle Tom, a traitor to his colour. 'Our father was a gentle giant,' says Casey. 'He spoke through his music and he was often criticised for that. You have to pick your battles. Today everyone would be sucking up to him but it was a different world. He had to suck up to them.' 'He paved the way for Oprah and Bill Cosby and all the young stars of today.' Natalie, the only one of Nat's children to follow him into a singing career – Ivy League educated Casey and Timolin both went into PR and now run a charity in their father's name – can empathise from her own experiences. 'When I was just starting out in the 1970s I was in Alabama with a group of people,' she recalls. 'We went to a restaurant and they refused to serve us. We were shocked; this was the 1970s. A sheriff came but only to tell us to move on. We were devastated.' Nat's life was cut short cruelly early. A heavy smoker, he was diagnosed with lung cancer in December 1964 and died two months later. Natalie, now 64, looks at her feet as she thinks about how, as a vulnerable 15-year-old, she numbed the pain of her beloved father's death with drugs. 'Losing Dad set me into a whole whirling dervish of stuff,' she says sadly. 'Smoking was one of the things I did – my mother went mad, she said, ""You couldn't have loved your father if you're smoking"". But I only stopped seven or eight years ago.' For Casey and Timolin, who are 11 years younger, it's hard to know what are memories of their father, and what are things they have been told. 'It's sad to think we didn't get to know him,' says Timolin. 'It's bittersweet because we've learned about who our father is through photographs and his music.' All three think it's important to keep their father's legacy going. 'Dad was one of a kind,' says Natalie with a smile. 'There will never be another Nat King Cole. They weren't expecting it when he showed up. He was such a classy lovely man, coming out of the South fairly uneducated, with this gift. He captivated the world with his voice.' Nat King Cole's The Extraordinary album is out now on Universal.","Nat King Cole suffered racism and was called a traitor by his own race .

The identical twins, born sharing the . same amniotic sac and placenta, are making progress toward going home . from the hospital, their parents say. 'It's still been crazy,' father Bill Thistlethwaite said. 'Everywhere we go, someone saw it. People are still talking about it.' Scroll down for video . Not the only one! Sarah Thistlethwaite, seen with daughters Jenna and Jillian, delivered her monoamniotic daughters on May 9 at Akron General Medical Center, as well . Growing girls: Mother Sarah Thistlethwaite, pictured, had been placed on a 57-day bed rest before she gave birth . Father: Bill Thistlethwaite to look lovingly at his new daughter . He said he and his wife, Sarah, were approached by people Saturday while having breakfast at a diner in their hometown of Orrville before going to visit the girls. They want to know how the twins are doing and express their good wishes, he said. Both girls are taking full bottles and have gained weight, each now at five pounds or more. Their rare birth condition is called monoamniotic, or 'mono mono,' and doctors say they occur in about one of every 10,000 pregnancies. A second pair born at Akron General the following week also are doing well, hospital spokeswoman Amy Kilgore said. Jenna was born first at four pounds, two ounces and 17 inches, with Jillian following 48 seconds later at three pounds, 13 ounces and 17.5 inches. They were born at 33 weeks and two days to their 32-year-old mother, a middle school math teacher. Proud: The Thistlethwaites say the girls are making progress toward going home from the hospital. A photo showing the girls holding hands taken shortly after birth May 9 at Akron General Medical Center has been widely seen on social media, in newspapers and on national TV . They were moved to Akron Children's Hospital after birth because they needed breathing assistance. If they continue to hit feeding milestones, they are on track to be home in another week or two, just before Father's Day. Thistlethwaite said he's been scrambling to finish painting their bedroom pink. Their 16-month-old son, Jaxon, has visited the girls and kissed them on the cheeks, his father said. Thistlethwaite has daydreamed about the time, years in the future, when he and his wife will show the girls their famous baby photo. 'I already feel like they're going to be best friends,' he said. 'They'll probably look at it and say, ""That makes sense because that's how we are.""' Jenna and Jillian were delivered by Caesarean section at 2:41pm at Akron General Medical Center, the Akron Beacon Journal reports, and were holding hands when presented to parents Sarah and Bill Thistlethwaite in the delivery room. 'They’re already best friends,' Sarah told the paper. 'I can’t believe they were holding hands. That’s amazing.' Touch: an adult hands touches one belonging to a tiny twin . Famous family: Jenna (on right) and Jillian (left) gained media attention last week when the twins were seen holding hands while they were presented to their parents . Dr. Melissa Mancuso, who delivered the monoamniotic girls along with Dr. Katherine Wolfe, told the paper that something like this normally .

Monoamniotic . twins are the rarest type, Mancuso told the paper, with risks including . birth defects and tangled umbilical cords that might kill a twin. Mother Sarah Thistlethwaite, a middle school math teacher, delivered the twins after spending 57 days in bed, according to the Beacon Journal, and her 15-month-old son Jaxon was looked after by family and friends while she waited to give birth. A hospital press release noted that Sarah, who took leave from her teaching position, was visited by husband Bill every day after work.","Jenna and Jillian were delivered by Caesarean section  at Akron General Medical Center on May 9 .

"By . Bianca London . Princess Beatrice is fast becoming the Royal Family's most enthusiastic gourmand, sampling London's finest culinary haunts night after night. Last night, the 25-year-old was spotted leaving Roka Mayfair, the upmarket haunt by Rainer Becker, creator and founder of Zuma, Roka and, most recently, Oblix at The Shard. In the last few months, she's visited the Chiltern Firehouse, Zuma, Nobu, Restaurant C, Balthazar, La Petite Maison, Les Trois Garcons and China Tang - it's a veritable roll-call of the capital's hottest dining destinations. Out AGAIN? Princess Beatrice loves to dine out and last night saw her enjoying the Japanese culinary delights of Roka in Mayfair . Last night's choice Roka is best known for its Japanese Robatayaki cuisine, but also serves up fresh sushi, sashimi and salads. Dishes include grilled lobster hot pot with crab miso butter and mitsuba, as well as rock shrimp, wasabi pea seasoning and chilli mayonnaise - although the website doesn't reveal the prices. Never encouraging if your means are more limited than Princess Bea's. The night before: Princess Beatrice enjoyed date night with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark at exclusive Mayfair restaurant, La Petite Masion on Tuesday night . Beatrice appeared in good spirits as she left the restaurant wearing a waist-cinching black dress with an Aztec-print jacket. Beatrice looked fresh-faced despite a late night the evening before, which saw her and long-term boyfriend Dave Clarke enjoying a low-key evening at La Petite Maison, a French restaurant in the heart of Mayfair. The flame-haired royal, who is making a name for herself as quite the fashionista, . looked sophisticated and chic in a fitted black dress, which she teamed . with a tailored monochrome blazer. Writing about the restaurant, a Square Meal reviewer writes: 'If you're pining for the Côte d'Azur, or neighbouring Liguria, you might consider heading over to La Petite Maison, which aims to capture some of that region's gastronomic spirit.' The menu features tender grilled veal . chops, lamb cutlets with smoked aubergine and whole sea bream cooked en . papillote with lemon and herbs. Who knew they were friends? Beatrice was last . week joined by long-term boyfriend David Clark a meal with Jimmy Carr . and his partner Karoline Copping . In one of . the more surprising buddy-ups of recent times, Princess Beatrice enjoyed a . double date last Wednesday with funny man Jimmy Carr. The two apparent pals dined out at exclusive London restaurant Zuma with their other halves. Beatrice . was joined by long-term boyfriend David Clark for the meal, while Jimmy . was accompanied by his partner Karoline Copping. Zuma in London's upmarket Knightsbridge is another of Becker's restaurants and describes itself as 'offering something completely new - a sophisticated twist on the traditional japanese izakaya style of informal eating and drinking. Dishes . include seared, miso marinated foie gras with umeboshi compote and . moromi miso marinated baby chicken, oven roasted on cedar wood. Yet . again, the website states no prices. She loves a night out! Princess Beatrice seems to be an unofficial restaurant reviewer and has visited the trendiest restaurants that London has to offer, such as The Chiltern Firehouse, right . Two weeks ago, she was . seen strolling hand-in-hand with Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas as . they enjoyed an evening out at Annabel's - a very exclusive private members club. The week before that, at the end of April, she enjoyed a romantic night out at celebrity hotspot, The Chiltern Firehouse, which she has visited a few times in recent weeks. 'Firehouse', as it is called (or hashtagged) by those who get to dine within its very exclusive confines, is the latest offering from hip hotelier André Balazs. The past fortnight alone has seen the likes of Tony Blair, Orlando Bloom, Lily Allen and Kate Moss dine there. Chiltern . Firehouse is part of the group owned by renowned hotelier André Balazs' collection of bespoke, luxury hotels which include celebrity favourites The Mercer in Soho, . New York, Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and Sunset Beach in Shelter . Island plus The Hamptons. Starters . include sea trout crudo, yellow mole, coriander (£11) and steak . tartare, pine nuts, chipotle and Firehouse hot sauce (£12), while main . courses include blackened salmon, sea kale, crispy skin and trout roe .

Mayfair in April, having enjoyed another gourmet dinner. While . most of us have to curtail nights out during the week, or risk falling . asleep at our desks, the 25-year-old royal is lucky enough not to have . to get up for work in the morning. The dinner marked the third time that Beatrice had hit the town that week. On the Wednesday night, Sarah Ferguson and .

Firehouse (again), where she had been dining with friends. Date night: Bea is often accompanied by her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark. One of the couple's favourite eateries is The Chiltern Firehouse . In mid-April,  Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew dined with their daughter in London's . fashionable East End. The happy trio had a quiet family supper at the fashionable Les Trois Garcons on Bethnal Green Road. It was an unusual choice for the group - edgy Shoreditch, although gentrified, isn’t yet a royal stamping ground. Les . Trois Garcons is a former pub decorated with stuffed animals and . dangling handbags, and serves up dishes such as £25 dish of poached . ballotine of chicken and lobster, and a £21.50 organic salmon with . spinach, potato Dauphine, and a champagne butter sauce.

A . notorious celebrity hangout, the young royal was at Nobu at the same . time as singer Ronan Keating and friends but confident Beatrice seemed . unfazed by the media attention, smiling for the waiting press as she . exited the pricey restaurant, loved by Cheryl Cole and Victoria Beckham. Princess Bea must have a penchant for Japanese food, considering that over half of the restaurants she's visited in recent weeks serve sushi and sashmini, perhaps that's how she maintains her trim figure. While the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge prefer a quiet night in (the royal couple were once spotted buying pizza and salad at their local Sainsburys), at least Princess Beatrice is representing the young royal set, showcasing some serious style credentials and helping support Mayfair's gastronomic economy.","Princess has dined out at Mayfair's swankiest restaurants recently .

UK women are far more worried than men about getting behind the wheel overseas, with 73 per cent never having done so. While 47 per cent have ruled out driving while on holiday abroad, the poll from TravelSupermarket found. Battle of the sexes: Men are more happy than women driving abroad . Of the women who had driven abroad, 17 per cent said it was more difficult than driving in the UK, compared with 9 per cent of men. The survey of 2,002 adults also found that men were far more likely to cause damage to hire cars abroad or fall foul of foreign driving rules. The fairer sex is safer behind the wheel (just 44 per cent have had a car accident compared to 57 per cent of men). The research also found that men are twice as likely to get a fine in their hire cars, and that female drivers are less likely to cause damage to their hire car (82 per cent compared to 76 per cent of men). Too scared: The majority of women won't drive while overseas, according to the survey .

"A Philadelphia company has unveiled its innovative bike for children that never falls over. Called the Jyrobike, it makes clever use of gyroscopes to keep the bike balanced even when a child leans from side-to-side. According to the company, this means a child can learn to ride the bike in just one day. The Jyrobike (pictured) claims to offer children a fast and easy method to learn how to ride a bicycle. A rapidly spinning disc inside the front wheel acts as a gyroscope that stabilises the bike when a kid leans from side to side so that they don't fall over, and it can be controlled remotely by a parent . The Jyrobike, which is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign, works on the principle that a bike is more stable at higher speeds. Inside the front wheel of the bicycle is a fast spinning disc. Motor power: 14.4 watts . Battery life: 3-4 hours . Max flywheel speed: 2,000 RPM . Weight: 3 kilograms (6.6 pounds) Size: 12 or 16 inches (30 or 40 centimetres) Connectivity: Micro USB . Water Resistant: Yes . This creates a gyroscopic force that balances the bike even when it is ridden slowly, as might be expected for a child getting behind the handlebars for the first time. A ‘control hub’ in the front wheel dictates how the gyroscope acts. This can also be bought separately and attached to another bike. It can change the rate that the disc in the front wheel spins to give a rider different levels of stability. This means as a rider improves, the assistance can be toned down. And ultimately, once they are comfortable, the spinning disc can be removed to reduce the weight of the front wheel by 60 per cent. There are two versions of the bike available; the smaller 12-inch (30 centimetres) version costs £179 ($249), while the larger 16-inch (40 centimetres) bike is £219 ($299). As seen here the Jyrobike is stable even when it is given a gentle push and it is allowed to move by itself with the gyroscope inside the front wheel enabled . A remote control can be used to alter the 'control hub' in the front wheel of the bike. This means a parent can change the stability assistance afforded to a child as they ride. This means as a rider improves, the assistance can be toned down, or it can be turned up if they are struggling . ‘The genius behind our technology is that it covertly promotes correct riding technique,’ the company said on their Kickstarter page. ‘It takes the stress out of teaching, eliminates fears of falling and gets the whole family out riding together faster than trial and error, balance bikes or training wheels.’ The speed of the spinning disc in the front tyre can also be adjusted remotely, so an adult can quickly increase the stability if their child is far away and looks like they are about to fall, for example. The disc inside the bike can be charged with a Micro USB cable and lasts for about three hours, and the software inside can also be updated by connecting it to a computer. Production on the Jyrobike is due to start 'soon' and it is expected to hit the market in January 2015. And next year the company also hopes to build an adult version that uses the same technology in a larger bike to help older people learn how to ride.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A buzz of excitement is surrounding the Long Island race track where California Chrome could become the first Triple Crown winner since 1978 tomorrow. The possibility that the winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes could extend his winning streak to New York's Belmont Park is expected to attract thousands more visitors. Belmont Park's director Martin Panza has been preparing for the extra attention California Chrome has brought, and has been adding extra seating, security and bathroom facilities.

Nearby businesses are profiting from the . racehorse's success too, with fully booked hotels and restaurant owners . anticipating an increase in customers. California Chrome's chance to make it into the record books has coincided with a relaunch at the Belmont track. New management have filled the undercard with high-stakes races, which increased the day's total purse to $8 million - the second-richest day in American horse racing behind the final slate of the Breeder's Cup. It has also planned to surround the action with music from rapper LL Cool J, former New York Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams, and Frank Sinatra Jr singing New York, New York. 'For the first year of us doing this, under this new format, it's not going to get any better than this,' Panza said in an interview near his track office, which was filled with boxes of Belmont Stakes caps and bags of souvenirs. 'From our end, what we need to do now is observe how the day goes and see what we can do for next year, always thinking that there could be another Triple Crown on the line.' Winning streak: Victor Espinoza celebrates as California Chrome crosses the finish line to win the Kentucky Derby in May . Victory: California Chrome, right, leads the field as he wins the Preakness Stakes in Maryland on May 17 . California Chrome is the twelfth horse to reach Long Island with wins in the first two legs of the Triple Crown, the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes, since Affirmed won all three in 1978. Attendance for those 11 races averaged nearly 30,000 more than in years without a contender - going from a low of 37,171 in 1995 when Thunder Gulch and Timber Country split the Derby and the Preakness, to a record 120,139 in 2004 when Birdstone upset Smarty Jones in the last of a three-year stretch of Triple Crown contenders in the Belmont Stakes. On-site wagering on the race-day program also surged in those years, according to track records, jumping from $6.8 million in contender-less 1996 to $9.2 million the following year when Silver Charm took the first two races, and from $8.8 million in contender-less 2007 to $13.3 million when Big Brown raced for history in 2008.

I'll Have Another's wins in Louisville and Baltimore sent attendance for the 2012 Belmont Stakes to nearly 86,000 and on-site wagering to $13.8 million even though the horse was withdrawn the day before the race due to a leg injury. The head of the track's management team said ticket sales for this year's Belmont Stake were already brisk before California Chrome broke from the gate at Churchill Downs in May. More than 70 percent of tickets and premium tables for the race were sold before the Derby, and all were gone before the Preakness, according to New York Racing Association president and chief executive officer Christopher Kay. After the Preakness, Kay said, they added a track-side tent and additional seating to accommodate the surge of interest in a potential California Chrome coronation. On track: With the first two legs of the Triple Crown already won, California Chrome is warming up for the final . General admission and grandstand tickets costing $10 remained available through the track late in the week and more than 3,000 tickets, ranging from $12 for grandstand to $2,300 for a table for two at the Garden Terrace Restaurant, were available on the secondary ticket sales website StubHub.com. Good weather - 82F and sunny, according to the National Weather Service - could push the crowd into record territory. 'Our intent is to make Belmont Stakes day an important day year in and year out,' Kay said. This year it has been an important day for business.

Other hotels were also booked solid, officials said, forcing some out-of-town fans to find lodging in Suffolk County, about 20 miles east, or stay in Manhattan, about 15 miles west. 'This Triple Crown opportunity doesn't come too often,' state hotel association chairman John Tsunis said.

'The victim, Saba ... married her neighbour Muhammad Qaiser for love five days ago against the wishes of her family,' he said. 'They took her to Hafizabad, shot her twice and threw her in the canal after putting her in a sack, presuming that she was dead.' Mr Akbar said Ms Maqsood was wounded in her cheek and her right hand. Her relatives fled the scene, he said, and after minutes in the water she regained consciousness and struggled to the bank, where passers-by helped her. Ms Maqsood was wounded in her cheek and her right hand, said a police spokesman. Her relatives fled the scene, he said, and after minutes in the water she regained consciousness and struggled to the bank . 'I was tortured and shot by my father, brother, uncle and his wife': Police spokesman Ali Akbar said he had recorded a statement from Ms Maqsood in which she blamed her family for the attack . 'She is a brave girl. She came out of the canal and approached a nearby fuel station from where a rescue team rushed her to hospital,' he said. Many conservative Pakistani families believe it is dishonourable for a woman to fall in love and choose her own husband. Women from such families are expected to agree to arranged marriages. Refusal can lead to honour killings. Last month a Pakistani woman called Farzana Iqbal was attacked and killed by suspected family members because she had married the man she loved. Death before dishonour: Police collect evidence near the body of Farzana Iqbal, who was stoned to death by her relatives in another suspected honour killing near the Lahore High Court building in Lahore on May 27 . The case drew intense global attention, including condemnation from the United Nations, in part because it the killing was so brazen. It happened in the centre of the city of Lahore, Pakistan's cultural capital. But many other incidents remain unreported. In 2013, 869 such cases were reported in the media, according to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, but the true figure is believed to be higher. Mr Akbar said he had recorded a statement from Ms Maqsood in which she blamed her family for the attack. 'I was tortured and shot by my father Maqsood Ahmad, brother Faisal Maqsood, uncle Ashfaq Ahmad and his wife Sajida Bibi,' he quoted her as saying. Mr Akbar added: 'Her condition is out of danger and we have registered a case against her family on her complaint.' Police had raided her father's home in the nearby city of Gujranwala but all the suspects had disappeared, he said.","Saba Maqsood, 18, was attacked by her father, uncle, brother and aunt .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A coroner has demanded the government do more to improve the safety of blind cords warning millions of homes could still have deadly blinds after a two-year-old girl was strangled to death. Sophie Allen suffered brain damage after she was found hanging from the blind cord in her bedroom at her home in Sunderland. At an inquest into her death, it was heard that the inquisitive toddler, who was playing with her brother, is thought to have climbed on to a storage box to look at her pet rabbits out of the window. Two-year-old Sophie Allen from Sunderland, who died after she became entangled in a blind cord in her bedroom . Sophie was found in this bedroom at the family's home in Sunderland after looking out of the window to see her pet rabbits . But the box tipped over and Sophie got her head caught in the noose of the cord and when she slipped, it cut her air supply off. She was rushed to hospital but despite doctors’ best efforts scans showed there was no activity in the toddler's brain and her life support machine was switched off. Now coroner Derek Winter has urged the Government to do more to prevent future deaths. New safety regulations governing the manufacture of blind cords came into force in February. But Mr Winter said this would mean there are still millions of potentially deadly blinds in family homes. He added he plans to use his powers to write to the Government to see if more can be done to prevent future deaths. Recording a conclusion of accidental death, he explained: 'I will ask that they reply within 56 days as to what additional measures can be taken to highlight public awareness, so those people who have existing blinds fitted can take immediate action to take away the risk of those blinds, and the regulations that are in place from February are brought to everyone's attention and the number of deaths from blind cords can be eliminated or almost certainly reduced. Sophie, pictured with her brother Jayden, right, who she shared a bedroom with, and her baby sister Amelia . At the inquest in Sunderland it was heard that Sophie lived with her parents Peter Allen and Danielle Hudson, along with her siblings Amelia and Jayden, with whom she shared a bedroom. The hearing was told that Sophie, who would have been three in December, was 'a very inquisitive child', and enjoyed looking out of her bedroom window to keep an eye on her pet rabbits. In February, new safety regulations came into effect covering cords on most types of blinds. The new rules means that blinds must be 'safe by design' and supplied with an appropriate child safety device. These devices break the cord or chain under pressure or provide the facility to store the cord out of reach. Detective Inspector Shelly Hudson, from Northumbria Police, said at about 8.30am on April 20, Sophie's parents heard the two children playing in their bedroom. Her mother got up to go to the toilet and saw Sophie's brother was standing on his bed and a storage unit in the bedroom had tipped over. DI Hudson said: ""Sophie's sibling told his mam that Sophie was stuck, but because she was an inquisitive little girl, she assumed she was hiding. 'She went quickly to the toilet and went back to the bedroom and as she opened the child gate, she noticed her brother was looking concerned and standing on his bed. 'She asked him again where she was and he pointed at the storage unit next to the window. 'She noticed a shadow behind the curtain, moved the curtain to one side and realised Sophie had the blind cord around her neck.' The frantic mother freed the unconscious toddler and carried her downstairs where they parents tried to perform CPR. When it did not work they went to a neighbour's house to call an ambulance as Miss Hudson could not get through on her phone. At an inquest, Sophie was described as an 'inquisitive' child who liked to look out of her bedroom window to keep an eye on her pet rabbits . The two-year-old was treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, pictured, after being transferred from Sunderland Royal Hospital but doctors were unable to save her . Sophie was rushed to Sunderland Royal Hospital before being transferred to a specialist children's unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle. But despite efforts of medics, her life support machine was switched off in the early hours of April 26. DI Hudson said that 28 children in the UK have been strangled by looped cords since 1999, with 15 of the deaths in the last four years. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accident (RoSPA) estimates there are more than 200 hundred million unsafe blind cords in the UK. The charity has handed out more than 50,000 free 'cleats', which tie up blind cords, as part of an ongoing safety campaign.","Sophie Allen, 2, was found hanging from a cord in her bedroom .

Danger man: Hazard scores against Sweden in his country's 2-0 friendly win in Stockholm . ‘Hazard is the type of player who sometimes needs a kick up the a***!’ said Degryse. ‘Against Sweden he switched off several times, just like he did in the Champions League for Chelsea against Atletico Madrid. If that doesn’t change Wilmots will have to resolve it by dropping him.’ Hazard did not appear to be putting in much effort while Belgium were at a training camp in Sweden last week and despite scoring a wonder goal in their 2-0 defeat of Sweden, looked uninterested at times. But, he said, fans should not be deceived by appearances. ‘The way I play I can sometimes seem nonchalant,’ said Hazard. ‘It has always been the same for me. People demand a lot of me and that’s to be expected. But when I play for Chelsea you play one game and even if it doesn’t go well you can immediately play another and redeem yourself. ‘But with the national team, there is more pressure to perform every time. They always expect me to do tricks all the time and score goals and that’s not easy.’ His club manager Jose Mourinho also criticised Hazard after  Chelsea lost 3-1 at home to Spanish side Atletico Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals. Mourinho claimed Hazard neglected his defensive responsibilities. Valued: Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany hugs Hazard after his goal against Sweden . Strong words: Former Belgium international Marc Degryse believes Hazard needs to improve or face being dropped at the World Cup . Magician: Hazard, pictured in Belgium training, says he can't be expected to do tricks in every game . ‘I wouldn’t say the two goals we conceded against Atletico were a result of my lack of effort,’ said Hazard. ‘I don’t agree with that. It was a team error and we have collective responsibility.’ Belgium have been picked by many as dark horses for the World Cup. Hazard said the near 4,000 crowd who have attended every training session at their camp in Westkapelle on the Belgian coast is indicative of the high expectations people have of the team. Interest in England is heightened by the inclusion of 12 Premier League players in the squad. Only England, with 22, have more. Familiar faces: Vincent Kompany (left) and Romelu Lukaku (right) are two of the 12 Premier League players in Belgium's World Cup squad .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Disgraced: Retired New York City Police Detective Louis Scarcella's (pictured last year) brother Michael Scarcella was found dead Thursday of an apparent suicide . The cop brother of a retired NYPD detective under investigation for a series of questionable murder investigations over the past few decades was found dead Thursday. Michael Scarcella, 50, of Brooklyn, reportedly committed suicide. He is the brother of 62-year-old Louis Scarcella, a shamed former homicide detective in the department. It is not clear exactly how Michael Scarcella took his own life, according to the New York Daily News. His body was found shortly after 11.00 a.m. Michael Scarcella was not known to be under any kind of misconduct investigation, but his older brother has been heavily scrutinized for the past 12 months. Five men in prison for about 20 years each were released from custody after it was found they were wrongfully convicted of killings investigated by the elder Scarcella. More than 50 additional cases dating back to the 1980s are under review by the Brooklyn district attorney, according to recent reports. Additional convictions are expected to be overturned after it was revealed Louis Scarcella threatened several suspects and witnesses, and even called on the same drug addict multiple times to provide testimony that helped land convictions. Louis Scarcella was once seen as a rising star in the department because he was able to get an unprecedented number of convictions. A MailOnline call to Louis Scarcella’s home went unanswered, and a family member told the Daily news that he was ‘with family.’ His younger brother died a 25-year NYPD veteran.","Michael Scarcella was found dead Thursday in his Brooklyn home .

"By . Snejana Farberov . President Barack Obama showed himself a perfect gentleman with Queen Elizabeth II during D-Day commemorations in Normandy Friday, tenderly helping the 88-year-old monarch down a flight of stairs. Photographers covering the event in Chateau de Benouville, Normandy, captured Obama and New Zealand's Governor-General Jerry Mateparae guiding her majesty to her position for a group photo with other world leaders. Many observers were quick to point out that Russian President Vladimir Putin, who stood off to the right just a few steps away, did not bother to aid the elderly queen. Scroll down for videos .

Together: Only Queen Elizabeth, French President Francois Hollande and Queen Margrethe of Denmark separated President Obama (left) and Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) in the group photo . Obama and Queen Elizabeth were among 19 heads of state and members of royal families who attended a series of elaborate ceremonies and memorials marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. The American president and the British monarch appeared cordial during the commemorative events in France, which culminated with a dazzling fireworks display. The two were pictured walking amiably side by side deep in conversation just a couple of steps behind President Putin and France's Francois Hollande. The lanky commander-in-chief thoughtfully bent his 6-foot-1 frame so he could listen to his royal interlocutor. For President Obama, the queen seemingly served as a buffer separating him from Mr Putin, whom he did not publicly acknowledge and went to great lengths to avoid. Enlarge . Standing out: Red light reflected from the carpet illuminates the Russian president as he passes Obama . At odds: Only the Queen, France's Francois Hollande and Denmark's Queen Margrethe separated Obama and Putin at the lunch on Friday. The men did speak for 10 to 15 minutes, the White House said .

The . queen was equally eager to keep her distance from Putin in light of her son Prince Charles' controversial comments made last month comparing the Russian . president to Adolf Hitler. To be on the safe side, the queen focused all her attention on Obama. French diplomats . had thought long and hard about where to seat Mr Putin. The solution was . to slot him near the top of the table but in tranquil waters away from Obama and the queen of England – between . the Queen of Denmark and Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg. It was reported that Putin and Obama did eventually have a brief conversation in private on the sidelines of the lunch. Perhaps the only faux pas committed by the American president was that he was caught openly chewing gum throughout the meal with Queen Elizabeth seated to his left. Obama did not fare quite as well in the presence of royalty three years ago, when he unwittingly violated the royal protocol by delivering a speech while Britain's national anthem played in the background during a state dinner in Buckingham Palace. Chums: Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall laugh with Obama during the ceremony at Sword Beach . Toast: The Royal raised her glass with the French leader at the elaborate venue. She also said: 'Each year has  compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World War' Also, it is only a matter of time before some sharp-eyed royal observer makes hay of the fact that during the D-Day event in Normandy, President Obama lightly touched her majesty on the arm when helping her down the stairs. According to centuries-old protocol, the queen should not be touched in any way beyond a polite handshake. First Lady Michelle Obama caused an uproar in 2012 when she gently rubbed the queen's shoulder after the monarch put a friendly arm around her waist during a G20 reception. After . lunch Friday, the leaders made the short journey to Sword Beach. Here the . hosts erected a vast arena where the 3rd British Infantry Division came . ashore on D-Day morning. The day of gratitude drew royals . including Queen Elizabeth II of England, who dined at the French . presidential palace in the evening, and the king of the Netherlands, . Willem-Alexander, as well as political leaders from across Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also joined in, along with a small group of German soldiers, as a sign of European unity.

France. ‘The true measure of all our actions . is how long the good in them lasts,’ Queen Elizabeth declared in a speech during a state dinner hosted by President Hollande at Elysee Palace in Paris. ‘Each year has . compounded in Europe the benefits of our victory in the Second World . War. Seen in that light, those heroic deeds will stand out as much in . 700 years as they do after 70.’ Noting . ‘the joy of becoming a great-grandmother’, the 88-year-old Queen added a . telling sentiment that will, no doubt, be much quoted by future . historians: ‘Everything we do, we do for the young.’ Salute: Former sailor Peter Smoothy aged 89 from Herne Bay, Kent pays his respects to fallen comrades .","President Obama was pictured gently helping the 88-year-old monarch down the stairs at Chateau de Benouville, Normandy .

An ex-convict with a history of mental illness  eyed in the stabbing that left a six-year-old boy dead and his seven-year-old friend clinging to life was released from prison only two weeks ago despite a history of mental illness, it has been revealed. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was paroled May 23 and is suspected in multiple stabbing attacks that have left two people dead and two others hospitalized in the weeks since. His original five-and-a-half-year sentence stemmed from attempted murder and assault convictions, records showed. Scroll down for video . Accused: Daniel St. Hubert being arraigned Thursday night in Brooklyn criminal court . Cops unknowingly encountered the suspect only hours before the vicious attack in a Brooklyn housing project that sent shockwaves through the city. He was urinating on a sidewalk when police approached him, sources told the New York Daily News. He claimed that he didn't know it was illegal and, after showing proper ID, he was released with a summons, said police. His reported actions over the next few hours are unspeakable. St. Hubert is accused of entering the Boulevard Houses in East New York, and stabbing to death P.J. Avitto in an elevator. The attack left Mikayla Capers seriously injured, she is currently fighting for her life in a city hospital.

Killed: 18-year-old Tanya Grant-Copeland, pictured, was stabbed on Friday four blocks from where the children were attacked but police are still investigating whether St Hubert could be responsible . The mentally ill man was then arrested . only hours later for the stabbings after police patrolled the area . around his mother's home in Queens - and now he is suspected in yet . another grisly murder, police said. St. Hubert didn't put up any resistance . during his arrest, though he has a record of assaulting both a police . and correction officer, and was angrily ranting to himself in a holding . cell late Wednesday night, said NYPD spokesperson Stephen Davis. St. Hubert appears on surveillance . video near the subway stop where a homeless man was stabbed early . Wednesday morning on a platform, Davis said. Witnesses . to the seemingly random attack also described the suspect using an . 8-to-10-inch knife with a brown handle similar to one recovered on St. Hubert when he was arrested, Davis said. The 52-year-old drifter is recovering in a hospital and expected to survive the disturbing attack. St. Hubert is also suspected of stabbing to death 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland on Friday four blocks from where the attack of the young children happened, authorities said. Media frenzy: Reporters and photographers crowd the sidewalk for even just a glimpse of the man accused of the horrific stabbings . Plea: Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce appealed for help tracking down the stabbing suspect hours before he was arrested on Wednesday . Further testing of evidence collected . at that scene needs to be conducted, Davis said, but a similar knife was . recovered where Copeland was killed. St. Hubert was being held in a Williamsburg, Brooklyn precinct on Thursday . and unavailable for comment. It wasn't immediately clear if he had made . any statements or had asked for an attorney. Meanwhile, the father of Prince Joshua Avitto, the six-year-old boy who was fatally stabbed, said on Thursday that if he saw the suspect, he'd ask him, 'What made you do this to a little baby?' 'I'm at a loss for words,' Prince's father, Nicholas Avitto, told Fox 5 News. 'The bottom line is he got out and this tragedy took place after he was released from jail.'

Davis said St. Hubert, who has an extensive criminal history, had previously been arrested on disorderly conduct charges for taking up two seats on the subway and other infractions. St. Hubert hasn't yet been officially charged but murder and assault charges are likely coming, said Davis.","Daniel St Hubert, 27, has been arrested in connection with the death of P.J.

"By . Martin Hardy . Newcastle have fought off stiff competition from West Ham to land the Sunderland midfielder Jack Colback on a five-year deal. West Ham had put together a £10 million package that would have put the 24-year-old on a £50,000-per-week package. That represented a huge wage rise from the basic £6,000-a-week Colback was earning at Sunderland, where he has been since he was 10. Decision: Jack Colback has decided to sign with Newcastle United rather than West Ham . Got him: Alan Pardew beat off fierce competition to secure his man . However the Newcastle fan is keen to stay in the North east and that appears to have been a huge factor, with Swansea, Aston Villa and Hull all tracking the player. Colback's move to St James' Park from fierce rivals Sunderland, who were also keen to keep the player, is expected to be confirmed next week. He will become the first permanent signing made by Newcastle since January 2013, but they will not have to pay a fee with Colback having run down his contract at the Stadium of Light. Disappointment: Sam Allardyce's West Ham  was one of a number of teams who had been chasing the midfielder .

"By . Alice Grebot . Smiling again: Jodie Hart underwent surgery to fix her underbite . When Jodie Hart first noticed her lower jaw jutted out further than her upper jaw, during her early teens, she assumed the problem would correct itself. Instead, the mismatch only became more pronounced. Within a few years her underbite – where the lower jaw is further forward than the top – was so severe that chewing food  was difficult. ‘I already had orthodontic braces to correct my crooked teeth and I hoped they’d fix my underbite,’ says Jodie, 26, who works in PR. ‘But my lower jaw gradually got more prominent and unsightly, and by the time I was 17 it was really uncomfortable. ‘Eating was hard as my teeth didn’t . fit together properly. I didn’t eat apples because it was too much . effort trying to bite into them and I had to get food  to the back of my . throat and chew it much more. I also felt really self-conscious as my . jaw looked odd.’ An . underbite is a type of deformity known medically as a reverse overjet. It is caused by an overgrowth of the lower jaw or the upper jaw not . developing properly,  or a combination of the two. ‘Jaw . deformities are quite common and affect about ten per cent of the . population,’ explains  Darryl Coombes, consultant oral and maxillofacial . surgeon at the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex. ‘An . underbite can sometimes cause jaw-joint problems, such as pain or . clicking, and patients find it hard to bite into foods. 'There’s often . also a psychological impact too as it can appear strange and alter . looks.’ An underbite can . occasionally be corrected with orthodontic braces alone but if the . deformity is severe – as in Jodie’s case – surgery is needed to . reposition and realign the jaws. This . is performed by surgeons qualified in both medicine and dentistry, and . only on patients aged over 18 whose bones have stopped growing. ‘Jaw surgery is a major undertaking and the entire process takes about 18 months’ says Mr Coombes. ‘People with an underbite often have rotated or angled teeth, caused by the mouth adapting, and these must be completely straightened and aligned before the operation by an orthodontist. Otherwise it’s impossible to work out where the jaws should be and teeth won’t fit together correctly.’ Before the op: Jodie pictured before the surgery, when her protruding jaw meant that she struggled to chew her food properly . Patients wear braces for a year – and they remain on during the procedure. Once the teeth are straight, the surgeon takes X-rays of the jaw and makes a cast of the teeth, and uses a metal hinge known as an articulator to simulate how the teeth should meet. ‘Once the correct position is determined, plastic wafers are made to sit on the teeth during the operation and show where the jaw should be,’ says Mr Coombes. ‘A great deal of planning happens before the surgery.’ The operation is performed under general anaesthetic and through the mouth, via incisions in the gums, to prevent scarring to the face. ‘To move the upper jaw, we break and . detach it from the base of the skull, then reposition it,’ says Mr . Coombes. ‘To move the lower jaw, we cut the sides of the jaw using a . surgical saw.’ The jaw can then be slid forwards or backwards until it is in the correct position – marked by the wafers. It . is fixed together again with titanium plates and screws, then the gums . are sewn up with dissolving stitches. Titanium is used because it  is . bio-compatible, so it can stay in  for life. Jodie had four screws inserted and had a thin slice of bone removed from her jaw, to improve the fit. Surgery usually takes two to three hours and requires a short stay in hospital. ‘Afterwards patients experience swelling, numbness and discomfort for several weeks,’ says Mr Coombes. ‘Painkillers are prescribed and patients see their final appearance two to three months later. Braces stay on for up to six months.’ Jodie’s recovery from the NHS surgery took about five weeks. ‘After the operation the pain was extreme, despite the painkillers, and there was a lot of blood in my mouth,’ she says. ‘My jaw was locked shut, due to the pain, and my cheeks were like footballs. 'The first few days I was kept on a drip, then I started drinking nutrient shakes through a straw. After a few weeks I moved on to soft foods then later back on to solids. ‘Although my bottom lip and part  of my chin are now numb, which  doctors warned could happen, I haven’t had any pain since. 'The ordeal was definitely worth it – I am now able to chew food comfortably, can eat what I like and I breathe more easily. ‘Once the swelling had completely gone, I had a normal-looking face and was thrilled. It was like looking at a different person in the mirror. ‘Now I feel much more confident about my appearance, whereas before there was a major imperfection. ‘My face is all in proportion and the new jaw position even makes my cheekbones more pronounced. ‘Having the surgery was the best decision I’ve ever made.’ darrylcoombes.com .","Jodie Hart, 26, had such a bad underbite she struggled to chew her food .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Federal authorities are investigating several threats made against the family of Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, who has been lauded as both a hero and a traitor since he was released by the Taliban in Afghanistan in a controversial prisoner swap that freed five suspected terrorists who were being held at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. Officials won't describe the nature of the threats, but acknowledge that threats have been made. Bergdahl's parents, Bob and Jani Bergdahl, have not been seen publicly since announcing with President Barack Obama that their son had been freed. Threats: Federal authorities have confirmed that threats have been made against Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani following their son's controversial release . Moment of release: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was shown struggling to adjust his eyes to the light at the moment he was released in a video released by a Taliban website. Former colleagues accused him of being a deserter . 'We are working jointly with our state and local . partners and taking each threat seriously,' FBI Special Agent William . Facer told CNN in an e-mail on Saturday. The threats come in the wake of controversy . coming from the families of soldiers who were killed while supposedly . looking for Bergdahl, who is said to have deserted his post, which is what led to his capture by Taliban forces in 2009. The family also was the center of controversy after Bob Bergdahl thanked Allah during the White House announcement about Bergdahl having been freed. Critics of Bob Bergdahl say the Taliban was 'thrilled' when he 'claimed the White House for Islam' by thanking Allah in his press conference with President Obama, it has been claimed. The father of the freed . soldier - who former colleagues claim was a deserter - said he was . speaking Arabic and Pashto because his son's English was poor after five . years in captivity. But . commentators accused him of giving the Taliban a priceless propaganda . tool, with one saying extremist sources in Pakistan were delighted. Mr Bergdahl spoke at the White House after 28-year-old Bowe - the only American prisoner of war in Afghanistan - was freed in exchange for five Afghan detainees held by the U.S. Introduced by the President in the rose garden, he spoke mostly English with some Arabic and Pashto. 'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said. 'I'm your father Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same. 'To . everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American . government and international governments around the world, thank you so . much.' The Arabic phrase bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the Koran and means 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful'. Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news network TheBlaze, said her Taliban sources were 'thrilled' at the phrase being used. Swap: Sgt Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to U.S. special forces in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees . Emotional: Bob and Jani Bergdahl wept as they spoke of their love for their son in another press conference . Accusations: Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for TheBlaze, said the Taliban was thrilled . She told TV commentator Glenn Beck, who founded TheBlaze: 'He definitely was, in a way, consecrating the area. 'He was reaching out. It's an Islamic phrase... And when I contacted my sources in Pakistan who have direct links with the Taliban, they were actually thrilled, the Taliban was actually thrilled that the father did this.' She added: 'This is incredible, he's gone way way beyond just a father reaching out to his son. Divisive: Bob Bergdahl said he studied Arabic to understand his son's captors . 'He’s actually putting so many lives in danger, and he’s giving a propaganda tool to Mullah Omar, who is the leader of the Taliban who the U.S. has been looking for for years.' Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech. After his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar. He said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language. 'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.' Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child? 'Bob and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, I'm sure.' Yesterday a public homecoming parade for Bergdahl featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King was abruptly cancelled in his tiny hometown of Hailey, Idaho. The official reason given was a concern for public safety - but MailOnline learned that a row erupted between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and former US Army Platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in the town. In . an email to Mayor Haemmerle, who wanted to hold the celebration, Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the . community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe . Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so. Cancelled: A homecoming parade for Bergdahl was abruptly called off in his home town of Hailey, Idaho . Political firestorm: Senator John McCain - who was a POW for more than five years in North Vietnam - speaks to reporters yesterday. President Obama has been accused of putting a price on an American life . 'It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held. ‘It would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to, in any way, heap undeserved adulation on Bergdahl, or to adopt the sickly hue of ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions.’ He added: ‘Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause. For now, the only appropriate response is silence.' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel phoned Bergdahl's family yesterday to update them on his condition. In the 10-minute call Hagel wished the family well and told them the Defense Department will continue to support the soldier's medical care, along with the process known as reintegration. An official said Bob and Jani Bergdahl expressed their gratitude. Earlier Wednesday, Hagel told reporters that the rush to judgment about Bergdahl is 'unfair' to his family. Footage: A video on the Voice Of Jihad Website was confirmed to show Sgt Bergdahl on the day he was freed . Released: Since he was taken back by the U.S., Bergdahl has been in debriefing with military psychologists . To freedom: The soldier was shown in the video being patted down by his own colleagues before boarding . The POW's exchange for five Guantanamo detainees has provoked a storm of controversy. Many accused President Obama of negotiating with terrorists and allowing a clear price to be set on an American life. And . while the soldier has been hidden from public view, being debriefed by . military psychologists, many of his former colleagues have accused him . directly of desertion. Some claim six servicemen died in the search for the POW, and a Facebook group called Bowe Bergdahl is NOT a hero! has attracted more than 13,000 members. Its description reads: 'Bowe Bergdahl has been made out to be a hero, deserving of praise. 'However, the media and government have lied to the public and covered up the facts. 'I and many of my former battle buddies have first hand knowledge of what took place on that hill in Afghanistan. 'We are here. We will be heard. Bergdahl will be held accountable for his actions.'","Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani have received unspecified threats, federal authorities confirm .

His 23-year-old fiancee added: 'I looked at it and I was in shock and I started crying. I was in the middle of my friend's kitchen and I was like you guys look at this this is unbelievable.

Swanner, a professional snapper based in Alabama, was photographing a family on a beach in Seaside, Florida, several weeks ago when she spotted the proposal in action. 'It was such a quick two seconds that I snapped those pictures and turned right back around and started shooting my family,' Swanner told AL.com. 'I honestly didn't even think I had a good shot because I was so far away.' Swanner said she noticed the couple's family hiding nearby with cameras.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . Suspect: Dennis Marx was shot dead as he arrived at court with an assault rifle . A former TSA employee, armed with homemade bombs and an assault rifle, was shot dead on Friday as he tried to enter an Atlanta, Georgia courthouse. Dennis Marx, a self-proclaimed Sovereign Citizen, is believed to have been plotting to take hostages at the courthouse, where he had been due to attend a hearing on drug and weapons charges. Deputy Daniel Rush, who was shot in the leg by the gunman, is being hailed a hero after he prevented Marx from gaining access to the building. Marx, who had links to an anti-government group, had arrived at the court building wearing a bullet proof vest and gas mask, and carrying weapons. When he pulled up in his car, the 48-year-old threw out spiked stop strips to prevent vehicles from reaching him. Deputy Daniel Rush confronted Marx, who was shot dead as he approached Forsyth County court at 9am ET. Before he was shot dead, Marx shot through his windshield, striking Deputy Rush in the lower leg. He also let off smoke grenades and pepper spray. Deputy Rush, who is being treated in hospital for his injuries, has been hailed a hero for stopping what police believe was an attempted hostage situation. Scroll down for video . WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Danger: Dennis Marx, seen in this undated photo, had arrived at the court building wearing a bullet proof vest and gas mask, and carrying weapons . Hero: Deputy Daniel Rush is credited with saving the day by confronting Marx before he could reach the court . Search: Members of a SWAT team swarm over the courthouse after the confrontation with Marx on Friday . Blocked off: Police cordon off roads surrounding the court house as detectives search for explosives . Forsyth . County Sheriff Duane Piper said Marx had arrived at the courthouse . armed with an assault rifle, homemade explosives, water supplies and zip . ties. 'He came for the purpose of occupying the courthouse,' Sheriff Piper told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'It would be a guess to think how many lives [the deputy] saved had he not engaged him right there. 'Mr Marx’s intention was to get inside that front door and to take hostages.' 'We don't know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him ... we have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse.' Sheriff Piper described the attempted attack as a 'frontal assault' on the court house, and said Marx and Deputy Rush were involved in a gun fight before Marx died. 'From the video, it looks like [Marx] saw that deputy, swerved to try and run over the deputy. The deputy engaged him. He was shooting at Mr Marx in the vehicle, Mr Marx was shooting through the windshield at the deputy,' Sheriff Piper added. Quick thinking: Deputy Rush was shot in the lower leg as he confronted Marx when the gunman headed towards the court building . Road block: Police use their cars to block access to the courtroom . A woman who had been acting as Marx's attorney in his forthcoming drug and weapons case, told WSB-TV she had withdrawn from his case yesterday. She claimed she had asked the 48-year-old gun trader to undergo a psychological evaluation, but that he refused. A SWAT team that had been on its way to a different call, were able to reach the courthouse quickly and secure the area. Ann Shafer, another attorney due to represent Marx at his drug hearing, said he had been due in court this morning, but failed to turn up. After waiting 40 minutes for her client, who she described as 'slightly unstable', Shafer left by the back exit, and heard the gun shots. 'I feel very lucky that I walked out the back of the courthouse instead of the front,' she told 11 Alive, adding that she immediately suspected Marx was behind the gunfire. Bomb-sniffing . dogs have been brought to the crime scene over concerns that an . explosive device could have been planted near the building. Response: Heavily armed members of the Sheriff's department clear the scene after Deputy Rush was shot in the leg . Stopped: Stop strips that Dennis Marx threw on to the road can be seen to the right. Marx, who was wearing a bullet proof vest, was shot dead . Marx was known to police, who said that his links to Sovereign Citizen groups had made them wary that a bomb may have been left. He worked for the Transportation Security Administration for at least a year, from 2002, an official told CNN. Deputies are also searching for explosives and booby traps at the house Marx had been living in for the past ten days. A no-fly zone has been put in effect near his Cummings residence, and explosives specialists have not yet entered the house, which police have described as 'a bomb'. The . Sovereign Citizen movement he claimed to be a part of began in the 1970s, and is made up of groups . who believe all branches of the U.S. government are illegal. Some members have been linked to the murder of police officers. Marx . had previously tried to make an official Second Amendment Complaint . against Forsyth County sheriff's office and SWAT teams. In court documents filed in August last year, Marx made 'sweeping' allegation against members of the police force over their use of search warrants, 'Yet he does not allege a specific example to support this claim or any of his other claims'. After the shooting, surrounding buildings and a nearby construction site around the Atlanta courthouse were evacuated, and a police officer could be seen patrolling the roof of the courthouse. Relief: An officer is hugged as he attends the scene of the shooting outside the courthouse . Investigation: The sheriff's department searched the area around the courthouse, above, and the home of Marx who was suspected of leaving explosive devices . Shooting: Police cars surround Atlanta courthouse on Friday morning after a masked gunman shot a sheriff's deputy . Abandoned: A SUV with three of its doors open was spotted at the steps of the courthouse shortly after the shooting . An abandoned SUV, with three of its doors open, could be seen in aerial footage of the courthouse. It appeared as if it had driven across a flower bed before coming to a stop. It is not yet clear if it is connected to the incident. Deputy Rush, who has served on the force for 25 years, was taken to hospital for a gunshot wound to his lower leg. A few hours after the shooting he posted a message on Facebook stating simply: 'I am ok.' He has been praised widely for his actions in quickly bringing to an end what could have been a potentially devastating situation. Friends, family and supporters took to social media sites to thank Deputy Rush for his selfless actions, and to wish him a speedy recovery.","Suspect named as weapons trader Dennis Marx .

"The 911 calls show 'the remarkable calm and resourcefulness of students, faculty, and other witnesses,' police say . By . Associated Press . A day after a lone gunman armed with a . shotgun opened fire at Seattle Pacific University, Seattle police . released three 911 calls recorded shortly after the shooting. The calls . reflect a mix of shock, calmness and swift action by students, witnesses . and faculty. One student talks to 911 operators while a classmate attempts to tend to his bleeding neck and chest. Two other callers after witnessing the shooting at a small Seattle university calmly describe their location, the shooter and the chilling scene. 'He walked up behind this guy,' the caller said, adding moments later: 'There were two people standing there. And this guy walked up behind one of them, lifted his rifle and shot directly.' Campus tragedy: 911 calls describing the actions of Seattle Pacific University shooting suspect Aaron Rey Ybarra have been released . The 911 calls show 'the remarkable calm and resourcefulness of students, faculty, and other witnesses,' police wrote. Police said the shooter, who killed a 19-year-old freshman student and wounded two other young people, had 50 additional shotgun shells and a hunting knife. He said after his arrest that he wanted to kill as many people as possible before taking his own life, Seattle police wrote in a statement filed in court Friday. The suspect, Aaron Ybarra, 26, was ordered held without bail on Friday. He was arrested at the scene after a student tackled him when he was reloading his shotgun, police said. In one of the recordings, a student calls 911 after his classmate runs into a classroom bleeding from the neck.

Horrific events: Students view a growing memorial at Seattle Pacific University after shootings described calmly to 911 operators by witnesses, even by some who were injured . 'There's someone shot. I was hit with shrapnel,' the student said. 'Looks like birdshot according to the person that is patching me up.' 'Someone was hit directly... and immediately fell,' he adds. After the student who died was identified as Paul Lee from Portland, Oregon, students began mourning their classmate, leaving notes, posting a picture and praying at a makeshift flower memorial near Otto Miller hall, where the shooting happened. Lee's friend and classmate Ben Purcell said he was supposed to meet Lee to study on the hour the shooting happened, but was running late. Lee went ahead to Otto Miller without Purcell. Mourning: Students and other attendees stand in prayer in Royal Brougham Pavilion, which was being used as an overflow site for a broadcast of a prayer service at Seattle Pacific University Friday, June 6, the day after the shooting . 'He went over and got shot,' Purcell said, shortly after praying at the memorial on Friday. He had learned two hours earlier Lee was the man killed. 'Paul cared about God and people in a special way. And that's what I want to do too,' Purcell said. Purcell also left a note on the memorial. It said in part: 'I wish we had gotten together earlier to study, because then you wouldn't have been shot.' Wounded in the shooting were Sarah Williams, 19, who remained in intensive care Saturday, and Thomas Fowler, 24, who has been discharged.","Seattle police released three 911 calls recorded shortly after the university shooting .

"By . Kirk Maltais . In a poignant ceremony Saturday, the family of a Marine killed in the Afghanistan war adopted the bomb-sniffing dog that was by his side throughout his last days. The ceremony, held at Camp Pendleton, near San Diego, California, was to honor Staff Sergeant Christopher Diaz, 27, who was killed September 2011 while deployed in the Helmand province of Afghanistan. The dog, a six-year old Belgian malinois named Dino, was deployed with Diaz in Afghanistan. He was uninjured in attack that killed Diaz. The family traveled to the military base to adopt Dino, who was pictured with their son in a photograph he sent from Afghanistan before he was killed. Dino was officially retired by the military, and given tests to ensure that he did not suffer from the canine equivalent of post-traumatic stress disorder. The Diaz family, pictured with Sgt. Jonathan Overland (top center) and Dino (lower center).  The family brought the dog home with them after a ceremony at Camp Pendleton, California, on Saturday . 'I don't think that it will decrease any of the pain we feel,'  Diaz's . father, Salvador Diaz, told the Los Angeles Times. 'He's not . going to replace Christopher but he'll give us something that . Christopher loved, the Marine Corps.' 'It's going to be helpful - we'll have something to hold on to.' said Sandra Diaz, his mother. Following the ceremony, which was attended by half a dozen close relatives, the family brought Dino back to their home in El Paso, Texas, where they have a large backyard with a swimming pool. 'Dino will be our baby,' Sandra Diaz said. Before deploying to Afghanistan, Diaz and Dino had worked together at Twentynine Palms, a Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center. There, the two developed a bond, which continued up until his death during combat operations. Born and trained in Israel, Dino takes commands in Hebrew but also . understands English, according to Sgt. Jonathan Overland, who took over as . Dino's handler. Overland also attended the ceremony. According to the LA Times, the Marine Corps needed approval from . the secretary of the Navy in order to proceed with the adoption. The law permits such an adoption if it will . help a family with the grieving process and if the dog is considered a . good candidate for adoption. The testing was performed by specialists at Lackland Air Force Base in San Anotonio, Texas, a military dog training school. The results showed that Dino was of the right temperament to be adopted by the Diaz's.","The family of Staff Sergeant Christopher Diaz, who was killed while deployed, picked up the dog at Camp Pendleton, in California .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A 'paranoid schizophrenic' man accused of stabbing two innocent children last week has been taken to Bellevue hospital for psychiatric treatment. He was released from jail just nine days before the alleged stabbing without being given medicine or a psychiatric referral. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was taken to Bellevue hospital at 3 a.m this morning after he allegedly stabbed 6-year-old Prince Joshua (P.J.) Avitto to death on Thursday. He also allegedly stabbed P.J.s 12-year-old playmate Mikaya Capers with a steak knife. Mikayala is still in the hospital but is now out of intensive care and is walking on her own. Accused stabber Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was taken to Bellevue hospital this morning for psychiatric treatment . Prince Joshua Avitto (left)  was stabbed to death last Thursday and Mikayla Capers (right) was stabbed and remains in critical condition . The New York Daily News reports that St. Hubert suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and was diagnosed after serving jail time for trying to strangle his mother with an electrical cord. He was released on May 23 without medicine or a referral for psychiatric treatment. Nine days later he was accused of stabbing both children in the elevator at Boulevard Houses in East New York, Brooklyn. St. Hubert's sister Judith Perry said that her brother is eager to clear his name and truly believes that he didn't commit the crime. 'I didn’t do it,' he told his sister. Perry believes that the police are treating her brother as though he were guilty before his trial  that he told her he was 'abused' by the guards who were transporting him to the hospital. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, believes he is innocent and 'doesn't understand' why he is being held by law enforcement . Prince Joshua Avitto, 6, was memorialized on Friday at a funeral with over 1,000 attendees . St.Hubert said that the guards who took him to the hospital banged his head against the wall and tightened his handcuffs until they were painful.'His hand is swollen,' Perry said. 'He doesn’t like the situation he’s in. He feels it’s unfair that they are ... judging him guilty without even giving him a fair trial.' Sharod Jean-Pierre, P.J.'s 21-year-old sister says that taking the suspect to Bellevue doen't bring her brother back her brother nor doers it do anything to quell her pain.'He’s still gonna be able to eat, sleep, talk to people. My little brother isn’t going to be able to do that anymore,' Jean-Pierre, 21, said of the suspected Brooklyn stabber. 'I want him to stay at Rikers. I want him to suffer.' P.J., nicknamed Superman, had a funeral on Friday and more than 1,000 mourners including Mayor de Blasio, Al Sharption, and P.J.s cousin TaJ Gibson who plays for The Chicago Bulls were in attendance. Cops believe that St. Hubert may be connected to a few other stabbings in New York in the past few weeks. Cops think St.Hubert may have killed Tanaya Copeland, 18, who was stabbed just a few blocks away from where the children were stabbed. Police think St.Hubert might also be responsible for stabbing a 53-year-old homeless man named Kyle Moore who was critically wounded on Wednesday in Chelsea on the Subway at W. 18th street. The New York Daily News reports that St.Hubert was also sent to mental health facilities in 2010 and 2011.","Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was taken to .

"By . Associated Press . Pope Francis waded into Middle East peace-making this evening by welcoming both the Israeli and Palestinian presidents to the Vatican for an evening of prayers. Israeli President Shimon Peres was the first to arrive at the Vatican hotel where Pope Francis lives, followed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Francis warmly greeted both and met privately with each one before heading out to the Vatican garden for the service. Their meeting came just weeks after the last round of peace negotiations, sponsored by the U.S.,  collapsed.

Vatican officials have insisted Pope Francis has no political agenda by inviting the two leaders to pray at . his home other than to rekindle a desire for peace among the two . parties. However, the meeting could have significance on the ground beyond . mere symbolism. The meeting will also cement Francis' reputation as a leader unhindered by diplomatic and theological protocol . who is willing to go out on a limb for the sake of peace. 'In the Middle East, symbolic gestures and incremental steps are important,' noted the Rev. Thomas Reese, a veteran Vatican analyst for the National Catholic Reporter. 'And who knows what conversations can occur behind closed doors in the Vatican.' The unusual prayer summit was a feat of diplomatic and religious protocol, organized in the two weeks since Francis issued the surprise invitation to Peres and Abbas from Manger Square in Bethlehem.

It took place in the Vatican gardens . in the shadow of St. Peter's Basilica, the most religiously neutral . place in the tiny city-state. It incorporated Jewish, Christian and Muslim prayers - delivered in Hebrew, English, Arabic and Italian. The . prayers focused on three themes common to each of the religions: . thanking God for creation, seeking forgiveness for past wrongdoing and . praying to God to bring peace to the region. Francis, . Peres and Abbas were expected to deliver brief remarks, shake hands and . plant an olive tree together in a sign of peace. The spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians was also present to give a united Christian front. A view inside St Peter's Basilica showing the Mass of Pentcost taking place this evening . Pope Francis led the prayer summit this evening - which focused on three themes: thanking God for creation, seeking forgiveness and praying for peace . Vatican officials have described the prayer evening as something of a 'time-out' in political negotiations, merely designed to rekindle the desire for peace through prayers common to all the main faith traditions in the Holy Land. But even Francis' secretary of state, . Cardinal Pietro Parolin, has said the power of prayer shouldn't be . discounted for its ability to change the reality on the ground. 'Prayer . has a political strength that we maybe don't even realize and should be . exploited to the full,' he said at the end of Francis' trip. 'Prayer has the ability to transform hearts, and thus to transform history.' That . said, no concrete results are expected: Peres has no formal role in . peace negotiations, holds a largely ceremonial post and leaves office at . the end of the month.

His pleas have been ignored by the West, with both the U.S. and . the European Union saying they will give the unity government a chance. Peres' participation thus undermines .

He said: 'The government of Israel decided not to hold political negotiations, but we aren't talking about political negotiations. 'We are talking about a different gesture, a spiritual gesture, an act of public diplomacy.' Abbas told Italian daily La Repubblica that Francis' invitation was 'an act of great courage' 'Nothing should stop us in the search for solutions so that both of our people can live in their own sovereign state,' he was quoted as saying in Sunday's editions.","Pope Francis welcomed both presidents to Vatican for peace prayers .

"By . Julian Robinson . Google could place 'flags' on search results to show it has hidden links to embarrassing information following the European Court's controversial 'right to be forgotten' ruling. Under the plans, an alert would appear at the bottom of a page of search results telling internet users in Europe whether certain links had been deleted. It comes after the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg ruled that people have a right to . ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ material about them to be dropped from search results. Google is planning to put 'flags' on search results to alert people that links to sensitive information has been removed . The internet giant has since provided forms allowing people to ask that certain information about them be hidden when their name is searched online. But the company is planning to flag up to European Citizens the occasions when it has removed certain links once a search request has been made, The Sunday Times reports. Sensitive material would not have to be removed from the internet altogether under the ruling as it would remain on websites such as MailOnline. But information not shown in internet search . results is effectively beyond the reach of web users who do not know . the specific location of what they are looking for. Earlier this month it was revealed Google had received one demand every seven seconds to suppress information about people’s pasts. The figures indicate that large amounts of material could disappear from public reach as a direct result of the ECJ decision that search engines must enforce the ‘right to be forgotten’. Managers at the search engine said the online form was used 12,000 times on the first day its form was available – with applications arriving at the rate of 20 a minute during its busiest periods. Demands came from all 28 EU countries, but are understood to have involved hundreds from Britain. Although Google is based in California, judges ruled that it could be considered a European organisation because it maintains sales offices in European countries. Internet pioneer: Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said that the European attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web . A high proportion of the information expected be lost to European search engine users is likely to be connected to convicted criminals trying to remove records of their past that could be seen by employers, clients or social contacts. Over the first three days following the court judgement, those asking for records to be removed in Britain included a convicted user of child pornography, a politician with a chequered record in office, and a doctor with a controversial professional record. 'There are many search engines around the world which don’t have a presence in Europe and who won’t abide by this ruling' Jimmy Wales, Wikipedia founder . The ruling was triggered by a test case involving a Spanish citizen who wanted Google to stop providing an embarrassing link in searches for his name. The link provided a regional newspaper advert from 1998, in which authorities were auctioning the man’s house to recoup debts to the social security system. Judges said search engines should be required on request to remove links which breached the ‘right to be forgotten’ – a new rule strongly supported by officials in Brussels but one which has yet to be incorporated into EU treaty law. The scope of the rule – against which there is no appeal – is not yet clear. One internet pioneer, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, has already said that the European attempt to suppress information would not work because of the global scale of the web. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: ‘They don’t censor the US version. That is not going to happen. There are many search engines around the world which don’t have a presence in Europe and who won’t abide by this ruling.’ Company co-founder Larry Page has suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the controversial ruling as a green light to internet censorship . The BBC, which runs an archive of news stories dating back to the 1990s, is also among organisations to receive requests that material cease to be flagged up. In his first interview since the decision, company co-founder Larry Page suggested authoritarian states around the world will see the changes as a green light to internet censorship. 'It will be used by other governments that aren't as forward and progressive as Europe to do bad things,' he told the Financial Times. Google has been contacted for further comment.","Internet giant could alert users when search results have been removed .

Investigators found child pornography on Josh Powell's computer at least 17 months before he killed his children and himself, according to FBI documents. The Salt Lake Tribune reported on Saturday that the documents show the FBI was investigating the disappearance of his wife, Susan Powell, as well as possession of child pornography. Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan Powell's parents, said the family was never told the FBI was investigating Josh Powell for child pornography. If the state of Washington's Department of Social and Health Services had known about the suspected child pornography, it 'never would have let him have those kids,' she said. Police discovered child pornography on Josh Powell's (pictured here in 2010) computer at least 17 months before he killed his children and himself, says FBI documents . When a state worker delivered 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden to Josh Powell's rented home in Graham, Washington, on Feb. 5, 2012, Josh Powell locked out the worker and ignited a fire that killed him and his sons. Susan Powell, who was last seen at her West Valley City, Utah, home on Dec. 6, 2009, has never been found. Josh Powell had been previously linked to child pornography, the Tribune reported.

Long said Powell was under investigation for child pornography after cartoon images of incest between mothers and children were found on his computer in late 2009 or early 2010. Josh Powell's two young sons suffered sexual abuse at the hands of their father before he killed them with a hatchet and blew up their Washington state home in 2012, according to a new tell-all book. Gregg Olsen and Rebecca Morris, the authors of 'If I Can’t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children,' claim that they uncovered evidence proving that John and Susan Powell’s children, 7-year-old Charlie and 5-year-old Braden, were molested while living with their father and paternal grandfather. The boys’ maternal grandparents, Chuck and Judy Cox, first noticed that something was amiss with their grandkids when Charlie and Braden moved into their Utah home in 2011, two years after their mother's disappearance. Inappropriate behavior: Chuck and Judy Cox, (pictured) noticed that their grandsons, Charlie (left) and Braden (right), refused to sleep clothed, telling them their father, Josh Powell, used to sleep naked with them . The book, based on interviews with the couple’s family and friends, claims that one night, the siblings refused to put on their pajamas while getting ready for bed, according to Radar Online. 'Who told you it’s okay to be naked?' Mr Cox asked the boys, to which they allegedly replied, 'Our daddy!' After talking to Charlie, the grandfather learned that he and his brother slept naked in bed with John Powell, who also slept in the nude. One of the brothers later drew a picture for Chuck Cox showing what appears to be a child next to an adult, accompanied by the chilling words, 'Don’t play with me!' The book, which is out in stores today, . suggests that there is also a possibility that Braden was molested by Josh's father, Steve, who was later charged . with voyeurism for taking pictures of young girls who lived next door . to him. When the boys were taken from the custody of their father, Braden was diagnosed with a fungal skin . infection; one way to contract this infection is through sexual contact, the authors said. Charlie and Braden's maternal grandparents also noted that the kids started getting violent with one another. Where is she? Susan Powell, pictured with her sons Braden and Charlie, vanished in 2009 and in the months ahead of her disappearance, her husband might have been poisoning her, friends have said . One night when the two were taking a bath together, Mr Cox walked in on Charlie holding his brother's head underwater. The man later recalled that a few more seconds and the toddler likely would have suffocated. Olson . and Morris' book contains other disturbing allegations surrounding the . Powell family drama, including claims that the father starved Charlie to . the point of malnutrition and possibly poisoned his wife, Susan, before . she vanished in 2009. While . 29-year-old Susan Powell's body has never been found, her husband was . long suspected of having a role in her disappearance. Then in February . 2012, he attacked his sons with a hatchet and blew them - and himself - . up in his Washington state home. Speaking to authors Olsen and Morris for their book, 'If I Can't Have You', the couple's friends have given a terrifying insight into the Powell household. They claim that Josh Powell, who was unemployed, controlled the family's finances - ordering his broker wife only to buy the cheapest groceries and refusing to feed the children three meals a day. 'Susan had to research what was on sale at what store,' Michele Oreno told the authors. 'Then she had to come home and put it into the computer, what she spent on every item. Troubled: Her husband, Josh Powell, pictured, also withheld food from his young sons, friends said . Tragic: He killed himself and his sons in 2012 by striking them with a hatchet and blowing up the house . '[Josh] was . really ticked off because the week before she had spent two cents more . on a can of peas than he found at another store... It got so he wouldn’t . give her money for food or anything.' Susan even called friends to ask if she could sneak hot dogs from them because the boys were so hungry, friends said. Then, when Charlie Powell was a year old, a doctor diagnosed him with malnutrition, the book said. 'He gets one meal a day at day care. That's all he needs,' Josh told Susan, according to friend Rachel Marini. 'You’re not wasting my food on him because he’s just going to poop it out!' Friends added that they started to suspect him of poisoning his wife in October 2009, two months before she vanished. She began to feel nauseous so wondered if she was pregnant before miscarrying, friends said. 'He made a . lot of organic products for her to drink, a lot of thick yogurt stuff . and fermented drinks with kefir,' friend Amber Hardman explained. What did he know? Powell, pictured after his wife vanished, reportedly ordered his wife around in their home . Theories: The new insights were shared by friends in a book out Tuesday, left. It also suggests that one of the sons may have been sexually assaulted by Josh's father Steve, pictured in court, right . Susan's body was never found, although the search still continues. Josh has claimed that his wife was at home when he took his sons, Charlie and Braden, on a winter camping trip in Utah's West Desert. In February 2012, 36-year-old Josh Powell took his two sons into his home from a state supervisor, attacked them with a hatchet and then blew up the family home, killing all three. Police documents from May 2012 reveal that Utah officials believe that Josh killed his wife and that his brother Michael helped dispose of her body. Michael killed himself in February 2013.","Investigators found child pornography on .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Associated Press . California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn is still furious about his horse missing out on the Triple Crown and waded into controversy on Sunday by making clumsy comments about disabled people. Even after a night's sleep to think over calling Belmont Stakes winner Tonalist a 'coward' for not running in the Kentucky Derby, Coburn labored his point that California Chrome was at a disadvantage having raced three times in five weeks, . 'That would be like me at 6'2"" playing basketball against a kid in a wheelchair,' said the 61-year-old horse owner during an interview on Sunday with Good Morning America. Critical: California Chrome owner Steve Coburn, pictured, said his horse 'had a target on his back' and complained that other horses in the Belmont Stakes - like winner Tonalist - did not compete in the Kentucky Derby or the Preakness Stakes . The irate co-owner repeated this awkward analogy three times during his round of morning interviews, despite its quesionable tone. 'Triple Crown, that means three — not one, not two — triple means three,' he said. 'If you don’t realize that maybe you need to go back to school and figure this out. Triple means three. 'If something isn’t done I will never see a Triple Crown winner again. I’m 61 years old.' Coburn is furious that his horse was denied the Crown by Tonalist, who was allowed to enter the Belmont Stakes despite not competing in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes. 'We won the Kentucky Derby and we won the Preakness,”' Coburn said. 'We earned the points to run in the Kentucky Derby. We did not have to race in the Preakness or the Belmont but we nominated to the Triple Crown.' He was asked during the Good Morning America interview if thought his wheelchair comparison offensive. 'No, I'm just trying to compare the two,' he said. 'Is it fair for me to play with this child in a wheelchair? Is it fair for them to hold their horses back?' Coburn said he has no problems if people label him a 'sore loser' and even proceeded to give out his phone number so people can call him with their complaints. Big finish: Tonalist (11) with Joel Rosario up edges out Commissioner with Javier Castellano up to win the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race on Saturday . Yesterday, California Chrome owner Steve Coburn complained that other horses were entered just to knock out California Chrome as his horse's bid to win the Triple Crown was ruined on Saturday. Tonalist, the Belmont Stakes winner, did not run the Kentucky . Derby or the Preakness Stakes. California Chrome tied for fourth place in a dead heat with horse Wicked Strong. Commissioner came in second place, while Medal Count came in third. California . Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza lost the 1 1/2-mile race on a hot day . at Belmont Park, where tens of thousands of fans were packed in hoping . to see history. It was not to be, leaving Affirmed as the most recent . Triple Crown winner in 1978. 'It's all or nothing. This is not fair to these horses and to the people that believe in them. This is the coward's way out,' he told NBC. 'Our horse had a target on his back,' Coburn said. 'I thought . he was gaining ground, but he didn't have it in him, apparently,' Coburn said of California Chrome's performance. 'These other horses, they always set him out. They set him up and try to upset the apple cart.' He also said, 'I'm 61 years old and I'll never see another Triple Crown winner in my lifetime because of the way they do this, it's not fair to these horses that have been in the game since day one.' Out of the gate! California Chrome, center, is flanked by Wicked Strong, left, and Tonalist, right, as they run down the backstretch during the Belmont Stakes . Sore loser? Steve Coburn who co-owns California Chrome with wife Carolyn, said their horse 'had a target on his back' California Chrome broke quickly but was pressed immediately by Commissioner and General a Rod. Espinoza eased California Chrome back into third along the rail. Approaching the final turn, California Chrome was maneuvered to the outside. He angled four-wide turning for home, just to the outside of Tonalist, who was close to the pace the entire race. Espinoza started whipping left handed in the lane but California Chrome had no response. Tonalist kicked strongly in the final strides, edging Commissioner by a head to finish in 2:28:52. Harsh words? California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn calls from the grandstand at Belmont Park after his horse finished fourth .

His rise from a . humble pedigree and his working-stiff owners resonated with sports fans . who rarely take an interest in horse racing. California . Chrome's owners spent $8,000 on a mare they bred to a stallion for . $2,500, and were called 'dumb asses' by a trainer for buying a mare who . gave no indication that she could produce a standout offspring who could . run fast. Belmont . Park race track was earlier buzzing on Saturday as crowds gathered to . watch California Chrome try and win the Triple Crown. The . Long Island track - said to the the toughest of the three - had to add . extra facilities after a surge in interest over the possibility that the horse could become the first racehorse in 36 years to pull . off the feat. Crowds . began arriving early at the track, with an array of brightly colored . and creative headgear - from wide-brimmed sunhats with ruffles and . delicate fascinators to more imaginative offerings.

Favorite to win: This racegoer was clearly backing California Chrome to win Belmont - and the Triple Crown . Victory: Jockey Victor Espinoza celebrates as California Chrome crosses the finish line at the Kentucky Derby . One racegoer had styled his Stetson-style hat around California Chrome. Tiny trophies adorned each side, a cutout photo of the racehorse raced across the brim, and a large Belmont Stakes sign poked above the wearer's head. Another fan clearly rooting for the chestnut colt was spotted wearing a silver construction worker's helmet that had a crown and the number 3 attached. The creation was being worn on top of the person's baseball hat. Many of the women attending the event opted for more elegant headwear, with large-brimmed sunhats in fuchsia pinks and mint greens a popular choice. Feathers, flowers, ruffles and other adornments helped the hats stand out in the crowd, as an estimated 100,000 race fans gathered ahead of the big race at 6.52pm. California Chrome was on a six-race winning streak, which included being first past the post for the Kentucky Derby on May 3, and Preakness Stakes in Maryland on May 17.

Only . 11 horses have managed the feat, with Affirmed being the last. Since . then, 12 horses have captured the first two legs without completing the . equine hat trick. The California Chrome camp earlier possessed a quiet confidence that they had the long-awaited Triple Crown champion. 'The . horse is doing great, I couldn't ask anything more from him,' Alan .

On Friday the horse was given the opportunity to shake off any race day nerves, with a visit to the paddock and track areas, before being taken for gallop. 'He's training outstanding. Nothing seems to bother him too much. He's pretty cool,' Sherman said. California Chrome had to navigate the testing ground at Belmont, which includes a lap around 'Big Sandy' - its deep and exhausting track. However, his veteran trainer Art Sherman, felt positive before the race. The 77-year-old said: 'I feel more confident coming into this race than I did any race. I'm getting pumped up.'","Steve Cobrun, 61, followed up his angry rant in the aftermath of California Chrome's defeat on Saturday with another series of irate comments on Sunday morning .

He then took fiancee Stacey Smith, 26, for a coffee and walked past the mural illustrated with characters from her favourite Disney film Beauty And The Beast. Henry Barnes and Stacey Smith in front of the graffiti he used to propose . Upon realising her other half of three years was actually popping the question, Stacey, a PhD student at Bristol University, burst into tears before saying 'yes'. She said: 'Henry didn’t tell me what he was doing. I knew he was painting but I didn’t know what. 'It took him two days to finish the thing but he managed to keep it a secret from me. 'He rang me and asked if I wanted to meet up for a drink in Stokes Croft (in Bristol) after work and I didn’t have a clue what was going on.

"By . Jennifer Newton . A third U.S. tourist has been detained in North Korea with sources saying it was because he left a Bible in his hotel room. Pyongyang confirmed that it had detained the man, named by the state news agency KCNA as Jeffrey Edward Fowle, in April for violating its laws after entering the secretive state, led by dictator Kim Jong Un. They added that he was being questioned by authorities for conduct inappropriate for the purpose of his visit as a tourist. An undated picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un released yesterday. It comes as his country revealed they have detained a third American tourist . The report gave no further details but Japan's Kyodo news agency cited unidentified diplomatic sources as saying the American was detained just before he about to leave the country for leaving the Bible in a hotel room. It is thought that agents in the state are particularly sensitive to religious material. A State Department official said Washington was aware of reports that a third U.S. citizen had been detained in North Korea. They confirmed: 'There is no greater priority for us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad,' adding no further information was available. Two other Americans are currently being held by North Korea having been arrested after arriving on tourist visas and accused of crimes against the state. Korean American missionary Kenneth Bae has been in custody for 18 months after being arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 15 years of hard labour on charges of state subversion. Sources say that Mr Fowle was detained for leaving a bible in his hotel room (file picture) His family says he suffers from a variety of health issues, including diabetes, an enlarged heart, kidney stones and severe back pain. A second man, named as Matthew Todd Miller, has been held since April, with KCNA saying he tore up his visa and demanded asylum. North Korea has detained and then released other Americans in the past year, including Korean War veteran Merrill E. Newman, whom it expelled after holding him for more than a month accusing him of war crimes. In May, the U.S. State Department issued an advisory urging Americans not to travel to North Korea because of the 'risk of arbitrary arrest and detention' even while holding valid visas. 'Foreign visitors to North Korea may be arrested, detained, or expelled for activities that would not be considered criminal outside North Korea,' it said. Pyongyang has detained a number of U.S. citizens in recent years, using them as a tool to extract visits by high-profile figures, including former President Bill Clinton, for propaganda means. North Korea periodically accuses the United States of military hostility and conspiracy to overthrow its leadership. The two states have been locked in a tense diplomatic conflict over Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes. The United States has no diplomatic ties with North Korea and the interests of its citizens in the country are represented by Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang.","North Korean state news agency says Jeffrey Edward Fowle was detained for 'violating its laws'

Cole has been partying in Hollywood with his best friend Shaun Wright-Phillips who plays for QPR after not being selected for Roy Hodgson's England squad. He is now looking for a new club after leaving Chelsea and being dropped from England's World Cup squad. It prompted Cole to take to Twitter to announce his international retirement, shortly after the news broke. The ex-Arsenal player earned 107 caps for his country in a 13-year international career. He famously married singer Cheryl Cole but the couple split after the footballer allegedly cheated on her during their marriage. The MailOnline has contacted Cole's agent and is awaiting a comment. A spokesman from Chelsea FC has said it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.","Former Chelsea star, 33, is on holiday with friends in Beverly Hills .

"By . Joe Callaghan . Ciro Immobile sent out a warning shot to Roy Hodgson's England as the Italian striker tore Brazilian club giants Fluminense to pieces in the Azzurri's final World Cup warm-up. Six days out from their meeting in Manaus, Borussia Dortmund's Â£15.6million new boy scored a hat trick and set up two for Lorenzo Insigne as the Italians ran out 5-3 winners in Volta Redonda. Top scorer in Serie A for Torino this season, Immobile may have given Cesare Prandelli a dilemma. But so too did his leaky defence as the Italians looked shaky across the backline, conceding three goals to the club side. Hero: Ciro Immobile  scored a hat-trick to help Italy to victory on Sunday night . Opener: Italy's Lorenzo Insigne celebrates scoring the first goal of the game against Fluminense . In front: Insigne scored in the 23rd minute to give Cesare Prandelli's side the lead . Ready: Insigne (centre) celebrates with team-mates during Italy's final warm-up match before the World Cup . Fluminense: Felipe Garcia; Bruno, Gum, Carlinhos, Jean, Diguinho, Conca (c), Chiquino, Walter, Fabricio, Gustavo Scarpa. Goals: Chiquinho (28); Carlinho (36); Carvalho (62). Italy: Perin; Abate, Ranocchia, Paletta, Darmian; Thiago Motta, Parolo, Aquilani (c), Cerci; Immobile, Insigne. Goals: Isigne (22, 56) Immobile (30, 54, 55). Ref: Marcelo de Lima Henrique (BRA) The ninth best team in the world against an outfit sitting second in the Brazilian Championship, for a time it looked like this could be another pre-tournament blip from the Italians. Fresh from a dour stalemate with the Republic of Ireland and a shock 1-1 draw with minnows Luxembourg, Prandelli sent out his second string to right some wrongs. And yet they found themselves again level after a chaotic first half. In the absence of Mario Balotelli and Antonio Cassano it was left to Immobile to lead the line as Italy's lone striker with Insigne and Alessio Cerci operating off him. Once things warmed up, it was to prove a lethal combination. Marco Parolo, operating alongside skipper Alberto Aquilani in front of Thiago Motta in the Azzurri engine room, split the defence with a delicious ball on 26 minutes. Immobile looked very mobile as he sprung the offside trap, rounded Felipe Garcia in goals and unselfishly (especially so considering he had yet to open his international account at that stage) crossed for Insigne to tap in. But Fluminense roared back and having ignored the early warning signs the Italian defence were undone by Dario Conca. The Argentine was not so long ago one of the highest paid players in the world when he played under Italy's 2006 World Cup winning coach Marcello Lippi in China, and he was relishing this stage. A beautiful ball sent Gustavo Scarpa clear down the left and his cross left Chiquinho with a tap in. Not giving up: Fluminense pulled Italy back twice during the first half . Leap: Ciro Immobile (second right) jumps above the Fluminense defence to score Italy's second goal . Ready for the World Cup? Immobile celebrates with team-mate Gabriel Paletta (right) It sent the partisan capacity crowd into raptures and was yet another pre-tournament wake-up call for the Italians. They responded rapidly though when Insigne returned the favour for Immobile to break his national team duck on his third cap. A wicked free kick from the left was flashed into the far corner off the striker's head and Italy were back in front. But again it was not for long...five minutes to be exact as left back Carlinhos was allowed free reign by AC Milan's Ignacio Abate to send a weak shot across the face of goal that somehow squirmed under debutant Mattia Perin. It's pretty clear why Gianluigi Buffon has 140 caps to his name. But all was changed utterly in a stunning three-minute spell after the interval when the second string had surely been on the sharp end of Prandelli's tongue. Immobile was unplayable as he roamed across the Fluminense backline. First he was on hand to tap in the rebound when Alessio Cerci's shot was parried. Less than 60 seconds later he again made a joke of the offside trap to latch on to Aquilani's pass and expertly finish for his hat-trick. Tricky: Alessio Cerci (centre) attempts to battle past three Fluminense players . Finish: Immobile (left) beats Fluminense's goalkeeper Felipe Garcia dos Prazeres . Then another minute later he repeated the trick a third time and again centred for Insigne's second.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Just days after hate-crime charges were dropped against the man accused of assaulting fame-seeking V. Stiviano while yelling racial slurs, the New York Police Department has enlisted the public's help in gathering new information about the alleged assault. The renewed effort to acquire new leads in the case comes a week after NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton was quoted as saying 'we would have hoped that she would stay on the West Coast,' noting that at that time she was yet to make a police report of the alleged assault, but had already told her story to the media. Now, however, the NYPD is peppering the the city with flyers asking for witnesses to come forward with information about the alleged assault. Help: The NYPD is seeking additional information about the alleged assault on V Stiviano . Back on the West Coast: Stiviano returned to Los Angeles with a puffy cheek following the alleged assault in New York City . Humble: Stiviano, who seems to love the spotlight, hides behind a large plastic object as she returned to Los Angeles . Dominick Diorio, the 40-year-old man accused of attacking V.Stiviano in the alleged racist assault, has denied the charges. Diorio made a brief court appearance last week and was released without bail. He went on to accuse Stiviano of inventing the attack in order to gain publicity or to 'keep her name in the spotlight'. 'Simply put, a credible victim of a crime does not have her attorney call the press before she calls the police,' said Diorio's attorney, David Scott Smith. 'Miss Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight. But I can assure you if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame.'

Denial: Dominick Diorio's attorney denied the charges on behalf of his client after a brief court appearance on Wednesday, pictured . Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible. Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment. He was initially changed with assault and a hate crime but these charges were reduced to assault in the hearing. Smith, told The New York Post that he is pleased the hate crime charges have been dropped. 'I’d like to commend the District Attorney’s Office for deciding not to prosecute my client for a hate crime and to consent to his release without bail,' said Smith. 'I’m confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, that Miss Stiviano’s allegations will likewise begin to fail and at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed as well.' Diorio, who was reportedly celebrating his 40th birthday before the alleged run-in with Stiviano, appeared to have a small amount of bruising on his face. He allegedly told investigators he just 'slipped and fell' after a woman threw a phone at him. However, Stiviano offers an alternative explanation for his injuries. She claims he and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse at her during a random attack on Sunday evening. She claims their slurs included the N-word. Watch Video Here: .

Diorio allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan's meatpacking district. She alleges Diorio and his friends followed her and her two female dining companions until they were outside the hotel and then pounced. 'The defendant and another unapprehended individual followed her down the street while repeatedly calling her a ‘[n-word] bitch’ and a ‘whore,’ according to Stiviano's criminal complaint. 'The defendant reached through an open taxi window and struck her in the face with his closed fist.' According to Stiviano, Diorio and his friend spat at her before screaming racial obscenities at her. ’Yeah, I’ll f*****g hit a girl. I’ll hit you, you n****r b***h,’ the DA quoted Diorio as saying according to The New York Post. Donald Sterling pictured out shopping yesterday at the Grove in Hollywood, California . Shelly Sterling, wife to former LA Clippers owner Donald Sterling, stepped out for dinner at celebrity hotspot Craig's in west Hollywood last night .

He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday.

"By . Richard Spillett . Britain's biggest philanthropist has cut donations to a children's charity run by his ex-wife following their divorce, it emerged today. Chris Hohn used to give a large chunk of the profits of his successful hedge fund to the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), which is run by his former wife, Jamie Cooper. It was reported today that the £16million windfall the charity received from the fund in 2012 dropped to zero last year after the couple agreed to end the donation following their divorce. Accounts show a successful hedge fund set up by Chris Hohn (left) has stopped its donations to a foundation run by his wife, Jamie Cooper (right), since their divorce . The money instead went towards a £26million bonus deal for him and his top staff, the Daily Telegraph reported. Forbes listed Mr Hohn as one of the world's highest-earning hedge fund managers and traders last year, estimating his annual earnings at around £225million. The Surrey-born hedge fund manager set up the Children's Investment Fund (TCI) in 2003 with most of the company's huge profits being channelled to the foundation managed by his wife. It is estimated the charity made around £1.2billion out of the arrangement, including around £800million in 2007 and 2008, which made Mr Hohn one of Britain's most generous men. Mr Hohn, pictured centre, became one of the UK's leading philanthropists after giving an estimated £800m to children's charities since 2003 . But Mr Hohn, who met American Ms Cooper at Harvard University, posted for divorce in October last year, apparently bringing the deal to an end. Sources close to the couple told the Daily Telegraph that CIFF is now big enough in its own right not to need donations from Mr Hohn. Mr Hohn came to public attention last year when it emerged his investment fund had snapped up five per cent of shares in Royal Mail. The revelation increased pressure on ministers at the time over whether the firm was undervalued before its sale. Mr Hohn was also once described as a ‘locust’ after he helped to remove the boss of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that . was trying to buy the London Stock Exchange. The CIFF and TCI have not yet responded to requests for comment from MailOnline.","Chris Hohn's hedge fund used to give chunk of profits to foundation .

"By . Jennifer Newton . New footage has emerged of a Chinese toddler smoking a cigarette in the street as he is laughed at by onlookers. The pictures are believed to be of a child aged between two and three and despite the vast numbers of adults around, not one attempts to take the cigarette away from him. Passers-by and people on bikes passing can be heard laughing as the little boy holds the cigarette, taking several puffs of it like an 'old pro'. The footage was obtained by liveleak.com and has sparked fresh debate about the scale of China's tobacco habit. It is thought that around 30 per cent of the population of China smokes, which equates to 300 million people, with as many as 53 per cent of adult men in the country smoking. However, at the end of last year, smoking in public places such as schools and hospitals was banned in the country. It comes after another Chinese two-year-old, Tong Liangliang was pictured lighting up after being taught by his father, who believed the habit would alleviate pain caused by a hernia. The child, who is thought to be between two and three years of age, was captured on camera smoking the cigarette . Several adults pass by the child in the Chinese street but no one attempts to take away the cigarette . The boy appears to grimace after inhaling the cigarette, left, but then goes back for another puff, right .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . Robust response: Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, is to look into the practicalities of allowing any school to be inspected without notice . Six schools accused of spreading Islamic extremism will be placed into special measures in a bid to tackle fanatics, a report into the 'Trojan Horse' controversy is expected to reveal today. Ofsted is also planning ‘no notice’ inspections dubbed 'dawn raids' as part of a crackdown on teachers who undermine ‘British values’. David Cameron has personally intervened in the controversy to demand an end to Ofsted’s practice of giving schools two days’ notice of an inspection. His move is a direct response to claims that hardline Islamist schools are taking advantage of the advance warnings to change lessons and give the impression they are promoting a multicultural society and not denigrating Christianity. Tough new powers to be outlined separately today by Education Secretary Michael Gove could also see teachers and governors who undermine ‘fundamental British values’ barred from every school in the country. He will address MPs after the publication by Ofsted of reports into 21 Birmingham schools that have allegedly been infiltrated by Islamic extremists. The BBC has learned that six of these will be placed in special measures after 'significant evidence' that children were not being adequately protected from extremism. Five of those schools - including Oldknow Academy and Park View School - were previously judged as good or outstanding by Ofsted, but have now been rated inadequate following an investigation sparked by the so-called Trojan Horse allegations. Ministers say this is precisely why advance notice inspections must be stopped. Following days of damaging rows at the heart of government, the Prime Minister will today meet senior ministers, including Mr Gove and Home Secretary Theresa May, to ensure progress is being made on tackling extremism in schools. He has also instructed Mr Gove to ask Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, to report back on the practicalities of allowing any school to be inspected at no notice. Intervention: David Cameron will meet senior ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May (left) and Education Secretary Michael Gove (right) to ensure progress is being made on tackling extremism in schools . Findings from the Education Funding Agency suggest that notice periods were used in schools in Birmingham to put on hastily arranged shows of cultural inclusion. The Prime Minister said: ‘Protecting our children is one of the first duties of Government and that is why the issue of alleged Islamist extremism in Birmingham schools demands a robust response. ‘The Education Secretary will now ask Sir Michael Wilshaw to look into allowing any school to be inspected at no notice, stopping schools having the opportunity to cover up activities which have no place in our society.’ Mr Gove said: ‘Evidence uncovered in . Birmingham clearly indicates that schools have used the notice they have . been given of inspections to evade proper scrutiny. 'Our children need . to be kept safe from the dangers of extremism and guaranteed a broad and . balanced curriculum.’ Allegations: Park View School, which has allegedly been infiltrated by extremists, has been iven glowing reports and rated 'outstanding' by Ofsted in recent years . A leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in Oldknow Junior School, Birmingham . The Trojan Horse allegations came to light earlier this year after a letter emerged claiming existence of a plan for hard-line Muslims to seize control of schools by installing friendly governors, then forcing out uncooperative headteachers. The letter is now regarded as a hoax, but prompted investigations by Ofsted and the Department for Education, under orders from Michael Gove as well as West Midlands Police. The controversy has left David Cameron's Government in crisis after Mr Gove was forced to make a grovelling apology to the Prime Minister for undermining Home Secretary Theresa May, whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the Education Secretary. The punishments were meted out after a furious Mr Cameron was compelled to intervene to stop a vicious power struggle between Home Secretary Mrs May and Education Secretary Mr Gove. Mr Gove agreed to say sorry after private remarks he made criticising her and Home Office counter-terrorism boss Charles Farr at a lunch with Times newspaper executives over the Home Office’s handling of extremism in schools appeared in the media. Mrs May’s spin doctor, Fiona Cunningham, was forced to quit for leaking a damaging private letter to Mr Gove written by Mrs May. Many in the Muslim community have expressed anger over the investigations, with staff at one of the schools inspected branding the inquiries nothing short of 'a witch-hunt'. Mr Cameron also said he was calling a special meeting of the Government’s Extremism Taskforce to discuss the implications arising from the findings of the Ofsted review and the wider situation in Birmingham. Mr Gove is expected to say today that the five or more schools to be placed in special measures by Ofsted could have their governors and leadership teams removed. Powers granted in February will allow him to impose an indefinite ban on anyone whose conduct has undermined ‘fundamental British values’, including ‘individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance or those with different faiths and beliefs’. The Rev Oliver Coss, a governor at Regent's Park primary school, one of the 21 inspected, told BBC Breakfast that allegations were made that were 'completely untrue' after the departure of its head and deputy head teacher last year. 'Our school was named in a document which has become known as the Trojan Horse document, as being one where the head teacher and the deputy head teacher had been removed by an insurgency. Those allegations we utterly rejected,' he said. 'I do think it is right that once criticisms or complaints are made about schools that we see them through and make sure we know that we have answers.' Commenting on the wider inquiry, he said: 'There is a wide variety of allegations that have been made by a number of different groups and people and it is absolutely right that we get to the bottom of what is going on, so that people have confidence in saying that there is no extremism in Birmingham schools and that children are adequately protected from those risks. 'But I think there is a genuine risk of making it seem as though Islam is the same as extremism, or Islam is the same as terrorism, those things are categorically not true. 'It is very wise and very right that we should respect Islamic communities in east Birmingham, it is very right that we should allow that to be reflected in the culture of our schools because those things are good and noble and we want things that are good and noble celebrated in our schools.' The Trojan Horse allegations came to . light earlier this year after a letter emerged claiming existence of a . plan for hard-line Muslims to seize control of schools by installing . friendly governors, then forcing out uncooperative headteachers. The . letter is now regarded as a hoax, but prompted investigations by Ofsted . and the Department for Education, under orders from Michael Gove as . well as West Midlands Police. Park View, Nansen Primary and Golden Hillock Schools are all expected to be given inadequate ratings and placed in special measures, with their governing boards replaced. They are run by the Park View Educational Trust, which rejected the findings, pointing out that Ofsted found ‘no suggestion’ of extremism or radicalisation within classrooms.","Five of the six schools 'had previously been rated good or outstanding'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Ex-minister Alan Milburn says the Government's approach to UK child poverty 'falls far short of what is needed' The Government's plans to end child poverty are doomed to failure, its adviser on social mobility has warned as new estimates revealed the UK will be home to 3.5 million poor children by 2020. A report by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, chaired by former health secretary Alan Milburn, branded the draft strategy for the next three years a 'missed opportunity' and insisted it fell far short of what is needed to prevent the numbers rising. Mr Milburn said it was 'particularly lamentable' that ministers had been unable to agree on how to measure poverty after rubbishing existing measures. 'The Government's approach falls far short of what is needed to reduce, yet alone end child poverty in our country,' added the ex-Labour MP. 'Our new research shows that the gap between the objective of making child poverty history and the reality is becoming ever wider.' He also called on politicians from all parties to work together to combat the issue, adding: 'Willing the ends without the means today merely becomes a broken promise tomorrow. 'Across the political spectrum, party leaders now need to come clean about what they plan to do to hit the targets, or what progress they can deliver if they expect to fall short.' In its report, the commission concluded there were some positive things in the strategy, including the extension of childcare support for low-income families and a greater acknowledgement of the problem of working poverty than before. But it criticised a lack of any clear measures to assess progress and the absence of a detailed plan covering what needs to happen to jobs, wages and benefits to ensure poverty goes down. It also identified limited action to get other parts of society, such as employers, engaged in tackling poverty and a lack of new action on in-work poverty as fundamental problems. In addition it accused the Government of ignoring the impact of welfare cuts and of continuing to distance itself from statutory measures in the Child Poverty Act 2010, which senior ministers describe as 'discredited', without suggesting any alternatives. 'Doomed': The report wants that 3.5million children will live in poverty by 2020 - five times the government's legal obligation to end it . The findings were published as new research carried out on behalf of the commission by Landman Economics revealed the 2020 child poverty targets will be missed by a large margin. It estimated that even overly optimistic assumptions about parental employment rates and earnings would still leave more than three million children - 21% - in absolute poverty by 2020 - almost five times the number needed to meet the Government's legal obligation to end it. To achieve the targets within the current council tax and benefits system, it said, would require “implausible” parental employment rates of close to 100%, combined with big increases in working hours of families in working poverty over and above the requirements of Universal Credit. A spokesman for the Department of Work and Pensions said: 'We remain committed to our goal of ending child poverty by 2020. Our strategy outlines plans to tackle the root causes of poverty, including worklessness, low earnings and educational failure. 'This approach is a better reflection of the reality of child poverty in the UK today and is the only way to achieve lasting change. 'Under this Government there are 300,000 fewer children living in relative income poverty and 100,000 fewer children in workless poor families. We have just seen the largest rise in employment for over 40 years and unemployment is falling. But there is more to do - and we are getting on with that job. 'The commission's own research highlights the weaknesses of the current child poverty measures - calculating poverty by income alone fails to address the issues which hold people back and that's what we're tackling.'","Former minister Alan Milburn says Britain struggling to reduce child poverty .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It's not often Dame Vera Lynn can be found in the company of rappers Pharrell and 50 Cent. But that’s precisely where the Forces’ Sweetheart found herself at the weekend when her latest album entered the charts at number 13. Vera Lynn: National Treasure was released on Monday to mark the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings and features 40 wartime songs, including We’ll Meet Again and The White Cliffs of Dover. Real gangsta: The latest release by Dame Vera Lynn, left, has been 50 Cent, right, in the album charts . It has propelled the 97-year-old to the position of oldest living artist to ever feature so highly on the chart. Her last major musical feat was five years ago when she became the oldest person to top the album chart, at the age of 92. Dame Vera said: ‘I am delighted of course. It is wonderful to hear these songs again that were at the top of the charts so long ago, and it’s warming to think that everyone else is listening to them too.’ The veteran singer made her professional debut at the age of seven, and was also the first British artist to top the US charts with Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart in 1952. Now her latest album is beating the likes of Pharrell, the Arctic Monkeys and rapper 50 Cent whose new album missed out on the top 20. Solo star Sam Smith retained his hold at the top of the chart with The Lonely Hour this week, while singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran achieved his first UK number one single with Sing. Sheeran's single, which was co-written and produced by US star Pharrell, sold nearly 124,000 copies over the last seven days, according to the Official Charts Company. It knocked Sam Smith's Stay With Me off the top spot, with the 22-year-old's track slipping to number two. A charity single inspired by teenage cancer victim Stephen Sutton also stormed into the top 20. Hope Ain't A Bad Thing by The Neon Brotherhood finished in 16th place. Tom Drover from Neon Sound Studios, who played guitar on the track, said: 'The idea was hatched when Stephen posted his thumbs up picture. We all decided to come together to do something for Ste, one of the things on his bucket list was to have a charity single.' Stephen, 19, raised millions of pounds for Teenage Cancer Trust before his death last month and all the profits from the song will go to the charity.","Vera Lynn: National Treasure released on Monday to coincide with D-Day .

"By . Liz  Hull . Out of pocket: Jon Williams, , a nutritionist with the Wales rugby team, ended up paying twice for a villa in order to safeguard his break . The holiday plans of thousands of Britons are in limbo after an upmarket villa firm went bust. Customers . of Villa Parade, which managed more than 1,000 properties across the . Mediterranean and in America, have been scrabbling to get their cash . back after it went under last month. It . is claimed the holiday watchdog, the Association of British Travel . Agents (Abta), was warned that the company was struggling, but allowed . them to continue taking bookings until a few weeks ago. The villa firm is the biggest in the travel industry to go under since 2008. It . is understood the firm, run by a husband and wife team, had run up . debts of more than £6.5million - £3.3million of which was owed to . holidaymakers. Brian . McLaughlin, the retired boss of music and film chain HMV, said he paid a . £2,500 deposit on a villa in Majorca that he booked for three weeks in . August. Although he . contacted Abta in April after hearing about the firm’s difficulties, he . claims he was reassured that Villa Parade was trading normally. ‘Abta . told me that as far as they were concerned Villa Parade was financially . sound and met their stringent conditions of membership,’ said Mr . McLaughlin, 64, said. ‘But . Villa Parade stopped answering the telephone and the final time I went . on their website the message said they had gone into liquidation. So . much for Abta and their assurances.’ Ceased trading: The message on Villa Parade's website after its parent company went bust last month . Holidays ruined: Thousands of breaks - including to Florida - have been scuppered after Villa Parade went bust . Jon . Williams, a nutritionist with the Wales rugby team, ended up paying . twice for a villa, also on the Spanish island, in order to safeguard his . break last month. He . handed over £2,500 to Villa Parade and the same amount to another travel . company that took over the defunct company’s bookings. Mr . Williams and his family were keen to hire the property, which they had . visited previously, because they knew it catered for the needs of his . ten-year-old daughter, who suffers from cerebral palsy. Mr Williams, 42, from Tredegar, South Wales, said: ‘We had been to the villa three times. ‘It . has an outdoor jacuzzi which is great for our little girl. I didn’t . want to risk going to Majorca and finding I was barred from the villa. ‘Once . I was out there, it was clear Villa Parade was no longer operating and . its office had closed down. Abta was reluctant to get involved. They . were absolutely useless. Abta is there to protect its members, not the . public.’ Luxury breaks: Villa Parade sold accommodation and flight packages to destinations including in Mallorca . Travelopo, a rival . villa rental firm, also said it approached Abta in April to warn them . that Villa Parade was allegedly not paying the private owners of villas . and owed them money. Roger . Fenton, Travelopo’s managing director, said: ‘Abta knew of the problem . for at least eight weeks. The Spanish owners came to us in desperation . because they hadn’t been paid for a year and were owed 2.5 million . Euros. ‘Not only that, they . had distressed holidaymakers turning up for accommodation they had . booked through Villa Parade whose contract had been cancelled. ‘We . alerted Abta as soon as we realised the scale of the problem - which . had clearly been brewing for well over a year. Abta should have acted . faster.’ Luxury villas: Villa Parade specliased in accommodation breaks in Spain, Florida and Portugal (pictured) Travelopo claims to have evidence that some villas had been triple and quadruple booked by Villa Parade before it went bust. Villa . Parade claimed that negative postings on travel websites such as . TripAdvisor wrecked consumer confidence in the company and led to its . rapid demise. A spokesman for Abta said it launched an investigation as soon as Travelopo raised concerns on April 9. ‘We . will be working with the liquidator and other stakeholders to . investigate the full circumstances of this failure, its causes and in . relation to the recovery of all assets and losses,’ he said. He insisted all customers would be reimbursed, either through their credit card companies or through Abta. Chris . Brooksbank, the company’s liquidator, admitted it was a ‘messy’ state . of affairs, but added: ‘In defence of the directors they have been fully . cooperative.’ Nightmare holiday: Lorraine and Mike Beasant were evicted from their villa during a family break to Mallorca . A . terminally ill woman was evicted by police from a holiday villa, after . Villa Parade failed to inform her it had cancelled her booking, writes CAROL DRIVER. Lorraine . Beasant was on a family trip to Mallorca – her last before her latest . round of treatment for cancer – when she was forced to leave the . five-bedroom property on the first night. The . 57-year-old, who was on holiday with her husband, Mike, her three . grown-up children and friends, booked the £1,450-a-week break through . Villa Parade in 2013. However, . the company failed to tell Mrs Beasant she was no longer able to stay . in the property, only sending her an email the day before her April 12, . 2014, booking, which she did not read. The . 10 adults arrived at Villa Moncho - chosen because it had a downstairs . bedroom so Mrs Beasant would not have to carry her medical equipment up . stairs - gaining entry at about 2pm by using a code given to them by . Villa Parade. However, neighbours alerted the Spanish owner, who called the police, who arrived later that evening. Mrs . Beasant told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were having a barbecue when the . owner and the local police turned up at about 9pm. My son came in and . said “I’m sorry to do this mum, but we’ve got to move out”. ‘It was a shock. It really upset me to be evicted hours after arriving.' The . property owner – who did not want to be named - claims he cancelled his . contract with Villa Parade in November 2013. He said he had no . knowledge of Mrs Beasant's booking and called the police to help with . translation.

"By . Dan Bloom . Police are launching a crackdown on domestic abusers during the World Cup after research showed it sends violence soaring - even when England wins.

It comes . after a study showed domestic incidents increase by more than a third . when England loses a World Cup match - but also rise by 26 per cent when . the team wins. Hard-hitting: Police are launching poster campaigns to counter abuse including in Northumbria (pictured) Stress: A study looked at how testosterone levels can spike during a dramatic match (file photo) In Essex 117 fans, seven of them . women, will reportedly be handed warnings after officers analysed their . history of domestic and footballing crime. A similar tactic is being employed in Northumbria, where officers warn they will be paying 'special attention' to people who are known to be a risk. Elsewhere posters in single-sex toilets and on bus stops will depict distraught women next to slogans including 'Leave the striking to the players' and 'What time is kick off in your house?' It comes after a report found a steep increase in domestic violence during the tournament. Researchers from Lancaster University examined crime figures from Lancashire Police during the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and found there was more violence on days when England played. In Surrey the increase was far more dramatic - with a 61 per cent leap in domestic violence reports on the day England drew 0-0 with Algeria in South Africa four years ago.

Lancashire Police Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said heavy drinking was often to blame . Several police forces have launched World Cup domestic violence campaigns today. Essex Police will pay personal visits to 117 fans known to be a risk, The Guardian reported. In Lancashire the football clubs Preston North End, Blackpool, Blackburn Rovers and Burnley have joined emergency services to launch a hard-hitting poster campaign. In . Hampshire, volunteers will accompany police on domestic violence calls . to discuss the victim's relationship history and look for ways to . escape. And in Northumbria, officers specialising in domestic violence cases will be on duty during the matches. Lancashire Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw said: 'Residents across the county will be coming together to watch the World Cup this summer, and it should be a time for fun and celebration. 'But unfortunately, experience tells us the tournament is also likely to be a time for excessive drinking – which can have devastating consequences.' Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird added: 'It is well known that there's a tendency for incidents of domestic violence to increase during high profile sporting events, particularly as more alcohol is consumed. 'High risk domestic violence offenders and those with links to football violence have been identified across the force area and officers will be paying special attention to them.' She added: 'It's important that we use these high profile events to raise this issue again, ensuring people generally know that this crime continues to happen even when most people seem to be happy and enjoying themselves.

"By . Wills Robinson . and Kieran Corcoran . Builders have rubbished claims that thousands of diggers are being buried under London houses when excavation work has finished. It was claimed the equipment is left at the bottom of the luxury homes belonging to London's super-rich - who are increasingly expanding their properties downwards to get round tight planning regulations. The heavy machinery is needed to hollow out the ground to make way for swimming pools, cinemas, garages and other trappings of wealth. But, according to the new theory, many of the projects are so ambitious the diggers are left with no way to dig their way out again. Construction: When basement excavations on London flats are finished, the diggers used are allegedly left in the ground because it is cheaper than bringing it back to street level (file picture) The strategy is often used for major infrastructure projects, such as the Channel Tunnel, during which one boring machine dug itself into the ground to let the others pass. The strategy could fuel further outrage over the trend for 'iceberg homes', which has led wealthy residents of London's most well-to-do boroughs to complain en masse - even taking their grievances to the High Court. Construction apparently workers cover the entombed machinery with earth and concrete, leaving it stuck underground instead. Earlier this week, Ed Smith from the New Statesman magazine said equipment discarded under London was worth around £5million. He . wrote: 'First, a crane would have to be hired; second, the entire . street would need to be closed for a day while the crane was maneuvered into place. 'Both of these stages were very expensive, not to mention unpopular among the distinguished local residents.' The phenomenon reportedly came to light when conversion specialists contracted to build 'sub-basement' extensions to homes which had already been enlarged found the leftover machinery when they started digging. Row: Around £5million worth of equipment is thought to have been discarded around London, but builders say the claims are 'complete nonsense' However, a top London builder has said that the claims are rubbish - and that the economics don't stack up because London floorspace is so valuable. Don O’Sullivan from London developers Galliard, has said the claims are rubbish and make no commercial sense. He told the Evening Standard: . 'With the basement space worth up to £8,000 per sq ft why would someone . leave such valuable space filled with dumped equipment and fill in . concrete? 'Much more valuable to extract and have as sellable space – oligarchs are rich but not stupid.' But if the strategy has migrated to private homes in London, it would be yet another sign . of the heights to which the capital's property market has soared. The . average London home is now worth £459,000, according to the Office for . National Statistics. Extravagant: Multi-storey basement extensions - such as the one above planned by Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing - are becoming more and more common . 'It's shocking': Actress Joan Collins says there is 'too much building work going on' in her London neighbourhood . Developers said the loss of expensive equipment would also be costly to property developers and would risk breaking stringent Health and Safety procedures. Kevin O’Connor, managing director of Cranbrook Basement added that the suggestion was 'utterly ludicrous' and there are always procedures that can make sure the digger is taken out. 'Hell': Queen guitarist Brian May has complained about works near his home in Kensington . Wealthy homeowners are digging downwards rather than sideways or outwards to fit in saunas, swimming pools, gyms, home cinemas and even workers' quarters. Actress Joan Collins expressed the outrage of many earlier this year, hitting out at her new neighbours in upmarket Belgravia - many of whom she said hardly even use their homes. The Dynasty actress, 80, told a residents' maagzine: 'It's really sad. I find it shocking . that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys . when they only live here for two or three months of the year.' Queen guitarist Brian May also took umbrage at building work near his Kensington home. Writing online last month he said: 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it’s becoming a hellhole'. Well-heeled residents have started to hit back - in June of last year Pamela, Countess Listowel, joined 57 other resident in Camden in lodging an official objection to basement plans on her Victorian street. The 77-year-old peer said: ''These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.' Also in 2013, a group of Hampstead residents including Lord Justice Leveson instructed lawyers to seek an injunction from the High Court to stop their council approving a bid for an underground swimming pool. Over the last five years, there have been 800 planning applications for basements in Kensington and Chelsea alone.","Equipment is allegedly being left undergound when excavations are finished .

"By . Liz Hull . With their throaty engines, gleaming chrome and endorsements from some of Hollywood’s coolest action heroes, Harley-Davidson have long been the motorcycle of choice for men – especially those in the grip of a mid-life crisis. But the famous American firm is hoping that is all about to change – with the launch of two new bikes specifically designed for women. The Street 500 and Street 750 are the firm’s first new bikes in 13 years and bosses hope they will become the must-have 'little black number' in every woman’s garage. Growing popularity: Harley Davidson have created new bikes especially for women following a 30 per cent rise in sales to female riders in the last decade . Designers have got rid of the large, bulbous petrol tanks and shiny chrome which are synonymous with Harley’s masculine style. Instead the bikes have been given a sleek, black makeover and include smaller handle grips, lower seats and different foot peg positions to appeal to female riders. The move to create a motorcycle for the female market has been fuelled by a 30 per cent rise in sales to women over the past decade in the US alone. One in 10 of Harley’s sales in America is now made to a woman. Bike of choice: With their throaty engines, gleaming chrome and endorsements from some of Hollywood's coolest action heroes, Harley-Davidson have long been the motorcycle of choice for men . Each May Harley holds Women Riders Month and the firm has also been holding 'garage parties' to teach motorcycle basics to women – such as how to pick up a bike safely – for the past eight years. Around 10,000 customers, many of them women, also attend Harley’s riding instruction programmes for people new to motorbikes each year in the US. International Female Ride Day – originally set up to celebrate women riders in Canada in 2006 – which is now celebrated in the US and UK, as well as countries further afield such as India, Russia and Brazil, is also proof of the rising popularity of motorcycling among the fairer sex, experts say. They reckon that focusing on the female market will help Harley challenge its Japanese competitors, especially Kawasaki and Suzuki.","The Street 500 and Street 750 are the firm's first new bikes in 13 years .

"By . Darren Boyle . A teenage Justin Welby rediscovered his Christian faith after dealing with the suicide of a teenage boy while on his gap year in Kenya, a new book has revealed. The new biography of Archbishop Welby said that while an 18-year-old gap year student teaching with an Anglican Missionary group, he was suffering a crisis of faith describing himself as 'agnostic'. However, after the traumatic experience, the young Welby told a friend that he had 're-committed himelf' to Christ. During his gap year in Kenya in 1974 Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, had to cut down the body of a school boy who had taken his own life, an event which caused him to reaffirm his faith . The book, by . Oxford academic Dr Andrew Atherstone, has discovered correspondence . that covers the period of Archbishop Welby's conversion. The Archbishop travelled to Kenya in January 1974 aged 18. He joined fellow teacher Phil Kelly, who was three years older, in the Anglican missionary organisation. Mr Kelly regularly wrote home to his mother and some of that correspondence has been used by Dr Atherstone for his profile of Archbishop Welby. In the correspondence, Mr Kelly tells his mother that the young Justin Welby felt 'agnostic'. However following the suicide in Kiburu, Kenya, Mr Kelly noticed a difference in the future Archbishop's outlook on the world. He and Archbishop Welby had to cut the teenager's body down from a tree. The biography, pictured, chronicles Archbishop Welby's early life in extensive detail as well as his first year in office and features numerous interviews with the Archbishop's friends and family . He said: 'Justin . says that for the last 11 months or so his Christian faith has been in . decline so much so that a fortnight ago he reckons that he was more . agnostic than Christian. 'But he felt that I had got something which . he hadn’t so he began praying again … and a couple of days ago . re-dedicated his life and accepted Christ as Lord, since when he has . felt much better and also had the growing feeling to write to his Dad . about their mutual relations.' Mr Kelly told the Sunday Telegraph: 'I don’t honestly know whether in a Justin’s mind the two were connected. 'It . was a pretty harrowing and depressing occasion and I know I didn’t . sleep too well for the next week or so and a lot of kids were very upset . about it.' The book reveals that Archbishop . Welby's mother Jane sold a diamond ring she had inherited from her . godmother to fund his gap year trip to Kenya. Before his religious studies, Archbishop Welby had been a senior oil executive working for several major companies. It . was while working in France in 1983 that he and his wife Caroline . suffered the tragic death of his seven-month-old daughter who died in a . car accident. Six years later, Archbishop Welby resigned from the corporate world. Welby became Archbishop of Canterbury in February 2013 having been ordained a deacon in 1992. According . to Dr Atherstone: 'It is hard to tell at this distance, so it is a . wondering - but I do wonder whether there is a connection between . dealing with this traumatic suicide incident and then two weeks later . recommitting his life to Christ. Is the timing just a coincidence or is . there a connection between the two?' Archbishop Welby spent his gap year teaching in an Anglican Missionary project in Kiburu, Kenya. He travelled to Africa aged 18 after leaving Eton in 1974 when he had to deal with the tragic suicide of one of his students .

"By . Tara Brady . The personal assistant who exposed sleazy emails at the very top of English football is suing the Premier League for £150,000 claiming it is 'institutionally sexist'. Former law student Rani Abraham, 41, is claiming sex discrimination and harassment over the messages she read between league chief executive Richard Scudamore and his associates. She says she is still 'in shock' over the shared emails joking about 'broads', referring to women as **** and ‘female irrationality’. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rani Abraham (left) is claiming sex discrimination and harassment over the messages she read between league chief executive Richard Scudamore (right) and his associates . Miss Abraham also alleges she was victimised by her former boss Scudamore, 54, after blowing the whistle on his 'horrific' sexism. The Premier League said ‘no further disciplinary action is required or justified’ after it was claimed Scudamore had apologised over the emails. She accuses him of trying to smear her by falsely claiming she accessed private emails against his instructions. She also wonders why her predecessor Paola Nyderek, 34, quit just weeks into her role as Scudamore's PA. Miss Abraham's legal action will pile further pressure on Scudamore, who has resisted calls for him to resign. The Premier League insists she was specifically told not to look at his private emails. In legal papers, Miss Abraham brands the Premier League an 'institutionally sexist old boys' club' and the Football Association 'not fit for purpose'. She alleges that the FA chose to 'cover up' the scandal when it should have charged Scudamore with bringing the game into disrepute. Her solicitor Lawrence Davies, of law firm Equal Justice, revealed she is seeking compensation for lost earnings and hurt feelings as well as aggravated and punitive damages. Miss Abraham brands the Premier League an 'institutionally sexist old boys' club' He said: 'The compensation she is seeking is £150,000 in total - a tiny fraction of the Premier League's £3 billion annual revenue.' Awards of punitive damages by tribunals are virtually unheard of in this country. Mr Davies said: 'There is no limit to the amount a tribunal can award in damages for sex discrimination. 'It is only a matter of time before a UK tribunal adopts the U.S. approach to punitive damages to kill discriminatory practices that still flourish here.' In legal papers lodged at Central London Employment Tribunal on Friday, Miss Abraham accuses Scudamore of 'despicable and vile' behaviour and says she has never received an apology from him. Miss Abraham, who has 14 years' experience as a personal assistant and previously worked for Vodafone and Orange, says she felt compelled to blow the whistle. She says: 'On discovering the sexist work emails in the course of my work at the Premier League, I was offended and disgusted. 'I actually re-read a few of the emails because I could not believe that I had read them correctly. It was surreal and very disturbing. 'As I discovered others in the course of my work, I found it completely sexist, disgusting, vulgar and very disrespectful to women. 'My grandfather always taught me to speak up for what I believe in. I knew that I had to do the right thing and expose what I had discovered. 'I was in shock. In a way, I still am. Then I could not believe that such an important executive could behave in such a despicable and vile manner. 'Later, I was in shock at the way the Premier League failed to investigate the matter and failed to discipline him.' Miss Abraham said she was shocked that the Premier League failed to discipline Scudamore . Miss Abraham says that Scudamore 'humiliated' his wife and five daughters by saying women become more irrational with every child they have. She said: 'Given my experience of his misogynistic conduct I feel very sorry for his wife and daughters. 'I do not believe that Mr Scudamore has any respect for women employees or indeed women generally.' 'I did not want to work with or have to face Richard Scudamore any more. 'I realised that the Premier League was institutionally sexist from top to bottom and that I did not want to work there any longer. 'I could not believe that such an important executive could behave in such a despicable and vile manner' Rani Abraham . 'As soon as I read the sexist emails I knew that our working relationship was irretrievably damaged by his conduct. I no longer respected him. 'The point is that the chief executive had used his work email account to send out vulgar and sexist communications and he did not seek to censor or moderate his vile language even though he must have known that in the course of my work it was likely that I would view them at some point and bedistressed by it. 'It came as a complete shock to me and afterwards I felt humiliated, harassed and belittled. 'I did not want any future female executive assistant to have to suffer as I had. 'I also thought it was in the public interest that people knew about the sexism at the Premier LeagueRani says of her predecessor Paola Nyderek: 'It was clear when I mentioned Paola that staff were visibly uncomfortable about it. No-one said anything apart from that it did not work out. It was odd.' Miss Abraham, of Kingsbury, north-west London, worked at the Premier League as Scudamore's £40,000-a-year temporary PA for two months between September and November last year. She said: 'As the executive assistant I was asked to monitor and to manage Mr Scudamore's three company email accounts, all of which are @premierleague.com addresses. 'I have never accessed Mr Scudamore's private email accounts and indeed do not know if he has such an account.' Miss Abraham's legal action will pile further pressure on Scudamore to resign . She says she was told: 'Keep on top of his emails. Stay one step ahead of him and then you'll know exactly what he wants'. She says Scudamore falsely claimed she accessed private emails against his instructions to try and discredit her. She said: 'This was clear victimisation and harassment of me. He was taking a swipe at my professionalism and integrity in order to divert from his own illegal sexist conduct. 'For the record he has never apologised to me for the offence caused to me. 'Of course, because he is unaccountable at the biased and institutionally sexist Premier League and the not fit for purpose FA I have now had to issue an employment tribunal claim to obtain justice.' She brands the FA's claim that it could not charge Scudamore because it was a private matter 'nonsense'. She said: 'It was not a private matter. The communications occurred in work emails. It was simply a cover up by the FA.' Rani admits forwarding some of the offending emails to her own personal account as evidence. She says Scudamore phoned her at home two days after she started working from there as she was suffering from stress. She said that he said 'It's just not working out, is it?' and then went quiet. She says: ""My contract was to be ended by them that day. Mr Scudamore asked me to compile a list of outstanding matters and to put it in an email to him. 'He did not thank me for my work at the Premier League. 'After the call, although it was shocking, I actually felt very relieved because I thought I could not return to work in such a hostile, sexist working environment.' Miss Abraham says she told her job agency what had happened and forwarded one of the emails to them but never heard from the agency again. It was only after she finally found another job seven months later that she dared blow the whistle. Miss Abraham says that she has suffered 'stress, anxiety and depression' over the whole affair. Scudamore likes to be seen as a champion of equality in football and has worked with the FA to promote a multi-million pound women and girls' programme. However, Football Association's powerful independent board member Heather Rabbatts has said he should consider his position. And a number of England women internationals, including Everton women's goalkeeper Rachel Brown-Finnis, have also called for tough action. After the emails were revealed, Scudamore said: 'Entering into email exchanges of this nature was wrong and the apology I have made is sincere, as is the contrition I feel.' He is having a 'routine' heart operation next week - but plans to be back in his role by the start of the season. A statement from the Premier League said: 'The Premier League would resist strongly any such claims. 'It would be inappropriate for us to comment any further as there is an ongoing investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office and the police into the unauthorised removal of confidential business and legally privileged material.'","Rani Abraham is claiming sex discrimination and harassment .

"The congested route from England’s World Cup base in Rio de Janeiro to their training ground is causing FA chiefs a ‘nightmare’. When The Mail on Sunday hired a coach last week to test the journey, it took a distinctly uncomfortable hour and 15 minutes.

"By . Julian Robinson . An engineer refused to install an electricity meter at a couple's home - after telling them he was not trained to climb step ladders. The worker, from Utility Warehouse, said he was not allowed to use ladders while he was carrying out work at John Stearn's house in Saltburn, Teeside. Instead, the engineer downed tools and left saying specialist colleagues would have to finish the job. An engineer told John Stearn, pictured with his wife Linda, that he could not install an electricity meter as he was not trained to climb a step ladder . The company says their employee was unable to carry out the work for 'health and safety reasons'. Mr Stearn added: 'You don't need a training course to be able to use a pair of ladders. 'You have to laugh at what seems another silly health and safety rule.' Utility Warehouse said the engineer did not carry out the work for 'health and safety reasons' while he was at the home of John Stearn and his wife Linda, pictured . He had asked his supplier to change both his gas and electricity meters to a pre-payment scheme. The gas meter was changed without any delay because it was at ground level but the electricity meter was placed on the wall above head height. With the pair facing financial difficulties, he had hoped the work could have been done quickly to help manage his bills. 'We agreed . to have pre-payment meters installed thinking it would be a simple . thing to do, but we had this delay over the ladders,' he added. Mr Stearn said that he had been one of the company's customers for 'a number of years'.

He said: 'We were able to install a gas pre-payment meter, but the installation of the electricity pre-payment meter has been delayed because the engineer we sent to do this work was unable to climb a ladder to exchange the meter due to health and safety reasons.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When Mike King was growing up in Louisville, Kentucky, his mother married a man who he describes as 'my DAD, the best thing that ever happened to me.' At eight years old, Mike promised Roger King that he would buy him a '57 Chevy Bel-Air on his 57th birthday. Roger King recently turned 57 - and Mike, now 31, was able to keep his promise, presenting his dad with a classic turquoise Chevy complete with bench seats and spotless interiors.

Oblivious: Roger King attempts to fix a cornhole board, unaware of the '57 Chevy Bel-Air in front of him (left) before spotting his new ride for the first time (right) Disbelief: An emotional and teary Roger King hugs his son Mike King before approaching his dream car . A touching video of the moment Mike presented Roger with the coveted car was posted to YouTube, where it's been viewed almost two million times. Roger King grew up poor in a family of seven children and had always dreamed of owning a '57 Chevy Bel-Air, never believing he'd ever have the opportunity. He and Mike often spent time poring over car magazines and discussing the virtues of the classic car, which Roger 'knew he never would be able to own.' 'My dad has been everything to me, he is not my biological father but he IS my father,' wrote on a Reddit post about the video. 'When I was eight years old I promised him that on his 57th birthday I would buy him a 57 Bel-Air. I never forgot and was able to fulfill my promise.'

In the video taken by Mike King's sister, Roger King is distracted by a cornhole board he is trying to fix in his son's driveway, and doesn't notice Mike opening his garage door to reveal the vehicle in all its glory. When his dad finally notices it, he lets out a small, 'No!' and hugs his son tight and sobs, overcome with emotion. When they walk into the garage, Mike King hands over the car keys and his dad examines the car in disbelief. Finally, he leans over and kisses its roof before climbing inside. 'This is spotless, man!' he says. In a Reddit post, Mike said that he's been holding onto the car for two years since he traveled to New Hampshire to buy it and has been hiding it from his dad in his garage. To afford the car, Mike says he was working at a factory and pulled 60-hour weeks for months to be able to afford the car. He says he hasn't done much to fix up the car, but that his dad is now retired and can spend all his time working on it.","As an eight-year-old, Mike King promised to buy his dad a '57 Chevy Bel-Air for his 57th birthday .

"By . Darren Boyle . Prosecutors investigating a major Italian corruption scandal believe businessmen accused of bribing politicians involved in sanctioning a £4.5 billion flood barrier scheme in Venice used edible paper so all evidence of the plot could be eaten. It is alleged that the list of politicians who received illegal payments was printed on the special paper so it could be quickly swallowed in the event of a police raid. The Mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni has been arrested as part of the investigation although he insisted to a judge that he is innocent of all charges. Mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, pictured, has been placed under house arrest by police after he was accused of accepting £455,000 in illicit payments from developers behind the city's £4.5 billion flood defence scheme . Prosecutors claim that firms behind the ambitious Venice flood defence scheme, pictured, kept details of illegal payments to politicians on special edible paper that could be eaten in the event of a police raid . In December 2008 the city suffered serious flooding after the sea rose to more than 1.6 metres above it's normal level, which was the highest flood in more than 30 years . The corruption claims surround the construction of a Venice's new flood defence system which is designed to protect the city from rising water level. The Moses project was first considered in 1966 but work on the ambitious scheme was stalled until construction began in 2004 after concerns over the project's design, how it would be funded and its environmental impact. Prosecutors investigating the scheme have issued 25 jail warrants and a further ten for house arrest. They are investigating claims of corruption, illicit party financing and tax fraud. A 700-page document has been produced by authorities following a three-year investigation into the scheme. Anti-corruption police launched a series of raids early this week and have seized assets worth £32 million. It is believed that in return for illicit payments, politicians agreed to sign off on inflated invoices from the construction companies involved in building the project. Construction on the ambitious scheme began in 2004 when investigators believe that a consortium behind the project used an £18 million slush fund to pay off politicians who in return signed off on inflated invoices . According to the Daily Telegraph, a member of the Consorzio Venezia Nuova consortium involved in the £4.5 billion project's construction told a consultant: 'Write it on different paper, edible paper. You can swallow it if someone arrives one day. I'm not joking.' The conversation was recorded by police during their three-year investigation. It is believed that politicians received illegal payments from an £18 million slush fund. Mayor Orsoni is accused of receiving £455,000 from the scheme's developers to help fund his 2010 re election campaign. His lawyer said Orsoni was 'very strained and suffering both in human terms and from the point of view of his office.' Prosecutors have placed Mayor Orsoni under house arrest. According to prosecutors: 'As the investigation continued, it emerged that most of these funds were used to buy political power ... and to bribe senior public officials.' The first part of the ambitious flood protection scheme opened last year while the project is due to be completed in 2016.","£4.5 billion flood scheme designed to save Venice from future disaster .

"By . Julian Robinson . Jet passengers had to leap down an emergency chute moments after smoke was spotted pouring from the aircraft's brakes as landed. Dozens of holidaymakers returning to Britain from Alicante had to slide down from the Jet 2 plane after it had touched down at Blackpool airport. The incident happened just days after British passengers told of their terror when a separate Jet 2 flight was forced to make an emergency landing in Bulgaria due to loss of cabin pressure. Dozens of holidaymakers were asked to slide down an emergency chute at Blackpool Airport after smoke was seen coming from the brakes on landing . The Blackpool drama, on Friday, came after air traffic control spotted smoke and told the pilot to evacuate. One passenger, Andrew Dance reported how there was a 'bumpy' landing and that people started to 'panic' after the 139 passengers on board were informed of the evacuation. Eyewitnesses reported that some passengers suffered cuts and bruises after sliding down the chutes, though the airline says everyone on board evacuated 'safely'. Lancashire Fire and Rescue said they were called to assist emergency response staff at the airport, but their services were not required. A  Jet 2 spokesman told the Blackpool Gazette: ‘The captain was advised to evacuate flight LS740 from Alicante as a precautionary measure after Blackpool Airport air traffic control spotted smoke coming from the brakes on landing. ‘All passengers evacuated safely and are being cared for by our team at the airport. A full investigation is now underway.’ The Boeing 737-330 landed at about 1.20pm on Friday before the chutes were deployed. Days earlier, on June 4,  a separate Jet 2 flight LS516 had to divert to Sofia Airport in Bulgaria after the plane started to rapidly descend just an hour after departing from Paphos, Cyprus, to Newcastle.

"By . Paul Donnelley . It is believed that 58 people have died and it is feared that the death toll could reach three figures as a remote part of northern Afghanistan is hit by floods. In addition, thousands more have been left homeless. The flooding is the most recent in a series of deadly flash floods, landslides and avalanches in a part of the country that is almost cut off from the rest. Lt Fazel Rahman, the chief of police in the Guzirga i-Nur district of northeastern Baghlan, said that 54 bodies have been recovered so far including the remains of women and children, but many others are still missing. Villagers recover the body of a victim of the floods in Baghlan. More than 50 are known to have died although some sources put the death toll as high as 100 . He called for emergency assistance from the central government. 'So far no one has come to help us. People are trying to find their missing family members,' Lt Rahman said, adding that the district's police force was overstretched by the scale of the disaster. A statement from the office of the president Hamid Karzai put the death toll at 58 while other sources placed it higher still. Gen Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defence Ministry, said that two Army helicopters have been sent to the area to provide assistance. Afghan police and villagers retrieve the bodies of people who died in the flooding in northeastern Baghlan, north of Kabul, Afghanistan . Afghans look for their belongings in their house damaged after flooding in northeastern Baghlan left more than 1,000 people homeless . The Afghanistan Natural Disaster Management Authority has begun shipping out stockpiles of food and other supplies to the affected area, said Mohammad Aslim Sayas, the deputy director of the agency. Guzirga i-Nur district is located more than 85 miles north of the provincial capital, Puli Khumri. Jawed Basharat, the spokesman for the Baghlan police, said that they were aware of the flooding, but that it would take eight to nine hours for them to reach the area by road. Although people in the north of the country have for the most part been spared the horrors of the war, they have been subjected to several natural disasters. Last month, a landslide triggered by heavy rain buried large sections of a remote northeastern village in Badakhshan which borders China, displacing some 700 families. Authorities have yet to provide an exact figure on the number of dead from the May 2 landslide, and estimates have ranged from 250 to 2,700. Officials say it will be impossible to dig up all the bodies. A landslide in Baghlan in 2012 killed 71 people. After days of digging unearthed only five bodies, authorities decided to halt the recovery effort and turn the area into a memorial for the dead.","Northern part of country mainly avoided civil war but been hit by natural disasters .

"By . Brendan Carlin . MP Simon Burns, the former HS2 Minister, spoke out after Mr Bercow filed a 13-page protest over new laws that pave the way for the rail link . A former Tory Rail Minister last night called Commons Speaker John Bercow a ‘cry baby’ for objecting to the HS2 high-speed rail line – because building works will cause traffic jams near his home. MP Simon Burns said ‘biased’ Mr Bercow, whose Buckingham constituency is on the route of the £50 billion rail link, should be banned from chairing Commons debates on the issue. In an unprecedented verbal assault on the Speaker – traditionally a non-party political role – Mr Burns said that Mr Bercow should resign if he was ‘so concerned’ about the matter, enabling him to vote against it as a backbench MP. Mr Burns, who was until last October the Government’s HS2 Minister, spoke out after the Speaker, who entered Parliament as a Tory, filed a 13-page protest over new laws that pave the way for the rail line from London to Birmingham. Mr Bercow demanded to be called as a witness before a Commons committee to object to plans for the line, which he has previously condemned as ‘a wasteful white elephant’. He also called for cash compensation for residents affected by the route – and protection for a rare species of bats. And he said traffic jams caused by building works would inconvenience him by causing ‘delays in journey times travelling to and from my home’. His demands provoked an extraordinary counter-attack by Mr Burns, who has been in a long-running feud with Mr Bercow after he was overheard calling him a ‘stupid, sanctimonious dwarf’. Mr Burns, MP for Chelmsford, said last night: ‘John Bercow should join the real world. Everyone has to put up with traffic delays when there’s major improvements to infrastructure. 'To cry like a baby about that and use it to try to stop a project that is going to bring so many jobs and connect the great cities of this country really is special pleading. ‘If he’s so worried about being able to drive round his constituency, he could resign and vote against it from the backbenches.’ He also accused the Speaker of favouring HS2 opponent and fellow Buckinghamshire MP Cheryl Gillan in Commons debates. ‘Every time Cheryl gets up to speak on HS2, he calls her to speak first and he sits there grinning like a Cheshire Cat, nodding in approval,’ he said. He added that Mr Bercow had a right as a constituency MP to speak up for residents – but should be removed from the Speaker’s Chair for debates on HS2. He asked why Mr Bercow was allowed to preside over an HS2 debate in April when opponents, led by Mrs Gillan, tried to block the legislation. ‘Bercow should have excused himself from the start because he has a vested interest,’ he said. ‘It should be left to one of the Speaker’s deputies. I have no idea who is advising him on this, but it doesn’t matter because, if he disagrees, he will throw a tantrum. Mr Bercow, whose Buckinghamshire constituency is on the London to Birmingham route, demanded to be called as a witness before a Commons committee to object to the 'wasteful white elephant' 'He should not be given special privileges simply because he’s Speaker.’ Mr Burns’s attack marks a new low in relations between the Tories and the Speaker. A . former Right-wing Conservative, Mr Bercow forged strong links with . Labour MPs, whose support was vital in his success in being elected as . Speaker. Tory MPs claim he is ‘biased’ towards Labour and singles out Tory MPs, such as Mr Burns, for rebukes for heckling. A spokeswoman for Mr Bercow last night denied any bias, adding that he had been ‘scrupulously impartial’ in the HS2 debate. She . said: ‘In his capacity as a local MP, he petitioned on behalf of his . constituents, just as a Government Minister would do, and joined . thousands of other people who petitioned against the Bill.’","MP Simon Burns said the Speaker should resign if he was 'so concerned'

Montana neighbors say gold is pouring right out of their water taps, and they're worried that's not all their drinking water contains.

Digging deeper: Mark Brown has been finding gold flakes in his tap water and wants to know what else could be in there that he can't see . Golden stream: Mark Brown's wife Sharon noticed the gold as she let water out of the kitchen sink . 'She pulled the plug to let the water out and it was glistening, gleaming little flecks,' Brown told NBC. They decided that it couldn't possibly be gold, says Brown, but chemical tests proved that the flecks were, in fact, pure gold. 'I can't explain it... It's bizarre,' he said. The Browns' neighbor Paul Harper says he's also been getting gold in his drinking water. Whitehall gets its drinking water from two wells in the middle of town, reports NBC Montana.

NBC reports that an official with the State Department of Environmental Quality said there's no reason to suspect the gold came from the mine.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A transgender woman was held as a sex slave for months and beaten by a Louisiana trio - who seem to have confessed to the abuse with online memes. A town marshal in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, found the woman, whose identity has been withheld, with a logging chain wrapped around her near a Natchitoches highway, KATC reported. Police said the chain was removed by firefighters. David Rodriguez Jr., 37, his wife Christina Harper, 39, and their friend Ambre Lomas, 39, turned themselves in to the Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office. They face multiple charges, including human trafficking, kidnapping, false imprisonment and battery. Suspects: Couple Christina Harper and David Rodriguez, pictured, reportedly kept a woman as a sex slave in their home and abused her . Alleged suspect: Ambre Lomas, seen here in her booking photo, also allegedly beat and abused the victim . Digital connection: Rodriguez and Harper reportedly met the victim online through a BDSM website . Harper's Facebook page has several Bit Strip animated memes that appear to show her and Lomas abusing the victim. One shows Harper whipping the victim and comes with the tag that the victim 'thinks Christina is a real slave driver.' The victim, who is from Minnesota, agreed to move into Rodriguez and Harper's home about two years ago after meeting on a BDSM website, police said in a press conference. Though Rodriguez allegedly helped her move in, she told police she was forced to give him her money and her motorcycle. Rodriguez then allegedly tattooed the woman and listed her as a slave online. 'In this particular case, the victim probably had some depression, going through the sex change, being disowned by her family,' Natchitoches Parish Sheriff's Office criminal investigator Carey Etheredge said in the press conference. 'Suspects prey on people in this situation. They know how to talk to them, what to say to them to make them feel comfortable and make them think they’re coming to live a different life.' The woman was forced to perform sex acts, along with serving food and beverages, completing yardwork and working on a swimming pool, she told police. If she refused, Rodriguez, Harper and Lomas allegedly beat her and carved markings into her body, police said. The trio also allegedly tazed her and threw water on her. Authorities said in a press conference the woman slept in a 3-by-5 wooden box. Cruel humor: Harper, right, is depicted as 'a real slave-driver' abusing the victim, whose identity has been withheld . Macabre: Another meme appeared online showing Lomas apparently trying to hide Harper's dead body in a wooden box...not unlike the 3-by-5-foot box their alleged victim slept in . Pain: Harper seems ready to drill into Lomas in this brutal meme . The woman was chained outside for two days after she said she wanted to leave, KATC reported. The woman was allegedly taken to a building and chained inside. She escaped and drove one of the suspects' cars before she approached the assistant town marshal. Police have said that the relationship was consensual at one point, but they do not know which acts the victim was forced into, the Town Talk points out. NPSO Chief Investigator Greg Dunn told KATC that deputies recovered 15 guns, a stun gun, and digital equipment when they . searched the home on Wednesday. Two teenage children were also removed from the home and placed in child protective services.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A photo opportunity in a pub might have seemed just the thing to prove that Nick Clegg and Vince Cable are still good friends. But the Lib Dem duo looked decidedly awkward as they posed with a pint in a Soho watering hole this morning, in an echo of the desperate attempts by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown to appear united while privately at war. The love-in was supposed to focus on a plan to stop big name pub chains ripping off landlords, but all eyes were on the relationship between the Lib Dem leader and his rival whose friend was caught plotting to topple him. Scroll down for video . Nick Clegg and Vince Cable posed in the Queen's Head in Piccadilly just a week after the Lib Dem leader faced calls to resign . Mr Clegg was behind the bar, pulling a pint of London Pride for his Lib Dem colleague . The Lib Dem ministers hoped to promote a new crackdown on big pub chains ripping off landlords . All eyes were on the body language between the Lib Dem duo, after it emerged Mr Cable's friend Lord Oakeshott had been plotting to topple Mr Clegg as leader . The Lib Dems were plunged into crisis last week in the wake of dire election results, which saw Mr Clegg's party lose 300 council seats and all but one of his 12 MEPs. It later emerged Lord Oakeshott, a friend and ally of Mr Cable, had commissioned and leaked a series of opinion polls designed to show the party needed to ditch Mr Clegg. Lord Oakeshott warned that the party is ‘heading for disaster’ under Mr Clegg and he claimed Mr Cable knew all about secret polling he commissioned in Lib Dem seats to show they would do better without Mr Clegg as leader. Mr Cable was forced to break away from a trade visit to China to deny knowing about the plot, with allies of Mr Clegg furious at being left in the dark. Over a pint of ale in the Queen's Head pub in Piccadilly, the two men sought to put the turbulent rows behind them. Mr Clegg pulled a pint of London Pride beer for Mr Cable and an Archer Mild Ale for himself as the pair talked pubs, policy and chandeliers in the pub. Mr Clegg and Mr Cable were both at pains to stress that the Business Secretary (right) knew nothing about the plotting of his friend Lord Oakeshott . Mr Clegg insisted he wanted the Lib Dems to ask 'searching questions' about the dire election results, which saw the loss of more than 300 council seats and 11 of 12 MEPs . Mr Clegg insisted that he and Mr Cable were still getting on very well despite the turmoil of recent weeks . Mr Clegg said today: 'Vince has been very, very clear - he had absolutely no idea what Matthew Oakeshott was getting up to with his polls. 'All I would say is setting personalities aside, we had a really bad result last week. 'It's the most normal thing in the world that, after such a bad result, Vince, myself, the whole party - we're having a parliamentary party meeting tomorrow - that we really ask ourselves the most searching questions about what we can do to make sure we get our message across.' Mr Clegg said this included stressing his party's role in developing the economy, pensions, taxes and schools. Lord Oakeshott, a friend of Mr Cable, quit the party last week after being exposed for commissioning and leaking damaging opinion polls . An apparently humbled Mr Cable also told reporters: 'We work together, I support his leadership. We're going to move on from some very difficult elections. I'm optimistic we are going to turn this corner.' He added: 'I haven't been communicating with Lord Oakeshott recently.' A media scrum focussed on their body language risked overshadowing a crackdown on eye-watering contracts imposed by companies seeking to squeeze more profit out of struggling landlords. Publicans who have to buy beer and supplies at higher prices from so-called pubcos say they are struggling to make a decent living, with rents pushed up without warning. Under the changes landlords will get new rights under a statutory code, and an independent watchdog will have the power to resolve disputes. The adjudicator will enforce the new code, arbitrate disputes, carry out investigations into alleged breaches and impose sanctions on pub-owning companies if they fail to comply. Mr Clegg said: ‘British Pubs are often the centre of our community, a place where we meet friends, watch sport and enjoy a Sunday roast - they are a national treasure and the envy of the world. ‘They also contribute billions to our economy every year. But, for too long, landlords who are tied to larger pub companies have struggled to make ends meet. ‘The self-regulatory approach hasn't worked, so these new rules will give fairer treatment for landlords so that they can keep your local pub going strong.’ Mr Cable said: ‘Local pubs and their owners play a vital part in vibrant local communities right across the country, as well as making an important contribution to the economy. ‘Far too many landlords feel their income is squeezed by big pub companies. So today we are taking action to make sure they get a fairer deal. ‘The introduction of a statutory code will make sure that tied tenants get an accurate assessment of how better off they could be and the new independent adjudicator would make sure pubs companies are forced to act to redress the situation if they aren't behaving responsibly.’ Tied tenants have to buy beer from their pubco, usually paying a higher price, leading to complaints that they cannot compete with other pubs. The Lib Dem love-in had echoes of Tony Blair buying Gordon Brown an ice-cream in Gillingham in the run-up to the 2005 general election. The Labour PM came under intense pressure to name a date for handing over power to Mr Brown . Last month David Cameron and his Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson put on a united front during a walkabout in a market in Newark, when the Prime Minister bought his old school friend some Rocky Road cake . Under the new code, the Government said pub landlords will benefit from fairer rent assessments. All landlords running a pub under a ‘tied’ contract will be given the power to request a rent review if they have not had one for five years. For the first time, tied tenants will also have the right to review the information pub-owning companies have used to decide to increase rents. Ministers believe this greater transparency will allow tenants to see what information their landlord has used in calculating the rent, and decide whether an increase is fair. There will be additional protection for tenants whose pub-owning company owns 500 or more tied pubs. The Government held a consultation a year ago on the pubco system, which attracted a huge response from the industry. Steve Kemp, of the GMB union, said: ‘Self-regulation has been rejected, which is to be welcomed. ‘We will study what is proposed to see how workable it is, but we regret that the free-of-tie option has been ruled out.’","Lib Dem duo try to present united front after botched leadership coup .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Andy Murray has criticised Alex Salmond’s decision to ‘photobomb’ David Cameron with a Saltire after he won last year’s Wimbledon finals. Stressing he always plays as a Brit, yhe tennis ace said he ‘didn’t like it’ when the First Minister unfurled the flag in the Royal Box, moments after his dramatic win over Novak Djokovic. Mr Salmond was widely criticised at the time for trying to hijack the sporting triumph to push his case for Scottish independence, with critics telling him to ‘put it away dear’. Scroll down for video . Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond waved the Scottish flag after Andy Murray won the 2013 Wimbledon Men's Singles final . Murray has revealed he 'didn't like it' but was nervous about expressing a view on Scottish independence . Mr Salmond smuggled the blue and white flag into Centre Court in the handbag of his wife, Moira. As the crowd stood to applaud Murray’s win in straight sets, he pulled the Saltire out and waved it around directly behind Mr Cameron’s head. The move was seen as a crass attempt to politicise one of the crown jewels in the sporting calendar. Now, almost a year later, Murray himself has admitted he was not happy with the stunt. In an interview with the Sunday Times he said had met Mr Salmond after winning the US Open in 2012. ‘He seemed perfectly nice to me but I didn’t like it when he [Salmond] got the Scottish flag up at Wimbledon,’ Murray said. Mr Salmond defended his behaviour last year, insisting it had been a long time coming. Barack Obama spoke out against independence . Alex Salmond today expressed surprise at US President Barack Obama issuing a public warning against independence. Mr Obama last week said the US wanted Britain to remain ‘strong, robust, united and effective’, adding: ‘From the . outside, at least, it looks like things have worked pretty well.' In response, Mr Salmond told BBC One's Mar Show: ;It was certainly surprising, because the American government had made it very clear they were staying studiously neutral in the democratic referendum that is taking place in Scotland. 'But then of course, David Cameron has been begging everybody internationally to say anything to help with his travails at the moment. He’s right to be worried, incidentally – the latest yes poll’s at 46 per cent. 'So perhaps on the Richter scale of presidential interventions, this was pretty mild. It’s a matter for the folks of Scotland; he hopes that the UK will be strong and united as an ally. Well, if Scotland becomes independent, America will have two allies in these islands, not one.' 'It’s the first Scot since Harold Mahony in 1896 – it’s not something that happens very often, so I think a few saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all, the SNP leader said. 'This was after the match was finished, incidentally. This was part of the celebration. 'And the answer is no, I am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal box. 'I had the flag last year, actually – I just didn’t get the chance to wave it.' But Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said at the time: 'I think it was a wee bit of a stunt... my advice to Alex would just be ""Put it away dear"".' Murray remains cautious about being seen to express a view on the prospect of Scotland breaking away from the UK, but he insisted he had always played as a Brit. He added: ‘I started competing for Great Britain when I was 11. ‘I’m 27 now and I’ve been competing for Great Britain for 16 years.’ A year before winning the Wimbledon championships in 2013, Murray won gold on the same court in the London 2012 Olympic Games. But he said he did not know who he would play for if Scotland does go it alone. Voters in Scotland will decide whether to back independence in a referendum on September 18. While recent polls have suggested support for independence is growing, an IpsosMORI last week put Yes on 36 per cent and No on 54 per cent. Politicians on both sides of the debate have locked horns on the merits and dangers of breaking up the UK, but few Scottish celebrities have spoken out in fear of alienating half of the country. Actor Sean Connery is backing the Yes campaign, while singer Rod Stewart, comedian Billy Connolly and cyclist Sir Chris Hoy have voiced doubts about independence. Those who have urged Scotland to stay in the UK – including singer David Bowie – have been viciously criticised online by the so-called CyberNats. Mr Salmond insisted that there was nothing wrong with celebrating the first Scot winning Wimbledon since 1896 . Murray suggested this was playing a part in his decision not to express a view either way. 'I don’t know even when I was younger whether that is something I would have talked about,’ he added. ‘It’s very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you’re an absolute idiot,’ he said. A spokesman for Mr Salmond said: 'Andy is reigning Wimbledon Champion and a great Scottish tennis player. He has made it clear a number of times that he doesn't want to comment on Scottish politics. 'Everyone should just accept that and let him get on with playing tennis, rather than attempt to put him on the spot about who he would play for in a future Olympics.'","First Minister criticised for stunt ahead of independence referendum .

"The legal fees of Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saif will be funded by the British taxpayer as he faces a war crimes trial at the Hague. An 'exceptional' decision has been taken to pay a British barrister to represent Saif Gaddafi, by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC receives around 20 per cent of its £100million funding from the UK. Saif Gaddafi is currently being in Libya, where he is on trial via video link for corruption and war crimes in connection with the 2011 uprising. If he is found guilty, he is likely to be executed. An 'exceptional' decision has been taken to pay a British barrister to represent Saif Gaddafi, by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague . The ICC has ruled that the 41-year-old son of Gaddafi will not get a fair trial in his home country. It instead wants him to released into its custody and to appear at The Hague on trial for war crimes. The Sunday Telegraph  reports that the ICC court is now footing the bill for London based barrister John Jones to represent him - who has filed papers on behalf of Gaddafi accusing the Libyan government of breaching his client’s human rights. The court said it had 'exceptionally decided to assume the costs of Mr Gaddafi’s legal representation on a provisional basis until such time as an assessment of his disposable means has been conducted'. The decision by the ICC to fund Gaddafi's legal fees was criticised by politicians and military figures. Conservative MP Rob Wilson, parliamentary private secretary to Chancellor George Osborne, said the ICC was effectively handing legal aid to Saif Gaddafi - something which is only available to those who are wholly or partly indigent. George Clooney's fiancée Amal Alamuddin, an international human rights lawyer, is representing al-Senussi, Colonel Gaddaf's former right-hand man, who is accused of numerous atrocities against his people . He said: 'This does not seem to be the case with Saif Gaddafi, who comes from a hugely wealthy family and is thought to have siphoned off millions of pounds over the years.' Mr . Jones told the paper that he is being paid £70-an-hour in legal . fees, that the taxpayer’s contribution was 'infinitesimally small' and that his hours are capped by the ICC. He . said rather than focus on the costs of the trial he said that it should . be known that Gaddafi  - who is currently being held in a prison in . Zintan, and has appeared only via video link - is facing the death . penalty and deserved the right to a fair trial. The . elder Gaddafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 . years before he was ousted by an uprising in August 2011. He was captured and killed in October, along with his son Muatassim. The ICC has ruled that the 41-year-old son of Gaddafi will not get a fair trial in his home country. It instead wants him to released into its custody and to appear at The Hague on trial for war crimes . Gaddafi's younger sons Seif al-Arab and Khamis were killed earlier in the civil war. Saif is accused of murdering civilians during the Libyan revolution. He was charged alongside Abdullah al-Senussi, with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court. George Clooney’s fiancée Amal Alamuddin, an international human rights lawyer, is representing al-Senussi, Colonel Gaddafi’s former right-hand man, who is accused of numerous atrocities against his people. She is helping the 64-year-old appeal against the decision to allow his trial to take place in Libya, where he could face the death penalty. al-Senussi was convicted in absentia by a French court for the 1989 bombing of a French airliner. In Libya he is accused of overseeing a prison massacre of 1,200 inmates as well as torture and hangings. Under United Nations rules, the Hague court was due to hear the case unless Libya could prove that it was capable of overseeing it. Libya was given approval last October, despite allegations that al-Senussi had been mistreated  in custody.","Barrister paid to represent Saif Gaddafi by International Criminal Court .
