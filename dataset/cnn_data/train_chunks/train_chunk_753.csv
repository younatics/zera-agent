A boy shivers in the harsh Oslo winter, pathetically wrapping his arms around himself on a bus stop bench. He isn't wearing a coat and temperatures in the Norwegian capital regularly plunge to -10C during winter. A heartbreaking scene, but the actions of the ordinary people who witnessed the plight of 11 year old Johannes Lønnestad Flaaten is both joyous and inspiring. A young blonde woman who sat next to the boy and notices him rubbing his arms. She immediately asks him: 'Don't you have a jacket?' Scroll down for video . This 11 year old boy was filmed as he sat shivering without a coat at a bus stop in Oslo, Norway. The actions of people who saw his discomfort will bring a smile to even the most jaded souls . Caring: This young woman asks him why he has no coat in such cold weather. He replies that it was stolen . Warm heart: She takes off her own jacket and wraps it around the freezing boy . 'No, someone stole it,' he replies. She questions him and discovers he was on a school trip and was told to meet his teacher at the bus stop. She asks him the name of his school and where he's from as she selflessly drapes her own coat around his shoulders. Later, another older woman at first gives him her scarf, then wraps him in her large padded jacket. Johanne's predicament was a hidden camera experiment by Norwegian charity SOS Children’s Village as part of their winter campaign to gather donations to send much-needed coats and blankets to help Syrian children get through the winter. Many of the refugees have left their homes without winter clothing. Throughout the day, more and more people offered Johannes their gloves and even the coats off their backs as they waited for their bus. One man even sat shivering in his t-shirt so Johanne could be wrapped up in his warm coat. Sacrifice: This man endured the savage temperature in just a T-shirt so the boy could get warm . Another woman tries to help him track down his 'teacher', and then wraps him up in her scarf. She later gives him her coat as well . The video ends with the message: 'Are you a person who would act when you see someone who needs help?', followed by information about how donations can be made. 'People should care as much about children in Syria as they care about this boy,' Synne Rønning, the information head of SOS Children’s Villages Norway, told The Local. According to Johannes, who volunteered for the experiment, only three people out of the dozens who came and sat at the bus stop made no effort to help him. 'There were so many nice people,' he said. According to Johannes, who volunteered for the experiment, only three people out of the dozens who came and sat at the bus stop made no effort to help him . 'We filmed for two days, and I thought maybe only three or four of them would give me their jacket altogether. But there are many more who did it. Many more than those who are shown in the video.' Since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011, more than two million Syrians - at least half of them children - have fled the violence in their homeland to neighboring countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Many have spent the winter in flimsy tents with often only a plastic sheet covering the ground. Gift: A woman gives Johannes her gloves. The stunt was to raise awareness of the plight of Syrian child refugees . This group of people tried to help the boy out of his predicament.

In the capital, Beirut, many Syrians live in underground parking lots, under bridges and on old construction sites with no running water, sanitation, electricity or protection from Lebanon's sizzling summers and its freezing winters.","An 11-year-old boy was filmed as he struggled against the cold without a coat in Oslo .

Sentenced: PC Christopher Hamilton was jailed for three years for inflicting 'cruel' behaviour on the child . A police officer has been jailed after subjecting a child to a campaign of shocking abuse. Christopher Hamilton from Gateshead was working as a PC when he began a sickening course of what a judge branded 'sheer and deliberate cruelty' against the youngster. His victim suffered a series of disturbing injuries as well as significant emotional abuse while alone with the disgraced officer. A court heard the child suffered burns to their hands, bruising to the face and hair loss. And in a sickening twist, Hamilton left the victim in tears after making humiliating videos on his phone. While he recorded the footage, he forced the youngster to say hurtful things about their family members and even recorded the youngster on the toilet. Now Hamilton, who also abused his position to look up details of tenants on the police computer, has been jailed. Judge Penny Moreland, at Newcastle Crown Court said the only motive she could think of for the abuse was that Hamilton derived pleasure from it. The judge added: 'Police officers are entrusted by society with a duty to protect the public, particularly vulnerable members of the public. 'You were, at the time, a police officer and you abused your power and were cruel to that little child. 'This arose, in my view, from sheer cruelty, it was a course of protracted and calculated ill-treatment. You were deliberately cruel.' The youngster suffered burns and blisters to the back of the hands while trying to wash with scalding water, the court heard. It also suffered bruising to its genitals from a toilet seat and bruising to its face from a swing. Hamilton accepted subjecting the child to cruel emotional abuse. He videoed the child on at least four occasions, subjecting it to an interrogation and reducing it to tears and obvious distress. The court heard Hamilton had been a PC since 2002 and worked at Gateshead and Whickham police stations. However he resigned in 2012 when the allegations came to light. Hamilton pleaded guilty to cruelty to a person under 16 by willfully ill-treating them in a mannerlikely to cause suffering or injury. He pleaded guilty to cruelty on the basis he did not cause the injuries but should have prevented them. A charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm on the child was left to lie on file. He also admitted unlawfully obtaining personal data from the police computer, for which he was fined Â£500. Mark Kelly, defending, said: 'His behaviour was wrong and totally inappropriate but he does not accept he caused the injuries.' Cruel: Judge Penny Moreland, at Newcastle Crown Court said the only motive she could think of for the abuse was that Hamilton derived pleasure from it .","Christopher Hamilton was a PC when he began the cruel behaviour .

A devoted American social worker has been stabbed to death by her Indian husband of five months - who then returned to their home and blew himself up. Erin Willinger, 35, a yoga teacher and psychologist from New York, was found dumped in a bush with multiple stab wounds to her face and body in the city of Agra on Thursday night, according to Indian news reports. Her husband, 32-year-old Bunty Sharma, returned to their home, where he is believed to have ignited cooking gas, causing a massive explosion that killed him. The tragedy comes just months after the couple met and married - but accused each other of lying about previous marriages, while Willinger also accused her new husband of infidelity. Loss: Erin Willinger, from New York, was killed by her Indian husband in India on Thursday evening . Tragic: Willinger had only moved to Agra, India in July and met Bunty Sharma, left, whom she married in October. After killing her on Thursday, he returned to their home and blew himself up . Willinger had visited Agra - which is about 120 miles south of New Delhi - with a group of Americans in July and chose to stay after telling the Indo-Asian News Service she wanted to help make the city worthy of 'such a beautiful monument as the Taj Mahal'. After arriving in the city, she met Sharma, a cab driver, and the pair married quickly - celebrating on a rooftop restaurant in front of the Taj Mahal. Officials records note they married on October 11. But within weeks, their marriage began to crumble and by December, they started living separately. Both accused the other of hiding previous marriages and Willinger, who went by the alias Kiran Sharma and also uses the name Erin White, accused her new husband of greed, infidelity and cruelty, the Hindustan Times reported. White approached the Agra Police's . Mediation Cell for Family Matters in January, asking for help and the . couple was put in touch with a counselor, who encouraged them to start . living together again. Suicide: Neighbors rushed to save Sharma after hearing an explosion in his apartment but they found his charred body (center, pixelated) after he apparently lit cooking gas to kill himself . Motive: Bundy allegedly killed her amid arguments over infidelity and lies about their previous marriages . But . the arguments continued and on Thursday evening, Bunty reportedly drove Willinger to a quieter section of the city and stabbed her to death in his . taxi cab. He then shoved her body in bushes along the road, the Hindustan Times reported. He then returned home and locked himself in his room on the second floor. Local residents then said they heard a loud explosion and saw flames erupting from the room. When they rushed inside to rescue him, they found his charred body on the floor. Authorities believe Bunty sparked the blast by igniting gas he had released from a cooking gas cylinder in the apartment. OneIndia reported that police had recovered the blood-stained knife and that the bodies had been sent for autopsies. New life: Willinger, pictured with a friend, said she wanted to stay in Agra 'as long as her body permits' The union home ministry and the American embassy in New Delhi have been informed. A State Department official confirmed Willinger's death. 'We offer our condolences to her family and loved ones on their loss,' the official told MailOnline. 'We are in contact with her family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect for the privacy of those affected, we decline further comment.' Before her death, Willinger had revealed that she was deeply in love with Indian culture and wanted to improve civic conditions in Agra. On the day she was killed, she . addressed a press conference to promote her campaign 'Agra Sunder Hai', . and several local NGOs pledged support to her. She had said she hoped to help Agra with improving its water, plastic waste and garbage disposal. Last . September, she spoke with the Indo-Asian News Service under the name Erin White. She revealed her desire . to stay and help the city, although she had only planned to visit to . help feed leprosy sufferers near the Taj Mahal. Scene: An image is believed to show Sharma's tax cab, in which he stabbed his wife before dumping her body . Investigation: Police swarm the scene where Sharma killed himself. They also recovered the murder weapon . She said that she wanted to stay in Agra until '60 or maybe more - as long as the body permits'. 'This city needs a push,' she said. 'The city is dirty and no one wants to stay back here for a night. You have to teach people to be conscious of hygiene, health and sensibilities of others. You have to build trust and reach out.' She spoke of taking money from the rich to give resources to the poor, and said she hoped to get actors and other celebrities on board to help make programs more attractive. And she was confident that her idea was going to be a success. 'I am talking with so many [students, businessmen and professionals] and they all agree that the time for change has indeed come,' she said. 'You need role models. A democratic society needs inspiring heroes to move ahead. You need success stories to diffuse the clouds of negativity all around.'

President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama at the White House Friday despite the stern objections of China, which warned the meeting would 'inflict grave damages' on its relationship with the U.S. Obama greeted the Dalai Lama while the Tibetan spiritual leader and fellow Nobel laureate was in the U.S. on a speaking tour. But China called the meeting a 'severe violation of the principles of international relations.' The White House took pains to ensure the meeting was not portrayed as a conference of two heads of state. Diplomatic: President Obama met with the Dalai Lama at the White House on Friday despite the stern objections of China . The occasion was closed to photographers, . and, unlike during some previous visits, the Dalai Lama departed the . White House without speaking to reporters. In a statement after the meeting, the White House said Obama offered his 'strong support for the preservation of Tibet's unique religious, cultural, and linguistic traditions' and for human rights protections for Tibetans in China. The Dalai Lama told Obama he's not seeking Tibetan independence, and both leaders said they hoped talks would resume between Beijing and the Dalai Lama's representatives. When the White House announced the . meeting late Thursday, China responded almost immediately, urging Obama . to cancel it in what has become something of a diplomatic ritual . whenever the president meets with the exiled Buddhist monk. Respects: The Dalai Lama acknowledges the audience before speaking at an event called Happiness, Free Enterprise, and Human Flourishing in Washington on Thursday . In a biting statement, China's government accused Obama of letting the Dalai Lama use the White House to promote anti-Chinese activities. 'It is a severe violation of the principles of international relations,' said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China's Foreign Ministry. 'It will inflict grave damages upon the China-U.S. relationship,' she continued. Beijing has often protested when world leaders have granted audiences to the Dalai Lama, including when Obama met with him in 2010 and again in 2011. Chinese officials denounce the Dalai Lama as a separatist responsible for instigating self-immolations by Tibetans inside China. But he is widely respected around the world for his advocacy of peace and tolerance. Obama hosted the Dalai Lama in the White House's Map Room, rather than the Oval Office, where the president traditionally brings a visiting leader for a round of photographs. The private meeting, closed to reporters despite media requests for access, suggested an attempt to avoid the appearance of a formal meeting between two heads of state. Previous visit: The Dalai Lama, a frequent visitor to the U.S., walks out of the White House in Washington, after meeting with President Barack Obama in February 2010 . The White House said Obama was meeting with the Dalai Lama in the visitor's capacity as a cultural and religious leader. As . if to indicate a reaction had been expected, officials reiterated that . the U.S. recognizes Tibet as part of China and doesn't support Tibetan . independence. At the same . time, officials said they were concerned about tensions and . deteriorating human rights in China's Tibetan areas, urging Beijing to . resume talks with the Dalai Lama or his followers without preconditions. China . bitterly opposes the Dalai Lama's quest for greater Tibetan autonomy . and is wary of Obama's efforts to increase U.S. influence in the region. Relations . between the U.S. and China are already on edge over Beijing's . increasingly aggressive steps to assert itself in the region, including . in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors. China's . emergence as a leading global economic and military power has strained . ties with Washington, and the two have also clashed over cybertheft and . human rights.

The private firm that decides whether benefits claimants are fit for work has pulled out of its £500million contract after claiming its staff received death threats. Atos Healthcare, which has been accused of making unfair decisions on when sick and disabled people lose benefits, was ordered to review its tests last summer after a government report found its assessors were of unacceptably poor quality. But yesterday, sources in the French IT company claimed it was pulling out as its staff were increasingly coming under attack while carrying out their work. Protesters hold placards outside Atos's London headquarters in August 2012 . Each month last year they recorded about 160 incidents of the public assaulting or abusing staff, the Financial Times reported. Protests had erupted outside their offices this week, when staff received deaths threats in person and on Facebook  and Twitter. Examples on social networking sites include someone calling staff ‘murdering scumbags’, adding: ‘We won’t be smiling when we come to hang you b******s.’ Another said: ‘Know anyone who works for Atos? Kill them.’ The company has regularly come under fire over the assessments – which are used to gauge eligibility for employment and support allowance and incapacity benefit – amid claims people are being wrongly recommended for work or put through stressful medical interviews. One third of its decisions have been overturned on appeal and the firm has become a lightning rod for Left-wing critics of the Government’s welfare reforms. Atos Healthcare revealed it has been in discussions with officials for ‘several months’ about ending its work capability assessment contract, which was due to run until August 2015. Kate Green, shadow minister for disabled people, said: ¿People have been badly let down by Atos' A spokesman insisted it would not ‘walk away’ from the contract and that it would continue to provide a service until new contractors had been appointed. ‘For several months now we have been endeavouring to agree an early exit from the work capability assessment contract,’ the spokesman said. ‘We will not walk away from a front-line service. Our focus remains on delivering the services we are contracted to provide in a professional and compassionate way until a new service begins.’ However, relations with the Department for Work and Pensions appear to be close to breakdown amid persistent criticism over the quality of Atos’s assessments. Kate Green, shadow minister for disabled people, said: ‘People have been badly let down by Atos. But changing the contract isn’t enough. It’s time for the government to fundamentally reform work capability assessments so disabled people who can work are given support they need to find a job.’ The DWP yesterday refused to comment.","Atos Healthcare staff are increasingly coming under attack, source claims .

But the festivities came to a halt when Wilder opened his mother's present towards the end of the day. He broke into a rage, advancing on his mother in front of his siblings. On Boxing Day, officers arrived to arrest the teenager and he admitted common assault in a police interview. 'An argument broke out over some trainers she had bought him and there were young children present,' said prosecutor Clare Barclay.

'CSX has told me they were aware they were out there, but they did . not have permission to be on the train tracks,' Gardner told reporters. Casualty: 27-year-old Sarah Elizabeth Jones of Atlanta, a camera assistant, was killed in the deadly accident . ""That's a very active train track,' he said. 'There's probably . anywhere from up to 10 trains a day that go through on those tracks.' The Savannah-based crew was shooting footage for 'Midnight Rider,' a . film based on the life of singer Gregg Allman, when the crash happened . Thursday afternoon. Wayne County sheriff's detectives were working . Friday to piece together how and why it happened. The deadly collision took place at a railroad trestle that crosses . the Altamaha River in the rural county about 60 miles southwest of . Savannah. The tracks, owned by CSX Railroad, cross private land owned by . forest-products company Rayonier, which has a nearby paper mill. The . crew, and director Randall Miller, had been filming a dream sequence on . a railroad, when the train suddenly appeared on the bridge they were . on. Miller, . who reportedly fell on the tracks as the crew tried to get out of the . train's path, is working on a film about the life of musician Gregg . Allman. His crew had . been prepared for two trains to pass by as they filmed at about 4pm on . Thursday. They had placed a bed on a bridge in Doctortown when a train . driver blew his whistle to alert them to an unexpected third train. Scene: Investigators said the crew never had permission to be on the dangerous tracks . The . team had less than a minute to try to clear the track and get off the . bridge before the train, which was heading to Savannah, passed by, Variety reported. A photographer pulled Miller to safety after the director fell on the tracks while trying to move the bed. The . rest of the eight-man crew were still leaving the bridge as the train . went past, striking and killing the second camera assistant, and . throwing debris from the set into the air. The train struck and killed a woman identified by the sheriff's . department as 27-year-old Sarah Elizabeth Jones of Atlanta. Jones was a camera assistant. Seven others . were injured, one seriously enough to be taken by helicopter to a . Savannah hospital. Further information on their conditions was not . immediately available Friday. Near miss: Director Randall Miller, left, fell on the tracks as he tried . to help the crew move part of a set. He is currently filming the life . story of musician Gregg Allman . Trespassing onto railroad tracks is illegal under Georgia law and punishable as a misdemeanor. The film studio Friday referred calls to a Los Angeles publicist, .

A CSX spokeswoman, Kristin Seay, declined to comment further and . would not confirm that film crew had no permission from the railroad to . be working on the train tracks. Authorities provided few details about the collision. Gardner said it . wasn't clear if crew members were actually on the trestle bridging the . river or just on the tracks at the river's edge. Tragic: The film crew had been filming near this stretch of track when an unexpected train hit and killed a camera assistant . He said the train . smashed some of the crew's equipment, and it's possible some of the . injuries were caused by flying debris.

She has a string of offences, and has stolen from almost every member of her family. In the latest episode in Swanston's history of offending, security staff spotted her leaving Asda in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, after stealing a pair of hair clippers. When police officers arrived to arrest her, the 25-year-old was found to be driving her grandfather George Swanston's Vauxhall Corsa and gave her sister Victoria Swanston's details. Swanston, of Gateshead, initially pleaded not guilty to one count of theft and one of taking a motor vehicle without consent. But she changed her plea on the day of trial, confessing to the crimes. She had already pleaded guilty to driving without a licence, driving with no insurance and obstructing a police officer at an earlier hearing. Lynne Russell, prosecuting, told Newcastle Magistrates' Court that the offences happened at Asda, in Gosforth, on November 23 last year. She said: 'She (Swanston) was seen on CCTV taking a box of hair clippers and she left the store without offering payment. 'She was detained by staff and the police were called and officers attended. The 25-year-old was spotted leaving this Asda store in Gosforth, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, with a pair of hair clippers in her pocket. When police officers arrived and arrested her, Swanston gave her sister Victoria's details . Stephanie Swanston's criminal record reveals 35 previous convictions. In April 2010 she targeted her parents, grandfathers and uncle in a string of scams, stealing nearly £3,000 for fund overseas holidays. She also made £7,500 worth of failed loan applications in relatives' names and pawned two of her mother's watches. She was sentenced to six months in prison. Months after being released she fleeced her grandparents out of more than £2,000 after stealing their bank cards. Within three weeks, Swanston targeted four Sainsburys stores, stealing electrical goods before trying to return them in exchange for a refund. In April last year the 25-year-old was jailed for six months after fraudulently claiming carer's allowance, crisis loans and jobseeker's allowance, totalling more than £10,000. She admitted forging the signatures of three grandparents and her sister to get her hands on the benefits. One of her grandfathers was in hospital at the time and has since died. She was sentenced after admitting 15 counts of fraud. 'When they spoke to her, she provided false details and gave her sister, Victoria Swanston's details. 'At . the police station, officers found her passport in her bag and realised . it was this defendant and not Victoria Swanston. She then admitted she . had attempted to avoid arrest. 'From . the police database system, it became apparent she was insured to drive . a Vauxhall vehicle, which was found in the Asda car park and the . registered keeper was her grandfather, George Swanston. 'He was spoken to and said she had taken it without his consent. 'She only had a provisional licence and Mr Swanston said he would not have let her drive the vehicle alone. 'She was insured to drive the vehicle on his insurance but only when she was accompanied. 'The defendant originally said she had driven the car with her grandfather's permission but he denied this was the case.' Gerry Scott, defending, said: 'The theft of the car was foolish and largely opportunistic. 'She had lost her job at the time and that has caused underlying difficulties. 'In terms of the obstructing PC, that was foolish but it didn't cause the police significant trouble. 'In terms of the taking without consent, their was a breach of trust but there was no bad driving or no damage caused to the vehicle.' The court was told that Swanston has 35 past convictions, many involving thefts from her family. The case was adjourned until next month for the preparation of a pre-sentence report. Swanston was bailed until that date.","Stephanie Swanston was caught shoplifting at Asda in Gosforth .

The writer who was working with Julian Assange's failed 2011 autobiography has for the first time described what it was like collaborating with the WikiLeaks founder who he found by turns inconsistent, passionate, funny, lazy, courageous, vain, paranoid, moral and manipulative. Andrew O'Hagan, an award-winning, Booker-nominated writer, was drafted in by publishers Canongate to ghost-write but as the deadline loomed Assange was increasingly uncomfortable about the whole venture and one of the highest profile book deals of recent times collapsed. Canongate had sold books in more than 40 countries for a staggering US$2.5m before the deal imploded. Complex: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whose behaviour O'Hagan sheds light on . O'Hagan told his story in a lengthy essay for the London Review of Books, a version of which he delivered in a lecture in London last night, the Guardian reported. Ultimately, the book deal collapsed, O'Hagan wrote, because Assange had never wanted to write it. 'The man who put himself in charge of disclosing the world's secrets simply couldn't bear his own. The story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses. He didn't want to do the book. He hadn't from the beginning,' he said. As the deadline approached, Assange was 'totally shocked' at the idea of his story being told, and he branded people who write about their family as 'prostitutes'. His lawyers had persuaded him to publish it, arguing that the royalties would help with his rising legal bill. Assange was initially enthusiastic, and told O'Hagan he hoped the book would read 'like Hemingway'. 'Mansion arrest': the Norfolk stately home where Assange and some of his supporters lived for a time. He later felt the Guardian had gone from a collaborator to an enemy . Canongate, fed up with Assange . increasingly not co-operating, published a version of O'Hagan's . manuscript, Julian Assange: The Unauthorised Biography in September . 2011. Assange had not given his consent. But this did not stop him covertly encouraging sales and tweeting links to its Amazon page. To no avail. The book sold fewer than 700 copies in its first week - a disaster. In . his essay, O'Hagan also shed light on Assange's unconventional life at . Ellingham Hall in Norfolk before he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean . Embassy. He lived there . with a group of supporters while on bail over allegations of rape and . sexual assault in Sweden under conditions candidly described by one of . his lawyers as jokingly referred to as 'mansion arrest'. Endorsement: Fidel Castro, pictured here with his brother and successor Raul (right), and Venezuela's late president Hugo Chavez, said apparently told Assange that WikiLeaks was the only website he liked . On his first visit to the country . house, O'Hagan was met by Assange in stockinged feet. Assange that him . he might be in jail soon and that might not be bad for writing the book. Prestige: Canongate assigned O'Hagan, whose 1999 book Our Fathers was shortlisted for the Booker Prize . O'Hagan . said that during the Egyptian uprising, when President Hosni Mubarak . tried to close the country's phone network Assange and other staffers . hacking into the system from their Norfolk kitchen table to reverse the . shutdown, then leant back to eat chocolates as the revolution . continued. O'Hagan was told that Former Cuban President Fidel Castro had sent a message to say WikiLeaks was the only website he liked. Assange . was at times paranoid, O'Hagan said, citing the whistle-blower's fears . that when driving through Norfolk he was being followed by would-be . assassins. When a group of company presidents offered Assange £20,000 for an hour's Skype time, he said: 'If Tony Blair - a war criminal - can get £120,000, I should get at least £1 more than him. The Australian had strong views on former collaborators who in his view had become 'enemies' - the Guardian, the New York Times, in time, Canongate. In his view 'the Guardian was an enemy because he'd 'given' them something and they hadn't toed the line, whereas the Daily Mail was almost respected for finding him entirely abominable.' O'Hagan described feeling torn betwen 'a kind of loyalty to Julian's vulnerability, especially (not in spite of) his role as enemy to himself', and regarding him as a Peter Pan-type figure, 'the lost boy of Queensland with his silver hair and his sense that the world of adults is no real place for him'.","Award-winning Andrew O'Hagan reveals WikiLeaks founder's behaviour .

Two brothels in London's red light district will reopen after a judge rejected police claims women working there were being 'controlled or incited into prostitution'. More than 200 police swooped on London's infamous Red Light district last December, raiding around 20 flats. Officers had raised fears that the prostitutes were being controlled for gain - which is illegal. The raids were hugely controversial, . sparking protests in the area attended by Hollywood actor Rupert . Everett, who branded the raids a 'land grab facilitated by the police'. A judge has quashed closure orders on two brothels in the Soho area of London (pictured) after police evidence workers were being controlled for gain was thrown out . But in a victory for campaigners, Recorder John Kingston quashed the closure orders on two of the flats in Brewer Street. This means the sex workers can now move back in. Giving his ruling at Isleworth Crown Court the judge rejected police evidence the women were being controlled or incited into prostitution for gain. He said: 'The furthest the evidence goes is to show that the Appellants used the first and second floor flats for prostitution by arrangement with other sex workers at mutually convenient and agreed times.' He said this 'does not constitute control' withing the meaning of the law. The English Collective of Prostitutes, which has led opposition to the controversial raids, have hailed the ruling a 'victory for common sense'. Sex workers will now be able to return to work in the two brothels in London's red light district (pictured) Lori Bora who has worked at the premises for five years, said: 'I am very pleased that justice was served. 'The police should be ashamed of themselves to accuse us of being controlled when they know very well we are not. 'Nobody tells me when and how long to work. To the judge I say that he is welcome to come down and see us girls in Soho at any time...for a cup of tea.' Niki Adams, from the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP) said: 'These closures should never have come to court. 'The police misled the public and claimed that they were needed to prevent rape and trafficking. No victims of trafficking were found; instead the police threw women out of the relative safety of their flats. 'This decision is timely as women have been without an income since the beginning of December. Many are in debt and some were about to be made homeless. Recorder John Kingston made the ruling at Isleworth Crown Court (pictured), rejecting police evidence women were being controlled or incited into prostitution for gain . Laura Watson, also from the ECP, said: 'We are delighted. The ruling is extremely important because the police were saying there was some invisible figure who was organising how long the girls worked, how much they charged, and said that constituted control. The women came to court and said that is not right. But if this is all the police need to show control they can shut down any business in the country - they wouldn't need to show force or coercion.' The court had heard that Soho is one of the safest places for prostitutes to work because women don't work alone or on the streets. Most of the women who were evicted in Soho are mothers and grandmothers - and have lived in the area for decades. They claim they are being driven out of the area to make way for its gentrification.","Two flats raided in London's Red Light district last December by 200 police .

Measured: Christie says she respects and accepts the referees call, but didn't have to agree with it . She picks . up the story of those fateful last few minutes when, after waiting at . the back of the field of four, she unleashed herself with about three . laps of the 111m course to run. ‘When I saw the draw come out, I saw . it was the harder of the two — more like a final — and I was in lane . three so I decided to save my energy and smash it at the end,’ she said. ‘I knew if I was patient, I had the speed.

I thought the judge might advance me . to the final — but I got a penalty. ‘I haven’t talked it through with . him but he said I pushed her over. The problem with short track is the . referees are all different and there is no consistency. ‘I always respect the referee’s decision but I don’t agree with it. ‘The . reasons are confused. In the 500 I was penalised for diving up the . inside. I thought that was what they were judging. 'This time she tried . to dive up the inside but I was pushed from behind off the back of my . skate. I don’t understand his point of view right now.’ Christie, who comes from the Scottish new town of Livingston, . walked through the tunnel only moments before the final in which she . should have been competing took place. The gold medallist was Park . Seung-hi, whom she had beaten in Friday’s quarter-final. Not only . that but it was Park she had crashed into in the 1500m,  triggering the . bullying in cyberspace from irate Korean fans that almost persuaded her . to withdraw from the Olympics altogether. Gobsmacked: Christie said didn't understand what she'd done wrong to miss out on a chance at a medal . Statistics so far: The medal table as it stands . Christie, who at 5ft 3in . cuts a smaller figure than many of her rivals, looked so vulnerable in . the minutes after her latest and final setback that it was impossible . not to sympathise with her. Thankfully, support from the psychologist, Mike Rotherham, and the rest of the team had got her on to . the start line. She did not cry on this occasion. She had probably run . out of tears. ‘Everyone here and back home in Britain was brilliant,’ she said. ‘I got back on my feet. I came out and thought, “I have got . this”. Last year I could only win from lane one or two; I couldn’t do it . from three or four. I did those overtakes, which I am really proud of. ‘I haven’t managed that before.

A woman prepares for bed: Many people find that the preparation portion of getting ready for bed is part of what makes them relaxed and sleepy . Millions of adults get in to their night clothes as soon as they get in from work, a study has revealed. Researchers found one in ten adults in Britain put on their pajamas immediately after they arrive home from work. The poll also found the typical Brit slips on their sleepwear attire at precisely 9.11pm. The hotel chain polled over 2,000 adults on their sleepwear habits and revealed that just under half the nation are at their happiest when lounging around in their pyjamas. With nearly a quarter of the nation admitting to having spent the entire weekend in their PJs on more than one occasion. The survey revealed British women have opted for a more laid back approach to their sleep attire, with 17 per cent of the women polled admitting to wearing an 'old' nightie or just a t-shirt. Only one in twenty women opt for a pretty nightie or camisole set, whilst 18 per cent of the men polled wear pyjamas and the rest choosing to wear just boxer shorts and a t-shirt. It seems that the women polled had good intentions when they first met their partner to wear more attractive sleep wear, but on average, eight months into the relationship women become more relaxed and replace their pretty camisoles for scruffy pyjamas. An honest 39 per cent of the females polled said they are past caring what their other half thinks of their sleep wear. The study also found that 30 per cent of men would reject a woman who wore a floor length nightie to bed. Other bedtime garments that were off limits in the bedroom include a cartoon character night shirts and an old football shirt. Women also revealed that novelty boxer shorts, pyjamas with characters on and striped pyjamas were also deemed a no-no. All tucked up: British folk, as it turns out, are incredibly particular to their sleeping garments, and many see them as a link to their prospective partner's personality . In fact, the only time we tend to make an effort in our night attire is when staying at a hotel with 34 per cent of respondents admitting to taking their best nightwear if they are staying away from home. A further one in five go out and buy brand new sleepwear if they have to stay in a hotel. And quarter of those said it's because it's usually a special occasion and a paranoid 15 per cent said they want respectable nightwear in case they get spotted by hotel staff. A spokesman for Premier Inn said: 'We think it's great Brits have a casual and laidback approach to their nightwear. 'For many, it is the only time you can be safe in the knowledge that no one will be concerned about what you're wearing and most importantly, feeling comfortable in your sleeping attire is certain to help towards a great night's sleep.'","Adults get into their pajamas as a way of preventing stress after work .

A benefits cheat pocketed almost £40,000 of Disability Living Allowance by claiming he could only walk with a stick - despite teaching martial arts across the country. Mark Kemp, 58, claimed £35,000 worth of the benefit over 15 years - during which time he became an expert in Ju-Jitsu. Kemp of Oldham, Greater Manchester, was even credited with helping to invent a discipline called Shin Ga Do. Scroll down for video . Mark Kemp pocketed £35,000 in Disability Living Allowance over 15 years despite being a martial arts teacher. He told the Department of Work and Pensions he would only walk with a stick . DWP investigators infiltrated the teacher's lessons and found him throwing kicks and blocking punches . He led classes in the sport at the Tameside Kempo Ju-Jitsu Club in the city. A picture of the man even appeared on the club's website. But the black belt cheat was exposed when investigators infiltrated his sessions and saw the father- of-two throwing kicks and blocking punches. Kemp was even filmed playing golf and enjoying a family day out at Southport Pleasure Beach during the Department for Work and Pensions probe. The black-belt, pictured during a tutorial, taught martial arts across the country and is even credited with inventing the Shin Ga Do discipline . Kemp had originally started claiming DSA legitimately in 1992 after being injured in a car accident - but failed to tell the authorities when his health improved, a court heard . Kemp was handed a six-month sentence, suspended for one year at Manchester Crown Square . He had claimed to the DWP he could not walk without a stick. Kemp has narrowly avoided jail after pleading guilty to two charges of falsely claiming benefits at Manchester Crown Square. The court heard Kemp had originally started claiming DSA legitimately in 1992 after being injured in a car accident - but failed to tell the authorities when his health improved. For four years while he was wrongly claiming benefits, Kemp also worked as a driver for a mobility company - taking people who were genuinely disabled to medical appointments and lifting them in and out of ambulances. Nicola Daley, prosecuting, said: 'It was apparent to investigators that by 2012 Mr Kemp's health had significantly improved which had not been reported. 'Statements were taken from friends or associates and they described how he has been capable of taking martial arts classes for a number of years and had no difficulty being on his feet for over two hours.' When interviewed by investigators in 2012, Kemp said his health hadn't improved - but later pleaded guilty to the two charges at court. Defending, Paul Bryning said his client had no previous relevant convictions and was otherwise of good character. Kemp was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for a year and a curfew to stay in his home between 9pm and 7am for four months. Speaking after the case, Roy Paul, DWP north west fraud manager, said: 'It is our duty to ensure that benefit payments go to those who really need them and we are committed to cracking down on those who play the system.'","Mark Kemp, 58, claimed £35,000 of Disability Living Allowance .

A butcher's assistant who stabbed his boss 51 times in an unprovoked attack before going on a machete rampage has been jailed for a minimum of 27 years. Naeem Mehmood, 27, stabbed Parvaiz Iqbal in the freezer room of his butcher’s store and in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in October last year. Mr Iqbal, 40, was found with a 7in (18cm) knife stuck in his chest, a judge at Sheffield Crown Court heard. Naeem Mehmood, 27, stabbed Parvaiz Iqbal 51 times in the freezer room of his butcher’s store and supermarket in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in October last year . When another employee, Saied Husseine, 44, discovered what was happening, Mehmood stabbed him in the stomach before picking up a butcher’s knife and running through the streets covered in blood - smashing car and shop windows on his way. Mehmood was eventually arrested in a supermarket car park around ten minutes after the attack after a huge police operation was launched. Another shop worker who came to his boss’s aid was stabbed in the stomach but survived the ordeal. Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC described how, after the attack at the Bismallah Food Store, Mehmood went on a 10-minute rampage, smashing windows and threatening members of the public with a huge machete he picked up after leaving the murder weapon embedded in Mr Iqbal’s chest. Mr Moulson said the defendant shouted . 'Don’t come outside or I will gut you up' in Punjabi to strangers as . passers-by fled in terror. Iqbal, a popular 40-year-old father-of-three boys, died in his butchers in Eastwood, Rotherham. One of Mr Iqbal's employees, who tried to help at the scene, was also stabbed and suffered a serious stomach wound . Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC described how, after the attack at the Bismallah Food Store, Mehmood went on a 10-minute rampage, smashing windows and threatening members of the public with a huge machete . Peter Moulson, prosecuting, described . the moment Mr Husseine walked in and saw what was happening, telling . the court: 'Mr Husseine opened the door and saw Mr Iqbal on the floor . covered in blood with the defendant standing over him. 'There . were 19 sites of injury to Mr Iqbal’s head and neck, 20 to the front of . his torso, five to the back of his body and multiple injuries to his . arms and hands. 'Several ribs were fractured and cut through the defendant using severe force to inflict these injuries. 'The final blow struck Mr Iqbal’s chest with such force that the defendant was unable to remove the knife from Mr Iqbal’s body. 'The defendant stabbed Mr Iqbal at a rate greater than once every two seconds  for a total period of just over a minute.' He was eventually arrested after he was confronted by an unarmed police officer, Chief Inspector Ian Womersley. Mr Moulson said the attack on Mr Iqbal was 'unprovoked, sustained and determined'. Mehmood was jailed for life today by Mr Justice Males who ordered he serve a minimum of 27 years. Earlier, Mehmood had pleaded guilty to murdering Mr Iqbal and causing Saied Husseine grievous bodily harm with intent. The judge said: 'This was a brutal, . sustained and unprovoked attack, beginning with a cowardly stab in the . back by a lethal weapon.' He told Mehmood: 'All murder is very serious but the seriousness of this offence was particularly high. 'It . involved a savage and ferocious attack with a lethal weapon, . premeditation and gratuitous violence continuing well after Mr Iqbal was . bleeding to death on the floor. Mr Brown said Mehmood originally suggested that he had been disrespected by Mr Iqbal but more than a dozen of his other employees talked of him as being the 'perfect boss' when interviewed by detectives . 'There was also a deliberate and murderous attack on Mr Husseine, which could very easily have caused his death. 'Your conduct as you left the store and proceeded along the road, terrifying and threatening innocent members of the public as you went, was a serious aggravating factor.' The judge said father-of-three Mr Iqbal was 'a friendly and popular member of the community who was well-liked and respected by his employees, his customers and all who knew him'. He noted how Mehmood terrified members of the public as he made 'bloodthirsty threats” in the street while brandishing the 10in (25.5cm) machete above his head. The court heard that he smashed up glass displays in Mr Iqbal’s shop, swearing and shouting as young children looked on. Mehmood then smashed up a series of cars outside the store before breaking the windows of a barber’s shop, showering customers with glass and threatening the owner. The judge said: 'The aftermath, as you left the store and rampaged down the road in broad daylight for about 10 minutes, leaving a trail of destruction behind you, caused real and understandable fear to many members of the public.' But he said: 'Why you acted as you did is not apparent.' The court heard that Mehmood, who came to Britain from Pakistan in May 2011, started work at the shop in June 2013 but went on sick leave in August after part of his finger was chopped off in a machine at the store. The judge said the defendant had returned to work the day before he attacked his boss, on October 15.

He said: 'It may be that you were reacting to what you perceived, with no justification at all, as some kind of slight or that you harboured some kind of grudge. 'But, in any event, there is not the slightest excuse for what you did.' The judge said there was also no evidence of Mehmood suffering from any kind of mental disorder. Passing sentence, he told Mehmood: 'It is apparent from your conduct in this case that you are a very dangerous man and present a considerable risk to public safety.' The judge also commended the actions of Mr Womersley, who confronted Mehmood in the car park of a Tesco supermarket. The unarmed officer approached the bloodstained defendant, who was still brandishing the machete, and convinced him to put down the weapon. Speaking outside court, Detective Inspector Kevin Brown, from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'It was a frenzied and unprovoked attack on Mr Iqbal and I think the sentence reflects that.' Mr Brown said Mr Womersely 'put his life at risk' to disarm Mehmood, who appeared in the dock surrounded by prison officers. 'There’s nothing really that’s come out in our investigation to explain why,' the officer said. Mr Brown said Mehmood originally suggested that he had been disrespected by Mr Iqbal but more than a dozen of his other employees talked of him as being the 'perfect boss' when interviewed by detectives. Mehmood, of Herringthorpe Valley Road, Rotherham, was given a 10-year prison sentence for the attack on Mr Husseine, which the judge ordered to run concurrently.","Naeem Mehmood, 27, stabbed Parvaiz Iqbal 51 times at the bucher's store .

Undercover sting: In 2001 the Countess of Wessex, pictured last week, was forced to say sorry to royals and politiocians after she was recorded making 'horribly indiscreet' comments by the NotW . A senior royal was forced to write a series of grovelling apologies after she was recorded making 'horribly indiscreet' comments about her family, including allegedly calling the Queen 'the old dear', it emerged today. Rebekah Brooks told the Old Bailey phone hacking trial that Sophie Countess of Wessex was forced to give an interview to the News of the World after she made rude remarks to the 'Fake Sheikh'. Prince Edward's wife was targeted by investigative reporter Mazher Mahmood . worked on a tip-off via Max Clifford that her PR company was . selling access to the royal family in 2001, the court heard. In the sting it was alleged the Countess made . indiscreet, and often rude, references to the late Diana, Princess of . Wales, the Queen Mother, Tony and Cherie Blair and William Hague during a . lengthy conversation Mahmood, who said he wanted to hire her PR firm. The 'Sophie tapes' captured her apparently saying Tony Blair as being 'far too . presidential' - while Cherie Blair was 'just horrid. Absolutely horrid, . horrid, horrid'. She is also said to have referred to the Queen . as 'the old dear'. The Countess is further alleged to have told the . bogus sheik that Charles and Camilla will marry - but not until 'the old . lady dies'. In this instance, the Countess was referring to the Queen . Mother. Ms Brooks today described how the investigation into royal access for business was blown when the letters leaked out. She said Buckingham Palace had forced the Countess to do an exclusive interview with News of the World if they dropped the embarrassing story. Evidence: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks told the Old Bailey today about her deal with the royals after the Countess of Wessex made disparaging comments . She . said a former 'disgruntled' employee had approached the newspaper . alleging that the countess and her business partner were using the royal . connection to boost their business. The journalist set about posing as a Sheikh in need of PR at a huge cost to the News of the World (NotW), the court was told. There . was laughter in the courtroom when Brooks said: 'He would live the true . life of a wealthy Sheikh. He would have a Bentley and a penthouse . suite. He always told me it was imperative.' Apology: The Countess of Wessex in 2001 on the day after it emerged she make 'indiscreet' remarks to the Fake Sheikh about fellow royals and politicians . After . the lengthy investigation, Brooks was presented with the results and . she concluded that although it complied with the editors' code of . conduct from the start, it had not proved the allegation that the . Countess had personally offered access. Brooks decided not to run the story and instead rang Buckingham Palace to make a deal. An agreement was struck for an interview with Sophie in exchange for dumping the Fake Sheikh story. It was the first interview since her marriage so a good deal for the paper, she said. She told the court: 'In the meantime, the Countess of Wessex, having been told by us, had realised that during the course of trying to get Maz as a client she had been horribly indiscreet about members of the royal family and politicians and obviously remembered what she said. 'So she wrote to everybody involved. She was particularly mean about Tony Blair and Cherie, William Hague, so she wrote these letters.' But the letters leaked out and 'became a justification for running the original story' although it was more about the embarrassing remarks, she told the court. A story about the letters also appeared in the Mail on Sunday. Her comments were not read to the court today but were widely reported at the time. Brooks told the jury: 'The time in which I approached the palace and negotiated the interview and then did the interview, as the Countess of Wessex is writing letters, it is being discussed in the palace, what had happened. 'I'm assuming someone from the palace leaked this to the Mail on Sunday, but that's an assumption. If it was us and the palace that knew.' Afterwards, Brooks wrote to the head of the investigations unit, Greg Miskiw, saying: 'We have got to learn some lessons from Sophie. 'As I said, all our entrapment and subterfuge must be justified 110 per cent. We have to (sic) so careful and make sure everything we do is inside the law. 'I know Sophie was 110% justified in every way and our methods were right and proper. We must continue this standard with all our investigations.' Asked why she would have sent that email, Brooks told the court that there had been 'a lot of things said' about the operation that were not true. She said: 'Because I had had particular involvement in this, I was quite cross because I felt that at every stage in the Countess of Wessex investigation we had adhered to the code and used the public interest exceptions and had behaved responsibly on the actual final decision, did we have enough of a story?' The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sophie, Countess of Wessex, forced to do NotW interview after revelations .

Former Miss Bolton and one-time Miss England hopeful Kristina Long carried on driving after she hit David Robinson while over the limit . A beauty queen turned lawyer was jailed yesterday after she mowed down a man in a hit and run while driving home drunk. Kristina Long, 26, was speeding in a 20mph zone after her work Christmas party when she hit a pedestrian. But the former Miss Bolton, who was twice the legal limit, carried on her journey despite knowing she had crashed into something. David Robinson, 53, was thrown almost 80ft forward and was left lying in the road with a fractured spine and leg until another motorist finally spotted him, a court  was told. Yesterday, Long’s career as a lawyer lay in tatters as she pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing serious injury, failing to stop at the scene of a collision and driving with excess alcohol. Jailing her for 12 months, Judge Paul Lawton said cases like this required a message to be sent out about drink-driving over the Christmas period. ‘The tragic circumstances of this case are obvious to all concerned,’ he said. ‘But they are circumstances of your own making. You took a calculated risk to drive, having consumed a large amount of alcohol.’ Manchester Crown Court heard Long, who also won an award at the World Miss University contest in 2010 representing Northern Ireland, had been drinking wine and vodka at the party held by her law firm Keogh’s at Bolton’s Reebok Stadium. Long was jailed for 12 months and disqualified from driving for two years at Manchester Crown Court after being found guilty of a series of driving offences .

Distracted, Long collided with Mr . Robinson, causing injuries which left him in hospital for almost a month . and in a neck brace for longer. Long won beauty pageant Miss Bolton and also represented Northern Ireland in a beauty pageant in South Korea before turning her attention to law, where she got a job at UK firm Keogh's . Long pleaded guilty to a series of driving offences and was jailed for a year, as well as being disqualified from driving for two years . But . it was not until Long returned home and confessed to hitting something . that a relative called police and officers found she had 45mg of alcohol . on her breath almost two hours after the hit and run. They estimated . she was likely to be at 61mg at the time of the crash. The legal limit . is 35mg. Her car was also severely damaged from the impact with Mr . Robinson, a museum technician. When . footage of the incident was shown to Long, she said: ‘Oh  my God.’ Prosecutor Charlotte Crangle said: ‘CCTV shows there was no braking at . all until after the impact. 'He hit the bonnet and was thrown up into the . air  and propelled 24 metres forward before landing in the bus lane . with  his feet facing towards the pavement. 'The defendant’s windscreen . was smashed.

Workers at the bogus call centre in Swansea tricked around 3,000 mobile phone users across the country in the eleborate scam. They targetted people who had just bought phones from Phones 4U and Carphone Warehouse as one of the gang had worked for both companies which meant he had 'insider information' about how the system worked.

They pretended to be from phone giants O2 and Orange - and claimed to offer their customers discounted insurance packages. But a court heard they were not authorised to sell the policies which were worthless. Prosecutor David Elias said: 'Around 3,000 people across Britain were conned in the fraud. 'It contributed to the erosion of confidence in the industry by members of the public.' The team, based in Swansea, were monitored by police who installed hidden microphones and cameras to take hundreds of hours of footage over two months.

Swansea Crown Court heard how they . told customers they were saving money when they paid a one-off sum of . £105 to swap their legitimate phone insurance for worthless ones. Three members of the team admitted conspiracy to defraud, another four admitted selling insurance when unauthorised to do so. Sentence: Omar Mapara was jailed for three years .

Authorities say four Oregon teenagers accused of shooting a fellow high school student with a BB gun and carving a swastika into his forehead had spent an evening sketching out ideas for torturing him. According to an affidavit filed Tuesday, the February 10 attack went as planned, until they released the 16-year-old boy to pull cash from an ATM. He fled to a nearby store instead and called police. The teen told investigators he was lured to the shed by 15-year-old Jenna Montgomery. There, he said 15-year-old Blue Kalmbach shot him with a BB gun and used a box cutter to cut the swastika.

All five teens attend the same southeast Portland high school. On the morning of the alleged assault, Montgomery spoke with the victim there and asked to hang out after school. They walked behind a house nearby, according to the affidavit, and Montgomery led him to a shed in the backyard. Waiting inside were Kalmbach, 17-year-old Jess Taylor and a 14-year-old boy. 'Mr. Taylor stated that he helped formulate the plan to torture (the victim),' Multnomah County assistant district attorney Chris Ramras wrote in the affidavit, 'and assisted by writing down several ideas.'

The violent protests that have seen Venezuela's major cities burn have their roots in a little-known incident on a college campus in a city far from the capital. Students at the University of the Andes in San Cristobal in the border state of Tachira were protesting an attempted rape of a young woman on campus. The students were outraged at the brazen assault on their campus, which underscored long-standing complaints about deteriorating security under President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez.

Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks next to a painting of the late Hugo Chavez, during a news conference at Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas yesterday . But what really set them off was the harsh police response to their initial protest, in which several students were detained and allegedly abused, as well as follow-up demonstrations to call for their release, according to students and people who live in the city of San Cristobal. 'It was shocking not just to students but to all of San Cristobal,' said Gaby Arellano, a 27-year-old student leader who has been involved in the national opposition campaign. 'It was the straw that broke the camel's back.' The protests expanded and grew more intense, drawing in more non-students angry about the dismal economy and crime in general, which led to more people being detained. Students at other universities decided to march in Caracas and the protest movement became a nationwide campaign when prominent opposition leaders decided to get involved. The main rally on February 12 in the capital turned violent, resulting in three deaths from gunshots and then the jailing of opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez. Now, protests that continued throughout the country yesterday, and are particularly fierce in San Cristobal, rarely, if ever, mention the attempted rape.

'I'm tired of waiting five or six hours in line for a kilo of flour.' Today, as the anti-government movement has snowballed into a political crisis, the likes of which Venezuela's socialist leadership hasn't seen since a 2002 coup attempt, San Cristobal remains a hotbed of unrest. Protest rallies are expected throughout the country over the weekend. The government on Thursday said it would send paratroopers to aid hundreds of soldiers already in place to restore order and the president has said he would consider imposing martial law in the area.

He says the city is under siege by right-wing paramilitaries under orders from former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, who dismisses the allegation as an attempt by the Venezuelan leader to distract people from an economy beset by shortages of basic goods and inflation of more than 56 percent. President Maduro said yesterday that San Cristobal Mayor Daniel Ceballos, a member of the same party as Lopez, would soon join the jailed opposition leader behind bars for fomenting violence. 'It's a matter of time until we have him in the same cold cell,' he said. Residents on Friday tried to resume their normal activities as the smell of burnt trash still lingered. Public transportation has yet to be restored, many stoplights are out and students are gearing up for what they promise will be an extended fight. As warplanes buzz the sky, there is also widespread resentment of the heavy troop presence. 'Why is the president sending these troops here? As far as I know, the military is supposed to protect Venezuelans, not attack them,' said Jose Hernandez, a 31-year-old construction worker. San Cristobal, a rural city 400 miles (660 kilometers) from Caracas, would seem an unlikely place to be at the center of a national crisis. But with its disproportionately large student population and longstanding cultural and economic ties with its more conservative neighbor, it has long been an opposition stronghold. The state of Tachira, of which San Cristobal is the largest city and capital, was only one of two where opposition candidate Henrique Capriles defeated Hugo Chavez in 2012 presidential elections. Last April, residents of San Cristobal voted nearly 3 to 1 in favor of Capriles in the race against Maduro to elect Chavez's successor. Its independent streak may have to do with its isolation, said Arellano, who grew up in Tachira. 'I think people in Tachira have always stood against abuses and being trampled,' she said.

Just 12 days after celebrating the birth of her daughter Kylie, Heather discovered she would never be able to conceive another child when a hemorrhage led to her being rushed into ER. 'Blood flowed out of me like a faucet,' recalls Heather. 'I remember shifting in and out of consciousness and a firefighter standing in front of me with a blank look on his face and muttering the words to effect of ""holy crap"". 'My parents had arrived while I was being wheeled out. I remember telling them I loved them and saying good-bye to Kylie. I thought this was the last time she'd see her mother alive.' Second chances: Minnesota natives Heather and Brad Spencer (pictured with their daughter Kylie) didn't want to give up on their dream to have a second child after a hemorrhage left her unable to conceive . By the time she returned to her family home in Minnesota, Heather had received 18 bags of blood, three of plasma and had undergone four surgeries all in less than two weeks. But she'd also had to have a hysterectomy. 'I was devastated. Absolutely devastated. Yes, I was lucky to be alive, but not being able to carry another baby was a huge loss.' Heather and her husband Brad - who had met during Heather's freshman year at St Cloud State University and married in 2006 - didn't want to give up on their dream to have a second child. So they started to research the idea of using a gestational carrier. 'We both grew up with siblings,' says Heather explaining their fervent quest for another child. Costly: They started researching gestational carriers, but the costs involved came as a complete shock. 'We have been given an estimate of $75,000 to $125,000,' says Heather . 'We feel this is such an important relationship in a person's life. Having that sibling to go through life with is something we both feel is important. Even before we met each other we both knew we wanted two children.' But the costs involved came as a complete shock - Heather works part-time as a realtor and her husband is a product designer. 'We have been given an estimate of $75,000 to $125,000,' says Heather. Desperate times: That was how they hit on a novel idea. To let someone else name their unborn baby, for a price: $20,000 to be exact . Trade-off: 'An amount this large could make a huge impact for us on being able to move forward with this process. If the ""sacrifice"" we make is having a crazy baby name, we will take that,' says Heather . 'The costs will go up from there if it doesn’t work the first time. The cost can also go down from here if we find a carrier on our own.' That was how they hit on a novel idea. To let someone else name their unborn baby, for a price: $20,000 to be exact. The couple started a page on crowd funding platform indiegogo - offering incentives ($150 for a year of new baby pictures, $25 for a thank you hug from them,) to try to raise part of the mountain of cash it would take to try and have another child, as well as put out a plea for a surrogate. Family love: 'Having that sibling to go through life with is something we both feel is important. Even before we met each other we both knew we wanted two children,' she explained . As for giving away naming rights, 'I put it in there to get a laugh out of people who were looking at our page,' says Heather. 'However, if someone seriously wanted to take us up on it, we'd be game. 'An amount this large could make a huge impact for us on being able to move forward with this process. Therefore, if the ""sacrifice"" we make is having a crazy baby name, we will take that in return for the addition of a life to our family.'

The leopard population of India is believe to be just over 1,100, as conservationists have warned it might become extinct as a result of bounty hunting for the animal’s skin. About a third of the state of Chhattisgarh is forested, but as infrastructure increases, humans have moved into animal territory, making interaction with wild animals more common.","Boy, aged five, dragged from his home in central India by a leopard .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 11:59 EST, 21 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:26 EST, 21 February 2014 . Gillian Astbury, 66, a diabetic patient at Stafford Hospital who died after slipping into a fatal diabetic coma in 2007 . Just one senior nurse was in charge of 84 beds at scandal-hit Mid-Staffordshire Hospital, a court heard yesterday. There was ‘no effective oversight’ at the NHS trust, which a major public inquiry said may have needlessly caused the death of 1,200 patients due to appalling failings in care. Yesterday the full details of blunders made by staff in the death of one patient were laid bare in the first case regarding the hospital to come to court. Gilian Astbury, 66, was admitted after a fall at home, and was assessed by a doctor to be diabetic, Stafford Crown Court was told. But she was not given insulin injections after staff failed to read her medical notes and died ten days later after collapsing into a diabetic coma. The NHS trust, which has already apologised for the ‘dreadful’ care she received and admitted health and safety breaches, now faces a possible fine of £1million. However, campaigners say the fine will be paid out of  taxpayers’ money and simply hit patient care – and do nothing to hold managers to account. The family of Mrs Astbury have also made it clear that they would rather see those responsible prosecuted than have resources taken from the hospital. Emma Jones, a solicitor representing families of those who suffered at the hospital, told BBC Radio 4: ‘They [victims] want a hospital where they can be assured that safe treatment and care is being provided. 'They are not sure fining the trust will achieve that outcome – unless it can be pushed back into patient safety  and care.’ Naomi Chambers, an expert in health policy at Manchester Business School, said the trust was now a ‘hugely toxic brand’ which was struggling to recruit doctors and nurses. She added: ‘It is absurd on the face of it for one public sector body to be fining another public sector body with no obvious benefit to the taxpayer or for patients.’ She called for a ‘swift decision’ on the dissolution of the hospital, which went into administration last April but a decision to close it has not yet been taken by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. In court yesterday Bernard Thorogood, prosecuting on behalf of the Health and Safety Executive, said Mrs Astbury had been let down by the ‘complete absence’ of communication between staff. Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust has previously admitted health and safety breaches at Stafford Hospital . He said her death was ‘wholly avoidable’ and that overstretched nursing staff were ‘set up to fail’. ‘All the clinical and nursing staff were working in the context of poorly-led and poorly-run systems with no effective management oversight and control’, he said. It emerged that there was just one senior nurse in charge of 84 beds at the time, following a cost-cutting programme by bosses. The court heard Mrs Astbury suffered a catalogue of errors in three different wards. She was assessed on arrival in 2007 and described as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, who needed daily injections of insulin to control her blood sugar. However, the chart monitoring her blood glucose level was not completed for several days, a referral to a dietician was never acted on, forms were not signed by senior staff, and the ambulance crews’ record – containing key information – was never attached to Mrs Astbury’s medical notes. The case has now been adjourned after Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, the judge sitting in the case, said it could have ‘wider implications’ and he wanted to ‘reflect on the submissions’. 'Cure the NHS' campaigners have repeatedly called for answers about the poor standards of care and lack of accountability, including demanding the resignation of NHS boss Sir David Nicholson . He will now reserve sentencing of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust to a later date. Mid Staffs last year pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety rules and providing ‘dreadful’ care to Mrs Astbury. It was passed to the crown court as magistrates can only impose a £20,000 fine. To the dismay of bereaved relatives, not a single manager, doctor or nurse at the trust has been prosecuted for their part in the incident. Two nurses, however, have been disciplined. Ann King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned for misconduct by a professional panel in July last year. In October, the trust finally admitted to management failures – three years after an inquest jury ruled Mrs Astbury’s death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other systemic failures. The case continues. Mid Staffs has already apologised for the ‘dreadful’ care Mrs Astbury received in the short time she was at the hospital, during which time she was transferred between three different wards. It has said practices have ‘improved considerably’ in the intervening years. Mr Thorogood said the basic failings . began right after Mrs Astbury was admitted to accident and emergency . with a suspected fractured arm and pelvis following a fall on April 1, . 2007. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave . was told that an initial admission process had been carried out . correctly, but failings in subsequent handovers meant key information . about Mrs Astbury was not then passed on. Described . as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, she needed daily injections of . slow-acting insulin to control her blood sugar and the admitting doctor . made a proper assessment of her condition, also setting a trigger level . under which her blood glucose should be kept, according to Mr Thorogood. He . said the admitting A&E nurse who initially assessed Mrs Astbury . properly recorded her diabetes, her need for a dietician, and also came . up with a care plan - proving the hospital's staff should have been well . aware of her condition. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave adjourned the case saying it could have 'wider implications' and that he wanted to 'reflect on the submissions' Separately, since Mrs Astbury's death two nurses have been disciplined. Ann . King was struck off and Jeannette Coulson was cautioned following a . Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found them of guilty of misconduct . in July last year. In . October 2013, the trust admitted failing to properly manage and organise . hospital services including its systems for record-keeping and sharing . patient information between staff. The . case was moved to the crown court for sentencing because the . magistrates ruled their sentencing powers to issue a fine of up to . £20,000 would not be sufficient, given the gravity of the offence. The . current prosecution was brought three years after an inquest jury ruled . Mrs Astbury's death was contributed to by low staffing levels and other . systemic failures. The . inquest also concluded that a failure to administer insulin to the . 66-year-old amounted to a gross failure to provide basic care. ‘However before these arrangements could be set up there needed to be a robust handover system,’ added Mr Thorogood. She . was transferred from A&E to the hospital's Ward 7 on April 1, but . by the time of her death in the early hours of April 11, had been the . victim of a catalogue of errors. Nurses . failed to give her daily dose of insulin on the morning of April 10, . and she collapsed and later died in the early hours of the following . morning. Among the failings, . her fluid monitoring chart was incomplete, and records about food . intake were contradictory - one said she was eating, another contained a . referral to the dietician, which was never acted upon. Her . patient number was wrongly written from one form to the next, forms . were simply not signed by senior staff, while on admission the ambulance . crews' record - containing key information - was never attached to Mrs . Astbury's medical notes. In . one case, the orthopaedic ward where Mrs Astbury was when she died was . using an obsolete form which had already been phased out in other wards. A specialist report commissioned by the HSE concluded the passing on of information by nurses ‘fell significantly short’ of the required level and care provided was ‘significantly below the right standard’. It highlighted problems in information-sharing, hand-overs and record-keeping in eight nurse shifts and up to 11 drug rounds, over the period Mrs Astbury was in hospital. Outgoing chief executive of the NHS Sir David Nicholson . There is widespread anger at the fact that not a single official has been held to account for the failings at the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust – in particular the outgoing chief executive of NHS England, Sir David Nicholson. He was head of West Midlands Strategic Health Authority between 2005 and 2006 – the body supervising Mid Staffordshire – but failed to pick up on the horrific standards of care at the start of the scandal. When the report into the tragedy revealed that up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly at the trust between 2005 and 2009, Sir David insisted he was not ashamed of his record. His comments led to him being branded ‘The Man With No Shame’ by campaigners and the Press.And only one person has lost their job directly over the disaster – the former chief nurse at Stafford hospital Janice Harry, 60. She was struck off after it was found she endangered patients. She made harsh cuts that reduced the number of nurses to dangerous levels. She also refused to adequately staff the A&E department, ignored warnings that patients were at risk and did not provide proper food and fluids for patients in the Emergency Admission Unit.","Gillian Astbury died after two nurses failed to give her insulin .

Male panda Xing Hui (which means Twinkling Star) and female Hao Hao (Cute) are to receive a red-carpet welcome when their chartered Boeing 747 touches down at Brussels airport. Among those waiting on the tarmac to receive the pair - who are celebrities at home in China - will be Prime Minister, Elio Di Rupo. Scroll down for video . Arrival: Male giant panda Xing Hui and female Hao Hao land in Brussels tomorrow . The bears have their own Twitter feed and Hao Hao was named China's favourite panda at the international Giant Panda Zoo Awards last year. But their forthcoming arrival has inflamed old tensions between Belgium's Walloon (French-speaking) and Flemish populations. French-speaking Mr Di Rupo has been accused by Flemish politicians of snubbing the country's oldest and most famous zoo, in Antwerp, when he helped to secure the pandas' visit to Belgium. Borrowed: with only 2,000 pandas left in the wild, China has lent the two bears to Belgium, which is paying ¿10m (£8.2m) for their visit . How famous? Hao Hao was named China's favourite panda at the international Giant Panda Zoo Awards last year . Instead the pandas are to stay in the Pairi Daiza animal park near the city of Mons, where the mayor is none other than Mr Di Rupo. The 170-year-old Antwerp zoo insists its pedigree and prestige should have made it the first choice. A zoo spokesman told the Guardian it was better equipped to host the two four-year-olds, having accommodated two other pandas in 1987. All in all we are rather surprised that the prime minister did not think of us,' a spokesman said. Makeover: couriers DHL published this picture on their Facebook account showing the final touches being made to the chartered plane . Cyber pandas: the bears' Twitter account detailed their flight to Belgium . Zuhal Demir, an MP with the Flemish separatist N-VA party, has accused the prime minister of outright favouritism. 'Di Rupo made a political choice,' Ms Demir said. 'He was not acting as prime minister of all Belgians.' However, Pairi Daiza's founder and owner, Eric Domb, insists the zoo was scrupulous in its application for the pandas. 'The pandas are Chinese, not Walloon or Flemish,' he said. Pairi Daiza, set up just 20 years ago, is Belgium's most popular zoo, with 1.25 million visitors last year. Antwerp zoo, meanwhile, saw its visitor numbers stagnate at 840,000. Spacious: the pandas are heading to the 20-year-old Pairi Daizi zoo for the duration of their stay . Bamboozled? A Flemish politician accused Mr Di Lupo of snubbing the 170-year-old prestigious Antwerp zoo . A shrewd commercial deal lies behind the pandas' visit. Belgium will pay an estimated €10m (£8.2m) to host the duo but they should more than pay for themselves. Visitors numbers to Edinburgh zoo leapt 51 per cent in 2012, the year after they began hosting pandas. With only around 2,000 pandas left in the wild, China is sparing about renting them out: Pairi Daiza is one of just 17 zoos worldwide hosting the bears. Pairi Daiza is spending €8m (£6.61m) on a special 300 sq metre Chinese garden to make the pandas feel at home, and it will include separate 120 sq m residences for each. Hao Hao: the cost of having the two pandas on loan is high but visitor numbers could soar once the celebrity bears have arrived .","Bears Xing Hui and Hao Hao land in Brussels tomorrow .

Wayne Rooney's agent has been locked in talks with Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward over a new deal for the England star. Rooney, who has 18 months left to run on his contract, has attracted interest from Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid. The forward's agent Paul Stretford was at United's Carrington training base on Wednesday before returning on Thursday morning to hold further discussions, with Rooney's Old Trafford future topping the agenda. In the driving seat: Wayne Rooney and Paul Stretford held discussions with Ed Woodward over a new deal . In demand: Rooney has attracted interest from Chelsea and Spanish giants Real Madrid . United will resist any attempts by Madrid to force through a deal for the 28-year-old, who, as revealed by Sportsmail earlier this week, is on a list of three centre forward targets for the La Liga club this summer. Rooney is wanted by Carlo Ancelotti, with the former Chelsea boss also interested in Manchester City's Sergio Aguero and Monaco striker Radamel Falcao. When informed at the weekend that Chelsea's Jose Mourinho had predicted Rooney would be sold abroad this summer, United manager David Moyes said: 'I disagree'. United, who were dumped out of the Capital One Cup by Sunderland on penalties on Wednesday night, will be boosted by the imminent £37million arrival of Juan Mata from Chelsea who arrived at Carrington on Thursday morning. Uncertain: The England international's future remains in the balance - although United are keen for him to sign . Mata will undergo a medical at Bridgewater Hospital ahead of the move, which will be a club record fee for the Premier League champions. But earlier this week, United legend Gary Neville questioned the signing of Mata. The Sky Sports pundit does not believe the Spaniard, who fell out of favour under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge, fits in with the 'typical philosophy' of United. In a series of tweets, England's assistant manager said: 'Does he fit in with what I would call the typical philosophy of Manchester United? I would say no. 'Positives of signing a player like him are obvious-lift everyone (spark) creativity, knows PL, 4th place chances go up - fantastic player.' On the move: Juan Mata will join Manchester United in a £37million deal from rivals Chelsea . Then, on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show, Neville added: 'The first question, I think, is where are you going to play? Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie are up top if they are fit so where are you going to play him? Are you going to play him off the left or off the right? 'Maybe they have to change the philosophy and maybe that's what David Moyes is thinking. Maybe he wants to play narrow wide players and maybe a three in midfield. 'They would have to change to accommodate Juan Mata in the way they normally play. They normally play with wide players. 'He's obviously a fantastic football player, there's no doubt about that, but one thing it does do, I suppose, is that David Moyes, Manchester United and Ed Woodward need to sign a big player. 'They need to make a noise and if they get him in it will attract potentially other players - and they need three or four players. 'What it could be is the start of something to lead to other things, but typically I wouldn't say he fits.'","Wayne Rooney has 18 months left to run on his Manchester United deal .

MasterChef judge John Torode was granted a divorce from his wife Jessica yesterday, clearing the way for his romance with actress Lisa Faulkner. A High Court judge issued the uncontested decree nisi in less than a minute yesterday, finally cutting ties between the 48-year-old TV chef and the mother of his two children Jessica. The pair, who have a son, eight, and a daughter, seven, had been married for seven years but ended their marriage 'by mutual consent' after breaking up in 2011. Romance: Lisa Faulkner and John Torode, who was yesterday granted a decree nisi ending his marriage . A year later Torode made public his relationship with 41-year-old Spooks star Faulkner, who he met while she was cooking her way to victory in 2010's Celebrity Masterchef. Faulkner has described her relationship with Torode, which blossomed after the pair split from their former partners, as 'really new, really lovely'. She told the Mail last September: 'John and I were friends. Neither of us thought of it as anything else until... 'I don't know how things change, but something does. He asked me on a date. We went out for dinner. Then it was slightly different. 'I'm really, really happy. John and I are having such a nice time but we're taking things slowly. There are lots of other people to consider.' Torode with his ex-wife Jessica: The pair ended their marriage 'by mutual consent' after breaking up in 2011 . Faulkner's ex-husband Chris Hoghill, who played Tony King in EastEnders, moved out of their marital home in early 2012. The pair share custody of an adopted daughter, Billie, who is six. Torode has four childre, two with his ex-wife Jessica and another two from a previous relationship. She has previously insisted that there were no sparks between her and Torode when they first met filming Celebrity Masterchef. Cook: Faulkner holds the Celebrity Masterchef trophy after winning the series in 2010. She met Torode, a judge on the programme, during filming . 'When I met John he was a judge on a show I loved and I was petrified of him. He was brilliant and gave us all tips so you didn't want to let him down,' she said. 'All I could think was, “That sauce hasn't worked.” I didn't see anything but food for three months. 'After I won, we did The Good Food Show and stuff. John and I always got on, but I never thought about me and him.' Since first going public with their romance in November 2012, Faulkner and Torode have not sought to downplay their romance, but neither have they exactly flaunted it. They have been photographed together at celebrity events just a few times and both still live at separate London adresses. Faulkner began acting at 19 in the film The Lover after leaving school at 16 to model. Roles in Brookside, Holby City and Spooks followed. Since taking the MasterChef crown she has reinvented herself as a cookery expert, publishing two recipe books, the second of which featurs her daughter throughout. 'Cooking anchors me and calms me,' she has said. That makes her an ideal match for Torode, who began his kitchen career in his home town, Melbourne, aged 16 before moving to London in 1991 and clinching jobs as sous chef at some of London's most fashionable restaurants. After first appearing on television in 1996 on ITV1's This Morning, he joined Greg Wallace to present a revamped MasterChef on BBC One in 2005. Neither he nor his wife were in court to see their marriage ended, the Daily Express reports.","Faulkner and Torode went public with their romance in 2012 .

When Ian Usher, 50, from Barnard Castle in Country Durham decided he had had enough of life in the fast lane, his solution was dramatic. Recently divorced, fed up with his job and tired of his new life in Australia, in 2008 Ian put his entire life up for sale on eBay, with his car, job and motorbike among the items included. £216,000 better off, he decamped to a deserted island in the Caribbean and six years on, says, despite the lack of creature comforts, he's happier than ever. Remote: After selling his life on eBay, Ian Usher, 50, spent the proceeds on a private island in Panama . Now his incredible story is to appear on a new Ben Fogle documentary in which he reveals what giving everything up for a new life in the wilderness is really like. 'I’ve always been a bit of an adventurer and so have always spent a lot of time pursuing outdoor activities such as climbing, canoeing and diving,' he reveals. Thanks to his new home, a tropical island off the coast of Panama, he has plenty of time to indulge in all three, even if that does mean living without electricity and running water in a tiny self-built cabin and growing or raising most of his own food. 'We're not completely self sufficient . here on the island,' he admits. 'We do grow coconuts, pineapples, yukka, sugar cane . and almonds but we haven’t yet perfected the art of growing other . vegetables on our land. Isolated: The island is a 20-minute boat ride from the nearest jungle town and was totally uninhabited . Transport: Usher and his girlfriend Vanessa Anderson use homemade canoes to get around . 'We have 10 chickens who roam free on the . island so our eggs are totally organic. Sometimes the local Indians will . bring freshly caught fish to the dock for us to buy. 'Everything else . comes from the supermarket in town or Ernie’s Jungle 7/11 – a small . store on the edge of the jungle.' With little need for cash thanks to his eBay sale and the book deal that ensued, most of Ian's time is spent working on the land or relaxing on the beach. 'We usually get up quite early, between . five and six o’clock and do some work until around nine,' reveals Ian. 'Then it’s . breakfast for us, the chickens and the dog. We get involved with the . local VHF radio transmission a couple of days a week that broadcasts to . the expats. 'We spend time working outside on the land, snorkelling on . the reefs off the bay, swimming and reading. Home: Ian lives in a house he built himself and grows much of his own food on the island . Companions: One of the flock of 10 chickens who keep Ian company and provide a supply of eggs on the island . Hands on: Ian carries a tethered goat onto the island (left) and attempts to get a WIFI signal (right) 'Once in every 10 days we go to town for food . supplies and fuel. Sundays without fail we go to our jungle restaurant, . Rana Azul, where we meet up with the local community for an afternoon of . drink, food and dancing.' Despite the remoteness of his new home, which is a 20-minute boat ride from the nearest town, Ian has found someone willing to share it with him - girlfriend Vanessa Anderson, who he met last year during a visit to London. 'Vanessa coming to live here has made a big difference [to my life].' he reveals. 'We met last year when I passed briefly . through London and she came to live here a couple of months later.' With Vanessa on board, Ian says his happiness is complete and adds, his family notwithstanding, that jet-skiing is the only thing he misses about life in the UK. Hard work: Ian, pictured with Ben Fogle, puts his woodwork skills to use on building a new canoe . Home from home: Ian and Vanessa show Ben Fogle around the island for an episode of New Lives in the Wild . 'There isn’t really much I miss at all,' he says. 'I . enjoy living a relatively simple life. Maybe a better internet . connection would be good. Oh, and an evening out with family and friends . at a good English pub on a Friday night. 'Vanessa still misses a London style cappuccino . but I think she’ll get over that soon.' He adds: 'I wouldn’t change anything - I really enjoyed building an off-grid home and living on the island. I've always thought life is supposed to be an adventure.'

Such was the emphatic manner of Manchester City’s win in the Capital One Cup semi-final first leg here last night, they did not even need a second half. Three goals up by the interval and coasting towards the final, Manuel Pellegrini’s side were every bit as dominant as West Ham had feared. The trip to Upton Park in two weeks is nothing more than a  formality, as is their place at Wembley on March 2. Alvaro Negredo must take the plaudits for a well-taken hat-trick with his left foot but rarely can the Spaniard have had an easier night.

City do not need any help scoring goals — especially at the . Etihad where they now have 59 in 15 games this season — and there could . have been far more  on a night when they fired 32 shots at goal. Edin . Dzeko scored another two and the Bosnian had lost count of City’s . tally by the time he was interviewed afterwards, mistakenly thinking it . was five. ‘That happens . sometimes,’ said Pellegrini with a knowing smile after his Champions . League  miscalculation in Munich last month. As it rained goals on a wet . night in Manchester, Sam Allardyce stood under heavy skies while the . West Ham fans called for his head.

Even . the cautious Chilean struggled to say there was still any life left in . this tie afterwards. ‘In football it’s never finished,’ he said. ‘But it’s an important step to playing in the final at Wembley.’ The . writing was on the wall even before kick-off.

Michael Jackson went for 60 days without sleep, making him the only person ever to have done so, a sleep expert has claimed. Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, said he has never heard of any person who has gone 60 days with Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep as he testified at the wrongful death trial of concert promoter AEG LIve. Michael Jackson's mother Katherine is suing AEG Live, claiming it failed . to properly investigate her son's personal doctor Conrad Murray and . missed warning signs about his failing health. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 after giving Jackson a lethal dose of the anesthetic propofol. Jackson's mother argues AEG Live pressured Dr. Murray to get her son to . rehearsals but ignored warning signs and failed to get him help. But AEG Live lawyers say Jackson chose and hired Murray so their executives had no way of knowing about the propofol treatments administered in his home. As reported by CNN, the jury was told by Dr Czeisler that the 60 nights of propofol infusions which Dr Murray said he gave Jackson to treat insomnia has never before been undertaken. Dr Czeisler, a sleep consultant to NASA and the CIA, told the jury that the drug does not offer REM sleep and disrupts the normal sleep cycle. But it leaves those who take it refreshed and feeling as though they have had a proper night's sleep. The doctor told the jury that the lack of REM sleep could eventually have taken the singer's life had he not have died when did. Legal action: Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson, left, is suing AEG Live, claiming it failed to properly investigate her son's personal doctor Conrad Murray, right . The jury was told that rats tested by scientists died after five weeks of no REM sleep. People who are deprived of REM sleep for . long periods become depressed, paranoid and anxious. They also lose their balance and appetite, and can have slower physical and emotional reactions. These . are symptoms which Jackson was said to be suffering from in his final . weeks. His show's producers reported that he became thinner, paranoid and forgetful, and was heard talking to himself. Suffering Rapid Eye Movement sleep deprivation for an extended period of time makes someone paranoid, depressed, unable to learn, distracted, and anxious, Dr Charles Czeisler testified in the trial. The sufferer loses their balance and appetite, while their physical reflexes get 10 times slower and their emotional responses 10 times stronger, he said. The brain needs seven to eight hours of sleep to repair and maintain neurons every night. Learning and memory also happen when you are asleep, he said. Without it, the sufferer completes tasks less successfully, he said. 'It would be like eating some sort of cellulose pellets instead of dinner,' he said. 'Your stomach would be full and you would not be hungry, but it would be zero calories and not fulfill any of your nutrition needs.' He explained to the jury that your brain needs seven to eight hours of sleep to repair and maintain neurons every night. 'Like a computer, the brain has to go . offline to maintain cells that we keep for life, since we don't make . more,' he said. 'Sleep is the repair and maintenance of the brain . cells.' Lawyers acting for AEG Live have said it was Jackson who chose and hired Murray. They say executives could not have known about the dangerous propofol treatments. Expert opinion: Charles Czeisler, a Harvard Medical School sleep expert, testified that the lack of REM sleep could eventually have taken the singer's life had he not have died when did . The trial, which has been running for eight weeks, continues. It is expected to conclude in August. Jackson passed away aged 50 on June 25, 2009 after he received a dose of propofol administered by Murray and stopped breathing. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson’s death and is currently serving four years behind bars in a L.A. County jail for providing the fatal dose. He is appealing the verdict, claiming it was Jackson who was responsible for his own overdose.","Singer 'only person to go two months without .

A crane operator who was trapped high above a burning building has been saved by a brave rescuer who dangled from a Royal  Canadian Air Force helicopter and pulled the man to safety. Tuesday's fire at a partially-constructed apartment complex in Kingston, Ontario, quickly engulfed the cab of the crane that was perched above the building, forcing the operator to crawl out on the exposed boom. A daring RCAF sergeant attached to hoist was lowered onto the crane. He grabbed hold of the frightened crane operator and lifted him to safety as dozens of onlookers held their breath on the ground. Photographers captured images of the harrowing rescue, including the moment the crane operator was lifted into the air and safely pulled into the safety of the CH-146 Griffon helicopter. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: A Royal Canadian Air Force rescue shopper was sent in to save a crane operator who was stranded high above a burning building Tuesday . Harrowing: Sergeant Cory Cisyk put on a harness on the stranded man and hoisted him up to the relative safety of the air force helicopter . Inferno: The crane caught when a partially-constructed apartment complex that it was working on burst into flames . 'For us, this was extremely unusual. But even discussing with the crew afterwards, we really figured that the training we do every day really came into it and played a big factor in the way things ran,' Sergeant Cory Cisyk told the CBC. The man was taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, but we later released. The crane is still standing, though officials say it could collapse and fall down at any time after the flames severely damaged the metal frame. Neighboring homes have been evacuated because engineers have no idea when or where the crane will come down. Sgt Cisyk and his crew flew from Canadian Forces Base, Trenton about 65 miles away from Kingston after it became clear that the crane operator would require aerial acrobatics to rescue. Trapped: The crane operator hunkered down at the end of the boom as he waited for rescuers to arrive. Witnesses on the ground prayed the crane wouldn't collapse before the chopper got to him . Success: The man was treated at a local hospital, but escaped the harrowing ordeal without major injuries . Burned out: The carriage of the crane was engulfed in flames from the building burning below it . Sergeant Cory Cisyk performed the daring rescue . The Kingston Whig-Standard reports that witnesses on the ground shouted encouragement at the trapped crane operator, as they waited for the chopper to arrive. Witness John Ashie told the CBC that onlookers could scarcely believe their eyes. 'Especially when the helicopter guy was rescuing him from the crane, everyone was like, ""Oh my god! I can't believe this is happening, it's just so surreal,""' he said. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the fire. Sgt Cisyk said the rescue in the middle of a city was rare for the air force crew. RCAF search and rescue choppers are used to plucking stranded hikers out in the mountains or retrieving sailors in distress on the Great Lakes.

However forecasters say things could change depending on where the leading edge of the Arctic air stops. I'm dreaming of a white Christmas: A cold blast of Arctic air sweeping across America's eastern states next week could bring the season's first snowstorm . Plan: The schedule for next week's potential storm would be Tuesday over the Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes, Tuesday night and Wednesday over the southern Appalachians and Thursday along the Atlantic Seaboard . AccuWeather.com reports forecasters are bracing for two other possible scenarios. One is that the low pressure system moves out to sea, bringing some rain and snow mix to the central Appalachians with dry, cold conditions in New England. Another possibility is that an unusually strong storm moves up the coast then backs into the Northeast, leading to heavy snow inland and rain along the I-95 corridor. 'Climatology does not favor major snow in along the I-95 corridor in mid-November,' ABC 7 New York's Chief Meteorologist Lee Goldberg said, according to AccuWeather.com. 'Snow is more likely in the higher ground north and west of the cities.' Scenario 1: Forecasters say a coastal low which develops near the Carolinas and slides up the East Coast could bring coastal rain, inland snow and gusty winds . Scenario 2: Another possibility is that the low does not make the turn up the coast and slides out to sea instead . Meteorologists warn a nor'easter snowstorm could mean regional power outages, blocked secondary roads, coastal flooding and beach erosion from North Carolina to New Jersey, New York and New England.

Mr Paul claimed that several hundred thousand people have . already signed up for the suit that he hopes will be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court – perhaps an inevitability after courts have issued differing District . Court rulings on the constitutionality of the program. Announcing the suit: Senator Rand paul (R-KY) spoke about the lawsuit in a Friday night appearance on Fox News . The Senator contended told Fox News that . to applying a single warrant to millions of people is unconstitutional and that . questions of constitutionality should not be decided by the secretive FISA . court. ‘The question here is whether or not you can have a single . warrant applied to millions of people,’ Mr Paul said before explaining that . anyone with a cell phone is eligible to sign up. ‘No you can’t have our records without our permission or . without a warrant specific to an individual.’ The government quietly announced in a Friday afternoon . statement from Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s office that . the surveillance program has been renewed. The statement also included defense of the spy program’s . legality, perhaps in an attempt to head Mr Paul’s lawsuit off at the pass.

Southern Districts of both California and New York, as well as 16 FISA court . judges on 36 occasions, the government claimed the program is lawful. Mr Paul disagreed, saying that Americans should not have to . trade their Fourth Amendment rights for protections against terrorism. ‘We think we can have security that we can defend against . terrorism, but that doesn’t mean that every individual American has to give up . their privacy,’ he said. Mr Paul may have a case after U.S. District Court Judge . Richard Leon ruled last month in Washington, D.C., that the program was . unconstitutional, and ordered the removal of the records of two individuals. 'I am not convinced at this point in the litigation that the NSA’s database has ever truly served the purpose of rapidly identifying terrorists in time-sensitive investigations,' Judge Leon wrote in his ruling, according to NBC News. Anyone with a cell phone: Mr Paul says anyone with a cell phone is eligible to join the lawsuit .

Takeaway in a manger: Takeaway service Just Eat is offering a revolutionary service selling our favourite dishes with a festive twist on Christmas Day, including this 10in mince pie pizza . Turkey thigh mince, chestnut stuffing, cranberry relish in a pitta bread with bacon, lettuce and bread sauce creates the festive kebab . Around one million Facebook were asked to post their views on takeaway Just Eat's website and a specialist chef created the most popular choices. The 10-inch mince pie pizza is made from 350g mince meat, edible gold star and icing sugar. Meanwhile, 500g of turkey thigh mince, chestnut stuffing, cranberry relish in a pitta bread with bacon, lettuce and bread sauce creates the festive kebab. Chipolatas and bacon are used to make the sushi, which is wrapped in cavolo cabbage and 100g of brussels sprouts are used in the spicy curry. New research shows more than 8,500 takeaway orders were made on Christmas Day last year, with over 500,000 orders made between December 23 and 31. Almost half of orders were for pizza (43 per cent), a third (30 per cent) for Indian and 8 per cent were for American dishes - fried chicken and chips.

Once a staunch New Yorker, Caleb Young, like many, felt disenchanted to the city he once loved so much in the aftermath of 9/11. A singer-songwriter who got by working as a bartender, Young watched the Twin Towers collapse from the roof of his apartment building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. His relationship at the time also fell through. So he packed his bags and headed home to North Florida to live with his motherhood in his childhood home, reported The New York Post. Needing a job, his mom found a notice in the newspaper calling for dance instructors - no experience necessary. Scroll down for video . Caleb Young, who has become known as the 'widow whisperer', now owns a dance studio in North Florida that specializes in helping widows and octogenarians jazz up their lives . He trained for a week and got the job. Now, over 10 years later, he owns a thriving dance studio called Absolutely Ballroom and has come to be known as 'the widow whisperer'. Why? Because Young's studio specializes in helping octogenarians feel like they're on Dancing With The Stars. 'This director calls me and [says] how when his father died, he didn’t know if his mother would survive, and then she found ballroom dance,' Young told The NY Post. '[It turns out] she was one of my students.' Young has two employees who help him teach more than 40 students. Caleb Young, 45 (right), has made a career for himself helping octogenarians feel like they're on Dancing With the Stars. Here he teaches a student how to properly execute her ballroom hand gestures . Caleb Young's dance studio, Absolutely Ballroom, is the focus of a new documentary, Ballroom Confidential, which follows the lead up to a special student performance . The students, who range in age from 23 to 97, pay $70 for 50-minute one-on-one sessions, most once a week, year round. The majority of them are older than 50 — 30 to 40 percent of whom Young estimates are widows. 'I think the reason I connect so well with these ladies is that I treat them like people,' he says. 'Some of these ladies, they can be quite intimidating when they walk in the door. 'I’ve just never been intimidated by them.' But there’s a deeper reason Young is able to connect with these widows — and many of them don’t realize. In 2000, Young lost his own partner of seven years, Mark Pizzelli, to cystic fibrosis. Caleb Young, 45, left New York after 9/11 and, after a few years working as a dancer, started up his own dance studio in North Florida . 'I think I was the only one who believed he wouldn’t die,' says Young. 'I think I was still at the ‘We are invincible’ stage of life.' It is with that shared pain, and the understanding of the need to stand on your own, that Young deals with his clients. 'The majority of it is creating their own identity — not as a wife, grandmother or a great-grandmother,' says Young. 'Just being who they are.' Young's unique story has made him the focus of a new documentary, Ballroom Confidential, which is released Friday.

An ousted Native American leader who is accused of shooting dead four people in a savage attack has been revealed to be a bully who everyone in her town hated. Cherie Lash Rhoades was arrested Thursday on suspicion she unleashed her fury at a meeting on whether she should be evicted from one of nine little houses on the Cedarville Rancheria in the high desert of northeastern California's Surprise Valley of which she was previously leader. Police say the angry woman, who worked in the tribe's gas station and convenience store and wore brightly colored tank tops that showed off her tattoos, left four dead and two wounded in the gun and knife attack. This Thursday, Feb. 20, 2014 photo released by Alturas Police Department shows Cherie Lash Rhoades who allegedly killed four and injured two . The terrifying shooting spree left the tiny town shocked. 'She bullied her way through life,' said Sandra Parriott, a lifelong resident of Cedarville and owner of two downtown markets, of Rhoades. 'But I would never think she would start blowing people away in a meeting.' Those killed included the suspect's brother, 50-year-old Rurik Davis, her niece, 19-year-old Angel Penn and her nephew, 30-year-old Glenn Calonicco, and Sheila Russo, 47, Modoc County Sheriff Mike Poindexter said. Eviction from tribal housing is among the most serious punishments for American Indians. Though police have said they are still working on a motive, a nephew who lived with her, Jacob Penn, said she snapped under the pressure of her brother trying to evict her. The brother, Rurik Davis, who lived down the street on the Rancheria, had apparently taken over as tribal chairman and was among the dead. Investigators had been looking into whether Rhoades took federal grant money meant for the rancheria she once led, a person familiar with the tribe's situation told The Associated Press. The person spoke only on condition of anonymity. Alturas Police Chief Ken Barnes said they were looking into whether the embezzlement allegations spurred the tribe's efforts to evict Rhoades but they had not established any definitive motive. The investigation was no secret around town, where several people interviewed by the AP mentioned it, though they said they had not been contacted by investigators and did not want to give their names. Though Rhoades was always ready to share a joke, 'you did not want to get on her bad side,' said Penny Nash, Parriott's sister. 'She has a powerful personality.' Rurik Davis (left), 50, was the killer's brother and Angel Penn (right), 19, was her niece . Sheila Russo, 47, an administrator for the Cedarville Rancheria Indian tribe, was one of four people killed when Cherie Lash Rhoades opened fire . The small town is home to the Cedarville Rancheria, a small tribal organization . It was not immediately known if . Rhoades had a lawyer. She was being held at an undisclosed location . because the husband of one of the dead, the only nonrelative to be shot, . works at the Modoc County Jail, Sheriff Mike Poindexter said. Rhoades . has yet to appear in court, where she would be given a lawyer if she . could not afford one herself. Her father, Larry Lash, declined to . comment. Penn, who lived with Rhoades and was raised by her after her . sister gave him up as a child, had little to say but a shrug of the . shoulders about his aunt, whom he called, 'my mom.' He said two of the . dead were his brother and sister, Rhoades' nephew and niece. Most . of the 35 registered members of the rancheria appear to have been . related to Rhodes. Parriott ticked off 20 people on her fingers she knew . were relatives of Rhoades. Parriott . said her late mother had known Rhoades' late mother, Virginia Sweeney, . who lived in town as a child, but not on the rancheria. Rhoades came . back about 20 years ago with her young son, mother and brother, Davis, . and worked her way into leadership of the tribe. Parriott said Rhoades 'was always loud. She kept pushing and plowing to get her way.' 'I . sure wouldn't have wanted to be her neighbor,' Parriott added. 'She . took pretty good care of her kid, but I don't know that she had any . friends. She had family, but family aren't always your friends.' Rhoades' brother, Rurik Davis, was easy to get along with, Parriott said. The .

The New York Post reports that Collins came out in a Sports Illustrated article last May but that he hadn't signed with an NBA team that season yet. Jason Collins makes history by being the first openly gay NBA player . Originally Glen Davis was going to go with the Nets but he went with the Los Angeles Clippers instead . When Nets players were asked about how they felt about having a gay teammate, they responded with openness and understanding. 'It's 2014' said Deron Williams on Friday. Micheal Sam became the first openly gay NFL player a few weeks ago, paving the way for gay males in American sports. 'Michael Sam just came out, and his teammates welcomed him, and they’re in college. It’s time for the NBA, as well,' said Williams. Yahoo Sports reports that the Nets originally wanted Glen Davis, but that when he decided to sign with the Los Angelos Clippers they had to go back to the drawing board.

Nets coach Jason Kidd actually played alongside Collins for six and a half seasons and is familiar with Collins' playing abilities. Collins played for seven years with the Nets from 2001-2008 and also played with Kevin garnett and Paul Pierce with the Boston Celtics. 'I think it’s important that anybody who has capabilities and skill level to have a chance to do something he’s great at or one of the things he’s good at,'his teammate Garnett said. 'I think it’d be biased and, in a sense racist, if you were to take that opportunity from a person,' he continued.

The Wall Street Journal reported the landmark agreement could set a precedent for Netflix's dealings with other broadband providers. In exchange for payment, Netflix will get direct access to Comcast's broadband network. The news comes after Comcast agreed to buy Time Warner Cable Inc. which, if approved by the regulator, would establish Comcast as by far the dominant provider of broadband in the U.S. serving 30 million households. Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said he decided to strike the deal after Netflix streaming speeds for Comcast subscribers began deteriorating. According to January data, the average speeds of Netflix's prime-time streams to Comcast subscribers had dropped 27 percent since October.

'When she hired him, Dahlenburg told . plaintiff that if he 'applied' himself and worked with her 'on and off . the clock' he could advance to a management position,' the suit alleges.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 07:53 EST, 23 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 23 February 2014 . Afghanistan's Taliban said Sunday it has suspended 'mediation' with the United States to exchange captive Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five senior Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay, halting — at least temporarily — what was considered the best chance yet of securing the 27-year-old soldier's freedom since his capture in 2009. In a terse Pashto language statement emailed to The Associated Press, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed blamed the 'current complex political situation in the country' for the suspension. A U.S. official with knowledge of the talks said the cause of the suspension was not the result of any issue between the United States and Taliban. He declined to elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. This image made from video released Wednesday April 7, 2010 by the Taliban via the Site Intelligence Group shows U.S. soldier then Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl . Bergdahl, of Hailey, Idaho, was last seen in a video released in December, footage seen as 'proof of life' demanded by the U.S. Bergdahl is believed to be held in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Mujahed said the indirect talks with the U.S. had been mediated by Qatar, where the Taliban established a political office last June. The video of Bergdahl was part of the negotiations which were to lead to the eventual transfer of the five Taliban leaders held since 2002 in Guantanamo Bay. 'The leadership of the Islamic Emirate has decided to suspend the process for some time due to the current complex political situation in the country,' the statement read. 'The process will remain suspended without the exchange of the prisoners until our decision to resume.' Mujahed did not elaborate on what 'political situation' in Afghanistan led to the suspension of talks or say when they might resume. Afghanistan is in the middle of a presidential campaign ahead of an April 5 election. Two-term President Hamid Karzai cannot run again for office under the Afghan constitution. The U.S. State Department has refused to acknowledge the negotiations, but the U.S. official previously told the AP that indirect talks were underway. In response to the Taliban statement Sunday, U.S. Embassy spokesman in Afghanistan Robert Hilton said: 'Sgt. Bergdahl has been gone far too long, however we can't discuss the efforts we're taking to obtain his return.' Efforts at a swap are also seen as a concession to Karzai. Washington would like to see him back away from his refusal to sign a security pact that is necessary for the U.S. to leave a residual force behind in Afghanistan. Karzai says he wants Washington to push reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban forward, without offering specifics. The five Taliban detainees at the heart of the proposal are the most senior Afghans still held at the prison at the U.S. base in Cuba. Each has been held since 2002. This undated photo provided by the Bergdahl family and released by the Idaho National Guard shows then Pfc. Bowe R. Bergdahl, 23, of Ketchum, Idaho . They include: . — .

The single mother of three says she was fired from her job as a bank manager at the Oldsmar branch last year when bank officials were made aware of the deadly weapon she was concealing. Armed: Ivette Ros regularly carried her gun on her person or in her purse to her workplace, which does not permit weapons . Ros' has filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the termination constitutes a violation of her constitutional right to carry arms. According to the Tampa Tribune, she is seeking monetary damages and attorney fees. 'Iâ€™m a manager of a bank,' Ros told the Tampa Tribune. 'We have a lot of robberies that happen in our banks. I feel safer having that weapon if I ever needed to protect my employees.' A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to talk about the court case but said the company has clear rules prohibiting employees from bringing weapons onto its premises. Former manager: Ros used to work at this Oldsmar branch of Wells Fargo until she was fired for bringing a gun to work last year . The company offers an exception in states where individuals are allowed to keep weapons in their locked vehicle in a company parking lot. Ros told the Tribune that she sometimes left the gun in her car, but often brought it into the bank concealed under her clothing or in her handbag. Last year, another staff member noticed the gun and reported her to bank officials. She was fired after an investigation by corporate security. Protection: Ros' attorney says the bank's policy violates her right to arm herself . 'I am within my constitutional right,' Ros said. 'The bank is one of the places that I am able to carry a weapon to. My weapon was concealed. I have a certified license.' Ros' attorney Noel Flasterstein says the company's policy is illegal and that Ros is being discriminated against. Legal experts disagree.

It seems some wealthy Atlantans aren't keen on the prospect of a drag-racing, egg-throwing Canadian teenager for a neighbor. Residents of the well-to-do Buckhead neighborhood are planning to stage a protest outside the Blackland Road property the pop star has his eye on. Given Bieber's prior egg-throwing antics at his Calabasas residence, which are now under investigation by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, the residents' wariness is understandable. Palatial: Bieber is reportedly interested in purchasing this Blackland Rd property . Event: Residents have no intention of welcoming Bieber with open arms to the wealthy Atlanta neighborhood of Buckhead . Baby, no: Bieber's antics at his Calabasas residence, including causing $20,000 of damage to his neighbor's house with eggs, have earned him a bad rep . The event is set for Monday and so far 136 people have committed to the 6am event. 'As a community here in Buckhead, we have worked hard to achieve our goals and get to where we are. Justin Bieber’s relocation to Atlanta can be nothing but bad for our children, as well as the community,' reads a statement on the Facebook page. 'Some can’t even let their children play in the driveway without fear; he has raced vehicles under the influence before. What’s to say he won’t do it again? Write caption here . Nearby neighbors: 136 people have already said they will attend the protest outside this property . 'As a homeowner down the street from this residence, one can assume many people will be contacting real estate agents soon enough. Please do not allow a child to ruin what we have worked so hard to obtain. Thanks for the support!' The home in question is an $11 million, seven-bedroom, 16,000 mansion built in 2010, reportedly near where his mentor Usher lives.

A schoolboy has admitted he and his older brother stabbed their stepfather more than 60 times as he slept. Jerome Ellis, 14, admitted that he and 22-year-old Joshua killed Neil Tulley as he lay on the sofa in their living room. Their 'frenzied' attack almost severed the 54-year-old's head. But the pair deny his murder, arguing that they feared for their family's safety after he had apparently threatened their mother. Neil Tulley (left), 54, who was found stabbed to death on the sofa of his home in Guildford, Surrey, in August last year and Jerome Ellis (right), 14, who on trial for murder . The siblings fled after the killing and discussed killing themselves with the large knives they had used on Mr Tulley but eventually handed themselves in to police with the aid of a church bellringer, who Joshua told: 'We're murderers.' Taking the witness stand behind a screen at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, Jerome Ellis told the jury of the events of the night of August 12 last year. Joshua, now 23, and who suffers from depression, was living as a virtual recluse in the attic at the time. The court heard he told his sibling that during an argument with their mother downstairs, Mr Tulley had threatened to go and get an axe from the garden shed. Jerome said: 'He (Joshua) told me we had to kill him.' Mark Wyeth QC, representing the young defendant, asked: 'Did you agree?'. 'Yes,' he replied, adding: 'I saw that as the only option, because he was a threat to everyone in the family, including me, my brothers, my mum and even his own children.' Scene: The killing happened in August last year at this house in Guildford, Surrey . He said he and Joshua went downstairs and got two knives from the kitchen drawer before 'attacking' Mr Tulley as he lay on the sofa he slept on in the living room. 'I wasn't thinking properly and it was all a blur,' said Jerome, who could not recall how long the attack took. The jury heard that afterwards the pair had left the house and walked to a nearby forest, still covered in Mr Tulley's blood and with the knives in a Sainsbury's bag with baby wipes the pair claimed were for covering their injured hands. 'There was a discussion of suicide, I don't remember who started it,' Jerome told the jury. 'I considered it. We were going to commit suicide with them (the knives).' The brothers' natural father Gary Ellis, pictured outside Guildford Crown Court, wept as his young son gave evidence . At 9.15am the following day Marie Ellis called her mother-in-law, Patricia Ellis, and told her Neil Tulley was dead. Mrs Ellis told her to ring 999 but it was not until half an hour later that she did, lying to ambulance controllers that she was calling about a heart attack victim. When paramedics arrived at the property, in Guildford, Marie Ellis took some time to open the door and then led them to the body on the sofa. There were still three young children in the house at the time. The brothers evaded police for several days before turning up dishevelled at a church a few miles away, where the older brother told a bellringer: 'We're murderers' and asked him to contact police. Prosecutors have already outlined how Mr Tulley had been acquitted the previous year of attempting to murder Joshua by swinging an axe at him. Jerome and another brother had been kicked out of their natural father Gary Ellis' home on January 29, 2012, after he discovered they had been sneaking off to visit their mother and Joshua in secret. Marie and Joshua were said to be happy they had returned, but Mr Tulley had argued that they could not stay in the small home already occupied by him, his partner, Joshua and Mr Tulley's three daughters with Marie. As the argument became heated, Mr Tulley was alleged to have walked out to the shed and picked up an axe, bringing it inside and threatening Joshua. 'I saw Mr Tulley try to kill my brother with an axe,' said Jerome. 'He lunged at him' he added, demonstrating a chopping motion. 'It didn't connect, Josh knocked it out of they way and tackled Mr Tulley to the floor.' Once Mr Tulley was arrested, tried and eventually acquitted, he returned to the family home. The court heard he drank daily and was abusive towards Joshua, Jerome and Marie regularly in the lead up to them attacking him. Justin Rouse, defending Joshua, said Mr Tulley had previously had a restraining order taken out against him by Marie and had also received a caution for strangling her. Philip Katz QC, prosecuting, questioned whether Mr Tulley had in fact threatened to use the axe, which Jerome had seen after breaking into the garden shed a week earlier. He asked why the police were not called during the argument, to which Jerome said: 'We had tried the police before, he was acquitted and came back to the house and continued to be abusive. 'I wanted to protect my family and if that meant doing that (killing Tulley) then that was the only option.' As father Gary Ellis sobbed in the public gallery, Mr Katz QC questioned Jerome's recollections and said he was trying to protect Joshua. 'Things were going from bad to worse in that house after his acquittal and I suggest that you were angry,' he said. 'An element of revenge was involved in what subsequently happened. On the night in question the decision was made that Neil Tulley was to die and you agreed to take part in that.' Jerome denied any planning or element of revenge in the attack. The trial is expected to finish on Tuesday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Jerome and Joshua Ellis killed Neil Tulley in Guildford, Surrey .

Jade Goody's mother has been removed from jury duty after complaining about a fellow juror. Jackiey Budden, 56, wrote a letter to the judge at Blackfriars Crown Court after becoming annoyed by a young woman chewing gum, flicking her hair, and taking her shoes off during the trial. However after the note was passed on the judge dismissed the jury, causing the sex assault trail they were sitting on to be restarted. The other jurors were all reselected to sit on other cases, with the exception of Ms Budden. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: 'Before we went into court we were told if we felt uncomfortable about anything we had to write a letter to the judge. 'Being on a jury was something I treated seriously. I was listening to everything and making notes. But I was sitting next to this woman who wasn't showing any interest. 'She kept kicking off her shoes, huffing and puffing, tossing her head and chewing gum.' Before the second day of the trial Ms Budden passed the note of complaint to the judge. After dismissing the jury, Ms Budden said she was given the option of sitting on another jury or going home.

Ms Budden, from Bermondsey, added that she didn't think she would be eligible for jury duty because she has previous convictions, and the serving on a jury had made her feel proud. She says she has no idea what she did wrong, or why she wasn't reselected. The Ministry of Justice confirmed that Jackiey had been removed from duty.

The employment rate among women reached 67.2 per cent, the highest level since 1971. The latest rise was driven by an increase in the number of women working full time, which was up by 122,000, to 8.1 million, over the past three months. Female workers now account for 46 per cent of the total UK workforce. The number with part-time jobs fell, by 28,000, to 5.9 million, while in comparison the number of men in both full-time and part-time work rose.

A Duke college freshman and middle class Republican has hit out at critics after her secret career in porn was revealed. According to a story in the college paper the Duke Chronicle, the trouble started for 'Lauren' (not her real name) when fellow college freshman Thomas Bagley came up to her and asked her if she was the same girl as the adult film star he'd been watching. Lauren admitted that she acted in pornographic films under a stage name, but swore him to secrecy. Exposed: In an interview with the campus newspaper, Lauren called her porn career empowering . For his part, Bagley denies having recognized her in porn, telling the Daily Caller that she actually confessed her secret to him. Both agree that despite his promise, Bagley blabbed at his next fraternity rush event. Once he leaked the secret, people across campus were texting and tweeting about the Duke freshman porn star within a matter of days. The aspiring lawyer was crudely mocked and attacked online. 'If you b***ed her, report in,' wrote one anonymous poster on the CollegiateACB message board. 'We going to pretend like she . was unaware of the social consequences of going into that business? she . made a decision, now she needs to live with the consequences,' wrote another. She soon found herself talking to the campus newspaper about her life in porn, which Lauren would later call an attempt to control the conversation. In that interview, Lauren said she started in adult films as a way to offset her massive tuition bills, and called the Duke campus a place where women had to hide their sexuality, and were held to a 'virgin-wh*** dichotomy.' In that story, the author took note of Lauren's 'designer bag' and new iPad as proof of her porn-riches. Higher learning: Duke students took to the internet to criticize Lauren's career choices and speculate who might have had sex with her . However, Lauren wasn't entirely pleased with the Chronicle's representation. While she thanked them for giving her a forum she also accused them of skewing her words and betraying her trust in a response on the blog Develle Dish, adding that they had 'portrayed me as a naÃ¯ve, attention seeking little girl who flaunts her wealth.' She went even further detailing her life in pornography and the lack of impact she expects it to have on her future in a first-hand account published on xoJane Friday. 'I couldn't afford $60,000 in tuition, my family has undergone . significant financial burden, and I saw a way to graduate from my dream . school free of debt, doing something I absolutely love,' Lauren wrote. 'Because to be . clear: My experience in porn has been nothing but supportive, exciting, . thrilling and empowering.' She further elaborated that the site she performed for was a 'rough sex website' but that she had never been 'coerced or harmed' while filming. 'Everyone has their kinks and we should not shame anyone for enjoying something that is perfectly legal and consensual for all parties involved,' she wrote. First-hand: In an article on xoJane, Lauren said she had no fear of porn impacting her future career as she wouldn't want to work for anyone who held it against her . 'For me, shooting pornography brings me unimaginable joy. When I finish a scene, I know that I have done so and completed an honest day's work. It is my artistic outlet, my love, my happiness, my home.' Finally, she shot back at critics who claimed she was being degraded: 'I can honestly say that I have never felt more empowered or happy doing anything else.' Lauren also called for people to examine why they treated female sexuality 'with such disdain,' and dismissed online comments that said her history would prevent her from finding work after graduation. 'I wouldnâ€™t want to work for someone who discriminates against sex workers,' she wrote.","'Lauren' was outed by a fellow student at a fraternity rush .

Dozens of coffin-shaped pits have opened up across a cemetery after weeks of rain caused the earth to give way over burial grounds. The alarming sinkhole phenomenon, which have exposed around 50 unmarked graves, raised fears deep cavities might be concealed just below the grass. Visitors are being warned to watch their step after the giant holes appeared at Gravesend Cemetery in Kent. Collapse: Coffin-shaped holes have been opening up in the cemetery in Gravesend as a result of earth movements . Warning: Visitors have been told to be careful where they step in this Gravesend cemetery after large holes began to open up . Several plots have sunk below ground level following weeks of heavy rain. Worried cemetery bosses have revealed they have never before seen graves sinking into the ground on such a scale. A technique known as backfilling has so far failed, as the heavy rain has seen the soil compact down. Now visitors have been warned to tread carefully - as holes may be lying underneath a mere 'carpet' of grass. The . graves, including those at another cemetery in neighbouring Northfleet, . have been sinking into the ground over the last fortnight. Unsettling: Heavy rain is being blamed for disturbing the earth and causing graves to collapse in on themselves . Patching up: The local council is busy backfilling the sunken graves with more soil . A Gravesham Council spokesman said: 'It is quite common for graves to sink - especially after a period of heavy rain. 'However none of the current staff has . seen anything on this scale. Both cemeteries have been affected but . Northfleet is smaller and has been more manageable. 'There are two main reasons why it has happened. Urban sinkholes are more common after heavy rain, because they are caused by water flowing through channels below ground and eroding away soil or soft rock like limestone. As the earth is carried into other parts of the ground large caverns can open up, usually unknown to the authorities or the people living above them. Once the cavern cannot support the weight of the topsoil above it, it collapses into the ground. One of the world's largest sinkholes, the Xiaozhai Tiankeng in China, is more than 2,000ft deep. 'One is graves are backfilled with loose soil and they sink again once that soil gets so wet and heavy it compacts. 'One of the first areas that showed a problem had been backfilled three times and needed doing again. 'Secondly in the old section of the cemetery the graves are deeper, so there are larger cavities for the soil to sink into. 'We have been working hard to top up the affected graves using extra staff from other teams. 'It is a gradual process but it is a priority to deal with them.' Some of the graves have been taped off to keep people away from certain areas. Families have been visiting the site to check on family members buried there. A sign warns: 'The ground staff are . backfilling them as soon as they can, but due to the scale of the . problem, have had to tape off some areas where the situation is . particularly bad. 'Please be . careful when walking on the grass as sometimes the soil has compacted . but the grass remains like a carpet over the hole.' The recent spell of torrential rain and storms seems to have caused a spate of serious sinkholes to open up.

She's admitted to having boob jobs, but Victoria Beckham has never used botox, fillers or lasers, says her dermatologist. Dr Harold Lancer claims the 39-year-old transformed what was uneven, acne-blighted skin into a smooth and blemish-free face simply by paying attention to her lifestyle and skincare regime. He said: ‘Victoria Beckham is a natural beauty. 'She’s an incredible health nut – she watches her diet, her exercise, she sort of leads an ideal healthy life. 'She’s an example of how skincare products can be used to convince tissue to heal itself from the outside in and the inside out.’ The Beverly Hills medic added: ‘She suffered badly from acne but [her skin now] is totally self resolved. 'She pays meticulous attention to product use and lifestyle. ‘And I supervised all of it so I assure you nobody has touched her with any surgical implements or lasers. 'She’s an example of self discipline. ‘I always advise acne patients to modify their diets so they have no dairy intake, no caffeine intake, and next to no sugar. 'This means their carbohydrate intake has to be under 20 per cent of their calorific intake. ‘I’m the only skin doctor who she’s ever seen, so trust me on this one.’ A more competitive type of indoor cycling class, devised  by New York fitness experts, is attracting an array of celebrity fans, including Jessica Alba, Sofia Vergara,  Jimmy Fallon and Matthew Broderick. Called Flywheel, it combines powerful music and uplifting instruction with a new, high-tech ‘torq pack’ which measures your speed and power to give a race ranking and exact calorie-burn count. ‘Flywheel is extremely fun because I’m a little bit competitive,’ said Jessica, right. ‘During the sprints, you can see where you’re ranking in the class and go harder to make your number better.’ Winning streak: Flywheel combines music and instruction with a high-tech ¿torq pack¿ which measures your speed and power to give a race ranking . The class’s co-founder, Jay Galluzzo, says: ‘Jessica loves our intense, inspiring classes  and the technology.’ The first class opened in London last year, at Shoreditch House, and there are now plans to extend further into the UK. Cranberry juice could make your body healthier overall, says new research. Adults who regularly consumed the drink had better cardiovascular profiles than those who didn’t – even though there was no difference in overall calorie intake, said the US study. Drinking cranberry juice – which has long been a go-to drink for cystitis – was associated with smaller waist measurements, a reduced likelihood of being overweight or obese and a lower risk of infection or inflammation. All in your head: Agony may be 'all in the mind' People who believe their pain will have catastrophic effects feel it more severely – meaning pain may be ‘all in the mind’, says research. Psychological factors are increasingly seen to have a major impact on how much you feel pain, explaining why different people have different pain thresholds. The study of 100 patients with knee arthritis tested how much they ‘catastrophised’ pain and how badly they felt on six-minute walks. The research at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, showed that the more patients feared pain from walking, the more pain they actually felt. And the amount of pain felt can have an impact on recovery as  that often requires exercise. Jane Tadman of Arthritis Research UK says: ‘It’s always been a strange phenomenon that people with osteoarthritis, who may have the same amount of cartilage damage, have completely different levels and experiences of pain. ‘There is a large “psycho-social” aspect to chronic pain. We’re carrying out research looking at the way the brain processes pain, anticipation of pain and whether there are abnormalities in brain mechanisms, which if targeted, could offer a more effective way of dealing with chronic pain than traditional painkillers.’ Yoga really can create positive physical changes in the body, new research reveals. A study by Ohio State University looked at 200 breast cancer survivors who had never practised yoga before. Half were given twice-weekly 90-minute sessions for three months while the other half continued not to practise it. Blood tests taken before and after the three months showed that cytokines – proteins in  the blood that can show inflammation – were lower by  ten to 15 per cent in those doing yoga. One theory is that yoga aids sleep and cuts stress, which in turn reduces inflammation.","Victoria Beckham has admitted to having a breast enlargement .

Killer: A photo issued by Greater Manchester Police of Paul Maxwell, 49, who absconded while on on day release with prison staff in Rochdale town centre . A convicted killer is on the run after he bolted while on day release from jail. Paul Maxwell, 49, disappeared while visiting Rochdale town centre on Friday with prison staff. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the 1996 murder and robbery of 85-year-old Joe Smales in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Inspector Niall Pawson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'While we do not believe Paul Maxwell presents a significant threat to the public, he is unlawfully at large and he needs to be returned to prison. 'I would ask anyone with information about where he currently is, has been or could be heading to contact us in confidence.' First jailed for the killing of Mr Smales alongside his brother in 1998, Maxwell made headlines in 2011 when he unexpectedly pleaded guilty at a retrial after his conviction was overturned on appeal. In a handwritten note he read out on the first day of the hearing at Leeds Crown Court, he confessed to the murder and apologised to the family of Mr Smales for his 'cowardice'. In another shock revelation, in his statement, written in his cell, he claimed to fallen in love with the daughter of a priest with whom he had developed a relationship during counselling sessions in prison. 'She has done much to me help and realise my full potential as a human being,' he said. 'I am not the person I was in 1996. 'At some point I had to stand up, take responsibility and be man enough to take responsibility for my actions. 'Today is that day.' The attack on the reclusive elderly brothers sent shockwaves through the tight-knit community of Stanley in Wakefield. Mr Smales and his 68-year-old brother Bert, who was also badly injured in the attack, had lived all their lives at their cottage, where they topped up their pensions by selling eggs. Victim: Joe Smales was beaten and later died after being attacked and robbed at his home in Wakefield 1996 . At Maxwell's original trial in 1998, a jury heard the Smales brothers' quiet existence was shattered in June 1996 when their attackers barged through the door, threatening Bert with scissors and getting away with Â£7,000. Tragically, the brothers failed to report the incident and were targeted again four months later, when Joe was fatally attacked. Following the retrial Mr Justice Butterfield gave Maxwell a life sentence and ordered that he must serve a minimum of 17 and a half years. That meant he would have been able to apply for parole some time this year or next. But it appears that he couldn't wait for his time to come. Maxwell is described as white, about 5ft 7in tall, of medium build with short brown hair and blue eyes. He wears glasses and was last seen wearing blue jeans, a grey fleece top and white training shoes. He has links to Rochdale and Tameside.","Paul Maxwell bolted during visit to Rochdale town centre with prison staff .

The family of Benefits Street star Fungi have turned their backs on him after it emerged he was sleeping rough, saying that he 'used up all his chances' and 'deserves everything he gets'. Fungi, real name James Clarke, fled his home on the notorious James Turner Street in Winson Green, Birmingham, after the Channel 4 series aired last month. TV producers had been paying for him to stay in a hotel in Wales, but stopped picking up the tab when the documentary ended. 'Deserved': Fungi, right on Benefits Street, has been seen begging on the streets of Cardiff, but his daughter Kirsty, 23, has said it is his own fault . Taxpayer-funded: Fungi, pictured here in his home on James Turner Street, left in an attempt to tackle his drink problem . He was seen in Cardiff begging passers-by for change, and claiming he had been 'exploited' by the makers of the documentary series, who 'made their money out of me'. Fungi said that he had family but did not want to stay with them as it would be 'disrespectful'. But his 23-year-old daughter Kirsty today said he was banned even from seeing his three grandchildren. She said: 'It might sound horrible but my dad has ruined his own life, my mum's life and mine. 'He deserves to be living on the streets. He blames everyone but himself for his problems. He has used up all his chances but he's still blaming people for his situation. 'Maybe being homeless will teach him, once and for all, to pull himself together and stop taking drugs and drinking his life away.' 'Used up all his chances': Fungi, pictured with his daughter Kirsty in 1991, will not receive any help from his relatives, they have said . Absentee: Ms Clarke, shown as a baby in 1992, was raised single-handed by her mother Donna Reilly, left, after a series of disappointments from Fungi . Fungi launched the attack on Channel 4, and co-star White Dee, on Friday while begging outside a Tesco store in the Welsh city. Fungi, an alcoholic, lived in a taxpayer-funded home on James Turner Street while the series was being filmed last year, but fled afterwards in a bid to beat his drink problem. The TV station had been paying for him to stay in hotels around Wales while Benefits Street was broadcasting, but stopped picking up the bill after the last episode was shown. Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, he said: 'I've been exploited, the people who run the show made their money out of me and f***** me off. 'I slept rough last night. I've got no house to go to now. I've got family up here but I couldn't stay with them - it would have been disrespectful.' 'Abandoned': Fungi, pictured here with White Dee on the show, says his co-star doesn't care about his situation . He also hit out at fellow star White Dee, who has made numerous television appearances since Benefits Street was broadcast, and is reportedly mulling over a Â£90,000 deal to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. He said: 'That White Dee is earning money now and doesn't give a f***. I think she's a two-faced f*****.' Ms Clarke was brought up single-handed by her mum Donna Reilly, 39, after she kicked Fungi out for his drug-taking. She said: 'My mum was young when she met my dad. They stayed in touch but my dad was always going off with his druggie mates. 'My mum wanted him to be involved in my life but I hardly saw him because he was bad news. 'I was 12 years old and one of my cousins knocked at the door and told us he thought he'd seen my dad in town asleep. TV star: Fungi launched an attack on White Dee, who now has a showbiz agent and has appeared on shows including This Morning . 'My mum took me down to town and we saw him curled up next to another tramp in the shop doorway. 'He's let me down my entire life. I haven't had one birthday or Christmas present from him and I'm embarrassed for my kids that they have him as a granddad. 'Benefits Street is the worst thing he has ever done and we have to live with that forever.' Ms Reilly said: 'He hasn't changed at all. He's hooked on alcohol and whatever else and it'll probably end up killing him. 'He has sold his soul to Channel 4 and has wrecked any chance of having a relationship with his children or grandchildren.' A spokesman for Channel 4 said 'Fungi decided to spend time away from James Turner Street. Since then the team from Love Productions have provided some support for him and are currently helping him find alternative accommodation should he prefer not to return to James Turner Street. 'In the meantime he assured us that he would be staying with relatives.'","Fungi, 44, appeared on the show but later fled because of alcohol problem .

Barclays Bank was last night accused of ‘incompetence’ and urged to review hundreds of payouts to victims of the PPI scandal after it emerged some customers could have missed out on compensation while others were paid automatically. MPs piled pressure on the bank after an investigation by The Mail on Sunday found that some staff were given the wrong rules for awarding compensation. Hundreds of people who were sold payment protection insurance on their Barclaycards were affected by the mistake. Nahida Goodchild who lives in Ipswich, had PPI on her Barclaycard but was denied a refund by Barclays . The error meant customers who happened to have been dealt with by the bank’s Leeds office were awarded automatic payouts, while others had to fight for compensation. Barclays has insisted that nobody lost out, but now faces having to explain to MPs, the Financial Conduct Authority and angry customers how what it describes as a ‘minor glitch’ could have occurred. MP John Mann, who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, said: ‘This is a major issue. What Barclays needs to do is ensure that all their customers are compensated to the maximum amount. They should re-examine all the cases that are affected. I am going to raise this with the Financial Conduct Authority.’ Mark Garnier, MP for Wyre Forest and a member of the Banking Commission set up to look into reforms of the industry, added: ‘The charge here may not involve having cost anyone money; the charge is being incompetent.’ Barclays was one of the worst offenders when it came to the  mis-selling of PPI to people who neither asked for it nor needed it. Tens of thousands of customers paid for cover unnecessarily and Barclays has set aside £3.95 billion for compensation. It emerged in July last year that an office in Leeds had been working to different rules from another four sites that Barclays had created to handle PPI compensation claims. The Leeds case handlers were automatically compensating people who had bought PPI for their Barclaycard over the phone instead of deciding each case on its merits. A whistleblower said: ‘When  managers found out about this, they told us, “This has happened, let’s move forward”.’ Case handlers worked from an online manual which was updated across all five sites in April 2013. But a technical failure meant the new version did not fully upload  for the Leeds workers. Treasury Select Committee member John Mann, who said : 'What Barclays needs to do is ensure that all of their customers are compensated' Contractors became aware of the error in July 2013 after a spot-check. On July 29, a manager alerted staff in an email saying ‘an error has been made in the operating instructions’. Managers held a meeting and the matter was never mentioned again, according to the whistleblower. The revelation that the bank did not notice that it was operating a two-tier system for three months has left customers furious. Nahida Goodchild, 51, was upset when, after fighting for compensation for three years, Barclays decided that all she deserved was £238, even though PPI had been added without her consent to her Barclaycard 20 years ago. Payouts average £2,500 but the figure varies widely. ‘I am flabbergasted to think some people got their money automatically,’ said the mother-of-two from Ipswich. ‘It makes me feel even more angry. The least you expect is that everyone is treated fairly.’ A Barclays spokesman said: ‘No customer has been denied redress or treated unfairly in relation to these claims, which relate to less than one per cent of PPI cases during a period of three-and-a-half months. 'Those customers, of which we estimate there were less than 200, were only advantaged.’ A spokesman for the Financial Conduct Authority said of Barclays’ PPI-handling operations: ‘We are very closely working with their teams and understand how they are handling complaints.’","Error meant that some customers had payouts immediately .

The man who set up a charity project to help British terrorist victims, after his son was killed in an IRA attack in England, last night attacked David Cameron’s ‘offensive and thoughtless’ refusal to throw it a cash lifeline. Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed in the IRA bombings in Warrington in 1993, spoke out after the Prime Minister turned down a plea for £150,000 to rescue his Survivors For Peace project. Mr Parry asked Mr Cameron and Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers for the money weeks before the scheme is due to lose its Lottery funding in April. But he said he was shocked by a letter from Number 10 advising him to use the internet to find the money. ‘It is offensive for Mr Cameron to suggest that after nearly 20 years of running a charity I don’t know where to get money,’ said Mr Parry. ‘I do know and I have been to them all. His thoughtless response suggests he doesn’t see us as a priority. He expects us to muddle through, but we can’t. ‘Unless we find a wealthy benefactor we will have to make our staff redundant and cut adrift all the people who depend on us for support.’ Mr Parry said the Government’s refusal was ‘short-sighted’, adding: ‘Sadly, there are likely to be future British victims of terrorist attacks, here or abroad, and we are here to help survivors. If we aren’t, it will be harder for them.’ Tim Parry and another child, three-year-old Johnathan Ball, were killed in the IRA’s attack on Warrington, Cheshire, in 1993. Their deaths touched the heart of the nation and Colin Parry received an OBE for peace campaigning after the atrocity. Criticism: Following his son's death, Colin Parry set up a charity project to help British terrorist victims. Last night, he attacked David Cameron's 'offensive and thoughtless' refusal to throw the charity a cash lifeline . Plea: Mr Parry (pictured, right, with former Ireland's former secretary of state, Dr John Reid, left) asked Mr Cameron and Theresa Villiers for the money weeks before the scheme is due to lose its Lottery funding in April . He and wife Wendy set up the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Foundation For Peace and later devised the Survivors For Peace programme, set up to help British victims of the Northern Ireland ‘Troubles’. The scheme has since been widened to include those affected by the 9/11 attack in New York, the 7/7 bombings in London and the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. ‘My wife and I know from experience that friends and family can do so much, but you need experienced help to get through losing a loved one in a terrorist incident,’ said Mr Parry. Touching: Tim Parry and another child, three-year-old Johnathan Ball, right, were killed in the IRA attack. Their deaths touching the heart of the nation. Left, Colin Parry and wife Wendy hold a photo of their beloved son Tim . ‘That is why we established this charity. It is the only one that  specifically offers help to British terrorist victims. ‘We organised last year’s Hyde Park commemoration of the 7/7 bombing and plan to do the same this year. Victims get together, remember their loss in a dignified way and share their experiences. Without us, who will do it in future?’ In his letter, Mr Cameron said the Government had ‘done much in recent years to meet these needs’. He urged Mr Parry to use the internet to search for new sources of charitable cash, adding: ‘I encourage the Foundation to explore those tools.’ Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Ivan Lewis said: ‘It is essential to ensure victims of terrorism get  all the support they need to rebuild their lives. David Cameron and Theresa Villiers must stop dithering and save this project.’ The Warrington bombings consisted of two attacks – one at a gas storage facility and one in the town centre, where two bombs caused carnage and confusion. Johnathan was killed almost instantly and Tim was so badly injured his parents had to take the agonising decision to turn off his  life support machine. More than 50 others were injured. Downing Street did not comment last night.","Colin Parry's son Tim, 12, killed in the IRA bombings in Warrington in 1993 .

The family of murdered honeymoon bride Anni Dewani spoke of their anguish last night after her husband  was given more time to fight extradition over her death. Millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani is to seek a last-ditch appeal at the Supreme Court – the highest court in England, Wales and Northern Ireland – despite the High Court and the Home Secretary Home Secretary   Theresa May declaring he should be flown to South Africa to face trial over his wife’s murder. Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha said: ‘When the High Court decided  last month that he should go back, I believed that was it and he was on  his way. ‘The judges said it was not only in the interests of justice that he should go back, but also in the interests of us, Anni’s family. ‘But now we find he is looking for another way out of facing trial and they may reverse their decisions. ‘I am so upset by this news. It has been more than three years and the British courts still allow him to carry on looking for a way out of talking to the police.’ Dewani, 33, is being detained under the Mental Health Act and suffers post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Doctors say he may be unfit to stand trial, although it is accepted he can travel. But various hearings have been told that he has been able to visit his family home, swim, use the computer and stay in a caravan on hospital grounds. Mr Hindocha said he had no reason to doubt that Dewani, from Bristol, had suffered post-traumatic stress disorder and needed treatment. But he added: ‘The South Africans have convinced the British judges that their medical facilities and doctors will care for him adequately over there. It has also been agreed that he is recovering and is well enough to get on a plane and meet detectives in Cape Town.’ Anni’s mother Nilam, who is battling cancer, added: ‘It has been more than three years since our dear daughter was killed and we are desperate for Shrien to tell the police what happened. ‘Unless Shrien is back in South Africa and in front of a judge there, we cannot rest.’ Scroll down for video .

Nigel Lithman QC condemned a London conference to promote the British legal sector overseas, saying it was ridiculous for the event to boast of the ‘UK’s unrivalled legal expertise’ when funding for criminal cases is being cut. He added that it was ‘like inviting the Red Cross in to Theresienstadt to see what great camps the Germans truly ran’. The Second World War camp was used by the Nazis to showcase how well they treated prisoners – thereby disguising the horrors taking place at sites such as Auschwitz. Mr Lithman, chairman of the Criminal Bar Association, represents barristers who stand to lose out when fees for court cases are cut. He received more than £250,000 in fees from the legal aid budget last year. In a speech to lawyers he said the cuts would ‘destroy the criminal bar’. But his mention of a Nazi camp where tens of thousands died provoked outrage and was labelled ‘deeply offensive’ by Tory MP Michael Ellis. Last night Mr Lithman, who is Jewish, denied comparing the ‘dismantling’ of the criminal justice system with the ‘horrors of the Holocaust’. ‘There is of course no comparison with the evils of Theresienstadt, but what happened there is the Red Cross were invited to look at a “model” camp in which they were fooled that all was well,’ he said. ‘The point I make is you always have a duty to look beneath the surface to discover for yourself what in reality is going on.’ Speaking at a London conference to promote the British legal sector overseas, he said it was ridiculous for the event to boast of the 'UK's unrivalled legal expertise' when funding for criminal cases is being cut.

A 16-stone gardener was rescued after he spent two hours trapped in a 15-inch gap when he fell off a ladder and got wedged upside-down between a wall and a shed. Steve Thomas was cutting back fir trees in his parents' garden on Thursday morning when he slipped and plunged 10ft head first down the narrow opening. The 34-year-old blacked out after hitting his head on a rock while his frantic worried mother and father desperately tried to free him. Eventually the couple gave up and called firefighters - who rescued him by taking the wall down one brick at a time. Incredibly, Mr Thomas, who lives with his parents in Worcester, suffered only grazes to his body and mild hypothermia in the freak accident. He was rushed to hospital as a precaution but is now back at home. He said: 'I'm quite embarrassed by it. I was on a ladder but had stood on the back of our wall, took a step back and over I went.

I couldn't believe they brought the fire brigade out but I would have been there all day otherwise. The day the wall fell: The structure had to be taken apart brick by brick by emergency services .

'I've got cuts and bruises all over and can't move my right arm properly yet.' His mother Elaine, 60, a cleaner, told how she struggled with her husband Roger, 68, for an hour to free Steve before they had to call for help. She said: 'Our next door neighbour is putting some fencing up and we thought we would cut some trees down. 'I was just holding the ladder and I turned around and he was gone. 'He tried to get out but there's a lot of rubbish in the gap. 'He got stuck on it, he's a big lad, he's 6ft 3ins. 'We tried for an hour to get him out but in the end we realised we couldn't. He got cold by then because he had been there long enough. 'I was shaking like a leaf. The fire brigade were marvellous. Thank you to them and the medical staff. They were brilliant.' Roger, a retired railway engineer, added: 'I couldn't get at him to pull him back up. He was sort of jammed. 'It was claustrophobic.' Firefighters from Worcester Blue Watch Fire Station and an Urban search and rescue team from Droitwich, Worcestershire, were called at 10am on Thursday to rescue Mr Thomas. Crews used hand tools and painstakingly removed part of the wall brick by brick in order to free him. Watch Commanded Davie Bliston said: 'He had been down there for some time. 'We took the wall down brick by brick while giving him first aid.'

A British tourist who allegedly swallowed a rare pink diamond worth £135,000 in an Australian jewellery store has been charged with theft, police confirmed today. Matthew Osborne, 29, appeared at Cairns Magistrates' Court accused of snatching the Argyle stone, mined in Western Australia, from a shop in the northern Australian city last Saturday.

Despite the 250,000 Australian dollar (£135,000) price tag, the diamond is only 0.31 carat with a diameter of 4.3 millimeters, instead earning its value because of its colour. Queensland Police earlier said in a statement that the stolen diamond is still outstanding and investigations are continuing. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports that a British national was arrested at Melbourne airport on Thursday. 'We have been in contact with the local authorities and offered to provide consular assistance.' The man allegedly stole the gem from The Diamond Gallery (pictured) in Cairns, Queensland .

Ever since his wife passed away two years ago, Martin Conway has tended to her grave, regularly leaving pots of flowers in tribute. Now the 85-year-old former insurance broker has been told that this ritual must stop. And you can probably guess why. Yes, the local council has decreed that grieving relatives cannot leave flowers on graves at the cemetery because of health and safety fears. Martin Conway, 85, has been told he cannot leave flowers at his wife's grave because of health and safety . Officials said they put the rules in place several years ago after a cemetery worker cut his knee on a piece of broken pot. And they claim there have been complaints that tributes have blown away making the area untidy. But that did little to ease the distress caused to Mr Conway, who received a letter from Cromer Town council in Norfolk on the second anniversary of his wife Pat’s death. Mr Conway said: ‘It was a complete bombshell when this letter arrived. I have never been so upset by anything. Health and safety just seems to be an issue for everything these days. ‘When you go to a cemetery to stand by the grave of a loved one, putting a few flowers there is a great mark of respect and love. The regulations stopped that.’ The letter sent to Mr Conway and other families stated flowers could only be left on graves of those who have been cremated if the memorial slabs have a vase built into them. Mr Conway received a letter from Cromer Town council on the second anniversary of the death of his wife, Pat (pictured in the 1950s) However, relatives who tend to larger plots of those who have not been cremated are allowed to leave floral tributes. Mr Conway, a former parish councillor who was married for nearly 60 years, said: ‘It is grossly unfair that the rule only applies to plots where ashes are buried and not normal graves. How can they produce such a rule, putting those of us whose relatives were cremated at a huge disadvantage? I cannot believe  any town councillor could make such a distinction. ‘I was not aware of the rules when my wife was cremated. I normally read everything I get, but I don’t recall getting a leaflet or anything. ‘I didn’t get a tablet with a vase inserted in it because I didn’t think they looked as nice from an aesthetic point of view. ‘I have put a plastic pot containing flowers on there every month or so without any problem and none of the pots have ever blown over even in quite a strong wind.’ Mr Conway said the council’s letter stated that unauthorised pots of flowers would be removed from the cemetery from April. But he is hoping councillors will have a change of heart and relax the rules at their next meeting. Yesterday council clerk Julie Chance said:  ‘These rules and regulations have been in place for years and years. The reason is to make the maintenance of the cemetery easier. We had an accident up there when a member of staff knelt down to do some work and cut his knee on broken glass from a vase. ‘The rules apply to everyone and we just felt it was time to remind people about them.  We are trying to be as helpful as we can and if there are special cases, we will work with people to find a solution. Mr Conway said the council's letter stated that unauthorised pots of flowers would be removed from the cemetery from April . ‘We have contacted all relatives to remind them of the rules. First of all, we telephoned them if we had numbers for them, then we put out a press release and we followed it up by writing to them. If any families have concerns they should phone the town council to discuss matters and if necessary make an appointment to meet to discuss it further.’ Mr Conway and his wife married in 1954 and went on to have three children and three grandchildren. They moved to their favourite holiday destination of Norfolk after they retired 25 years ago. Mrs Conway died aged 81 in January 2012.","Cromer Town council in Norfolk decreed that grieving relatives cannot leave flowers on graves at the cemetery because of health and safety fears .

Apart from her work on TV, including Australia's Next Top Model, Dawson was also fashion editor for Woman’s Day and style editor for New Idea magazines. Long-time friend: Crowe had known Dawson from when they were both teenagers. Both were from New Zealand but had made Australia their home. They even lived near each other in Woolloomooloo .

'Rest in peace my sweetheart': Alex Perry and Jennifer Hawkins lead tributes to Australia's Next Top Model co-star Charlotte Dawson following sudden death . 'There are no suspicious circumstances and investigations are continuing.' Charlotte's spokesperson, Benji Hart of London Management, confirmed the news of the star's death to the MailOnline, saying in a statement: 'London Management is deeply saddened by the tragic loss of Charlotte Dawson. Our thoughts and sincere condolence are with her family at this difficult time.' Pictured on Thursday: Dawson pictured smiling at Woolloomooloo Wharf, near the home where she was found two days later . Last pictures: This is one of the last pictures of Charlotte, which she posted on Instagram page on Friday, just one day before she was found dead . Model and mentor: Charlotte is seen here with her fellow Australia's Next Top Model co-stars, Didier Cohen, Jennifer Hawkins and Alex Perry in July 2013 . A close friend of the star told Sydney's Daily Telegraph shortly after the news broke that Charlotte had been in 'the worst shape emotionally’ in the days leading up to her death. One friend is said to have alerted the building manager of her apartment complex after Charlotte failed to turn up to a lunch earlier this week. That with the fact her Twitter account had remained untouched for at least 19 hours sparked fears that something was amiss. 'She was in very bad shape. Terrible shape,' a friend told the publicaton. Fragile: Despite being in good spirits when photographed on February 12, Charlotte's friends have said that the star was in 'terrible shape' of late . 'She had failed to shop up to a lunch a couple of days ago and then when I had seen she hadn’t tweeted in almost a day it was clear something was wrong.' In the past, Charlotte had been open about her long-term battle with depression. The model mentor was hospitalised in 2012 after she was bombarded with bullying messages by Twitter trolls because of her involvement in an anti-bullying operation. It was reported at the time she had attempted to take her own life. Successful: Charlotte has had considerable success on Australian television following her career in modelling . Following her stay in hospital she appeared on A Current Affair and The Project in an attempt to expose the malice behind Twitter bullying. She also touched on the topic in her book, Kiss And Tell, which was released in October 2012. However, her appearance on TV prompted even more abuse on Twitter, with some social media users writing comments such as: 'please hang yourself promptly' and 'neck yourself you filthy s***.' At the time, Charlotte also revealed she had received several death threats during the ordeal. 'I’ve never had death threats of this ferocity. I’ve never had a campaign of this ferocity,' she said. Model: Charlotte, pictured here in 2005, left her native New Zealand at the age of 16 to model in Europe and with Ford Models in New York . Recently Charlotte hinted in November that she was looking to step away from the spotlight after it was reported she was axed from Australia's Next Top Model due to a cast 'shake-up'. She told the Herald Sun Confidential at the time: ‘I’m tired of the anxiety that comes with working in media, especially as a woman because you’re scrutinised daily and abused about the way you look.’ Charlotte's last Instagram post was a picture of herself, and in the caption she told how she was about to appear on the television show Mornings on Channel 9. 'About to go on @mornings9 to talk sex. As you can see I'm racking my brains & have gone blank 😳,' she wrote. Regular role: Charlotte was a judge on Australia's Next Top model for six years .

Garry Monk's home was one of more than 30 targeted by Llewellyn and Green since 2002 . 'We have utilised every investigative . tool available to us to link them to unsolved burglaries - some of which . date back over a decade.

After the pair were arrested, officers executed search warrants in Swansea and Neath, Port Talbot, where they seized stolen property. Two women were arrested and later pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods.

Lena Dunham has finally opened up about her unretouched Vogue photos, which were leaked by Jezebel last month after the site placed a $10,000 bounty on the original images. The 27-year-old creator of Girls told Grantland editor Bill Simmons in a podcast released on Thursday that she was ‘kind of scared’ to see the images, but after noticing how they were minimally retouched she ‘felt completely respected by Vogue.’ ‘They smoothed a line here and shaved off part of my neck,’ Miss Dunham said of the changes the magazine made to her cover shoot. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking out: Lena Dunham has finally opened up about Jezebel seeking her unretouched Vogue images for a $10,000 prize, saying that it 'felt gross' She . elaborated, saying: ‘I felt like, “Thank you for removing the one line . from my face because I’m 27 years old and shouldn’t have that there and I . appreciate this.”’ Rather . than unearth a great discrepancy between reality and distortion, as was . Jezebel’s intention, the release of Vogue’s unretouched images actually . drew a large backlash. Readers . and media outlets alike questioned the site’s famously feminist morals, . as well as its motives for seeking out, and later releasing, the . photos. Miss Dunham herself called the stunt ‘messed up.’ ‘I . think Jezebel can be really smart and funny… I think it’s just like, . once you’ve been attacked in that way, it’s hard to enjoy, once you feel . like they’ve made such a monumental error in their approach to . feminism. I just can’t be half-in… It felt gross,’ she explained. At . the time, Styleite labelled Jezebel as ‘vindictive’ for ‘handing over a . $10,000 reward to whichever underpaid assistant in Vogue's photo . department risks their job to cough up the photos’. Writers . at Crushable felt similarly, saying that the site’s move was ‘so far . from okay (delete extra unneeded sentence) ... there’s nothing wrong . with wanting to look better than your best when you’re doing a Vogue . photo shoot. In the same way there’s nothing wrong with Lena Dunham . getting decked out at award shows.’ Proud of her form: Miss Dunham has never been one to shy away from displaying her body, and often appears in various states of undress on her HBO TV show . Website SheKnows also wrote a story with the headline, ‘Lena Dunham's Vogue cover: Was the photo editing that bad?’ An . outpouring of Twitter response even saw Jezebel users attest that they . were boycotting the site in protest of its hunt for Miss Dunham’s . photos. Miss Dunham, . herself, does not feel all that dissimilar: ‘Instead of going, “Hey we . kind of f***** up, these photos are not that retouched. Lena go enjoy . the Vogue spread that you’ve been excited about since you were eight . years old,” they were like, “She is not retouched, but she could have . been.”’ The young actress . and director says that she felt the site’s handing of the photos ‘was . this weird political maneuvering that I had a lot of trouble . respecting.’ The photos in . question were featured in Vogue’s February issue – one which is already . being switched out at newsstands for the magazine’s March issue staring .

When Fallon asked if her daughters Malia and Sasha would have enjoyed the skit their mom was just in, Mrs Obama told him that she tries not to let her girls watch TV. 'They are 15 and 12. They want nothing to do with us,' she added. 'They want normalcy and the White House is not normal.' She added that when she asks Malia if she wants to bring friends home, her daughter tells her 'No one wants to come to the White House'.

As the subject moved to sports it wasn't long before Fallon was asking how the Let's Move campaign, now in its fourth year, was doing. Mrs Obama described it as a success and announced plans to get people across the country to show the campaign how they were moving, by posting pictures on social media, using the hashtag #letsmove. She added that if the campaign got enough of a response the President and Vice-President may post pictures of how they move too. The First Lady also used her slot on the show to promote Obamacare, telling Fallon that young people 'were knuckleheads' who think they are invincible, and said they needed to get health insurance. She reminded viewers that those under 26 can stay on their parents' healthcare, and said after 26 they could find coverage from as little as $50 a month. As Fallon gave details of the healthcare website, which was plagued with problems when it first started, Mrs Obama interrupted to yell out 'It's working'. To keep the mood light, Fallon asked Mrs Obama to reveal details about a series of firsts seeing as she was the First Lady. In the segment, she said the first meal she cooked herself was mac n cheese. When Fallon asked if the President could cook, she said: 'Yes he can. He doesn't,' before adding that Obama had cooked 'five times for me'.

But when Ferrell's character interrupted to say 'Exercise, ew!', the First Lady became sterner, as she pushed her Let's Move campaign. 'Exercise is not ""ew"",' she told the characters, adding that she enjoyed playing tennis and dancing - a revelation that led to an impromptu dance party where Mrs Obama showed off her moves.

The group, all Forest fans, began banging on the windows before the two groups confronted each other by an exit lobby. Chris Lowe, prosecuting, said: 'They banged on the windows of the train, so Doncaster Rovers supporters in the carriage reacted to that undoubted provocation, and made their way to vestibule areas of carriages E and F. 'Doncaster Rovers Supporters goaded Nottingham Forest supporters on the platform. It was clear each group were threatening each other. Violence broke out in vestibule F and on the platform.

Judge Andrew Hamilton said the incident was 'disgraceful' 'Punches were thrown, kicks delivered, members of the group used violence toward each other. Beer bottles and cans were thrown.' Town Councillor Steven Marsden pleaded guilty to wounding and affray after he launched a bottle into the raging brawl. He was jailed for 12 months after the court heard the bottle slashed co-accused Ashley Allen's nostril. Allen, 19, a Rovers fan from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, was left with permanent facial scarring following the attack. He admitted affray and was conditionally discharged for 18 months and banned from football matches for three years.

'Glass bottles were thrown and one of the defendants involved in the fighting was stabbed in the face with a broken bottle. 'We quickly launched an investigation and detectives worked hard to gather evidence against each of the fifteen defendants. 'We simply do not tolerate this type of violent and barbaric behaviour. We've had great success in dealing with football related disorder, and serious incidents such as this are thankfully very rare on the railway network. 'By working closely with clubs, the rail industry, and football authorities, we're making inroads into tackling the type crime that can ruin match days for law-abiding fans and members of the public. 'I hope that being banned from the club, along with the sentences handed down today serves as a stark reminder that football related disorder on the rail network is utterly unacceptable and will seek the maximum penalties for anyone involved.'","15 Nottingham Forest and Doncaster Rovers fans started fight on train .

Kissing Coppers – the celebrated Banksy mural which shows two uniformed policemen locked in an embrace – was sold at auction in Miami last week for £345,000. But now it has emerged that the mystery buyer of the life-size black-and-white image may have purchased a work that was created with the help of a Brighton barman called Jez. Kissing Coppers first appeared on the wall of a pub in the seaside town in 2004. But two years later it was vandalised and all but obliterated. The stencil graffiti of kissing policeman by street artist Banksy on the wall of a pub in Brighton, in its scrubbed up state after it was vandalised . Staff at the Prince Albert did a hasty restoration job with the assistance of Jez the bartender, who touched up the damaged paintwork so effectively that customers joked he could be the next Banksy. The work was then placed behind a sheet of Perspex to protect it. The original Banksy stencil graffiti on the wall of the pub before it was vandalised . In 2008, however, the mural was removed by specialists and replaced with a replica. The landlord of the Prince Albert, Chris Steward, sent the original to New York in 2011, with a view to finding a buyer. When Kissing Coppers was auctioned on Tuesday, there was no mention of its chequered history – an omission that has left punters at the Prince Albert baffled. They recalled the day in October 2006 . when two men in a plumber’s van pulled up outside the pub and sprayed . black paint over the mural. Paul Zenon, who lives in Brighton and is a regular at the Prince Albert, said: ‘The damage was awful. The pub tried to clean off the paint but the scrubbing pretty much erased the copper on the left. ‘One night, I was going past the pub and I saw a barman called Jez touching up the damaged paintwork. 'He was repainting it. Jez did a really good job. I joked with him that he could be the next Banksy.’ Mr Zenon, who is a professional magician, said he was stunned when he heard Kissing Coppers had been sold for such a large sum. ‘It can’t be claimed to be the original. Banksy’s work might be . underneath it all, but the paint you can see was done by the fair hand . of a barman. The wall after it was tarted up by the barman Jez, among others. The work has now been sold in Miami . 'It seems incredible that it could be considered to be a genuine Banksy. ‘But I guess if you’ve got that much money to buy an airbrushed piece  of graffiti you’ve probably got more money than sense.’ The . paint attack was captured by CCTV and Peter Wheatley and Paul Biggs . pleaded guilty to criminal damage in 2006. They were given a six-month . conditional discharge. The work was eventually extracted from the wall and put on sale in a fine art auction in Miami, Florida . Kissing Coppers was sold alongside Banksy's other work""Crazy Horse Car Door"" (foreground), along with artwork by about 50 other artists . When he was planning the New York deal, landlord Chris Steward explained: ‘When Banksy put it on the pub, it belonged to the pub and, if it is sold, all the money will go back to the pub.’ Mr Steward declined to discuss the . matter this week and a spokesman for Banksy said the reclusive artist . would not be commenting on the controversy. The . Miami auction house says  in its catalogue: ‘First painted in  2004 in . Brighton, England, on the side of the Prince Albert Pub, the Kissing .

These are the Albanian gang members who set up a cocaine hotline for drug addicts, earning more than £4million from 100,000 calls in just one year. The unprecedented operation, dubbed ‘Mario Line’ by police, capitalised on the rocketing figures of users in Hertfordshire and north west London. Harrow Crown Court heard this week how the gang, led by Besnik Sinanaj - known as Mario - ran a round-the-clock service for callers desperate for the class A drug, sold at £40-£50 a gram. Besnik Sinanaj, known as Mario (top left), took 99,000 drug users' calls from his home in Falmouth, Cornwall, on the specially-made 'Mario Line'. He then relayed the order to his team of nine, including convicted suppliers Brezar Culaj (centre), Brigal Culaj (top right), Claudio Surluceanu (bottom left), and Fation Sinanaj (bottom right) Between May 2012 and May 2013 a staggering 99,000 phone calls were made to the number. But detectives investigating the ring tracked down Sinanaj, 35, at his home in Falmouth, Cornwall, in April 2013. Three weeks later, on May 8, more than 160 police officers involved in Operation Pagoda busted a string of addresses during dawn raids. Yesterday, the 10 main players were sentenced to more than 40 years in prison, with Sinanaj alone jailed for 10 years. Detective Chief Inspector Mike Trotman, of Herts Police, said: 'The Mario Line was one of the most organised and prolific drugs lines to have operated in west Hertfordshire and I am pleased that we have dismantled this and the majority of those involved in its operation are now in prison. Haul: Police seized six kilograms of cocaine from the string of houses raided at dawn on May 8, 2013. Others jailed yesterday were Reoland Sinanaj (left), Sajmir Xhakrosa (centre) and Adrian Spulber (right) 'Hertfordshire remains one of the safest counties in the country and I want to send a clear message to anyone involved in drug crimes that we will use every power available to us to build intelligence, carry out warrants and bring offenders to justice.' The 10 jailed all pleaded guilty to suppling cocaine. Alongside Sinanaj, the judge convicted Brezar Culaj, 30, and Brigal Culaj, 31, to six years eight months behind bars. Fation Sinanaj, 27, and Reoland Sinanaj, 34, were sentenced to five years and four months, while Sajmir Xhakrosa, 35, will serve four years six months in prison.

Santiago Erevia remembers the day in May 1969 when his Army unit came under heavy enemy fire in Vietnam. While crawling from one wounded solder to the next, the radio telephone operator used two M-16s and several grenades to single-handedly destroy four enemy bunkers and their occupants. Decades later, the Texas man's heroic feat earned him the Medal of Honor. 'I thought I was going to get killed when I started to advance because when you fight battles like that you don't expect to live,' Erevia told The Associated Press on Saturday. Medal of Honor recipient Santiago Erevia, is photographed on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014, at his home in San Antonio. Erevia is one of twenty-four army veterans who will receive the award following a congressionally mandated review conducted to ensure that eligible award recipients were not bypassed due to prejudice . Medal of Honor recipient Santiago Erevia is one of twenty-four army veterans who will receive the award following a congressionally mandated review . The 68-year-old retired postal worker is one of 18 Latinos whose heroic deeds earned them the Distinguished Service Cross . Erevia is one of 24 veterans who served in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to receive the U.S. military's highest honor after a congressionally mandated review of minorities who may have been passed over because of long-held prejudices. The veterans — most of Hispanic or Jewish heritage — will be recognized in a March 18 ceremony that will try to correct the long-ignored ethnic and religious discrimination in the armed forces . The 68-year-old retired postal worker is one of 18 Latinos whose heroic deeds earned them the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest award for gallantry, and whose recognition is bringing to light the long history of military service among the Latino community — despite the prejudice they faced. 'For Mexican-American and Latino veterans, it's a really high point,' Ignacio Garcia, a Vietnam veteran and Latino history professor at Brigham Young University, said. 'It highlights the notion of duty — in spite of problems, and despite limitations that people put upon the Latino community, and despite having being treated as second-class citizens.' Erevia, cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969, is one of three of the 24 veterans who will be honored who are still alive. Former Sgt. Jose Rodela, from Corpus Christi, Texas, who will receive the medal for bravery during fighting in Phuoc Long province, Vietnam, in early September 1969, also lives in San Antonio. Other medals received by Santiago Erevia following his service . The other recipient still alive is Melvin Morris, became one of the first soldiers to don a 'green beret' in 1961 and volunteered twice for deployments to Vietnam during the war. Morris endured massive enemy fire directed at him and his men — he was hit three times — but was able to a fellow commander who'd been killed and recover the body. He also retrieved a map that included strategic information that would have been trouble if it fell into enemy hands. 'Those that aren't even here to receive their medals, those are my heroes,' said Morris, who retired from the Army in 1986 as a sergeant first class. 'They gave their whole life. They gave everything. They gave it all.' Among those posthumously honored is Pfc. Leonard M. Kravitz, the uncle of musician Lenny Kravitz. 'I am grateful that my uncle is finally receiving this honor,' Kravitz said in a statement Saturday night. 'He sacrificed his life for his brothers and is a true hero. My family is extremely proud.' The Army conducted the review under a directive from Congress in the 2002 National Defense Authorization Act. The law required that the record of each Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran who received a Service Cross during or after World War II be reviewed for possible upgrade to the Medal of Honor. The Pentagon said the Army reviewed the cases of the 6,505 recipients of the Distinguished Service Cross from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam . wars and found an eligible pool of 600 soldiers who may have been Jewish or Hispanic. Of the 24, eight fought in the Vietnam War, nine in the Korean War and seven in World War II. Latinos have served in the U.S. military for generations because they see it as a chance to change their circumstances, get out of poverty or obtain an education, Garcia said. Erevia, a high school dropout, joined the Army while going through a divorce. 'I joined the Army because I had no money to go to college and I wanted a better future,' Erevia said. He eventually got his high school equivalency certificate and went to college, although he didn't earn a degree. Many Latinos who served in the military later would be the ones who fought for equal treatment, Garcia added. Albert Gonzalez, the national commander of the American GI Forum, the largest Hispanic-American veterans group, said recognizing the veterans with the Medal of Honor shows a willingness in the country to face a blemish in American history. 'It says to us that the country hasn't forgotten us even though they keep certain doors closed to us,' he said. Erevia's wife, Leticia, said her husband is glad to be recognized but has mixed feelings about the war. 'Many times when he tells me these stories, he cries,' she said. Erevia said he thinks there were people more deserving of the highest honor than him, including a soldier who carried two wounded comrades out of harm's way just minutes before he was shot in the head and killed. 'I think he deserved it more than I did,' he said. Medal of Honor recipient Santiago Erevia, is photographed on Saturday, Feb. 22, 2014, at his home in San Antonio, Texas.

A police search of the southwest Missouri home of a middle-school football coach accused in a 10-year-old girl's kidnapping and death found child pornography and more than a dozen guns, according to search warrants released Friday. Officers retrieved a three-ring binder containing pornographic photos of young children at the home of Craig Michael Wood, the documents released by Springfield police say.

The Indian husband who stabbed to death an American social worker admitted to a previous killing during a marital spat, the woman's father is now claiming. Erin Willinger, 35, a yoga teacher and psychologist from New York, was found Thursday dumped on the side of a road in Agra, India, with multiple stab wounds to her face and body. Her husband, 32-year-old Bunty Sharma, returned to their home after killing and committed suicide by blowing himself up, according to local media. Andrew Willinger claimed to ABC News his daughter fled the apartment she shared with Sharma in the city known for the famous Taj Mahal after he admitted to previously being imprisoned for killing a friend. Loss: Erin Willinger, from New York, was killed by her Indian husband in India on Thursday evening . Tragic: Willinger had only moved to Agra, India in July and met Bunty Sharma, left, whom she married in October. After killing her on Thursday, he returned to their home and blew himself up . 'He tells her this story thinking that she would understand. She was appalled and she basically left within weeks of their wedding,' said the grieving father. He also refuted local reports that they accused each other of lying about previous . marriages, saying she knew of his previous wife because she was the mother of his six-year-old son. The previous wife died of an illness, he added. The father said his daughter was romantically with Sharma, but that the marriage was more of an effort to be accepted by the community than anything else - it was also against his wishes. 'She gets the idea that getting married would both get to be part of the community and be part of the family,' Andrew Willinger told ABC. 'It led to doing something official in court against my strong objection, but she just was determined.' Willinger had visited Agra - which is about 120 miles south of New Delhi - with a group of Americans in July and chose to stay after telling the Indo-Asian News Service she wanted to help make the city worthy of 'such a beautiful monument as the Taj Mahal'. After arriving in the city, she met Sharma, a cab driver, and the pair married quickly - celebrating on a rooftop restaurant in front of the Taj Mahal. Officials records note they married on October 11. But within weeks, their marriage began to crumble and by December, they started living separately. Both accused the other of hiding previous marriages and Willinger, who went by the alias Kiran Sharma and also uses the name Erin White, accused her new husband of greed, infidelity and cruelty, the Hindustan Times initially reported. White approached the Agra Police's . Mediation Cell for Family Matters in January, asking for help and the . couple was put in touch with a counselor, who encouraged them to start . living together again, something her father says she never wanted to do. Suicide: Neighbors rushed to save Sharma after hearing an explosion in his apartment but they found his charred body (center, pixelated) after he apparently lit cooking gas to kill himself . Motive: Bundy allegedly killed her amid arguments over infidelity and lies about their previous marriages . The terrified woman recently filed divorce papers, according to her father, and had only gone to the counselor thinking it was part of the dissolution process. She had hoped to remain friends though, he said. 'As far as she told me in conversation, that was required and she never intended for it to reconcile the marriage,' Andrew Willinger told ABC. 'She hoped there could be something amicable [between them].' His daughter remained in touch with Sharma's young son, often visiting the boy to make sure he was doing well, Andrew Willinger added. The last visit appears to have come on Thursday evening, when Sharma reportedly drove Willinger to a quieter section of the city and stabbed her to death in his . taxi cab. He then is said to have tossed her body in bushes along the road, the Hindustan Times reported. The previously convicted murderer then returned home and spent his final moments locked in a second floor room. Local residents then said they heard a loud explosion and saw flames erupting from the room. When they rushed inside to rescue him, they found his charred body on the floor. Authorities believe Sharma sparked the blast by igniting gas he had released from a cooking gas cylinder in the apartment. Police soon recovered the blood-stained knife and sent the bodies for autopsies, OneIndia reported. New life: Willinger, pictured with a friend, said she wanted to stay in Agra 'as long as her body permits' The union home ministry and the American embassy in New Delhi have been informed. A State Department official confirmed Willinger's death. 'We offer our condolences to her family and loved ones on their loss,' the official told MailOnline. 'We are in contact with her family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect for the privacy of those affected, we decline further comment.' Before her death, Willinger had revealed that she was deeply in love with Indian culture and wanted to improve civic conditions in Agra. On the day she was killed, she . addressed a press conference to promote her campaign 'Agra Sunder Hai', . and several local NGOs pledged support to her. She hoped to help Agra with improving its water, plastic waste and garbage disposal. Her father told ABC that her humanitarian efforts were only just recently starting to gain momentum. 'I think the tragedy to me -- besides the personal one -- is that things were just really getting started. 'She started to see things were happening,' he added. 'She thought she was safe because she had friends in the community.' Scene: An image is believed to show Sharma's tax cab, in which he stabbed his wife before dumping her body . Investigation: Police swarm the scene where Sharma killed himself. They also recovered the murder weapon . Last . September, she spoke with the Indo-Asian News Service under the name Erin White. She revealed her desire . to stay and help the city, although she had only planned to visit to . help feed leprosy sufferers near the Taj Mahal, and even spoke of wanting to stay in Agra until '60 or maybe more - as long as the body permits'. 'This city needs a push,' she said. 'The city is dirty and no one wants to stay back here for a night. You have to teach people to be conscious of hygiene, health and sensibilities of others. You have to build trust and reach out.' She spoke of taking money from the rich to give resources to the poor, and said she hoped to get actors and other celebrities on board to help make programs more attractive. And she was confident that her idea was going to be a success. 'I am talking with so many [students, businessmen and professionals] and they all agree that the time for change has indeed come,' she said. 'You need role models. A democratic society needs inspiring heroes to move ahead. You need success stories to diffuse the clouds of negativity all around.' She sadly never got to fulfill that mission.

While machines seem to be taking over our lives, one area they could never compete is in the creative art of poetry. Or could they? A developer has created a machine-learning algorithm capable of collaborating with one of the greatest writers of all time: William Shakespeare. Machine-learning software, dubbed ‘Fluency’, analysed the style of Shakespeare's sonnets. Nathan Mathias was then able to write a new sonnet choosing words from the suggestions generated by the algorithm . When I in dreams behold thy fairest shade . Whose shade in dreams doth wake the sleeping morn . The daytime shadow of my love betray’d . Lends hideous night to dreaming’s faded form . Were painted frowns to gild mere false rebuff . Then shoulds’t my heart be patient as the sands . For nature’s smile is ornament enough . When thy gold lips unloose their drooping bands . As clouds occlude the globe’s enshrouded fears . Which can by no astron’my be assail’d . Thus, thyne appearance tears in atmospheres . No fond perceptions nor no gaze unveils . Disperse the clouds which banish light from thee . For no tears be true, until we truly see . According to Natasha Lomas at TechCrunch, SwiftKey’s machine-learning software, dubbed ‘Fluency’, was trained to learn the style of Shakespeare’s sonnets. The group’s keyboard software is usually found in Android mobiles learning the users syntax and style to help them type faster. Using word suggestions generated by the algorithm, Mr Matias was able to compose a new sonnet in the style of Shakespeare. ‘As might be expected from an artificial intelligence, the result is full of mixed metaphors,’ Mr Matias said, writing in SwiftKey’s blog. ‘But it was a fantastic start, and I couldn’t wait to try it on other famous writers.’ As well as using SwiftKey’s engine, Mr Matias also built a visual interface to help in poetry creation and named this project ‘Swift-Speare.’ Using this interface, he was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including William Gibson and John Denham. Using the Fluency algorithm, Mr Matias was able to co-create poetry in the style of various authors including William Gibson and John Denham . ‘Virginia Woolf rightly said that studied poets usually feel the presence of other writers’ words,’ said Mr Matias. ‘With Fluency, I sometimes feel as if I have a backseat driver, one who never stops giving very specific suggestions.’ Mr Matias doesn’t see anything wrong with letting machines doing the hard work in composing poetry. He says a good arrangement of words will always resonate with someone. ‘I think I’ll see a successful automated poet in my lifetime,’ Mr Matias told TechCrunch. ‘It won’t be easy: a poet is more than someone who makes poetry. Yet that doesn’t rule out algorithms,’ he said.","Machine-learning software, dubbed ‘Fluency’, analysed the bard's style .

Prince Charles’s favourite hunt will be investigated by police for rampaging through a Cotswold town – allegedly chasing a fox. Residents claim around 40 horses from the Duke of Beaufort’s Hunt chased a pack of hounds who sped through Tetbury, Gloucestershire. Shoppers said they had to jump out of the way when 15 hounds ran through quiet streets on Monday. Scroll down for video . Beaufort Hunt: Residents claim around 40 horses from the Duke of Beaufort's Hunt chased a pack of hounds through the streets (file picture) Peter Martin, 51, said a fox ran past his garden gate, pursued by dogs. He said: ‘I was on the phone looking out the window and saw a fox legging it past my gate, closely followed by a pack of hounds thundering down the road. I spoke to a lady who had seen them soon after by St Mary’s Church. They had gone all the way into town.’ He said neighbours were too frightened to report the hunt to police. ‘I spoke to a clearly frightened,  distressed woman who had seen the hunt, but she didn’t want to leave her name,’ he added. Jamie Smith, owner of Bath Bridge Barbers, said: ‘I had to get out the way. There were about 15 dogs.’ Another resident said: ‘They leapt into my garden from the field and then ran into the road. I’m surprised they didn’t get run over.’ 'Ran through the streets': Residents say the hounds chased the fox through the quiet streets of Tetbury, Gloucestershire . But members of the hunt – popular with Princes Charles, William and Harry, who were once regulars at the Boxing Day meeting – claim they were trail hunting. This means the hounds follow a scent that is dragged over a course in advance. Sue Ferguson, a hunt member, said: ‘The hounds were as good as gold and nobody looked scared of them. There was certainly no fox in the High Street and the hunt would never chase one intentionally.’ A spokesman for the Beaufort Hunt said the hounds had run loose in the village because riders were delayed by an ‘unexpected wire’. Fox hunting as a sport was banned in England in 2004. Police confirmed they were investigating.","Residents claim around 40 horses sped through Tetbury, Gloucestershire .

Former Emmerdale star Cy Chadwick has denied abusing a young boy when he was himself a teenager on the soap. The 44-year-old, who played village bad boy Nick Bates for more than 10 years, is accused of the historic sexual assault during his first few years on the show. Chadwick pleaded not guilty this morning to one charge of indecently assaulting a child between 1985 and 1988 - when he was aged 16 to 19. Accused: Chadwick arrives at Leeds Magistrates' Court today. Right: One of his final appearances on the soap . He confirmed his date of birth and address and pleaded not guilty in a short hearing before Leeds magistrates this morning, where the case was referred to the crown court. He was bailed to appear at court again later this month. Chadwick is facing one charge of indecent assault of a boy under the age of 14. The alleged offence is said to have happened in the Leeds area between September 1985, and September 1988. It is thought he was first arrested in June after attending a police station voluntarily. Chadwick joined the farm-themed ITV soap aged 15 and went on to become one of its highest earners. He was on the show through its 5,000th episode and the peak of its popularity in 1993, when it reportedly drew 18 million viewers an episode.

Star: Cy Chadwick as tearaway youth Nick Bates in a 1992 episode of the ITV soap Emmerdale . Set in a fictional village in the Yorkshire Dales, the soap launched in October 1972 as Emmerdale Farm and shortened its name in 1989. It was reportedly only due to last 13 weeks but continued when it won huge popularity. Chadwick was one of its most high-profile actors and the fourth longest-serving cast member before he left in the mid-nineties to work in TV production. His recent credits as a producer include World's Toughest Driving Tests on BBC Three, according to the film and TV website IMBD. Chadwick made headlines in 1993 when he was snatched by three men who forced him to down a drugged drink and burgled his home. He recovered in hospital, but the mystery was never solved. Chadwick's arrest is not connected with Operation Yewtree, which is investigating claims of abuse by celebrities in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. However, it is thought the publicity surrounding the case could have been one factor which prompted the alleged victim to come forward.

Veteran DJ Dave Lee Travis today said that his 'nightmare' was set to continue as it emerged that he will face a retrial over two sex charges. Earlier this month, the star was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault, but jurors were unable to reach a verdict on one charge of indecent assault and one of sexual assault. Today the Crown Prosecution Service told a court that it plans to prosecute Travis over the two remaining charges in a fresh trial. He said outside court: 'The nightmare is now going to go on. All I can say is, this whole thing started when I was 67 and I just hope it will end by the time I'm 80.' Trial: Dave Lee Travis, pictured outside court with his wife Marianne today, is set to face a retrial over one charge of indecent assault and one of sexual assault . Following a short hearing at Southwark . Crown Court, the 68-year-old was bailed until March 28, when he will return to the court. Prosecutor Miranda Moore QC told judge Anthony Leonard: 'The prosecution is seeking a retrial for two outstanding counts.' Wearing a black suit and burgundy shirt and tie, Travis was allowed to remain seated in the dock as the matter was discussed. Travis was previously accused of indecently assaulting 10 women and sexually assaulting another in alleged incidents dating back to 1976. After . more than 20 hours of deliberation, on February 13 jurors acquitted him . of 12 charges, but were not able to agree on a charge of indecent assault against a woman in the early 1990s along with an . alleged sexual assault on a journalist in 2008. Bail: Travis was told to return to the court on March 28 for the next hearing in the case . Ruling: Travis was cleared of 12 assault charges but jurors did not reach a verdict on two others . Mr Leonard told Travis today: 'You are to return to this court on the 28th March. You are re-admitted to bail as before.' Ms Moore told the court a retrial would be likely to last just over two weeks. Marianne, Travis's wife of more than 40 years, supported him from the public gallery during today's hearing. After being cleared of the 12 counts earlier this month, Travis said he had been through 'a year and a half of hell'. Speaking . outside the court moments after being found not guilty of the 12 . offences, he said the case had cost him his reputation along with so . much money that he has had to sell his house. Travis, . who went on trial under his birth name David Griffin, said: 'I don't . feel like there is a victory in any way, shape or form.' 'Hell': Travis speaking outside court on February 13 after he was found not guilty of 12 indecent assault charges . The 12 charges of which Travis was . found not guilty related to nine different women, none of whom can be . named for legal reasons. One . alleged victim told the court she was an 18-year-old clerk at the BBC . in 1976 when Travis started offering her lifts in his yellow Pontiac, . then molested her in the studio. He told the court he did not give lifts to junior members of staff around the time of the alleged incident. One . of the witnesses said that Travis attacked her during a Showaddywaddy . concert when she was just 15, saying 'I love big boobs' and flicking her . nipples. Another . alleged attack was caught on camera, the court heard, as a 17-year-old . claimed the DJ 'had a fumble' up her skirt while he was presenting Top . of the Pops in 1978. Travis . suggested that if he had been seen touching the girl, 'the book would . have been thrown at me and I would have been out of the BBC'. In . the early 1980s, he allegedly stood behind a trainee radio announcer as . she was introducing Women's Hour on Radio 4 live on air. However, . Travis said that although he and his fellow DJs were keen on practical . jokes he would never have interrupted a BBC broadcast. In court: A sketch of Travis at Southwark Crown Court during his original trial . Travis was accused of assaulting a receptionist in his room at a hotel in Bude, Cornwall, as he toured the country with Radio 1 in 1983 or 1984. Around the same time, he was alleged to have molested a student union official when he was performing at Nottingham Polytechnic University. He denied both claims when he was on the stand. The DJ was also alleged to have assaulted a British Airways worker on two occasions when he hosted corporate events for the airline in the 1990s. The woman, who was 23 at the time, said Travis singled her out on the dancefloor and made her dance the lambada with him, and claimed he became aroused as he 'grinded' against her. Asked about the BA employee's claims in court, Travis replied: 'Am I allowed to laugh? Because I’m sorry, it’s a situation which did not happen.' A former employee of Chiltern FM, which shared a building with Classic Gold when the DJ was working there, said that she confronted Travis in the newsroom, calling him a 'pervert' after he put his hand up her skirt. He insisted the claims were 'completely 100 per cent fabricated', adding that any physical contact must have come when he accidentally brushed against her during an argument.

A young woman became so anxious about the size of her breasts that she starved herself in a bid to shrink them. Leanne McKillop, 30, developed such severe body image problems that she became acutely depressed and went through a lengthy battle with anorexia. She became so ill she had to be hospitalised three times. Leanne McKillop, 30, became so anxious about the size of her 34E breasts when she was a teenager (she is pictured at the age of 18) that she starved herself in a bid to shrink them . She said: ‘I couldn’t believe how quickly my breasts grew - one minute I was very flat-chested and by the time I was 14 I was wearing a size 34E bra. I hated it. ‘Grown men wolf-whistled at me in the street and the boys at school teased me. ‘It really got to me. I stopped playing netball, which was my favourite sport, when I became embarrassed about my chest getting in the way. ‘I became extremely depressed. I thought the only solution was to shrink my body by stopping eating.’ Miss McKillop’s anxiety reached a peak when she was 14 and she attempted to take an overdose. A childhood psychologist recommended a course of antidepressants which stabilised her mood. Miss McKillop (pictured at 17) was teased at school about the size of her breasts and was wolf-whistled by adult men in the street. As a result she became depressed and stopped eating . Miss McKillop (pictured at 17) gave up netball, her favourite sport, because she was so worried about her large breasts getting in the way . However, her apparent recovery hid the fact she had secretly slashed her calorie intake. She said: ‘I stopped eating and exercised obsessively, thinking that it would shrink my chest. Of course, it didn’t work, but it allowed me to feel as if I had some control.’ At age 16, while she was working at McDonalds, a supervisor heard her being sick in the staff toilets and raised the alarm with her mother. Her doctor referred her to a psychiatrist who diagnosed anorexia nervosa. Miss McKillop (pictured in January 2007) started obsessively calorie counting and exercising and had to be hospitalised three times when she dropped to just 4st 7lbs . Ms McKillop started to recover after seeing two friends die of anorexia. She now weighs a healthy 8st (pictured) and is training to be a fitness instructor . Miss McKillop (in 2012) said: 'I took up ballet and figure skating when I was trying to recover. It all helped distract me from constantly thinking about food' She received therapy before she found a job working in PR in Tenerife which entailed a drastic lifestyle change. She said: ‘In the beach resorts I was surrounded by beautiful women, so my desire to be thin just became stronger. ‘Mum and dad were miles away, so no one was there to check I was eating properly. After a few months, I was exhausted.’ Miss McKillop was admitted to The Priory for the first time when she was 20 and weighed less than 7st. She spent seven months being treated for anorexia before being discharged when her weight went up to 8st. Miss McKillop (pictured in 2007) said: 'I stopped eating and exercised obsessively, thinking that it would shrink my chest. Of course, it didn't work, but it allowed me to feel as if I had some control' Miss McKillop (pictured at 16) said: 'I couldn't believe how quickly my breasts grew - one minute I was very flat-chested and by the time I was 14 I was wearing a size 34E bra. I hated it' But despite her progress, she relapsed almost as soon as she was released from treatment. She said: ‘I even didn’t even want to drink water because I thought it contained calories. My life revolved around exercising for five hours a day and obsessively counting calories.’ When she was 25, Miss McKillop, of Greenock, Scotland, was admitted to The Priory for a second time, weighing about 5st. She became close with another patient named Paula, who sadly lost her own battle with anorexia when she died two months after Miss McKillop was discharged. She said: ‘Paula made me laugh - even on my darkest days. With her gone, I realised I had to get better, not only for my friends and family, but for myself.’ Miss McKillop (pictured at 14) has now recovered but her kidneys are irreparably damaged and she is likely to be infertile. She also admits that she will always be worried about her weight . Leanne (pictured second from right at the age of 15) says that she is now just happy to be alive . At 26, weighing a skeletal 4st 7lb, Miss McKillop was admitted into The Priory for her third and final spell - determined to get better and gain weight. She said: ‘When I won a place to the Glasgow School of Art to study product design, I found a new focus. ‘I took up ballet and figure skating too. It all helped distract me from constantly thinking about food.’ Miss McKillop slowly recovered and, at a healthy 8st, she finally feels as if she has her anorexia under control. But with triumph has come tragedy - this year another friend from The Priory also lost her fight against the disease after her heart failed. Miss McKillop (pictured since her recovery) says she wants others to realise just how deadly anorexia can be . Miss McKillop (pictured in 2012) said: 'I still have my bad days. I'll always be anxious about my weight and my body image, but I know it's something I can fight against now' Miss McKillop, who is now training to be a fitness instructor, said: ‘I’ve already lost two friends to anorexia, and I want other sufferers to know just how deadly it can be. Anorexia can, and does, kill. ‘Thankfully I’m back on track, but my body has been irreversibly damaged. ‘I’ve got the kidneys of an elderly woman and it’s likely that I’m infertile. ‘But I’m just glad to be alive. After attending two friends’ funerals, I know better than most that not everyone is so lucky. ‘I still have my bad days. I’ll always be anxious about my weight and my body image, but I know it’s something I can fight against now.’ If you are worried that you, or someone you know, might have an eating disorder, visit www.b-eat.co.uk .","Leanne McKillop, 30, developed anorexia nervosa as a teenager .

George Osborne is backing a bid to change the name of National Insurance to ‘earnings tax’. Tory MP Ben Gummer will introduce a Bill tomorrow to rename the century-old levy on the grounds that it has become misleading. National Insurance was introduced by Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George in 1913 to pay for state pensions and other benefits. But it has been decades since National Insurance funds went solely to pay for the welfare state, leading to the charge that it has become just a hidden form of Income Tax. The Chancellor is understood to be ‘attracted to the idea’ of renaming National Insurance, having previously called for a review of whether it should simply be amalgamated with Income Tax. But Mr Osborne has not yet made that move fearing voters would be alarmed to see their headline tax rates rise. Mr Gummer said he was campaigning for the change in order to encourage transparency in the tax system. He said: ‘I am very pleased the Government is interested in the idea. 'They have been very receptive to trying to make the tax system more transparent. ‘This would be a really good step forward in making what the Government takes from taxpayers clearer and simpler. The Chancellor is understood to be 'attracted to the idea' of renaming National Insurance . ‘The most important part is changing the name so in the public mind we can begin the two as the same, which they are. This is a first step.’ The Government has previously resisted changing the name since focus groups have shown that elderly voters still believe National Insurance funds pensions and the NHS and would be horrified if it were abolished, even in name alone. National Insurance rakes in billions every year for the Treasury. Workers earning between £149 and £797 a week pay 12 per cent of that income in National Insurance. A further 2 per cent is paid on all earnings over that level. That means many taxpayers are effectively paying 2 per cent extra in income tax, raising the higher rate to 42p in the pound and the top rate to 47p. Critics say National Insurance is particularly pernicious because, unlike income tax, MPs are not allowed to vote on whether it should be levied every year. Instead they are only asked to approve level of the charge.","George Osborne backs bid to change National Insurance to 'earnings tax'

Silence: Many of Jimmy Savile's victims did not speak out because they thought they wouldn't be believed . Many victims of Jimmy Savile were ignored or even laughed at when they told friends and relatives they had been sexually abused, a report revealed today. Some were told they were 'lucky someone like Savile had paid them attention', according to findings compiled by the NSPCC. And other victims - some aged as young as eight at the time of the DJ's 'sickening crimes' - never told anyone about their suffering because they assumed they would never be believed. Many of the 26 men and women interviewed for the report have still not confided in family or friends about their experiences, the charity said. One victim said: 'Everyone found it hilarious so I eventually just stopped talking about it.' Savile's crimes came to light in a TV documentary broadcast a year after he died in October 2011, at the age of 84. The revelations about the former presenter of Top Of The Pops and Jim'll Fix It prompted hundreds of victims to come forward with claims that they were attacked. According to today's report, Would They Actually Have Believed Me?, some of the victims told hospital workers and one went to the police, but no action was ever taken. The 26 victims - chosen because they were the only ones willing to participate in the NSPCC's focus groups - were mostly children at the time of the abuse, and ranged in age between eight and 26. The NSPCC said the research, which was commissioned by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in a bid to improve the way that police deal with abuse allegations, highlighted the 'devastating scars' that victims had suffered. Some turned to drink and drugs to cope, while others have suffered mental illness or contemplated suicide. Peter Watt, the NSPCC's director of national services, said: 'The responses these victims received when they first revealed Savile's sickening crimes makes heart-rending reading. 'They were ignored, dismissed, not believed, laughed at and, astonishingly, told in some cases they should feel lucky he had paid them attention. 'Half a century on, the world finally discovered just how dreadful his crimes were - something these men and women had known all that time but felt powerless to do anything about. 'The anger, frustration and sheer helplessness of the situation obviously damaged their lives in various ways. But they showed true courage in coming forward once more to talk about their experiences and hopefully they can now start to put the terrible trauma behind them.' Abuse: Savile used his fame and reputation to attack children with impunity, a report has found . A report released last year found that a total of 450 people had claimed that they were abused by Savile, with three quarters of the alleged victims being children. Many of his attacks were carried out on BBC premises as he was presenting TV and radio programmes, with others taking place in schools or hospitals while he was supposedly carrying out charitable activities. Today's new report reveals how victims are able to recall precise details about the abuse, such as Savile's scent or the last words he said to them. Some are still suffering from the emotional trauma caused by the abuse - when Savile's sex crimes became public knowledge at the end of 2012, some victims suffered flashbacks and felt physically sick when they saw pictures of him. However, the extensive media coverage also encouraged them to come forward and report the crimes, the NSPCC said. Three-quarters of victims interviewed did not realise as children that they had been sexually abused by the late DJ, the report found. Some of those interviewed said they were aware that something wrong was happening but felt helpless, ashamed or intimidated by Savile's fame, with some believing the abuse had to be reported by an adult. 'I never thought I could go to the police on my own,' one victim said. 'Children's minds work completely differently, don't they?' Power: Some victims were told they were 'lucky' to be chosen by such a big star as Savile . Some said they had initially blamed themselves, assuming they must have done something wrong, or 'been naughty'. During . the 1960s and 1970s, many did not understand what had happened to them - . the issue of sex abuse was so hidden from mainstream society that the . victims had never even heard the word 'paedophile'. The . report said: 'Some remembered feeling that an elder - particularly a . celebrity like Jimmy Savile - must know better than they did. 'There . were also cases where participants also remembered feeling conflicted, . and wondering if they should feel flattered or grateful that he had . ""chosen them"".' A key reason for not reporting the abuse was an 'overwhelming belief' from victims that they would not have been believed at the time, the NSPCC said. 'Jimmy Savile was a powerful and influential adult, who was seen as a ""charitable, good guy"" raising a lot of money for charity,' the report said. 'This led to feelings of hopelessness and inferiority in his victims, who felt there was no way that their word would have been believed over his.' Honoured: Savile was knighted in 1990 and received a host of other honours in his lifetime . According to the report, victims had 'largely positive experiences' when they finally went to the police after Scotland Yard launched Operation Yewtree in the wake of the TV exposé about Savile. But they wanted to see improvements, including new ways to report sexual abuse and additional specialist training for officers investigating allegations. And one complained that when reporting the crime to police an officer said, 'I think I would have pushed him off,' leading to the victim once again feeling uncertain about exactly what had happened. Lawyer Liz Dux of Slater & Gordon, who represents more than 140 Savile victims, said: 'We welcome the NSPCC's report into the disgusting and horrific crimes of Jimmy Savile which many of the victims we represent helped produce. 'It is hugely significant that the victims unanimously call for professionals who work with children and the vulnerable to have an obligation to report abuse they become aware of. It is frankly shocking this is not already law. 'Mandatory reporting of abuse, as recommended in this NSPCC report, would ensure the silence that Savile and predators like him shrouded themselves in will never be allowed to happen again.' Drusilla Sharpling of HMIC said: 'I am deeply grateful to the victims who contributed to this powerful and moving report. It vividly portrays the pain and anguish suffered by Savile's victims, which was often made worse by the way they were treated. 'We owe it to them to make sure that the police service responds positively and ensures victims are supported, listened to and treated with compassion.' Crime Prevention Minister Norman Baker said: 'It is encouraging to hear . that these victims felt the response from police was largely supportive. 'While . we can never right the horrific wrongs committed against these people, . we must ensure we do all we can to protect the most vulnerable in our . society from becoming victims again in the future.'","Many victims have still not told friends and relatives that they were abused .

For years she has been subjected to cruel taunts about her appearance which she admits have caused ‘lots of tears’. Now Olympic gold medal winner Rebecca Adlington appears to have resorted to cosmetic surgery to reduce the size of her nose and remove a bump. The retired swimmer is reported to have undergone the procedure at a Harley Street clinic several weeks ago. Before and after: Miss Adlington in 2011 (left), while her nose appears straighter in this recent image (right) The Olympian - whose struggles with body image have been well documented - looked gorgeous and confident while out doing some chores . In earlier interviews, the swimmer told the Mail she looks in the mirror and thinks 'God, I'm not pretty, I've got a very big nose' It comes after she broke down during last year’s appearance on ITV’s I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, admitting that she felt conscious of her body when she compared herself to fellow contestant and beauty queen, Amy Willerton. Afterwards she told the Mail about her long running insecurities about her looks - and the hurt caused by the hateful comments about them. She said: ‘Every day I look in the mirror and go, “God, I’m not pretty, I’ve got a very big nose. That’s what most of the negative comments on Twitter are about - my nose. ‘People say, “Oh God you look like a dolphin,” or “I didn’t realise they let whales into the Olympics, but at least you should be able to swim faster with a nose like that.’ She added then that she would consider cosmetic surgery, explaining: ‘I couldn’t even float the idea of having a nose job before, because with swimming you only get two weeks a year off. Ms Adlington said she has been subjected to abuse on social media sites due to her appearance . Adlington became a national treasure following her success at the 2008 Beijing games . ‘Would I now? I’d probably have it straightened, but it’s got to suit your face.’ Adlington became a national heroine and inspiration to millions of youngsters overnight when she won her first of two gold medals at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, aged just 19. At the time, the down to earth teenager lived off just £12,000 a year, relied on her parents to pay for her swimming hats, goggles and costumes and drove to training from her then home in Mansfield in a battered Vauxhall Corsa. But the vile abuse began soon afterwards, with comedian Frankie Boyle causing outrage on BBC2’s Mock The Week when he described her as looking like someone who’s ‘looking at themselves in the back of a spoon.’ The BBC Trust called his comments ‘offensive’ and ‘humiliating’ but he mocked her appearance again before the London 2012 Olympics when he tweeted she would have an ‘unfair advantage in the swimming by possessing a dolphin’s face.’ Body conscious: Miss Adlington broke down during last year's appearance on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!, admitting that she felt conscious of her body when she compared herself to Amy Willerton . Different strokes: She retired from swimming after taking two bronze medals at the London Olympics, and now runs the Becky Adlington's SwimStars' initiative which encourages children to learn to swim . In her interview with the Mail in December, Adlington explained she always had a ‘bit of insecurity’ about the way she looked. She explained: ‘I knew I wasn’t the most attractive girl at school. ‘Even when I’ve been on a night out, no boys would want to talk to me. So those comments hurt... lots of tears.’ Adlington, who was made an OBE in 2009 for services to sport, is now engaged to swimmer Harry Needs, 21.

Nicky Hutchinson, co author of Body Image In The Primary School, said: ‘There is such pressure to look perfect and social networking sites can exacerbate that, picking over appearance details in an unkind way that might not happen face to face. ‘Children need to be told that most of the images they see are unreal. They need to think about what advertisers are trying to do. ‘Women like Rebecca Adlington and the Winter Olympic winners should provide great role models for our children- as people who have worked hard to achieve a goal and whose bodies have shown strength, dedication and skill.’","Rebecca Adlington appears to have had surgery to reduce the size of her nose and remove a bump .

A mother tried to smuggle four illegal immigrants into Britain inside a VW camper van after being told it would clear her cocaine debts. Crystal Mosley, 27, and her partner Daniel Hassard, 25, both from Marton, near Blackpool, were told their £3,000 drug debt would be cleared if they brought four foreigners into the country. The couple, who travelled to France pretending to look at campsites for family holidays, were caught boarding a ferry near Calais. Crystal Mosley and Daniel Hassard admitted people smuggling charges after Border Officials found four illegal immigrants hiding in the back of their rented VW Camper van . Border Control officials searched their rented camper van and found the illegal passengers - three from Vietnam and one from China - hiding in the back. Mosley, who was driving the vehicle, initially feigned shock telling officials: 'I didn’t know they were there.' She later admitted taking part in the scheme, saying she and Hassard had been offered up to £3,000 for the safe delivery of the group. Mosley and Hassard both from Marton, near Blackpool, Lancashire admitted people smuggling charges at Canterbury Crown Court. Mosley was given 15 months - but it was suspended for two years so she could care for her nine-year-old son. She must also abide by 7pm to 7am curfew for four months. Canterbury Crown Court were told how the couple had amassed debts  through cocaine use and were promised up to £3,000 for bringing the group in to the UK . Painter and decorator Hassard was jailed for 15 months after claiming the operation was 'his idea.' Details of the couple’s exploits emerged in court last Friday, where prosecutors told how the van was stopped by Border Patrol officers at Coquelles, France at 1.30am on August 22 last year. Mosley was driving and she said they had left the UK the previous day. She claimed the couple were looking at campsites in the country. But officers ordered the back of the van to be opened and discovered one man crouched on the floor with two more illegal immigrants hiding in a bunk bed and a fourth hiding in a corner. Mosley initially denied knowing there were passengers in the back  but later broke down and confessed - claiming she and Hassard had run up debts using cocaine. She said they owed money to dealers but both of them had lost their jobs shortly before making the trip. Mosley said they had been offered between £2,000 and £3,000 to bring in people into the country. She said they had been supplied with a rented camper van and given £200 to buy tickets and fuel for the journey. The couple pictured with Mosley's nine-year-old son.  Mother-of-one Mosely initially denied knowledge of the group, saying 'I didn't know they were there' Hassard told officers they had been promised £3,000. He said they planned to use some of the money to pay off debts, buy clothes and go on a holiday. He admitted no threats had been made to them to complete the journey. In mitigation for Hassard, defence counsel Kerry Waitt said the couple had been in a relationship for three years and Hassard was 'very much the father figure' to Mosley’s son. She added: 'Had it not been for my client and his encouragement and inveiglement, his co-accused would not be sitting in the dock next to him. 'He takes full responsibility for her position today. He is a young man who foolishly had run up debts to people who it is not comfortable to owe money to. It was made clear in graphic detail what would happen if the money was not found.' Christopher Wray, for Mosley, said the mother was now 'drug free' and had moved house to keep away from former friends involved in the drugs scene. After the case David Fairclough from Home Office Criminal Investigations said: 'Those involved in people smuggling pray on the desperation of others in order to line their own pockets and are a major factor in illegal immigration to the UK. 'This case sends a strong message to those who think they can cheat the system.' Mosley was given 15 months, suspended for two years, while Hassard was jailed for 15 months.","Crystal Mosley, 27, told debt would be cleared if she smuggled in four people .

Pension companies will have to reveal details of hidden fees which can eat away up to a third of the money you have saved for your retirement. Under new rules, all costs and charges associated with a pension will have to be made public following a probe by the Office of Fair Trading, which identified 18 separate transaction costs that fund managers are concealing from customers. The plans are set to be introduced by . Pensions Minister Steve Webb to face down a rebellion in the House of . Lords this week by former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson. Pensions minister Steve Webb (left) will amend the law after a campaign by former Tory Chancellor Lord Lawson to expose the 'massive' charges imposed by pensions firms . Ministers are expected to announce today that fund managers of defined contribution workplace pensions must reveal ‘full details’ of all their costs in future. They hope the move will create competition in the pensions market and given pension holders greater choice at a time when auto enrolment means people are put in a workplace pension unless they opt out. A senior Government source said: ‘Transaction costs are the murkiest end of the pensions business and we are determined to bring them into the full glare of the sun.’ The move is designed to give pension holders greater choice and increase competition. It is especially important as the Government is bringing in rules to enrol workers automatically in retirement schemes unless they opt out. Lord Lawson had threatened to put down an amendment to the Pensions Bill, going through the House of Lords this week, to expose the hidden charges. Ministers hope the move will create competition in the pensions market and given pension holders greater choice at a time when auto enrolment means people are put in a workplace pension unless they opt out . Lord Lawson said last month: ‘The costs are massive in this area. In a competitive market, compulsory disclosure will go a very long way towards removing the mischief.’ He pointed out that hidden charges also ramped up costs and can worsen the deficits in some pension funds. ‘It is not merely the pension fund beneficiaries who are being cheated by these excessive costs — and many of these costs are grossly excessive —the more costs are ramped up unnecessarily by the pension funds, the worse that will make the problem of deficits.’ Mr Webb is expected to give the pensions industry a year’s notice before imposing a cap on charges in April next year. The full details of what will be included in the cap, expected to be about 0.75 per cent of the pension fund, have yet to be disclosed. It is possible the cap will include transaction costs. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘The pensions industry welcomes the idea of increased transparency on charges and we have been working hard to ensure that there is meaningful disclosure. ‘We know that costs of workplace pensions coming in now are falling, but we are looking at earlier, legacy schemes to see whether anything can be done.’ A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘We’re taking action to ensure consumers have access to good quality pension schemes so they have the confidence to plan for their futures. ‘A lack of transparency around the true cost of schemes can prevent savers from having value for money. We will outline our proposals to tackle this issue shortly.’","All costs and charges imposed on pensions funds to be made public .

The head of Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel was captured overnight by U.S. and Mexican authorities at a hotel in Mazatlan, Mexico, before being presented to the media as he was escorted onto a waiting helicopter en route to a secure facility. A senior U.S. law enforcement official said Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was taken alive overnight in the beach resort town. The official was not authorized to discuss the arrest and spoke on condition of anonymity. Guzman, 56, faces multiple federal drug trafficking indictments in the U.S. and is on the Drug Enforcement Administration's most-wanted list. His drug empire stretches throughout North America and reaches as far away as Europe and Australia. His cartel has been heavily involved in the bloody drug war that has torn through parts of Mexico for the last several years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Got him: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman was arrested in an early morning raid in the resort town of Mazatlan . Drug lord: Joaquin 'El Chapa' Guzman is led into a military helicopter following his arrest early Saturday morning . Powerful: Guzman was named one of Forbes magazine's 'most powerful people in the world' 'El chapo': Guzman's nickname means 'shorty' and is in reference to his 5-foot-6 frame . Indictments: Guzman faces federal indictments in the U.S. for drug-trafficking charges .

Extradition: It's unclear when - or if - Guzman will be extradited to the U.S., where he faces federal charges over drug trafficking allegations . Known as a legendary outlaw, Mexico's Osama bin Laden and the world's most powerful and elusive drug lord, Guzman had been pursued for weeks, the official said. Guzman's capture ended a long and storied manhunt. He was rumored to live everywhere from Argentina to Guatemala since he slipped out in 2001 from prison in a laundry truck - a storied feat that fed his larger-than-life persona. Because insiders aided his escape, rumors circulated for years that he was helped and protected by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government, which vanquished some of his top rivals. In more than a decade on the run, Guzman transformed himself from a middling Mexican capo into arguably the most powerful drug trafficker in the world. His fortune has grown to more than $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine, which listed him among the 'World's Most Powerful People' and ranked him above the presidents of France and Venezuela. His Sinaloa Cartel grew bloodier and more powerful, taking over much of the lucrative trafficking routes along the U.S. border, including such prized cities as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Guzman's play for power against local cartels caused a bloodbath in Tijuana and made Juarez one of the deadliest cities in the world. In little more than a year, Mexico's biggest marijuana bust, 134 tons, and its biggest cultivation were tied to Sinaloa, as were a giant underground methamphetamine lab in western Mexico and hundreds of tons of precursor chemicals seized in Mexico and Guatemala. Most wanted: Guzman is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the 'Osama bin Laden of the drug war' Kingpin: Joaquin 'El Chapo' guzman is in custody after 13 years on the run following his escape from prison in 2001 . Notorious: Guzman is notoriously violent and has been compared to Pablo Escobar in terms of his ruthless tactics . Paradise: Guzman was arrested at a hotel in the Mexican resort city of Mazatlan, Sinaloa . His cartel's tentacles now extend as far as Australia thanks to a sophisticated, international distribution system for cocaine and methamphetamines. Guzman did all that with a $7 million bounty on his head and while evading thousands of law enforcement agents from the U.S. and other countries devoted to his capture. A U.S. federal indictment unsealed in San Diego in 1995 charges Guzman and 22 members of his organization with conspiracy to import over eight tons of cocaine and money laundering. A provisional arrest warrant was issued as a result of the indictment, according to the state department. Guzman is still celebrated in folk songs and is said to have enjoyed deep protection from humble villagers in the rugged hills of Sinaloa and Durango where he has hidden from authorities. He is also thought to have contacts inside law enforcement that helped him evade capture, including a near-miss in February 2012 in the southern Baja California resort of Cabo San Lucas just after an international meeting of foreign ministers. He was vacationing in Cabo during a visit by then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. 'There's no drug-trafficking organization in Mexico with the scope, the savvy, the operational ability, expertise and knowledge as the Sinaloa cartel,' said one former U.S. law enforcement official, who couldn't be quoted by name for security reasons. 'You've kind of lined yourself up the New York Yankees of the drug trafficking world.' More than 70,000 people have been killed in drug violence since former President Calderon deployed thousands of soldiers to drug hotspots upon taking office on Dec. 1, 2006. Many say his government's assault on drug cartels and arrest of kingpins actually fueled the growth of Sinaloa and its major rival, the Zetas, which are now going head-to-heard for lucrative territory. In custody: Mexican Navy Marines guard the entrance to the military hangar in Mexico City where Guzman is set to arrive . Security: Mexican military members secure a hangar in Mexico City as they await Guzman's arrival . Busted: Law enforcement authorities had been planning the operation that led to Guzman's arrest for five weeks . Number one: Guzman is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion and has been named public enemy number one by multiple law enforcement agencies . The two are battling for Nuevo Laredo, a play Guzman lost to the Zetas in 2005, and hitting each other deep inside their respective territories. Sinaloa took over a key Zeta port in Veracruz, while bands of Zetas have attacked their rival deep inside the cartel's home, western Sinaloa and Jalisco states. The conflict has led to the gruesome dumping of dozens of bodies by both organizations in their battlegrounds. Authorities said the battle also weakened the Sinaloa cartel and that key hits on the top leadership in Guzman's organization had shaken up his inner circle. In the first months of 2012, the Mexican army and federal police arrested a half dozen key Sinaloa people, including two major cocaine suppliers and a man described as the head of Guzman's security detail. In April last year, a video made the rounds on the Internet of a man whom U.S. authorities believed was Guzman, possibly indicating a security breach in his inner circle. In 2012, Colombian police seized 116 properties worth $15 million that they say were bought for Guzman, while the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it was placing financial sanctions on a wife and several of his sons. While his capture may have symbolic importance, many, including Guzman's cartel partner, Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, say it won't stop the violence or flow of drugs through Mexico to the United States. 'When it comes to the capos, jailed, dead or extradited - their replacements are ready,' Zambada said in an exclusive interview published in Proceso magazine in April 2010. Escape: Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry bin. Authorities believe he had inside help . Guzman's success and infamy surpassed Colombia's Pablo Escobar, who was gunned down by police in 1993 after waging a decade-long reign of terror in the South American country, killing hundreds of police, judges, journalists and politicians. Growing up poor, Guzman was drawn to the money being made by the flow of illegal drugs through his home state of Sinaloa. He joined the Guadalajara cartel, run by Mexican Godfather Miguel Angel Gallardo, and rose quickly through the ranks as a ruthless businessman and skilled networker, making key contacts with politicians and police to ensure his loads made it through without problems. After Gallardo was arrested in 1989, the gang split, and Guzman took control of Sinaloa's operations. The Sinaloa cartel violently seized lucrative drug routes from rivals and built sophisticated tunnels under the U.S. border to move its loads. In 1993, gunmen linked to the Tijuana-based Arrellano Felix cartel attempted to assassinate Guzman at the Guadalajara airport but instead killed Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo, outraging Mexicans. Police arrested Guzman weeks later before his escape from El Puente Grande prison in 2001. At the time of his escape, Guzman had been serving a 20-year sentence for bribery and criminal association in a maximum-security prison in Mexico. He was rumored to have once entered a restaurant in Culiacan, capital of Sinaloa state, where his henchmen confiscated every patron's cellphone so their boss could eat without fear of an ambush. He was also rumored to have staged an elaborate public wedding in 2007 to an 18-year-old bride that was attended by officials and local police. Federal police say they raided the town that day, but got there just a few hours too late. Guzman had long been reported to move around frequently, using private aircraft, bulletproof SUVs and even all-terrain vehicles. His location was part of Mexican folklore, with rumors circulating of him being everywhere from Guatemala to almost every corner of Mexico, especially its 'Golden Triangle,' a mountainous, marijuana-growing region straddling the northern states of Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. An archbishop in northern Durango state said in April 2009 that Guzman lived in a town nearby. Days later, investigators found the bodies of two slain army lieutenants with a note: ""Neither the government nor priests can handle El Chapo.""s.","Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman is worth an estimated $1 billion .

Angela Merkel will this week give the green light to David Cameron’s attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels. On a visit to the UK, the German chancellor will say that she wants to see a new treaty to redraw the rules of the EU – opening the door for the Prime Minister to thrash out a different deal with Brussels. Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday confirmed that Mrs Merkel is also expected to back two key planks of Mr Cameron’s renegotiation effort, demanding tighter controls over the rights of migrants to claim benefits and greater controls by national parliaments. Links: The German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet the Prime Minsiter during a state visit this week . ‘There are people in many of the Nordic countries who share these ideas,’ he said. ‘In Germany there is a strong overlap of ideas. ‘Germany also has strict benefit rules. We don’t support people moving from one country to another because of the incentives of different benefit systems, and I think with Germany we have a lot of common ground on that.’ Regulations imposed by the Lisbon Treaty will end up costing British business nearly £100billion, a report claims today. Eurosceptic pressure group Business for Britain says that rules introduced in December 2009 have already cost £12.2billion. It claims the final cost to UK business of laws that can be directly attributed to the Lisbon Treaty will amount to £96.5billion. The report, which uses government impact assessments before the regulations were introduced to calculate potential costs, finds that a law that requires car manufacturers to comply with new EU standards for emissions has cost UK businesses up to £7.4billion. Rules requiring firms to cut their greenhouse gas emissions have cost £3billion. But pro-European campaign Business for New Europe criticised the report, saying the ‘costs’ are not proven. Senior sources say Mr Cameron will treat Mrs Merkel ‘like the Queen’ when she arrives on Thursday for what is a state visit in all but name. The German leader will meet the Queen for tea at Buckingham Palace and is due to give a speech to both Houses of Parliament – an honour almost never accorded to a non-head of state. A minister told the Mail that the Government expects Mrs Merkel to say that she wants to see treaty change in the EU – which will allow Mr Cameron to seek a new relationship ahead of an in-out referendum in 2017 on whether Britain should remain in the EU. ‘We know she wants to be helpful,’ the minister said. ‘She believes there needs to be a new treaty and that’s the chance we need to put these issues on the table.’ A No 10 source added: ‘She wants Britain in. She doesn’t want to be stuck in an embrace of economic death with [French president] Francois Hollande.’ Mr Hague told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘This is a different sort of visit from the French visit [by Mr Hollande] at the end of January. Germany is our most important partner on seeking reform in the EU.’ The diplomatic offensive is also designed to stitch up a deal to ensure the next president of the European Commission, who will replace Jose Manuel Barroso later this year, is someone who is prepared to see Britain get powers back.

Justice Secretary: Chris Grayling said new laws would stop serial offenders who think they can put up 'two fingers to the system' Criminals who repeatedly flout the law after getting out of jail will be forced to serve their full sentence behind bars, Chris Grayling said today. A loophole in the rules means the vast majority of offenders who break the terms of their early release get just 28 days back inside before they are let out again. The loophole applies even if they breach their licence conditions again and again. But in a new toughening of release rules from the Justice Secretary, repeat offenders will face remaining in jail until the end of their original sentence. Last night Mr Grayling told the Mail it would stop serial offenders who think they can put up ‘two fingers to the system’. He said: ‘Like the rest of the public, I’m fed up with offenders who think they can just put two fingers to the system and act like it doesn’t apply to them. It does. ‘That’s why we are closing the loophole for those who just think they can just time and again flout their licence conditions and get away with it. ‘Offenders need to understand that there are tough consequences for poor behaviour - that’s part of how we can tackle reoffending to make sure communities are safer, and that there fewer victims of crime.’ The change will mean a group of serial offenders serving, on average, an additional eight months behind bars before they are released. The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point. These conditions can include wearing a tag, not returning to places where they commit crimes, or staying away from victims. At the moment, the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence regardless of how many times they have broken the rules. They can only be kept inside for longer if they present a ‘high risk’ of causing serious harm to the public. Reduced: At the moment, the vast majority spend just 28 days in prison for breaches of their licence . But when the new law comes in to force, offenders who are ‘non-compliant’ will stay in jail until the Parole Board says they can be trusted not to break the rules. If the Board decides they will still break the rules, they will stay inside until the end of their jail term. The new rules are among a series of changes to be debated by MPs today as the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill returns to Parliament. The flagship Bill also includes longer sentences for perverts caught with sickening pornographic videos depicting rape and a new ‘tax’ on criminals to make them pay for the costs of the courts. Another central pledge is to end the scandal of police officers doling out repeat cautions to thousands of criminals. Progress: The new law affects criminals who persistently break the conditions of their licence after getting released from prison, usually at the half way point . Every year nearly 10,000 criminals get a caution for the same offence they committed within the previous two years. But a ban on repeat cautions will mean serial offenders hauled before the courts for every new offence. It is expected that around 14,000 fewer cautions will be issued each year.","Loophole means some offenders who break terms get 28 days back inside .

A major UK insurance society claims it was able to access records of 47 million patients over 13 years to help it decide premiums for customers. The Staple Inn Actuarial Society said in a report that it used NHS data covering all hospital in-patient stays between  1997 and 2010 to track the medical histories of patients, identified by date of birth and postcode. Concerns over use of patient data have been heightened after plans to roll out a new NHS data-sharing scheme were put on hold amid concerns over privacy and patients not being properly informed over the changes . The group – which works on behalf of insurance companies and actuaries – used the information to recommend an increase in the price of policies for  thousands of customers last year. Concerns over use of patient data have been heightened in recent days after plans to roll out a new NHS data-sharing scheme were put on hold amid concerns over privacy and patients not being  properly informed over the changes. The central database would involve taking records from GP practices and linking them with hospital records. Those promoting the scheme insist that it would be illegal for information held in GP records to be sold to insurers. The Staple Inn Actuarial Society report said it was able to combine hospital patient data with credit ratings agencies to advise companies, which led to increased premiums for most customers over the age of 50. The society said it was able to better calculate forecasts for certain diseases, such as lung cancer. GPs and privacy campaigners have strongly opposed the £50million scheme, claiming it would lead to patient data being misused . Phil Booth, from privacy campaign group medConfidential, told The Telegraph: ‘The language in the document is extraordinary; this isn’t about patients, this is about exploiting a market. ‘Of course any commercial organisation will focus on making a profit – the question is why is the NHS prepared to hand this data over?’ He added: ‘We have been categorically told that it would be illegal for GP data to be handed over to insurers, yet already all this hospital data has been extracted. It blows out of the water the idea that patients’ privacy is being protected.’ However, the new body in charge of NHS patient data said hospital episode statistics (HES) have not been used to analyse individual insurance premiums, but more generally, to analyse conditions among certain age groups. A spokesman from the Health and Social Care Information Centre said the data did not identify individuals. ‘The newly formed HSCIC can now only provide HES data to organisations that are looking to improve the way they are run for the benefit of their patients,’ she said. ‘This data is completely protected and does not identify individuals.’ Last week Tim Kelsey, director for patients and information at NHS England, said it will be ‘a criminal offence’ for any information entered into the new giant database, which will combine GP and hospital records, to be sold for insurance purposes. However, a database which contains only hospital records remains a separate entity, with its own rules allowing greater access to third parties. GPs and privacy campaigners have strongly opposed the £50million scheme, claiming it would lead to patient data being misused. Last week officials announced the data-sharing plan would be delayed by six months to ensure that members of the public were first made aware what their details will be used for and how they can opt out.","The Staple Inn Actuarial Society said in a .

Baroness Deech (pictured) said career women need a pre-nup law to help them protect their earnings from predatory men . Career women need a pre-nup law to help them protect their earnings from predatory men, an influential lawyer said yesterday. A law to allow couples to settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding would stop men marrying successful women and then running off with a large share of their wealth, Baroness Deech said. The call from the prominent family lawyer and pro-marriage campaigner came five days before Government advisers publish their own plans for a pre-nup law. However, any plans for marriage reform from the Law Commission could not become law before the 2015 election. Lady Deech said she intends to bring a pre-nup Bill into the Lords this week with the aim of getting a law before the election. Her intervention comes at a time of intensifying debate between supporters of a pre-nup law, which they say would stop gold-diggers and allow a couple to control their own break-up, and opponents who say that a pre-nup law would dangerously undermine the role of marriage as a lifelong partnership. Lady Deech said on Radio 4’s Sunday Programme: ‘Lots of young women these days are working, earning well, and would feel it extremely unfair if a young man who they marry and perhaps leaves them is going to take with him a sizeable chunk of what they have worked so hard for. ‘The position of women has changed in the last 40 years and it’s time to recognise that in this country, like virtually every country in the world, two people who are getting married ought to be able, if they want, to make a contract about how their assets are to be divided if they divorce.’ She said the institution of marriage has been so damaged already by easy divorce that pre-nups could do no more harm. ‘The law is very odd,’ she said. According to the Baroness, a law to allow couples to settle the terms of their divorce before their wedding would stop men marrying successful women and then running off with a large share of their wealth . ‘It takes no account of fault whatsoever. 'So . an awful lot of people end up having to give up homes, children and . pensions feeling, rightly or wrongly, that they are innocent and the . other one is guilty. ‘The . law is in a sad, sad way, but it’s too late – divorce is very prevalent . and I do think that pre-nups might make people think very carefully . about how dreadful it might be to end it. ‘Secondly it would save them so much money, so much hostility and bitterness, if unfortunately it does come to an end.’ But the Roman Catholic Bishop of Shrewsbury, the Right Reverend Mark Davies, told the programme: ‘My concern is the message that this is likely to be sending to a diminishing number of couples who are seeking the life-long commitment to marriage when we are asking them to prepare their divorce settlement before they have even married.’ Proposals drawn up by the Law Commission are likely to contain proposals for a new pre-nup law. Ministers have, however, indicated that there is no chance of legislation before the election. English courts have traditionally ignored pre-nup agreements and instead tried to divide a couples’ assets on merit. But the practice was undermined in 2010 when Supreme Court judges ruled that German heiress Katrin Radmacher should keep her £100million fortune after her divorce in accordance with the terms of her pre-nup.","Baroness Deech said women need a pre-nup law to protect their earnings .

Soldier Danny Hague, 32, who was sat in the passenger seat at the time, also died at the scene, as did the driver. An inquest in Bradford, West Yorkshire, heard just days before the accident, Miss Best had celebrated her 19th birthday. She had been given the all clear from cancer just a month before. Tragic: Cancer survivor Jade Best (right), who was killed in fatal car crash in Bradford. She is pictured here with her mother Karen . The teenager was described after her death as 'a strong character who got over her cancer', which she had received chemotherapy treatment for. Following the crash on the evening of September 16 last year, her parents said in a statement: 'Jade was a happy-go-lucky person and had a lovely outgoing personality that meant she embraced life to its fullest. 'She had recently been given the all-clear following a cancer diagnosis and had so much life left to live. We are devastated by her death and that she has been taken from us in such tragic circumstances.' The inquest on Friday heard the black Mitsubishi Evolution car was travelling at around 115mph in a 30mph zone when the driver lost control and narrowly missed another car before crashing. The car was travelling towards Bradford after the trio had been drinking in The Royal pub in the nearby village of Denholme. The inquest heard how one onlooker described the crash as being 'like an explosion'.

Police have been forced to patrol a beach to warn off treasure hunters after a shipping container stuffed with a million cigarettes washed up on the Devon coast. The 40-foot box - which contains 14 tonnes of cigarettes - was washed off of a tanker along with 516 others during a fierce storm in the Bay of Biscay earlier this month. It is thought the Danish container which landed at Seaton, Devon, could be the first of many to wash up on the Lyme Bay coast in the coming days. Landfall: The container washed up in Seaton, Devon, this morning . Cargo: The errant container spilled its contents onto the pebbly beach . The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is arranging recovery of the Maersk container which landed in the early hours of this morning, but have been delayed by the high tide. Police officers who have cordoned off the beach issued a stern warning to anyone hoping to pick up any free loot. A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'It was reported by a member of the public at 8.10am this morning and officers are on scene to make sure no one puts themselves at risk to recover anything. 'The contents belong initially to the original owner of the container, and then to the official Receiver of Wrecks, so anyone taking anything that washes ashore, even one packet of cigarettes, is effectively committing theft and will be prosecuted. 'So the message to anyone intending to go down there looking for free fags is don't bother.' Warning: Police have told potential looters to stay away . Hands off: Police reminded locals that the cargo belongs to the shipping company first, and second to the official Receive of Wrecks . The 1998-built ship was reportedly heading from Rotterdam to Sri Lanka when the containers toppled into the sea after it was caught in a fierce storm on February 14. The containers tipped out of the ship, which was pitching at 40 degrees in the storm, and spilled out into the sea - the biggest loss of cargo ever for the company. The police spokesman added: 'We're told most of them would have sunk or washed up in France, but this was one that bobbed its way all the way to here,' said the police spokesman. Elsewhere in the county a large fossil was among debris washed up as a result of the recent storms. The football-sized fossil was discovered among items washed up on Chesil Beach near Weymouth, Dorset. It is thought the fossil could be an ammonite, a type of marine mollusc which died out 66 million years ago. The piece of history is just one in a succession of marvels unearthed along the country's coast by this winter’s devastating storms and floods. It comes after a stash of unexploded bombs has been revealed along the South West coast and in parts of Wales. The storms that have ravaged and reshaped parts of the British coastline have led to the discovery of wartime shells long-buried on beaches. Remnants: Ammunition has been unearthed by the terrible weather that battered Britain's coasts . There are also fears that flooding along the Thames will erode riverbanks, leading to the discovery of bombs dropped on the area by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War. Police say that high tides and huge waves have either exposed devices or brought them closer to the surface. Further storms and flooding are expected as a new front moves in from the Atlantic. The Met Office has issued three severe rain warnings and gusts of wind are expected to reach 70mph. The Environment Agency also still has 48 severe flood warnings issued across the UK following what the Met Office has described as the wettest winter on record. Now walkers are being urged not to touch unidentified metal objects but to alert police to their finds instead. In South West England and West Wales, which bore the brunt of the storms, six devices have been handled by bomb disposal units in six weeks. The Navy’s Southern Diving Group said it had received a 20 per cent increase in reports of unexploded bombs since January. A 100lb Mk XIX Second World War . British anti-submarine mine was found by surfers at Watwick Bay, . Haverfordwest, while a rare First World War German mine surfaced on a . beach near the popular Cornish resort of Newquay.

A shell at Minehead, Somerset – close to a former naval firing range – was also made safe. Meanwhile a mortar was discovered on a beach at Hemsby, Great Yarmouth. ‘Ferocious seas and weather are thought to be responsible,’ said Sergeant Lee Henderson of Devon and Cornwall Police. ‘There is also the potential for further bad weather to unearth more devices. ‘The bombs may still be very dangerous and people should not touch them but call police officers immediately.’ Other glimpses of wartime Britain have been uncovered at Woolacombe, North Devon, one of the key training beaches for the D-Day landings.

Gone without a trace: Former abattoir worker Andy Albury has confessed to 14 unsolved deaths along the Flinders Highway, including hitchhiker Tony Jones (pictured) A former abattoir worker dubbed Australia’s Hannibal Lecter has been named as the prime suspect for as many as 14 unsolved murders, with at least 11 of them young people who disappeared along an 800km outback highway. Andy Albury, already serving a life sentence for the 1983 murder of an Aboriginal woman in Darwin, has allegedly confessed in prison to a killing spree along Queensland’s desolate Flinders Highway during 1970 and 1982. At least 11 people disappeared from that stretch of road during that time period – including hitchhiker Tony Jones, whose family last week said they believed an outback ‘thrill killer’ was responsible for his death. Jones vanished without a trace on the night of November 3, 1982 while walking along the Flinders Highway – last seen in Anthill Creek, known as Townsville’s killing fields, about 26km out of town. He was the last to go missing on that stretch of road. Queensland Police reopened the 32-year investigation last week after Albury’s confession, which led detectives to the abattoir where he used to work in outback Hughenden, 1400km north-west of Brisbane. Stewart Christensen, who now owns the abattoir, said someone could have easily been killed, chopped up and fed to the pigs without anyone noticing. “You’d never find a body or DNA,” he told the Times. “There are old pits full of bones all over that ridge line.” The now-retired Northern Territory police officer, Sergeant Les Chapman, who arrested Albury for killing Gloria Pindan in 1983 – the one murder for which he has been convicted – said he had confessed to killing 14 others. Albury was convicted of using a broken bottle to mutilate and murder Ms Pindan – cutting off her breasts and gouging out her eyes after killing her. He was sentenced to life in jail in 1984. In 2004, he said told the Supreme Court via video link from Darwin’s Berrimah jail he had ‘no interest’ in parole. More... How many has she killed?

A psychiatric assessment found he suffered a mental disorder causing him to have ‘a casual disregard for the act of killing’. The report also stated: ‘Albury is an extremely dangerous man. He has a fantasy about terrorising a town by committing casual, motiveless murder for the purpose of making people frightened that they may be the next to be killed.’ The alleged confession could finally bring about some closure to the families of at least 11 other who disappeared from the Flinders Highway, also known as the ‘highway of death’. Highway of death: At least 12 people vanished without a trace from the Flinders Highway, an 800km stretch of road that links Queensland to the Northern Territory . The body of Catherine Graham, 18, was found raped and slain on the highway in 2007. In October 1978, Karen Edwards, Gordon Twaddle and Timothy Thompson were found shot in the head near Mt Isa, about 250km west of Julia Creek. Hitchhikers Robin Hoinville-Bartram, 18, and Anita Cunningham, 19, also disappeared along the Flinders Highway several decades ago. Robin was shot twice in the head and her skeletal remains were found west of Charters Towers in July 1972. Anita was listed as missing but police believe she was killed with her friend. Police also found the bodies of Mackay sisters Judith, 7, and five-year-old Susan along the highway. Both were found to have been sexually abused. Outback murders in Australia were arguably made infamous by road worker, Ivan Milat, who killed seven young backpackers he picked up on highways south of Sydney in the 1990s, including two young British women.

A premature baby boy died when a nurse removed him from a ventilator without his parents' permission while he was receiving treatment at a scandal-hit hospital trust. Rohan Rhodes was born 14 weeks prematurely at Singleton . Hospital in Swansea in August 2012. Although he was very premature, he . got through the critical first few weeks and was doing well in the hospital's neo-natal intensive care unit. Rohan Rhodes, who was born 14 weeks early, pictured on a life support system in hospital. His parents allege he was taken off a ventilator without their permission while at St Michael's Hospital . The tiny baby had to have a heart operation and so was moved to the hospital - which is in the same trust as the scandal hit Bristol Children's Hospital . However, . a heart duct which usually closes at birth remained open. Doctors said . he needed to go to Bristol, which has a specialist children's heart . surgery centre, for an operation. Five weeks after birth he was transferred to St Michael's Hospital - which is in the same trust as Bristol Children's Hospital. As he was so premature, he needed a ventilator to help fill his lungs with oxygen. Rohan's parents allege a nurse practitioner looking after their son - who had no authority to withdraw the life-supporting device - turned off the ventilator. After being taken off the ventilator . Rohan developed necrotising enterocolitis - or NEC. This potentially . fatal condition is common in premature babies, especially those with the . heart problems. Rohan had a series of cardiac arrests and tragically died the following day. After the child was taken off the ventilator, the boy suffered two cardiac arrests and tragically died . Parents Alex Rhodes and Bronwyn Vincent (pictured) now await the results of an inquest into the circumstances surrounding their son's death . It is understood the nurse who took . Rohan off his ventilator received further training following her action - . but remains working at the hospital. She . has not been disciplined or reported to the Nursing and Midwifery . Council which has the power to hold a hearing and remove her from the . nursing register, it is thought. A Bristol inquest will hear on Monday the circumstances that led to Rohan's death. The hospital where he died is part of the same trust as Bristol Children Hospital - where the deaths of child heart surgery patients are to be the subject of an independent review, NHS Medical Director, Sir Bruce Keogh, said last week. This week the case of Lacey Marie Poton, four months, who died of a . cardiac arrest shortly after she was discharged from the hospital emerged. It . is alleged she also received poor care from South Western Ambulance Service. Rohan's parents Alex Rhodes and Bronwyn Vincent, who live in Narberth, Pembrokeshire, Wales, returned from a rest break to find their son had been taken off the device. They said: 'We have no idea why the nurse did what she did - but we are convinced it cost our son his life. 'Nurses can only take a baby off a ventilator under a doctor's direction and we know there wasn't a doctor's decision to do this.' Before he could be put back on the machine he suffered a cardiac arrest. Rohan was resuscitated by intensive care medics - but suffered a second heart attack the next day and lost his fight for life. Rohan's coffin - which was made by his dad using wood intended to make his first cot . The Bristol Royal Children's Hospital - which is part of the same trust as St Michael's where Rohan died . Ms Vincent said: 'Our little boy was doing so well. We are still trying to understand why this nurse did what she did. She had no authority. What she did is inexcusable. I was in tears. 'The doctors said he wasn't ready to come of the ventilator and he was going to stay on it until he had his operation.' 'Rowan was very premature at 25 weeks, but his lungs were holding up well. 'He needed a relatively safe operation to close a heart duct that should normally shut at birth. That would have helped his breathing improve. 'When we arrived at St Michael's his life wasn't in danger even though he was in intensive care. 'We were told his prospects of coming off the ventilator were good following the heart surgery. 'We have no idea why the nurse did what she did - but we are convinced it cost our son his life. 'Nurses can only take a baby off a ventilator under a doctor's direction and we know there wasn't a doctor's decision to do this.' Parents Emma Norley and Jhonny Poton - whose daughter Lacey Marie died after being discharged from the hospital . The child's parents also accuse South Western Ambulance Service of delivering poor care and not doing proper medical checks when she was in cardiac arrest . After being taken off the ventilator Rohan developed NEC. The couple believe the lack off oxygen when he was taken off the ventilator triggered the condition. Ms Vincent, 34, who works as a vet, alleges Rohan was left in 'agonising pain' from the condition until doctors finally gave him pain relief in his final hours. She said: 'The end was terrible. His gut burst, he had peritonitis and blood poisoning and his heart just couldn't cope. Mr Rhodes, a 37-year-old blacksmith, said: 'We have had no explanation for this nurse's actions. 'The doctors had agreed that he should stay on ventilation right up until he had his surgery. They didn't want to alter anything as he was doing so well.' Rohan was the couple's only child and is buried in his mother's native Irish Republic. She said:'Our little boy's coffin was made in the shape of a boat. It was handmade by Alex using the wood he had bought to build him his first cot. The reason it is a rowing boat is because we nick named him Ro Ro and used to sing Row, row, row your boat to him everyday.' The family's Laurence Vick, of Michelmores Solicitors in Exeter, said: 'There is likely to be legal action action over Rohan's death following his inquest.' Robert Woolley, Chief Executive of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the Rhodes family for the loss of their son, Rohan. 'The coroner will conduct a thorough and independent inquiry into the death of this child and we are committed to working with her to provide all the information she needs to do this. 'It would not be appropriate for us to comment further until the inquest has concluded.' A high level investigation is to be carried out the the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children - the same trust as St Michael's Hospital - follow numerous allegations of poor care and neglect. Another case was that of four-month-old Lacey Maruie Poton - one of several children to die following surgery at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children. She suffered cardiac arrest after being discharged from the facility. It is now alleged the child received poor treatment at the hands of the South Western Ambulance Service - one of the largest in the country. An internal report released today lists a series of mistakes made by the service - including the incident not being treated as an emergency and crew failing to take a proper medical history of the child in to account.","Rohan Rhodes was born 14 weeks premature and needed heart surgery .

The Queen's London residence is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country, figures reveal today. Traffic traveling along the A302 - known as Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to Buckingham Palace, produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012, data shows. Figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs show the average level of the gas - produced mainly from diesel engine traffic fumes - was 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air. Buckingham Palace is exposed to the highest levels of air pollution in the country, data shows . Traffic along Grosvenor Place - which runs adjacent to the Palace - produced the highest levels of toxic gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in 2012 at 152 micrograms per cubic metres of air . The figure is almost four times the European legal limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. Lower Grosvenor Place, another road close to the Palace, registered as 109 micrograms per cubic metre. Other highly polluted areas include Oxford Street near Marble Arch, which registered at 150 micrograms and Cockspur Street near Trafalgar Square on 138 micrograms. The fourth and fifth locations were Park Lane and Knightsbridge - which measured 135 and 134 micrograms respectively. Roads near other top London tourist attractions such as Madam Tussauds, Hamleys Toy Shop and  Covent Garden also featured on the list of 50 worst offenders - ALL of which were in London. The road running next to the Queen's London residence was the worst offender on a list of 50 locations provided by Defra. The European legal limit is 40 micrograms per cubic metre . A graphic showing the five locations with the highest levels of NO2 in the country, all in London - measured in micrograms per cubic metre of air . Outside London, Manchester Piccadilly scored 68, Belfast City Centre 63 and Nottingham City Centre 59 micrograms per cubic metre. Almost 30,000 people die every year due to respiratory problems caused by air pollution. Nitrogen dioxide in particular has been linked to breathing issues. Today environmental groups criticised the statistics. Simon Birkett, Founder and Director of Clean Air in London, said: 'These levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are nothing short of staggering. 'The World Health Organisation guideline is no human exposure in a single hour over 200 micrograms per cubic metre (with an annual average guideline of 40). Oxford Street near Trafalgar Square measured 150 micrograms per cubic metre . 'The thought that hundreds of thousands or millions of tourists and Londoners in a year may be exposed to air pollution this high is deeply troubling. 'In London, we need the Mayor to: ban the oldest cars emitting carcinogenic diesel exhaust as Berlin did more than four years ago, remove the turning circle requirement that still forces cabbies to choose between two large diesel taxis if they want a new vehicle and reinstate Phase 5 of the low emission zone that was a key commitment in the Mayor’s Air Quality Strategy until scrapped early last year. 'He also needs to ensure his ultra-low emission zone for 2020 includes the roads with the highest NO2 rather than excluding them which will force the most-polluting vehicles to join those avoiding the congestion charging zone and issue smog warnings to save lives, avoid hospitalisations and build public understanding of air pollution. Cockspur Street had the third highest levels of N02 at 138 micrograms . 'In short, ‘invisible’ air pollution is where smoking was 30 years ago in terms of the known health risks and the lack of public awareness.  People need Prince Charles to champion action to comply with air pollution laws in London and elsewhere.' The UK faces fines of up to £300m from the European commission after they launched legal action due to a failure to reduce high levels of NO2 air pollution from traffic. The commission said this was despite over a decade of warnings and several extensions and postponements given to the British government. Other European countries have also failed to meet the air quality directive, the commission said. A Defra spokesman said: 'Air quality has improved significantly in recent decades. Just like for other Member States, meeting the NO2 limit values alongside busy roads has been a challenge. 'That is why we are investing heavily in transport measures to improve air quality around busy roads and we are working with the Commission to ensure this happens as soon as possible.' Park Lane had 135 micrograms per cubic metre. The data follows the news the European Commission is to take legal action against the UK for its failure to lower levels of the toxic gas . Knightsbridge measured 134 micrograms. Environmental groups have today slammed the data, saying the findings are 'nothing short of staggering' The highlighted that the UK meets the EU air quality limit values for all other air pollutants. Responding to the latest figures, a spokesman for Boris Johnson said: London’s air quality is steadily improving, meeting legal limits for eight out of nine EU regulated pollutants. 'Since the Mayor was elected NO2 emissions have reduced by 20 per cent and the number of people living in areas exceeding NO2 limits has halved but he fully recognises the need to take further action. 'This includes the introduction of the world's first Ultra-Low Emission Zone in central London from 2020, tougher requirements for taxis from 2018 and a £20million fund to tackle local problem areas. 'These most ambitious measures will deliver enormous economic and environmental benefits for central London and will make this global city an even better place to live, work and visit.'","Grosvenor Place, next to Buckingham Palace, the most polluted road in UK .

On his way back Mr Collins passed a group of five young men, one of whom claimed he had bumped into him. He apologised and walked on but was told by the 15-year-old, 'you can't just walk away'. Lloyd then joined his friend, and as Mr turned to walk away he felt a 'tremendous pain to the right side of his face.' Mr Webster said: 'Christopher was utterly helpless.' Newport Magistrates Court heard last month that Lloyd had consumed 15 cans of lager as wekk as vodka and cocaine before the assault while the 15-year-old had drunk seven bottles of lager, taken cocaine and smoked cannabis. After the attack, the group of yobs, including the two attackers went on to another party. Mr Collins managed to ring his wife Jayne, 44, who dialled 999, and the pair were taken in the back of a police car straight to the Royal Gwent Hospital. Sportsman: Mr Collins, pictured before he was attacked, had represented Wales in archery . Mrs Collins said: 'There was blood coming through his nose, his eye socket, there was so much blood. When they said they were going to do a CT scan I didn't think he would come home.' The couple were initially told Mr Collins' eye might be saved, but despite being able to see light, he agreed for it to be removed to prevent problems spreading to his left eye. He said: 'One of the hardest things I've ever done is sign that consent form.' On January 7 his nose was reset and face rebuilt using four titanium plates, followed by an operation two days later to remove the eye and replace it with a prosthetic one. Mr Collins is now waiting for a permanent prosthetic eye to be sculpted and fitted. He said: 'It will help my confidence. I hope to return to work and learn to shoot an arrow left-handed, and using my remaining left eye.' Speaking adjusting to his injury, Mr Collins said: 'Everything takes a while and things I found very easy before are now totally different. I need more light, my left eye gets tired quickly. Shaving is now one of the hardest things in the world.' Speaking after Lloyd's sentencing, on Friday, Mr Collins said three years imprisonment was 'a kick in the guts'. 'Let down': Mr Collins said that the sentences given to his attackers felt like 'a kick in the guts' to him . 'I believe the judge was very unhappy with the Crown Prosecution Service because if they had brought more serious charges it could have been a longer sentence.' 'I don't think anything would ever have been enough but in 18 months he'll be out on licence. Mr Collins described the 15-year-old's six-month referral order as 'unbelievable' and said he felt 'incredibly let down by the sentence'. Judge Thomas Crowther called the charge of wounding 'unbelievable' and criticised the Crown Prosecution Service for limiting his sentencing powers. Judge Crowther said: 'You inflicted grievous bodily harm and it is on that basis you will be sentenced. 'You accepted you had a very hard punch - it seems to be a matter of pride to you. You are a danger to the public and people who you may chance upon. 'The harm was serious. As to culpability, you were a member of a gang and the victim was outnumbered. You used your fist on a man who was walking away and unable to defend himself. There is no one to blame in this case but you.' The court heard how Lloyd, who has a previous conviction for violent assault, had handed himself in to the police on January 8 after seeing a post on Facebook detailing the attack on Christopher. Meirion Davies, mitigating, said: 'He is clearly a man who is profoundly remorseful'. Lloyd's early guilty plea was given full credit and he was sentenced to three years, half of which will be served in custody and the other half on release on license.","Christopher Collins, 54, was savagely attacked by two teenagers .

Two boys were crushed to death today when a giant boulder destroyed the Alpine ski chalet in which they were sleeping. The horrific accident took place this morning just before 5am close to the British-built resort of Isola 2000, in southern France. ‘It happened in a chalet on the outskirts of the village,’ said Jean-Marie Bogini, the mayor of the village of Isola. ‘There was a landslide. There were seven people in the house – five adults and two children.’ Deaths: The two children were killed after a boulder flattened this chalet in Isola 2000 . Search: Firefighters were hunting through the wreckage last night after a large boulder bounced down the mountainside . Rubble: The boulder tore through what was once a three-storey building made from wood and stone . Incident: The ski resort of Isola is in southern France, 70 miles from coastal Nice . Mr Bogini said the some members of the two families in the chalet managed to escape, but the youngsters, aged seven and 10, could not get out. None of the victims have yet been identified. Three adults pulled themselves out of the collapsed chalet while two others had to be dug out. The bodies of the boys, one from each family, were found by sniffer dogs some two hours later, and then removed. Chilling pictures from the scene showed the three-storey building reduced to a pile of rubble. Local emergency staff were scrambled to the scene after a boulder, 32ft high and 16ft wide, was dislodged from the cliff above. Jean-Daniel Montet-Jourdran, of the Alpes-Maritimes prefecture, said the boulder was ‘enormous and weighed several tonnes’. He said a geologist was at the scene, and other potential lethal rocks were being removed. Mr Montet-Jourdran added that a criminal enquiry had been opened into the disaster, with gendarmes from nearby Saint-Etienne-de-Tinée involved. Gendarme commander Gael Marchand said: ‘Three of the survivors managed to get out of the rubble alone, while the remaining two had to be freed by the emergency service.’ Mr Marchand said the boulder first crashed on to a road, and then bounced down towards the wooden and stone chalet. It was part of a landslide which left the village of Isola ‘cut in half’, said Mr Marchand, who added: ‘One possible reason for the landslide is that the cliff was in a very fragile state due to a long period of heavy rain, followed by a thaw.’ Those who escaped were rushed to St Roch hospital in the coastal city of Nice, some 70 miles away. There . they were treated for minor injuries and shock, and counsellors were . also helping them deal with the horror of what happened. Destruction: The rockslide came to a halt further down the mountain . Disaster: Survivors of the incident were taken to hospital in Nice, 70 miles away . Search: Rescue workers were still at work today . Today police and gendarmes were surrounding the scene of the disaster, after shutting all nearby roads. Isola 2000 was founded by British Olympic skier and former Army officer Peter Boumphrey in the early 1970s. The resort is in a basin the southern French Alps, which the local authorities allowed Mr Boumphrey and London-based contractors to develop. There were always huge concerns about rock falls, however, with the village of Isola and the roads leading up to it particularly at risk. In 2009 Isola 2000 was completely blocked off when three avalanches fell on roads leading up to it. Hundreds of Britons were among those trapped. And two weeks ago, two women died when a boulder hit a Nice-Digne train as it travelled past Isola.","The boys, aged seven and 10, were killed by a boulder at 5am today .

For the vast majority of us, however, the sound of the alarm presents more of a challenge – and a survey has revealed the drastic measures we have to take to ensure we crawl out from under the covers in time to catch our train or bus. The poll found one in three workers finds getting up so difficult that they put their alarm clock on the other side of the room to force them out of bed. Almost one in ten workers has been sacked or warned about being late because of missing their alarm . And the survey for breakfast cereal firm Fuel Your 10K Hours found that a similar number choose a loud, piercing noise for their alarm to startle themselves into action, and one in 10 set an 'annoying' song to start their day. Nevertheless, the average Briton still snoozes for 14 minutes after their alarm goes off at 6:58am. Almost one in ten workers has been sacked or given a written warning for being late after sleeping in. Around 1,000 adults were questioned by the company about their sleeping and waking habits. More than 30 per cent set at least five alarms to rouse them from their slumber. The report shows people are struggling to cope with the national average of just six hours and 36 minutes sleep per night - much less than the recommended eight hours. A quarter of us feel like we haven't had enough sleep when we wake up. Business development manager Tom Gladdle, 25, often hits the snooze button up to five times to bag an extra half-an-hour in bed. Mr Gladdle, from Clapham, London, said: 'I have always struggled with getting out of bed in the morning. The majority of Britons snooze for 14 minutes because they feel they haven't had enough time in bed . 'I tend to hit the snooze button . repeatedly and sometimes find myself pressing it up to 5 times, snoozing . for up to half an hour. 'This . means I have very little time to get ready for work and end up leaving . the house, feeling rushed, stressed and not prepared for the day ahead. 'I wish I could just get straight out of bed when the alarm goes off, giving myself more time so I leave the house feeling relaxed and focused for work.' The time spent lazing between the sheets could be put to better use, he added. Mr Gladdle said: 'It's dawned on me that this time spent snoozing quickly adds up. 'I am actually spending a lot my life lying in bed when I could be achieving other things. 'I trained for a marathon last year and always tried to get out of bed for a morning run, but more often than not, failed. 'This meant I ended up training late in the evening when I was tired and lacking energy. 'I can't help thinking how much quicker my Marathon time could have been if I had just stopped snoozing.'","One in three workers puts their alarm on the other side of the room .

Police have admitted to 'inadvertently' re-setting Rebecca Leighton's Facebook after closing it down . A police force has admitted to ‘inadvertently’ reactivating a high-profile suspect’s Facebook account after offering to close it down to protect her privacy. Rebecca Leighton was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on suspicion of contaminating the saline drips of several patients at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Greater Manchester. She has claimed that officers, after getting her consent to close down her account, logged on to her profile and made it publicly accessible when it had previously been private. She also alleges that they leaked her name to the press. The nurse, who was cleared of the allegations against her, also claims the police force hacked into her email account when she was arrested in July 2011 and is suing the force for up to £100,000. In a High Court defence to the claims, seen by MailOnline, the police force admits officers asked for her Facebook log-in details, but denied asking for her Hotmail email details. Greater Manchester Police admitted an officer logged on to her Facebook, with consent, and changed the password ‘in order to protect [Miss Leighton’s] privacy so as to prevent any person, who may have been in possession of [her] original Facebook username and password, from being able to reactivate said account’. The officer then closed down the account before ‘inadvertently’ reactivating it. Ms Leighton claims that when the account was reactivated, her Facebook privacy settings were changed meaning the account was publicly accessible. As well as this meaning the public were able to see her photographs, Ms Leighton claims she received a number of hurtful and threatening messages. In addition to being called a ‘disgusting little tramp’, she claims to have received messages calling for her to ‘REMAIN IN PRISON FOR THE REST OF YOUR NATURAL LIFE, FAT COW’ and ‘rot in hell’. But the police force claimed to have been able to access a number of details on her Facebook account via a public search – including her friend list and her wall – before the account was accessed by officers. The High Court defence does not specify whether her photographs were accessible. Ms Leighton, who was cleared of accusations she had poisoned patients' saline drips, claims Greater Manchester Police made her Facebook account publicly accessible and then leaked her name to the press . Police chief of the time Ian Hopkins gives a media briefing outside GMP headquarters following the arrest . The police also denied volunteering her name to the press. Greater Manchester Police put a press release out about making the arrest - and says it was right to do so - and said that several media organisations called in throughout the day to ask for an identity. It claimed a reporter from the Manchester Evening News successfully identified her to the press office around two hours before an officer accessed her Facebook account. Ms Leighton spent six weeks in custody as police investigated the deaths of several patients from suspected saline drip contamination. The police force in its defence to Ms Leighton’s claims has said she is required to prove that her Facebook account was private before July 20, 2011 and that her Hotmail was logged in to.

Nearly a month's rain could fall in parts of Britain by tomorrow as experts warn this winter's storm weather is shrinking the UK's coastline 10 times faster than normal. Forecasters say the wet and windy conditions will continue in the north-west tonight with gusts of wind reaching 70mph in parts of the UK. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: 'There will be an awful lot of rain but the places that will see the most will be on the tops of hills in Cumbria and in largely unpopulated areas. A section of staircase leading to the beach at Birling Gap in East Sussex is removed after being damaged by a storm which caused three years of erosion in one month . Heavy seas lead to flooding and storm damage on Penzance promanard in Cornwall . 'The average rainfall for Cumbria in February is usually around 100 to 105mm and we forecasting that by tomorrow morning 80mm may have fallen in these areas. 'However in most places it's likely to be more like 20 to 30mm. In the south there will be not an awful lot of rainful, it will be mostly dry and mild. 'Going forward into the week the weather will continue to be unsettled, it will be blustery, windy and a mixture of sun and showers for most of the UK, but temperatures will remain mild.' 'Parts of north Wales, such as Snowdonia, may also see heavy rain like this and coastal areas will continue to see high winds of 60 to 70mph. Three severe Met Office rain warnings remain in place and the Environment is continuing to warn about flooding in 48 areas. Meanwhile, experts have said Britain's coastline will shrink 10 times faster this year following the storms - eroding by metres rather than centimetres. Hundreds of miles of English and Welsh coast are expected to recede by up to a staggering three metres this year, putting the homes and livelihoods of thousands under threat. A couple had to leave their holiday home in East Sussex due to the storms. Recent storms brought the cliff edge too close, one metre . Large waves smash against the harbour wall at Porthcawl, south Wales . Storm damage: Cliff erosion and landslide at Hoburne Naish Holiday Park in Dorset . Research by Plymouth University has found the expected rate of erosion of 20cm to 30cm per year is likely to jump to between two metres to three metres after huge waves have battered coastal towns this winter. As cliffs have crumbled under the weight of relentless rainfall, the depth of sand on beaches has risen dramatically and is two metres higher than usual in places, according to a study. A team from the university has used state-of-the-art equipment, including seisometers and thermal cameras, to record changes to Cornwall's coastline over the past three years in what is thought to be one of the most far reaching studies ever undertaken. The latest results worryingly reveal the level of erosion is up to 10 times worse after Britain's wettest winter on record. Professor Gerd Masselink, who is studying the erosion in Cornwall, said: 'On average this coastline near Porthleven retreats by 20 to 30cm per year. 'But this year's continuous gale force winds and giant storms have taken their toll and we're looking at losing between two and three metres.' Hundreds of miles of England and Wales' coast is made up of similar sandy beaches and cliffs. Meanwhile, EA chairman Lord Smith was accused yesterday of ignoring local advice about flooding on the Thames. Cllr Colin Rayner, who represents flooded Wraysbury in Berkshire, said he warned the agency the river needed dredging as far back as 2009, but was ignored. The flooding has been so bad it is even threatening this year's Oxford-Cambridge boat race with Oxford's team fearing it is falling behind in training. James Cracknell, the British rowing champion and double Olympic gold medalist, who lives close to the Thames at Chiswick, says conditions are 'hardly ideal' with the tidal stretch of the river flowing so quickly from Richmond down. 'I suspect it is Oxford who are making more of a fuss about it as they have things a lot worse than Cambridge has at Ely' he said. 'If the Oxford team has to train indoors on rowing machines because they can't go out on the river, it isn't a great feeling knowing that Cambridge are out on the water, but they must not think about the opposition. With outdoor events, these things happen.' Organisers say the historic race will only go ahead if the Thames is judged to be safe - not just for the crews but for thousands of spectators who line the banks to cheer them on. Oxford University's crew members have now been unable to get out on the river for training sessions between Osney and Iffley Locks for more than 60 days because of the floods.","Forecasters say the wet and windy conditions will continue .

A dream tropical wedding was almost cancelled after the groom found himself behind bars just four days before walking down the aisle. Martin Lonsdale, 25, was targeted by corrupt police officers and their accomplices as he was relaxing with bride-to-be Kayleigh, 24. Two conmen forced him into an unprovoked 'calculated attack' on a beach in Playacar, just south of Cancun in Mexico. Happy day: Martin and Kayleigh Lonsdale's wedding hung in the balance after he was arrested by corrupt policemen . Mr Lonsdale was attacked by conmen, but he was arrested after the fight - four days before the wedding . Mr Lonsdale, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and usher Rhys Quinn, 22, fought back after suffering a number of punches, but the brawl was quickly broken up by hotel staff and horrified onlookers. Armed police soon arrived at their five-star resort to arrest Martin and Rhys and the pair were immediately thrown in jail. The duo were were then beaten, strip-searched and humiliated by police, who took pictures of themselves laughing next to the naked men. They were finally released 39 hours later when Kayleigh, and her terrified wedding guests, were forced to handover £2,600 in cash for their freedom. One of the injuries Martin sustained after police attacked him . Astonishingly, the conmen, who said they were from Chicago but who had thick Mexican accents, were thrown out of a different hotel just hours later for pulling the same scam. 'It was a calculated attack,' Kayleigh said. 'They saw a big group of British tourists and must have seen dollar signs. We just had no idea how corrupt Mexico could be.' The couple had arrived in Mexico with 30 of their closest family and friends to tie the knot at a luxurious resort in September last year. Kayleigh had to beg guests for the 'bail' set by the Mexican police . Humiliated: Mr Lonsdale endured an horrific ordeal at the hands of his captors . But on their first day at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, in Playacar just south of Cancun, Martin and Rhys were confronted by two men as they headed back from the ocean. Out of the blue one of the men pushed Martin, telling him 'back off', before punching Rhys in the face in an unprovoked attack witnessed by hundreds of holiday-makers. A few hours later they were called down to the front desk to explain the incident to the hotel manager. Mr Lonsdale, who is showing signs of post traumatic stress disorder following the incident, said: 'When we got to the hotel lobby there were two truckloads of policemen armed with machine guns waiting for us. 'They handcuffed me straight away and threw me in the back of a pick-up van. 'They even threatened to arrest my fiancee and my mother. Mr Lonsdale said: 'They didn't question us or formally charge us with anything - it was terrifying' Mr Lonsdale and usher Rhys Quinn were driven to a police station where they were strip searched and beaten . 'The men that had attacked us were talking with the policemen and sniggering.' The men were driven to a police station where they were strip searched and beaten, before being humiliated by both male and female plain-clothed officers. 'They pushed us against the wall and made us bend over while they took pictures,' the public services worker added. 'Then two female officers came over and knelt down beside my genitals posing for a photograph. 'When I pleaded with them about my human rights they said I had none. ""This is Mexico"" they said. 'They didn't question us or formally charge us with anything - it was terrifying.' Martin and Rhys were then driven to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere where they were handcuffed to chairs in the middle of a room. A few hours later they were dragged through the building and thrown into a 12ft by 12ft rat-infested cell with 15 other men, all sharing a hole in the ground for a toilet. Thankfully the couple stayed to get married, but the shock and trauma of their experience has clouded their otherwise perfect day . Kayleigh remained at the hotel with her mother, working with authorities to locate the men. But to ensure their release the hairdresser had to plead with guests to help them with the bail, set at £1,100 per man, plus £400 for the solicitor's fee. They were told the money was for their 'victim's injuries'. 'Martin is a 6ft tall, rugby playing man's man, but he was as weak as a kitten after they released him,' added Kayleigh. 'He was covered in bruises, and stank of human faeces. 'He was traumatised beyond belief and wanted to catch the next flight out of the country.' Thankfully the couple stayed to get married, but the shock and trauma of their experience has clouded their otherwise perfect day. The couple, who have been together for six years, have been through counselling since returning to the UK . Holiday provider Thomson said they were sorry to hear about Mr Lonsdale's experience. 'As soon as we were made aware of the incident our staff provided support to the customers and their families, and liaised with the British Consulate, Embassy and Mexican authorities. 'We have continued to offer guidance since their return to the UK. 'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'

TV presenter Paula Yates had a mission for a long time to 'get' Michael Hutchence - and the Australian singer could not get out of her web - a former member of the rock band INXS said on Sunday. Speaking during an interview of surviving INXS members on Australia's Channel 7, the band's guitarist and saxaphonist Kirk Pengilly joined with other members in telling how Hutchence changed after being punched to the ground while out with model girlfriend Helena Christensen. He lost his sense of taste and smell, said bassist Garry Gary Beers, but it was Hutchence's relationship with Miss Yates that changed him the most. Revalations: INXS in their heyday. Kirk Pengilly and Tim Farris (back row) made explosive comments about Michael Hutchence in a CHannel 7 interview on Sunday . Pengilly revealed what he said had been a secret he had kept for all the years since Hutchence had died at the age of 37 in 1997. He said: 'Just prior to his death, about a week or so, what he told me he had a plan in place to basically split up with Paula and so, what can I say? More... 'We didn't know how long she had': INXS: Never Tear Us Apart star Samantha Jade reveals that her mother has cancer . 'Michael was so many firsts in my life': Kylie Minogue opens up about her romance with INXS star Hutchence and reveals she had never been to a funeral before his . 'That's what he told me. I don't know, it's all very personal stuff, I don't want to dwell on it.' Tim Farris, the band's guitarist, told how Hutchence took a swing at him on one occasion after he and Miss Yates had a daughter, Tiger Lily. Imminent split? Pengilly said that Michael told him that he was planning on leaving partner Paula Yates just before he died . Permanently affected after assault: Hutchence was beaten during a night out with then girlfriend Helena Christensen, and INXS bass player Gary Gary Beers said the singer lost his sense of taste and smell as a result . As they told of their shock at the death of Hutchence in a Sydney hotel room after he had had dinner with his father and stepmother, Pengilly recalled a strange dream he had had. He said: ‘I was in a field, it was moonlight and Michael came to me as an owl and said ""Everything's fine, I'm finally free, don't worry, I'm happy"".' The surviving band members pulled no punches in the special interview, with Tim Farriss saying Michael would have 'hated' the thought of Tiger Lily being brought up by Bob Geldof. The pair made no bones about the fact that they disliked each other, with Hutchence even going so far as to call Geldof 'evil'. Happy family? The surviving members of INXS have alleged that Paula Yates, seen with Hutchence and her daughters in 1996, was determined to 'get' him - while Hutchence had planned to end their relationship . Farriss said that the thought of Geldof being a sole parent of Tiger Lily would have been anathema to Hutchence. He said: 'Michael hated Bob in the end so much, to think that he would end up as the sole parent of Tiger Lily would have been the most horrific thing he could have imagined. But luckily for Tiger she had Bob at the end.' It was the child custody battle between Yates and Geldof that consumed Hutchence in the last days of his life, so much so that the coroner's report into his death - in a room at Sydney’s Ritz-Carlton hotel - recorded that Hutchence called Geldof and abused him for not letting Yates bring her children to Australia. Custody battle: Yates and Bob Geldof, seen together in 1991, were involved in a bitter court battle over their children when Hutchence died in 1997 . A year later Yates died from an apparent overdose, leaving Geldof to bring up Tiger Lily as his own. Farriss came across in the interview as having a strong paternal instinct for Tiger Lily. A father of two sons, he said that he had not kept in contact with Michael's daughter but would receive a reunion 'with open arms'. He said: 'She’s the daughter I never had. It’s my goal in life is to see this beautiful young woman and to tell her, face-to-face, what a wonderful man her father really was. How much he is loved and missed.’","Kirk Pengilly said Micheal spoke to him about split with Yates .

A pair of newlyweds have made history by becoming the couple first to marry in a Church of Scientology chapel, hailing their wedding as a 'victory' over 'inequality and unfairness'. Louisa Hodkin and Alessandro Calcioli, both 25, walked down the aisle in the historic ceremony after winning a landmark legal battle at the Supreme Court to exchange vows at the church. Dressed in a traditional white wedding dress and clutching a white and red bouquet of flowers, Louisa beamed as she emerged from the ceremony arm in arm with her new husband. Historic: Louisa Hodkin and Alessandro Calcioli, both 25, walked down the aisle at the Church of Scientology in Blackfriars, London . Happy day: Dressed in a traditional white wedding dress and clutching a white and red bouquet of flowers, Louisa beamed as she emerged from the ceremony arm in arm with her new husband . Guests applauded and threw confetti over the newly married couple from East Grinstead, West Sussex, as they walked out of the Church of Scientology in Blackfriars, London following the service, which was broadcast live on the internet. The new Mr and Mrs Calcioli were allowed to marry in the chapel after the Supreme Court ruled that it  was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'. As the ceremony began, a female singer performed Some Say Love, by the American country and pop singer LeAnn Rimes. Guests intoned Scientology's 'prayer for total freedom', saying the words: 'May the author of the universe enable all men to reach an understanding of their spiritual nature. 'May awareness and understanding of life expand, so that all may come to know the author of the universe. 'And may others also reach this understanding, which brings total freedom. Joy: Guests applauded and threw confetti over the newly married couple from East Grinstead, West Sussex . 'At this time we think of those whose liberty is been threatened, of those who have suffered imprisonments for their belief, of those who are enslaved or martyred and of all those who are brutalised, trapped or attacked. 'We prey that human rights will be preserved, so that all people may believe and worship freely, so that freedom will once again be seen in our land. 'Freedom from war, and poverty, and want. Freedom to be, freedom to do and freedom to have. Freedom to use and understand man's potential - a potential that is god-given and god-like. 'And freedom to achieve that understanding and awareness, which is total freedom. May god let it be so.' The groom's sister, who was among eight bridesmaids dressed in maroon, read an excerpt from 1922 children's novel The Velveteen Rabbit by Margery Williams. Momentous: The couple hailed their wedding as a 'victory' over 'inequality and unfairness' The bride's brother read from Scientology founder and pulp fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard's essay What Is Greatness? 'The hardest task one can have is to continue to love his fellows despite all reasons he should not,' he said. 'And the true sign of sanity and greatness is to so continue. For the one who can achieve this, there is abundant hope. 'For those who cannot, there is only sorrow, hatred and despair. And these are not the things of which greatness or sanity or happiness are made.' There were laughs as guests were invited to speak up if there were any reason why the couple could not be legally joined in marriage - but remained silent. Beliefs: In a statement released ahead of today's nuptials, the couple said their wedding was a 'momentous' day and the culmination of a five-year battle to have their religious rights recognised . Both bridge and groom were asked if their 'reality of the love' they felt for each other was 'such as will be constantly creating through health and sickness, through adversity as well as good fortune, can you confront and grant forgiveness for shortcomings as readily as grant praise for their many sterling qualities?' Both in turn answered 'yes' before also swearing their covenant to avow their 'solemn purpose to love, cherish and honour' each other. Asked how he felt after the wedding, Mr Calcioli told Sky News: 'Just ecstatic - a little bit speechless, just so happy that this day has finally come.' In a statement released ahead of today's nuptials, the couple said their wedding was a 'momentous' day and the culmination of a five-year battle to have their religious rights recognised. Ruling: The new Mr and Mrs Calcioli were allowed to marry in the chapel after the Supreme Court ruled that it  was a 'place of meeting for religious worship' 'We are extremely happy to announce today our marriage at the Church of Scientology in Queen Victoria Street, Victoria,' they said. 'It has been a long, five-year battle to achieve a simple freedom - the right to marry in our own church with a service in accordance with the rites and customs of our religion and surrounded by our friends and family. 'We are pleased and proud that our victory brings to an end inequality and unfairness, not just for Scientologists, but for people of all faiths - because the Supreme Court have now provided a definitive description of what a religion is, which had not existed before in English law. 'All weddings should be magical and momentous for the couple concerned, but we are conscious that ours, as the first for our religion in England, has its own place in history.' The couple said they decided to share 'this happy day' with the world on their website, adding: 'We would like to thank everyone who has sent us their good wishes. 'We are naturally extremely excited.' Solemn: Miss Hodkin and Mr Calcioli make their vows inside the chapel . Exchanging vows: The couple said they decided to share 'this happy day' with the world on their website, adding: 'We would like to thank everyone who has sent us their good wishes . Man and wife: The couple share their first kiss after their marriage . Miss Hodkin took legal action after the registrar general of births, deaths and marriages refused to register the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for 'religious worship'. Five Supreme Court justices upheld Miss Hodkin's challenge in December following a hearing in London last July. In their ruling they said religion should not be confined to faiths involving a 'supreme deity'. They said the Church of Scientology held religious services, therefore its church was a 'place of meeting for religious worship'. A Church of Scientology spokesman said: 'We are delighted that Louisa and Alessandro can now be married in their church in front of their family and fellow parishioners. 'They have paved the way for other Scientologist couples. Congregation: The chapel where Miss Hodkin and Mr Calcioli made their vows in front of friends and family . Refusal: The registrar general of births, deaths and marriages had refused to register the London Church Chapel for the solemnisation of marriages under the 1855 Places of Worship Registration Act - because it was not a place for 'religious worship' 'We extend our congratulations to the happy couple and wish them well in their future life together. 'This is an historic day for religious equality and freedom for all in the UK.' Since 2005 a new law enabled couples in Britain to marry in premises approved by local authorities, such as hotels and stately homes - rather than just a church or registry office. Civil marriage venues have since been expanded to include pubs, football grounds, wine distilleries, and other places far removed from a traditional church setting. The case was of particular importance to the Church of Scientology and its followers as several similar cases have been turned down in court in the past. Scientology is a religious belief system that teaches that people are immortal beings who have forgotten their true nature. Famous Scientologists include actors Tom Cruise and John Travolta. Founder: American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard in 1969 . The Church of Scientology was founded in 1953 by American science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. Hubbard wrote that 75 million years ago, an alien ruler called Xenu brought billions of his people to Earth in a spaceship before killing them in a bomb blast, leaving their spirits to wander around and harm the living. According to Hubbard, following Scientology means you can be clear of these malevolent spirits. Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. One purpose of Scientology, as stated by the Church, is to become certain of one's spiritual existence and one's relationship to God, or the 'Supreme Being.' Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'. These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' In order to ascend up the Scientology ladder, followers must complete a number of courses and be 'Clear' in Dianetics. This is a state, according to Hubbard, when a human 'no longer has his own reactive mind and therefore suffers none of the ill-effects that the reactive mind can cause.' The Church believes that humans suffer unwanted and negative feelings, which lead to illnesses. If every person applies Dianetics in their life, they can be 'Clear', or free, of these feelings and therefore avoid sickness. The next stage is to achieve Operating Thetan levels, or OTs for short. There are eight levels before the truth of Scientology can be fully revealed. It is believed that actor Tom Cruise took five years to reach this level.","Louisa Hodkin and Alessandro Calcioli, both 25, married at chapel in London .

The daughter of one of America's most notorious mobsters has opened up about growing up in gangland, and even the moment Frank Sinatra thought he might die because he knocked a champagne ice bucket on her lap, in a new tell all book. Meyer Lansky's gambling empire stretched from Las Vegas to Havana, with his partners in crime, Lucky Luciano and Bugsy Siegel, and he was so feared even international superstar Sinatra quivered in his presence. His daughter, Sandra, lived a lavish life funded by the proceeds of dirty dealing, and while her sprawling apartment on New York's Central Park had a terrace so big it served as a skating rink, friends were hard to come by because of her powerful father. Insight: The daughter of one of America's most notorious gangsters has opened up about growing up in gangland, and even the moment Frank Sinatra thought he might die because he knocked a champagne ice bucket on her lap, in a new tell all book, pictured . In the book, 'Daughter of the King: Growing Up in Gangland,' Sandra describes how daddy would take her to Broadway shows where the ushers knew his name and to famous supper clubs with her many mobster 'uncles.' According to an excerpt in the New York Daily News, it was in one of these supper clubs, The Riviera club in New Jersey, where she and 'Daddy' ran into Sinatra. She recalls one night, when she was 10 or 11, Sinatra came over to their table to say hello after his set. She said she felt very grown-up, out 'on the town' with Daddy but Sinatra was less excited. 'I had never seen anyone so nervous as Frank, particularly a star who had all the teenagers in New York screaming for him,' Sandra writes. 'But Frank was more fidgety in Daddy's presence than any bobby-soxer would have been in his.' She said the crooner was so anxious that when he reached over to shake her hand, he knocked over an champagne bucket of ice, which was chilling her ginger ale, into her lap. 'He nearly died,' she remembers, adding 'Maybe he was worrying about dying for getting me all wet. Maybe Daddy had given him one of his looks.' Power of the mob: 'Frank (Sinatra) right, was more fidgety in Daddy's presence than any bobby-soxer would have been in his,' Sandra recalls in the book of her father, left . Either way, he quickly Frank got on his knees and began frantically drying her off with a bunch of napkins. He only relaxed when she began laughing and said that he was tickling her. She said the twinkle returned to he father's eyes, and Frank began to breathe easier. The singer then gave her a big hug, as if she had saved his life by forgiving him. The Daddy's girl grew up into her own gangland character, 'Mob Deb,' she explains in the book, with her own table at glamor spots like El Morocco. She married at the tender age of 15. However, her playboy husband turned out to be a 'gay fortune hunter' so she quickly moved on to dating movie stars who introduced her to drugs. Sandra became addicted and was falling fast. However, the handsome Gabby Harnett saved her. She writes in the book, co-authored by William Stadiem, that she thought Harnett was the one, until he revealed himself as an undercover cop who wanted her to inform on her father. Booked: Gambling boss Meyer Lansky, right, smokes a cigarette as he is booked on charges of vagrancy at the West 54th Street police station in Manhattan in 1958 . Sandra ran to daddy and Meyer Lansky, as always, made things right, she said. The first time she became aware of his murderous ways was early October of 1951, when her father took her to dinner with 'Uncle Willie' Moretti - the underboss of the Genovese family. The pair chatted about Havana and her Daddy was 'quiet, thoughtful and a little sad' as they reminisced about old times. Willie turned to Sandra and joked that Lansky took her mother on honeymoon with the gangster Dutch Schultz. 'Is that any way to treat a lady?' he said. At that, the mob boss became uncomfortable and asked for the check. The next day at school she noticed one of the school janitors was reading a newspaper with Uncle Willie on the cover. She said she almost burst out with how she had dinner with him last night. Then she read the other half of the paper. 'Dead!' it said. 'Mob Boss Exterminated in N.J.' Dead: Cliffside Park, New Jersey-Racketeer Willie Moretti lies in his own blood after being shot to death ina restaurant in 1951. Sandra recalls having dinner with 'Uncle Willie' the night before his murder . And he was pictured in a pool of blood lying on the tile floor of a bar. 'I ran to the bathroom and threw up,' she writes. When Harnett asked for her help as an informant she ran straight to Daddy, who she said forgave her for not realizing sooner. He then decided to 'use him.' 'The plan was to feed Gabby and the FBI disinformation to send them on wild goose chases. He gave me a list of names to drop, names and places,' she recalled in the Daily News excerpt. She said they had a few more dinners, and numerous meetings that included FBI agents. But then she became distracted with a guy from a major Mafia family, Vince Lombardo. Vince wasn't in the Mafia himself, she writes, but he was 'perilously close.' She said her father would only let the pair marry if Vince promised to stay out, under any circumstances, of the Mafia for the rest of his life. 'Vince made the deal,' she said. Lansky denied many of the accusations against him and despite all the reports, the U.S. Justice Department never found him guilty of anything more serious than illegal gambling. He died of lung cancer on January 15, 1983, age 80, worth almost nothing on paper. However, the FBI believe he had over $300 million in hidden bank accounts.","Meyer Lansky's gambling empire stretched from Las Vegas to Havana, and he was so feared even international superstar Sinatra quivered in his presence his daughter, Sandra, recalls .

Lisa Philips, pictured at her court case in October, is being questioned by police over claims she lied to a court about being pregnant . A thief who stole £15,000 from her own aunt to pay off her debts and buy a big television is facing questions from police after allegedly lying to a court about being pregnant. Lisa Philips, 36, was given a suspended prison sentence at Teesside Crown Court in October after her lawyer told jurors for the case that she was expecting a child. However, it has since emerged that Philips, who was expected to give birth in December, was apparently not pregnant at all. The allegations have led to her being questioned under caution by police. Ultimately she could face charges of perverting the course of justice. Philips, of Newton Aycliffe, County Durham, received a four-month suspended prison sentence after admitting theft. She was also handed a 12-month supervision order and an additional one-month suspended jail term for obstructing police. A spokesperson for the police said today: 'A 36-year-old has been helping with inquiries in relation to an allegation of perverting the course of justice.' A file has now been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service, where lawyers will make a decision on whether to charge her. A source said: 'It seems she was never ever pregnant. She has tried to maintain she did a home test and thought she was. 'Family members didn’t think she was, so we waited until December when she said she was due, and that came and went.' In October, Philips’ lawyer Rebecca Stephenson told Judge Peter Armstrong: 'She is deeply ashamed of her actions. 'She has lost a great deal on a personal level, with family members and the breakdown of her relationship with her partner who she is currently pregnant to.' The court heard how Philips even created a fake bank statement in a desperate attempt to hide her dishonesty. Philips had transferred the money into an account she had full control of to allegedly keep it safe from her aunt’s Turkish boyfriend. Twice her aunt asked for money totalling £300, which she was given from the account, but no receipts were ever produced. Questions: Philips faces investigation from the police after her lawyers mentioned her 'pregnancy' to Teesside Crown Court in Middlesbrough, pictured . Her aunt became suspicious when repeated requests to see statements for the account were met with excuses by Philips. It later emerged that Philips had stolen £14,700 to pay off debts and to buy an Xbox games console and a flat-screen television. Judge Armstrong told Philips: 'Your initial concern about your aunt’s partner may well have been well-motivated, but you went on and did the thing that you were concerned about. 'The temptation for you was too great as you plundered the money to pay off your debts.'","Lisa Philips, 36, admitted theft in October and got a suspended sentence .

The unnamed man, in his 30s, will have a tooth broken in his mouth in accordance with the Quran which states 'an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth' A Saudi man who admitted knocking a tooth out of his mother's mouth after punching her has been told he will have the same tooth broken as punishment. The unnamed man was also sentenced to five years in jail and 2,400 lashes to be given out at a rate of 40 every 10 days in a local marketplace. The man, in his 30s, was arrested after his mother contacted the police asking them to rescue her after the attack. While his mother was taken to hospital, police took the son before the courts, according to the Saudi paper Okaz. The judge, Turki Al Qarni, issued the ruling after a medical report showed the son was mentally stable, and had not taken drugs or drunk alcohol. The ruling is based on a verse from the Koran which reads: 'And We ordained therein for them: A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth'. In Arabic countries it is typical for harsher sentences to be handed out for attacks against parents, as the Koran holds them in high regard. According to Gulf News, last year, a judge in the Red Sea city of Jeddah sentenced a man who had beaten his mother and broken her arm to remain in jail until she agreed to let him out. The man, who admitted during the investigation that he had physically abused his elderly mother, was also sentenced to 200 lashes for his assault. Even when parents are not involved, courts in the Middle east are known to hand out brutal punishments in accordance with the Koran. THe man was also sentenced to five years in prison and 2,400 lashes, which is a common punishment handed out in Saudi Arabia (file picture) In December last year a Yemeni man was sentenced to 20 lashes after claiming his new wife was not a virgin in front of her father. Rather than be dishonored the girl submitted to an examination to prove her virginity, and then took her husband to court. Saudi Arabia has faced strong international condemnation over its use of corporal and capital punishment. Public beatings and executions are common place in the autocratic Kingdom. In December a political activist was sentenced to 300 lashes and four years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy in the country.","Unnamed man, in his 30s, attacked his mother and punched her .

Sidra Fatima faces jail after conning seven men out of £35,000 after posing as a potential bride on a dating website . A honey trap conwoman posing as a potential bride-to-be on a dating website swindled seven men out of £35,000. Sidra Fatima snared seven men on Asian marriage site Shaadi.com, posing as a willing and available bride 'looking for someone who knows the meaning of love'. But the 33-year-old scarpered with the men's money and gifts they lavished on her before going through with their arrangement. Fatima was already married and set up the scam with husband Raja Haider Ali, 45, who pretended to be her cousin or brother-in-law when he came face-to-face with their victims. Claiming to be divorced and the mother of a child, Fatima described herself on the site as 'simple and sincere'. She added that she was a 'simple person learning from life and finding myself, looking for someone who knows the meaning of love, someone who can touch my soul'. In each case, Fatima arranged to meet the victim and in some instances his family while husband Ali, posing as a male relative, accompanied her. Following their first meeting, she would agree to marriage, insisting the victim handed over money to pay for the wedding. Prosecutor John Harrison told the jury at Bradford Crown Court the men had each stumped up a dowrie of around £5,000 each. He said Fatima then demanded gifts for the wedding in addition to the money. But once the money and gifts were handed over, Fatima would end the relationship either by telling the man she no longer wished to get married or by ignoring his phone calls. Fatima, an unemployed mother-of-two, and her taxi driver husband Ali pleaded guilty part way through their trial at Bradford Crown Court on Wednesday. After their arrests Fatima claimed she had been forced to take part in the scam by her husband while Ali suggested he was being blackmailed by his wife. Honey trap conwoman Sidra Fatima, pictured above, worked with her husband Raja Haider Ali to execute the scam. She would meet the men, before agreeing to marriage and demanding money to pay for the nuptials . A jury heard earlier that the scams were part of a variety of fraud offences committed by the couple. Fatima, who admitted nine counts of fraud - including seven relating to her misleading her suitors - also owned up to giving false details about her employment and income in relation to a £171,000 mortgage fraud involving a former home in Huddersfield. The pair also admitted charges involving insurance claims for three 'staged burglaries' at the same property. Ali, who goes under three different names, admitted six of the marriage deceptions committed  between May 2009 and January 2011. He also admitted fraud charges in relation to money he obtained from a man who he thought would buy their house. The jury heard Fatima, now of Dewsbury, had not worked since the couple settled in the Huddersfield area in 1999 while Ali, of Huddersfield, made a modest income as a taxi driver. Judge Colin Burn will sentence the pair next month and bailed them with the condition they surrender their passports. 'You should both be under no illusion that the offences you committed are almost inevitably going to end in a custodial sentence,' he added.","Sidra Fatima posed as a willing and available bride on Shaadi.com .

A court in Delhi heard the teenager was kidnapped by the three man in the Qutub Vihar area of the city as she made her way home from work in Gurgaon. Her mutilated body was discovered three days later in Rewari, Haryana, it has been reported. The court heard the girl had been beaten and acid had been poured in to her eyes.

The court heard the men planned revenge after the girl had rejected one of the men's advances. Last week a court convicted Ravi, Rahul and Vinod in the 'rarest of rare' case. More than 100 people, including the girl's relatives and neighbours, gathered outside the court at every hearing to demand capital punishment for the accused. Delhi Police had sought the death penalty for the men, who were convicted on Friday. The court heard none of the men had shown remorse during the trial. Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said the girl was killed in a cold-blooded manner, The Indian Express has reported. Earlier this week, the parents, above, of the victim demanded capital punishment for the rapists and murderers of their daughter . The judge said the men 'gratified their sexual lust upon the deceased by subjecting her to rape one by one'. The men had been arrested and booked for kidnapping, unnatural sex, gang-rape and murder of a girl. They were acquitted by the court of the charges on unnatural sex.

John Bercow has criticised BBC chairman Lord Patten for refusing to be grilled by MPs about the broadcaster’s coverage of Europe. The Commons Speaker insisted no one should consider themselves above parliamentary inspection, as he attacked Lord Patten’s refusal to answer questions from the European Scrutiny Committee. MPs are furious that the Tory peer – and former European Commissioner – has three times turned down their request to discuss the subject of bias in the BBC’s coverage of the EU. Because he is a peer, Lord Patten cannot be forced to attend. Criticism: John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, insisted no one should consider themselves above parliamentary inspection . Labour MP Kate Hoey called for a debate on how Parliament could ensure Lord Patten is ‘not abusing his position as a Lord to avoid appearing before the committee’. Mr Bercow waded in, saying: ‘Anybody who’s invited to appear before a committee of this House should do so. No one, however senior, should imagine him or herself above such scrutiny.’ Lord Patten, who earns £110,000 ‘base’ salary for a three to four day week, told MPs he would not discuss editorial decisions with them because this ‘is not consistent with the ideal of an independent Trust protecting the BBC from undue political interference’. Bill Cash, the chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said that with the looming European elections and the upcoming in or out referendum on EU membership, it was vital that the BBC’s output was ‘impartial’. Refusal: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten  has three times turned down their request to discuss the subject of bias in the BBC's coverage of the EU . ‘I entirely endorse what the Speaker said. We are dealing with the fact that it is not possible to summon a member of the House of Lords to our committees but it is being proposed that this rule is modified,’ he told the Mail. ‘There are many situations in which a member of the House of Lords holds positions which involve taxpayers’ money and they are paid out of the public purse.’ A spokesman for the BBC Trust said BBC staff had appeared before the committee to deal with points on coverage. He said: ‘In a letter to Bill Cash, Lord Patten set out why Trustees felt it would be inconsistent with the Trust’s role in protecting the BBC’s editorial independence for him to answer to the Committee for specific items and areas of BBC news coverage.

Seven British ski instructors have been arrested in France and were yesterday all facing prison sentences for providing lessons without a licence. It is all part of an increasingly bitter 'Piste War' which makes a mockery of European Union free labour laws. Simon Butler, an Englishman who runs a tour business in the resort of Megeve, was snatched off a ski lift by armed French officers on Tuesday, along with his six colleagues. Controversy: From left, Simon Butler, Adam Alder-Cox, Alex Casey, Ross Medcalf, Jay Blatherwick, Jim Wilkins, and Philip May. Mr Butler, Mr Casey and another man were arrested and held overnight in a police cell . 'They are accused of breaking employment laws', said Bonneville prosecutor Pierre-Yves Michau, who confirmed all were expected in a criminal court within the next two months. 'Mr Butler is not conforming to our laws,' said Mr Michau, who said all those arrested had their passports withdrawn. Those arrested and held overnight in a police cell were Mr Butler, Mark Gibbs, 63, and Alex Casey, 41. All face charges. Also arrested and facing charges, but not imprisoned, were Adam Alder-Cox, 21, Philip May, 45, Ross Medcalf, 28, and Jim Wilkins, 47. Jay Blatherwick, a 48-year-old female instructor, was questioned by French police, but not formally arrested. A furious Mr Butler, who is on bail and due to face a judge on April 7, said: 'I have all the right documentation to work in France, and so do my staff. 'I was arrested illegally and then placed in a tiny, freezing cell with a concrete slab as a bed. I was kept in custody for 36 hours and generally treated appallingly. Now we can't leave the country, and are all facing further time in prison.' He added: 'The gendarmes and other officials surrounded me and incorrectly accused me of teaching without qualifications. In fact my only real crime was being British and not French. 'I was treated like a criminal instead of someone who is running a successful local business.' Arrests: Mr Butler was snatched off a ski lift by armed French officers on Tuesday, with his six colleagues . The seven instructors - six men and one woman - face up to three months in prison for working without a licence. Mr Butler, a highly experienced professional, has worked in Megeve for almost 30 years, mainly with British holidaymakers. But he claims that he and his staff . are regularly harassed by the French, who want to maintain their part of . the Alps as a preserve of mainly local workers. Ski . professionals from the UK believe the French are trying to drive them . off the slopes - so ruining peoples' holidays in the process. Tensions . have increased over the past years, as EU employment laws allow more . and more people to travel and seek work in neighbouring countries. Outrage: UKIP's Paul Nuttall said, 'Those raging Europhiles who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep' Mr Butler was first fined the equivalent of around £8,000 in 2004 and last year was given a similar fine, together with a six month prison sentence. The latter punishment is currently under appeal. Mr Butler is also facing charges of failing to declare foreign employees - something he considers 'particularly ridiculous' because France and the UK are EU allies whose nationals are allowed to work in either country without permits. European Commissioner Michel Barnier, who is also a prominent French MP, devised a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as a means of allowing advanced ski instructors to work wherever they want, and it is recognised by the French government. Mr Butler has a stamp proving that he has . an MOU, but it is apparently being ignored by the judicial authorities . in Bonneville, and by the police. Philippe Planes, Mr Butler's lawyer, confirmed he had 'every right' to operate under a British licence. 'Mr Butler is not a criminal but is being treated as one,' said Mr Planes, who said his client had filed a complaint with the European Commission accusing France of discrimination and restricting his freedom of movement. When one of Mr Butler's staff was arrested last year, scores of holidaymakers staged a demonstration outside the Megeve police station where he was held. Commenting on the latest case, UK Independence Party deputy leader Paul Nuttall said: 'Those raging Europhiles who claim there is a single market should read this story and weep. 'They have simply misled people as this episode shows. Simon Butler has been treated like a dog by French authorities because he is a British national who wanted to work as a ski instructor and run a thriving business.'","Simon Butler snatched from ski lift in resort of Megeve by armed police .

Sacked: Leanne Phillips, 31, has won her unfair dismissal case against My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding dressmaker Thelma Madine, who fired her following a heated argument . A dressmaker who starred on the hit show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding unfairly dismissed her head designer after a heated row, a court has ruled. Thelma Madine, 61, sacked Leanne Phillips, 31, last Christmas following a shouting match which ended with the employee calling her boss 'a horrible b****'. However, a tribunal described her action as 'unreasonable' and criticised her for making it based on personal rather than business reasons. Employment tribunal judge Vincent . Ryan also described the atmosphere at the bridal shop as 'volatile', and . that much of this atmosphere was down to a need to provide added drama . for the reality television show. Miss Phillips brought the case against Ms Madine last December, after she was sacked from Nico Bridal Company in Liverpool, where she had worked for six years. Channel Four star Ms Madine once praised Miss Phillips for for taking her business 'to another level'. However she fired her former pal allegedly following a shouting . match which ended with Miss Phillips calling her Ms Madine a ‘horrible . b****’. Judge Ryan ruled that Ms Madine, who Miss Phillips described as 'like an aunt', had reacted to the insult 'as a friend', rather than an employer, and not for a reason relating to her work. Ms Madine, who rose to fame designing opulent dresses for traveller brides has now been ordered to pay Miss Phillips £1,200, and faces having to fork out more money in compensation. The judge upheld Miss . Phillips' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by Ms Madine, that she . was owed wages, was provided with no written contract of employment and . that her employer failed to follow ACAS guidelines when conducting the . disciplinary procedure. In his judgement ruling Mr Ryan said: 'All things and . personalities considered, the atmosphere in the place of work was . volatile and loud rows would erupt. 'Staff shouted at each other and could be abusive on occasions. 'This . informality and volatility was tolerated by the respondent and to an . extent, particularly when filming of the television documentary, was . actively appreciated by the respondent so as to avoid the risk of the . film footage being perceived to be boring.' Ruling: My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Thelma Madine, left, has been ordered to pay Miss Phillips £1,200 in back pay by the employment tribunal. The tribunal heard how prior to Miss Phillips losing her £400-a-week job at Nico, she and Ms Madine had been firm friends. Miss . Phillips had known Ms Madine since she was just four years old, and her . former employer had even bought her a car for her 30th birthday. 'The respondent was very generous to the claimant and they worked closely together,' said the judgement. 'The . claimants appeal against dismissal was not dealt with promptly and . there was considerable delay in the holding of the appeal hearing. 'The investigation into the matter was flawed. 'The . claimant was dismissed for personal reasons of the respondent that . related to the claimants personal conduct towards her and not for a . reason that related to conduct having a bearing on her work. Unfair: Tribunal Judge Vincent Ryan upheld Miss Phillips' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by Ms Madine, who rose to fame on the Channel four show . 'The respondent reacted to an insult from a friend in personal circumstances, rather than as a reasonable employer. 'The matter was personal and not business.' Ms Madine was ordered to pay back the . £1200 that had been deducted from Miss Phillips's wages, and a . compensation package will be agreed at a remedy hearing next year. During . the tribunal Miss Phillips had claimed that there were regular . arguments at the business which nobody else was punished for and that . there was no discipline structure. Employment:  Ms Madine paid Leanne Phillips £400 a week to design dresses for Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool . Her . mother Pauline Wooley also gave evidence suggesting Ms Madine, who rose . to fame on the Channel Four series about the traveller community, . routinely mistreated her staff. Ms Wooley, who is currently suspended from her role as Assistant Manager . at the company, told the court hearing in Liverpool that she was . 'treated like a dog' by her employer, who had also been a close friend . for more than 20 years. However, Peter Maratos, an employment expert speaking on behalf of Ms . Madine, said that Miss Phillips was 'spoiled' and 'over-reacted' after . the publicity from featuring on the TV programme had 'gone to her head'. Speaking about the result, Ms Phillips said: 'I am over the moon with the outcome. It has been a long process, coming up to a year since I was dismissed, and I am really pleased. 'I knew that there was only ever going to be one verdict. 'Judge Ryan saw through all of the lies - thank god he did.' Miss . Phillips has now launched her own fashion business - Leanne Alexandra - . and has been flooded with orders for christening and communion dresses . from the gypsy community. She added: 'It is onwards and upwards from here for me. 'I am concentrating on my business. 'I have had plenty of orders already and everyone has been so supportive of me.' Ms Madine, who denied the claims made at the tribunal, was unavailable for comment. Miss . Phillips's solicitor Stephen Pinder said: 'It was one of the most . overwhelming decisions I have seen in favour of the claimant. 'Leanne is delighted with the outcome and looks forward to continuing her new business.' After the success of the Gypsy Wedding series, Ms Madine went on to appear in spin-off Thelma's Gypsy Girls . The . court case came just one year after Ms Madine published her autobiography, . Tales of The Gypsy Dressmaker, in which she praised Miss Phillips. She . wrote: 'Leanne is now the head designer at Nico and is starting to . oversee parts of the process that I had to do, which is great, because . it means that I can concentrate on other parts of the business. 'I used to feel that every one of my . dresses was like my baby and that no one could do them as well as me but . I know now that the future of Nico is in Leanne's hands. 'Since . she started working for me, Leanne has taken Nico to another level. Not . only that, she also inherited her mum Pauline's determination and . loyalty. 'And I have to admit that she reminds me of me at her age, full of imaginative ideas and passion for the task in hand.'

Others questioned whether he should be sacked if Labour are to convince voters they can be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls was greeted with a roar of derision from across the House when he claimed that it was the Chancellor who was ‘in complete denial’ about the state of the economy. Mr Osborne hit back, saying: ‘The man who said that borrowing wouldn’t come down, unemployment wouldn’t come down, growth wouldn’t happen and the man who refuses to apologise for what he did to the British economy – he is the very epitome of denial.’ The Chancellor branded Mr Balls’s speech ‘a turkey’ and mercilessly ribbed him over his decision to cancel a grade three piano exam because it clashed with the Autumn Statement. ‘He probably should have gone ahead with his Chopsticks routine,’ Mr Osborne said. Hard time: Ed Balls turned red and was forced to yell as he struggled to get his message across in the Commons today . Labour leader Ed Miliband grimaced as Mr Balls yelled himself hoarse, while Labour MPs sat mute and grim-faced behind him. A senior Labour source admitted the party’s case on the economy ‘was not made well in the chamber today’. One Labour MP went further, saying: ‘He f***** it up. I was watching it thinking “we are f*****”. ‘He’s supposed to be a bright bloke, but there was no analysis of the Autumn Statement in what he said. Ed Miliband should really have sacked him in the last reshuffle. It was a sign of weak leadership that he didn’t.’ Doubts about Mr Balls came as it emerged that former Labour Cabinet Minister Baroness Armstrong has privately said the approach of Mr Balls and Mr Miliband will leave the party ‘in deep shtook’. Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow calls for order as Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls responds to the Autumn Statement . BAt a meeting of the Blairite Progress movement she said Labour were seen ‘as we were . . . in the late 80s’, adding: ‘Our hearts . .. are in the right place, but actually we’re not sufficiently concerned about public spending, about how we would pay for what we talk about’. Who do you trust most with the economy? ‘Unless we take that more seriously, . we’re going to be in deep shtook. We are allowing the story about the . economy . . . to be dominating and running in a way we can’t control.’ She admitted the Tories had ‘succeeded on the economy’. Another . Labour insider said Mr Balls would keep his job but should change . course. ‘That is two quite shocking performances that he has turned in . in his last two big appearances,’ the source said. ‘But what is . concerning people is not just the performance.‘There are lots of . people in the Shadow Cabinet saying that the cost of living stuff is . fine – but it’s not enough. It’s probably too late to move him now but . today was a reality check.’ One Blairite said MPs were likely to . demand a rethink of Labour’s economic policies in the coming days. ‘I’ll . be amazed if you don’t see the New Labour elements start to say that we . need something more than cost of living issues.’ Mr Balls tried to . put a brave face on his performance. He said: ‘I’ve got a bit of a sore . throat. It was very, very loud. There are a lot of working people in . this country who are seeing their living standards falling and no one to . speak for them. I’m not going to allow 300 Tory MPs to shout me down.’ Flat: MPs behind Mr Balls looked less than enthused by his speech and a source later said George Osborne later quoted a Labour source as saying their case for the economy 'was not made well in the chamber today' On the up: In March the Office for Budget Responsibility slashed growth forecast for this year to just 0.6 per cent, but the figure for 2013 and 2014 were dramatically upgraded today . Since . the Coalition was formed in May 2010. Ed Balls has been George . Osborne's sternest critic. Increasingly his words have come back to . haunt him. Here the Mail highlights some of his predictions - contrasting them with what actually happened. DOUBLE DIP RECESSION: . ‘Our complacent and out-of-touch Prime Minister and Chancellor have . spent the last week claiming their plan is on track, but . . . Britain’s . double-dip recession is even deeper than first thought. What more . evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies . have failed and they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth . and jobs. – May 24, 2012. Reality: A double dip was averted because growth was stronger than predicted. CUTS WOULD CHOKE THE RECOVERY: . ‘The overall impact is . . . a government plan which  isn’t balanced, . which is a drag  on growth, which has focused  on recovery in my view. I . have been saying for three years  that this plan wouldn’t work.’ –  May . 22, 2013. Reality: During the very quarter that he was speaking, the economy was growing by 0.7 per cent. UNEMPLOYMENT: ‘They have a programme that will clearly lead to the disappearance of a million jobs.’ – October 25, 2010. Reality: Employment has increased by more than 1.1million since 2010. PRIVATE SECTOR WOULD NOT CREATE JOBS . ‘We were also told the public sector job cuts would  be more than . outweighed by the rise in private sector jobs . . . It has been a . complete disaster.’ – October 12, 2011. Reality: Three jobs have been created in the private sector for every public sector job lost. CRIME WOULD SOAR BECAUSE OF CUTS: . ‘By failing to protect funding for the police in the Spending Review, . the Home Secretary is taking huge risks with the public’s safety, crime . and national security.’ – October 21, 2010. Reality: Crime has fallen by more than 10 per cent. CUTS TO COUNCILS WOULD HIT SERVICES: ‘We know the true impact of the massive frontloaded cuts to local government – hitting services.’ – June 6, 2011. Reality: Public satisfaction with councils’ services have increased.","#RedEd was trending on Twitter today as he suffered in the Commons .

Thousands of travellers were stranded yesterday as winds as fast as 140mph wrought havoc across the transport network. Roads were shut and train services cancelled, with Network Rail’s tracks covered with debris. A spokesman said: ‘We’ve had a trampoline, items of garden furniture, trees ... It’s quite extensive.’ By yesterday afternoon, there was not a single train running in Scotland, while services for almost the entire north of England were suspended. Elsewhere, passengers were forced to leave trains mid-journey after fallen trees meant it was not safe to continue. Killed: The driver of this HGV died after it was blown over in gale-force winds on the A801 near Bathgate, West Lothian, crushing several cars beneath it . Sheer power: Police examine an overturned car in Windy Nook, Gateshead . Glasgow Central station was evacuated during the morning rush-hour after flying debris smashed glass in the roof, but fortunately no one was hurt. Flights were also disrupted, with high winds leaving some unable to land. One easyJet plane with 112 passengers aborted two attempted landings in Scotland, before being diverted to Manchester. The flight from Gatwick to Glasgow was initially diverted to Edinburgh – but the storm soon reached that city too. Passenger Hazel Bedford, a charity worker, said: ‘I’m feeling really lucky to be alive. I was absolutely terrified. Hanging on for dear life: Another pedestrian in Leeds battles to stay upright by hanging on to a post . ‘The captain said there was a chance it could be a bit bumpy north of the border and there could be some delays while landing. ‘But we got further north and suddenly everything started shaking and bumping – we were going up and down, up and down, like a roller coaster.’ Glasgow, Leeds Bradford and Birmingham airports also faced disruption. Ferry services were cancelled at ports around the country, while motorists were confronted with fallen trees and flash-flooding. As a result, accidents caused further major delays. The winds were so powerful that vehicles were flipped onto their roofs; one overturned lorry caused long tailbacks on the M60. In Scotland, a man and woman had to be cut free from a taxi after a tree collapsed on top of it, while in Wales two drivers escaped when a 50-tonne tree fell onto their vehicles on the A40 near Abergavenny, South Wales. Another driver was similarly lucky to escape with his life, after his van was crushed by a tree with him inside it near the centre of Manchester. The tree missed the windscreen by just inches. Witness Kathleen McGuiness, 51, said: ‘It’s a miracle he’s walked away from it. I think he should make sure he plays the lottery on Saturday. ‘It landed right on his bonnet and made a massive bang. He was trapped inside, and he had to kick through the windscreen to get out.’ Another onlooker added: ‘He was very lucky to escape with just cuts  and bruises.’ Going, going... gone: A pedestrian tries desperately to stay on her feet yesterday as winds batter Leeds city centre, but in the end a gust blows her over and she falls in the road . In Birmingham, Muhammad Sial told how a tree had smashed his car – missing him by mere seconds. The 66-year-old said: ‘I didn’t hear a noise, I just got to the front door and turned to look back and the tree had smashed my car. It smashed the front and the windscreen. 'The trunk of the tree was lying right across my car – it had happened just in an instant. I think my prayers must have been answered. Every morning I pray to Allah to save me and others, so I am grateful.’ Scaffolding being used to repair the roof of an Aldi in Flintshire, north-east Wales, collapsed onto cars in high winds, and in Merseyside parts of a newly-built block of flats blew into the road and onto cars, smashing windscreens. Police said nobody was injured, although a number of residents were ‘severely shaken’.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:04 EST, 5 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 5 December 2013 . Waste? Fish oil contains vitamin D . Taking vitamin D supplements in order to ward off illness could be a waste of time, a study shows. Scientists saw little evidence that the pills lowered the risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s or other diseases. For decades, scientists assumed that the mineral, one of the most popular supplements in Britain, had numerous health benefits. But a review of 462 studies involving more than a million adults has concluded that a lack of vitamin D is not a trigger for many common illnesses. In Britain, the supplements market is worth £700million a year – a growth of 16 per cent in five years – and the most popular pills are multivitamins and fish oils, which contain vitamin D. The main reason scientists thought vitamin D could protect against disease was that patients with cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer’s had very low levels of the nutrient. But the French researchers now suspect that, rather than vitamin D deficiency leading to disease, these illnesses stop the body from producing vitamin D, so sufferers have lower levels. Lead author Professor Philippe Autier, from the International  Prevention Research Institute  in Lyon, France, said: ‘What this  discrepancy suggests is that decreases in vitamin D levels are a marker of deteriorating health. Ageing and inflammatory processes involved in disease occurrence . . . reduce vitamin D concentrations, which would explain why vitamin D deficiency is reported in a wide range of disorders.’ But his study – published in The Lancet – did not cast doubt on the supplement’s effect on the bones. The mineral is known to protect against bone thinning and the bone disorder rickets. Two months ago the chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, called for free vitamins to be given to children after it emerged that a quarter of youngsters are short of vitamin D. Presently it is only available on  prescription to under fives from low income families. In addition, pregnant women and those . who are breastfeeding are advised to take one vitamin D tablet a day – . which they can get on prescription – to ensure their baby’s bones are . healthy. Other academics said more research was needed before vitamin D . was discounted. Professor . Peter Selby, honorary clinical professor of metabolic  bone disease at . Manchester Royal Infirmary, said: ‘One problem with this sort of . systematic review is that it can only examine the studies  which have . been published previously, so it is limited by the level of vitamin D in . subjects in these studies. More investigation: Other academics said further research was needed before vitamin D was discounted . ‘It could very well be that the apparent negative results of this study have been obtained simply because they have not been looking at people with a sufficient degree of vitamin D insufficiency to have any meaningful biological effect.’ Other recent studies have also cast doubt on the curative properties of vitamin D supplements. In one case, scientists found ‘no convincing evidence’ that vitamin D supplements would fend off a cold. Testing was carried out on more than 300 adults in New Zealand over 18 months in 2010 and 2011. Half were given extra vitamin D while the rest took placebo tablets. The vitamin D group caught 3.7 colds per person on average, compared with 3.8 colds per person for the placebo group. In October, a review of previous studies by University of Auckland researchers claimed taking vitamin D supplements did not improve bone mineral density at the hip, spine, forearm or in the body as a whole. Professor Ian Reid, the study’s leader, said: ‘Most healthy adults do not need vitamin D supplements. ‘Our data suggest the targeting of low-dose vitamin D supplements only to individuals who are likely to be deficient could free up substantial resources that could be better used elsewhere in healthcare.’ Professor Reid reviewed 23 studies examining the effects of vitamin D supplements on bone density .","For decades, scientists assumed that the mineral had many health benefits .

The girls were being taught in ‘cramped’ conditions at Bnois Jerusalem School, which was using a three-storey house as extra classrooms. Concerns were first raised in 2006 but lessons were still taking place in the inappropriate conditions this year despite neighbours complaining about noise and the local council issuing an enforcement notice.

The Pennsylvania man who was lured on Craigslist by a young couple who wanted to commit a murder together, was still alive as they searched for a place to dump his body. Miranda Barbour, 18, told police that Troy LaFerrara, a 42-year-old married man, was still alive - 'choking and gasping for air' - after she stabbed him 20 times. Initially, Miranda told police that she killed La Ferrara in self-defense after he started to grope her. But her 22-year-old husband Elytte Barbour gave police a different story, saying they conspired to kill a stranger together, and he helped hold La Ferrara down while his wife wielded the knife. 'Natural born killers': Miranda Barbour (left), 18, and her 22-year-old husband, Elytte (right) are seen in handcuffs after being arrested in connection to the 'thrill killing' of Troy LaFerrara last month . Victim: Miranda Barbour said Troy LaFerrara, left, was still alive when she was searching for a place to dump his body. Pictured above with his wife Collen on their wedding day in 2011 . Miranda Barbour was the first to be arrested when police traced LaFerrara's last call to her cell phone. She was charged last Wednesday in his death, followed by her husband on Friday. Investigators said Elytte Barbour confessed to police the couple planned the killing. He previously told The Daily Item of Sunbury his wife acted in self-defense when LaFerrara, who was married, groped her after hiring her as a ‘companion.’ According to authorities, Miranda advertised herself as a 'companion' on Craigslist and LaFerrara responded. She arranged to pick him up on November 11 at a mall, three weeks after her marriage. Elytte Barbour says he hid in the back of the car under a blanket until the moment his wife gave him a signal. He held LaFerrara back with a cable cord while his petite, bespectacled spouse repeatedly stabbed him. LaFerrara's body was discovered the next morning in an ally by Sunbury resident Brittany Settler. Sex worker: The teen-mom's husband said he knew about her habit of meeting men on the internet and sleeping with them for money . 'I was making myself a cup of coffee when I opened the fridge to get the creamer out,' she told WHP. 'I looked out and was like, ""What is that?""' According to police, LaFerrara had keys in his hand but no identification. HIs face was purple. Clinging to life: LaFerrara was 'chocking and gasping for air' in the back seat of the car after being stabbed 20 times by Miranda Barbour . After dumping their victim's body, the Barbours when to Wal-mart to buy garbage bags, carpet clearer, paper towels and seat covers to clean out the SUV - but it wasn't enough. 'She related that there was a lot of blood and she wasn't able to get it all,' police said. After that they went to a strip club to celebrate Elytte's 22nd birthday. The Barbours had recently moved from North Carolina to Pennsylvania after tying the knot October 22. LaFerrara married his girlfriend of eight years, Colleen Keeney, in June 2011. The couple did not have children. According to his obituary, LaFerrara was employed as the senior resident engineer at the Lycoming County Landfill. The couple's arrests comes after Richard Beasley was given the death penalty in April this year after luring three men to an Ohio farm by using Craigslist job posts before killing them in cold blood. Mr Barbour has been charged with criminal homicide, aggravated assault, simple assault and criminal conspiracy and possession of instruments of crime. The 22-year-old man told police that he and his wife had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success. It was not until they came across LaFerrara on Craigslist that their plan finally came together. Death wish: Barbour told detectives that he and Miranda had plotted to kill someone in the past, but without success . ‘LaFerrara was just the one with whom it worked,’ Elytte Barbour told police. Earlier this week, Miranda Barbour gave police a different account of what happened. She told prosecutors that she would regularly use Craigslist to meet men for 'companionship', often being paid for the meetings up to $850, according to her husband. But in her first interview, the mom of one insisted that, despite setting up the meeting at the Susquehanna Valley Mall, Hummels Wharf, she didn't go through with it because she was too scared. Later, Barbour’s husband and friend were then interviewed and told officers they knew Barbour she met men who she had encountered online, and that she carried a pocket knife for her own protection. But just a day after her first questioning, Barbour voluntarily went to Selinsgrove state police barracks and asked to speak with investigators with an attorney present. In her second version of events, she said she met LaFerrara on Craigslist and after emailing back and forth, the two decided to meet at the mall, police said. Original sinner: The first 'Craigslist killer' Richard Beasley, above, was convicted in April after posting job vacancies on the site which used the promise of work on an Ohio farm to lure three men to their deaths . Beasley, 53, was convicted of teaming up with a teenager in 2011 to use the promise of jobs on a southeast Ohio farm to lure the men to their deaths. A self-proclaimed street preacher, he killed three men, all of who answered a Craigslist ad for a non-existent job. The slain men were Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Va.; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon. All were looking for a fresh start in life, prosecutors said repeatedly during the trial. The murderer was sentenced to death in April this year, after hearing the details of his crime, Judge Lynne Callahan said 'I think I'm going to be sick. Victims: David Pauley (left) was found buried in a shallow grave in 2011. Police later unearthed the body of Timothy Kern (centre) and Ralph Geiger (right) was the Beasley's third victim . LaFerrara entered Barbour’s vehicle, and once they arrived in Sunbury, LaFerrara told Barbour to pull over, police said. Barbour told police that she parked and LaFerrara began to grope her, touch her private areas and put his hands around her throat. According to the teen, it was then that she reached for the knife and began to stab LaFerrara in a frenzied attack. police said. She said she blacked out and didn’t remember the amount of the times she stabbed him, according to police. She made no mention of her husband playing a role in the killing, or even being present in the car. Controversial: The site will come under fresh scrutiny after its role in the latest death . She drove around the city and found the alley behind Catawissa Avenue. She got out of the vehicle and walked around to the passenger’s door, which LaFerrara was leaning against, opened the door and watched him fall out, police said. Before driving off, the teenager took the man's wallet, the report said. At a secluded spot, she cleaned away as much of the blood as she could before driving on to join her husband at his birthday party in a strip club. It is alleged she threw the knife which was used in the attack into the Susquehanna River, which runs through Sunbury and Selinsgrove.","Miranda Barbour, 18, arranged to meet married engineer Troy LaFerrara in parking lot for sex .

In an interview with the Cuban weekly Girón published on the cubadebate.cu website, Elian, said his experience in Miami when he was six 'charged me for life.' Speaking in his native Spanish, he said his basic rights as a child — 'the right to be with my father, the right to maintain my nationality and remain in my cultural context' — were violated in the United States. When he was young: Elian Gonzalez (R), the young castaway at the center of a dramatic custody battle across the Florida Straits in 2000 was given personal treatment by Cuban President Fidel Castro . Loyalty: 'The right to be with my father, the right to maintain my nationality and remain in my cultural context'  were violated in the United States . 'Those days were very sad for me, which marked me for life', González said Monday. 'It never gave me the chance to think of my mother, who died at sea as a result of the Cuban Adjustment Act,' he said, referring to the 1966 U.S. law that allows any Cuban who reaches the U. S. by any means to be paroled and given residency. Havana has called the law 'murderous' and blamed it for encouraging Cubans to board rickety boats to cross the Florida Straits in the hopes of reaching the U.S. González said he “suffered the consequences of the act.' But he emphasized that “our struggle is not against the American people; it is against their government.' He said. 'From the moment Americans knew of my case, they took to the streets to call for me to be sent back to my country.' Now a military cadet studying industrial engineering, Gonzalez said he would have suffered had he stayed in the United States. Fondness: Fidel Castro for me is like a father,'Gonzalez said in the recent interview. 'I don't profess to have any religion but if I did my God would be Fidel Castro. He is like a ship that knew to take his crew on the right path' The moment: Elian Gonzalez, held by Donato Dalrymple, is taken by U.S. federal agents from his Miami relatives April 22, 2000. U.S. federal authorities stormed the Miami house where Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez was sleeping . He was shy of his sixth birthday on Thanksgiving Day 1999 when a fisherman found him off the coast of Florida, clinging to an inner tube after his mother and nine others fleeing Cuba drowned trying to reach American soil. He was taken to live with relatives in Miami but his father, Juan Miguel, who was separated from his mother and had remained on the island, demanded that the boy be sent back, saying Elian was taken without his consent. The dispute turned into a headline-grabbing international custody battle that weighed heavy on the 2000 presidential race between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Fidel Castro threw the weight of the Cuban government behind the case, mobilizing seven months of massive demonstrations calling for Gonzalez's repatriation. As the two sides fought out the high-profile case in court, U.S. immigration officials decided to put Gonzalez in the custody of his father, who had come to the United States to argue for Elian's return. His relatives in Miami refused to go along, and armed federal agents then raided the home of Gonzalez's uncle and seized the boy. It was one of the few moments since 1959 when the Cold War rivals agreed on something: The U.S. legal system ruled that Gonzalez should be returned to his father.A state celebration was held on the 10th anniversary of his return to Cuba. The reunion: Six-year-old Cuban shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez is carried by a U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service agent April 22 as officials charged into the home of the Miami relatives who had refused to return the 6-year-old to his father .","Elian Gonzalez was returned to Cuba at age 6 after a tragic attempt to get to the U.S.

She's the glamorous former model turned TV chef, riding high with her own BBC show – but behind  the scenes Lorraine Pascale has been dealing with the trauma of a heartbreaking split. Lorraine, 41, has separated from fiance Ged Doherty, a music and film executive, after turning down his offer to move to Los Angeles and settle down together. Sources told The Mail on Sunday how the former Sony Music chairman and chief executive had been keen to move their relationship  to ‘the next level’ after four  years together and set a date  for their marriage. But the insider adds: ‘Lorraine feels that her career has got real momentum at the moment, and didn’t want to make such a big move. She’s settled in London  and everything is really on the up with her TV shows and books – she just couldn’t commit to a move across the Atlantic and the relationship has broken down. ‘Ged is devastated about the break-up, but Lorraine just didn’t feel the timing was right. They’re both very cut up over it.’ Lorraine, whose Christmas recipe guide appears in The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine today, met former Brit Awards boss Ged, now 55, through mutual friends at London’s Claridge’s Hotel in 2009, and since then he has had a major impact on her career and life. The couple dated for some time before Lorraine felt comfortable enough to introduce Ged to her daughter, Ella, who was 13 when the couple met. But they quickly became serious about one another, spending most of their time together at her Chelsea flat . The well-connected media executive, who also runs a movie production company with actor Colin Firth, is said to have been instrumental in negotiating many of her deals. Lorraine, meanwhile, supported him when he lost his job as Sony Music’s most senior UK manager in 2011, encouraging him to start up his own business. Lorraine was unwilling to leave behind her success on cooking shows in England, such as Home Cooking Made Easy . Devastated: Ged (pictured right, with Annie Lennox and Lorraine, left) wanted marriage, claims a source . The source added: ‘Lorraine’s friends thought she had really settled with Ged and it seemed like it was going to last. Obviously they got engaged, which was a huge step, but she just didn’t feel able to commit and there doesn’t seem to be any way back for them. ‘It’s very sad that it has ended like this. She hasn’t had much luck with relationships over the years.’Her hit BBC television series – including Fast, Fresh And Easy Food and Home Cooking Made Easy – air in more than 60 countries and have resulted in several bestselling cookery books. But despite her professional success, Lorraine has been unlucky  in love since her marriage to Polish musician Count Kaz Balinski-Jundzill ended in divorce. The pair married in 1995 and had Ella the following year, but separated in  2000. She later admitted the decision to tie the knot in her early 20s was ‘a bit of a gamble’. Lorraine is said to have been wary of serious relationships since but was linked for a short time to Princess Diana’s property developer confidant Christopher Whalley. And she told a biographer: ‘You don’t trust that anything will last. What I’ve done is accepted that it’s part of who I am.  I don’t try to fight it any more.’ A spokesman for Lorraine declined to comment on the break-up.","TV chef is said to be 'cut up' over collapse of relationship with music exec .

Prince Harry’s dream of winning a 200-mile race across the Antarctic has been shattered by a string of injuries among the team and safety fears, it was announced last night. Instead of racing to the South Pole, Harry and his companions will continue trekking to their destination over less dangerous terrain. Announcing last night that the team was no longer racing, expedition director Ed Parker admitted that the terrain, weather and altitude – 8,000ft above sea-level – had got the better of everyone.

Working together: Prince Harry, pictured centre dressed in black next to his Walking With The Wounded teammates on December 5, will still complete the challenge but the teams will no longer race to the finish line . United: Prince Harry pictured on December 5 with a member of Team Commonwealth, Heath Jamieson, ahead of organisers calling off the race because conditions are 'far harder' than expected . Three teams of wounded service . personnel from Britain, the USA and Australia and Canada were trying to . race to the Pole to raise money for injured soldiers in a contest . organised by the charity Walking with the Wounded.

Tough conditions: Chris Downey, a member of Team Commonwealth, is pictured trudging through the snow during the Walking With The Wounded challenge . One . of Harry’s companions, Sgt Duncan Slater, 34, said: ‘People have been . suffering big time. Most people have got horrible dry, hacking coughs . due to the weather.’ In . a statement on the charity’s website last night, Ed Parker said: ‘It . became obvious that underneath the concrete determination of all the . team members, the harsh reality of the Antarctic was starting to take . its toll. ‘It was . becoming evident that there was a higher degree of stress imposed on the . team members, due to unprecedented terrain on the plateau. ‘With careful consultation from our doctor and the race team, we have put the race on hold. ‘The reason for this is entirely simple – safety, which remains the core principle of our expeditions.’ Inspiring: Every one of the prince's team-mates has lost at least one limb serving in Afghanistan . Prince Harry, pictured on the first day of the trek on December 1, and his teammates are expected to complete the challenge on December 17 . Parker’s . decision was backed by Harry’s team leader, Guy Disney, who described . the first four days of the trek as a ‘full-out slog’.

A family of three - including a 10-year-old girl - have been killed in their home at an upscale Florida gated community and police say their bodies decomposed for up to three weeks before anyone found them. Marcio Ferraz do Amaral, 45, his wife Cledione, 34, and their young daughter were only discovered Saturday when their landlord sent someone to check on them at their house on Lake Nona near Orlando because they were behind on rent. The property manager who knocked on the door of the Ferraz do Amaral home was greeted with a horrible odor of rotting flesh. Deputies broke down the door and found the family dead in the garage - all the bodies were partially decomposed. Gated: The family was found dead in a private, gated community that sits on a golf course. Authorities say they could have been dead for three weeks before their bodies were discovered . Now detectives are scrambling to determine how the family died. There was no sign of forced entry into the house. There appears to be no sign of trauma on any of the bodies. Police are investigating the possibility that the family died in a murder-suicide plot. The Orlando Sentinel reports that the Ferraz do Amarals appeared to be a normal, happy family. Marcio was a pilot for a Brazilian airline. Cledione worked part time at Disney. They had been living the home in the exclusive Eagle Creek subdivision for five years. 'They were always very nice. No problems,' Gerald Mastro, the family's longtime friend and their landlord, told the Sentinel. 'When we went to Florida, we always visited them,' Mr Mastro, who lives in Chicago, said. Trouble in paradise: The family's landlord said that they were three months behind on their rent and had recently experienced financial hardship . Mr Mastro told the Sentinel that the family had fallen into financial hardship recently. Marcio stopped earning money from his job with the airline and Cledione's income from Disney was not enough to keep them afloat. The family fell three months behind on rent. Cledione emailed Mr Mastro in November to apologize for being late on the rent. She promised to FedEx the money to him. Mr Mastro waited three weeks and did not hear anything from the family. That's when he sent a property manager to the house to check on them.","Marcio Ferraz do Amaral, 45, his wife Cledione, 34, and their daughter, were found dead in Florida gated community .

In its second weekend at the box office, the Disney animated tale 'Frozen' finally cooled off 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,' while the week's lone new wide-release ""Out of the Furnace"" wasn't a match for either blockbuster. According to studio estimates Sunday, 'Frozen' led the multiplexes with a haul of $31.6million over the weekend, taking over the top spot from 'Catching Fire.' Lionsgate's 'Hunger Games' sequel had topped the box office for the last two weeks, but slid to second with $27million in its third week of release. Relativity Media's steel-town drama 'Out of the Furnace,' starring Christian Bale and Casey Affleck, posed no challenge for the bigger blockbuster holdovers. It opened with $5.3million, good enough for third place on what's typically a quiet early December weekend, sandwiched between Thanksgiving and the coming holiday season releases. Scroll down for video . Top dog: Anna (left), voiced by Kristen Bell, Olaf (center), voiced by Josh Gad, and Kristoff (right), voiced by Jonathan Groff in a scene from the animated feature 'Frozen' But it was an excellent weekend for Hollywood, with box office up 16.9 percent over the same weekend last year. Opening in a limited release of four theaters, the Coen brothers' folk tale 'Inside Llewyn Davis' also had one of the year's highest per-theater averages of $100,500 for CBS Films. With only a handful of moviegoing weeks left in the year, the strong weekend boosts the year's chances of exceeding 2012's record box office. This year may surpass last year's $10.8billion domestic box office, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Rentrak. 'We're running just slightly ahead of last year's record pace,' said Mr Dergarabedian. 'It's going to be really close.' Mr Dergarabedian expects next week's big release, Warner Bros.' 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,' to open in the neighborhood of Peter Jackson's first 'Hobbit' film, 'An Unexpected Journey,' which debuted with $84.6million last year. This weekend's new releases were minimal since 'The Hobbit' is expected to dominate the marketplace next weekend. Both 'Frozen' and 'Catching Fire' continued to show legs around the world. 'Catching Fire' added $44.3million internationally, bringing its global cumulative total to $673.4million over four weeks. With many millions still to come, 'Catching Fire' has already almost equaled the $691.2million worldwide of the 2012 original. 'Frozen,' too, has found strong business abroad. It added $30.6million internationally over the weekend. In its second week of limited release, the Weinstein Co.'s biopic 'Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom,' starring Idris Elba, continued to play in four theaters, earning an average of $19,400 per-theater. The Weinstein Co. has said it's not altering the movie's release following the death of South African leader Nelson Mandela on Thursday. ""Mandela"" opens wide on Christmas. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

Some parents intent on being different have thrown out the most common baby names this year in favor of some very peculiar monikers. At least three newborns were named Cheese this year, for example. And that’s just the boys. On the girls side came such out-of-left field choices as Kukua and Kiwi. Scroll down for full list... Odd man out:  While searching for the most popular baby names of 2013, the website BabyCenter stumbled upon some of the weirdest . The parenting website BabyCenter put together their list of the most common baby names of the year after surveying half a million parents. While the decidedly unscientific method of simply asking around yielded some expected results—Sophia, Emma, Olivia, Jackson, and Aiden top among them—it also uncovered some oddities. The survey found that at least three parents out of the half a million had named their new baby things like Cheese, Thirdy, Enno, and Rocket. And those are just a few of the stranger boys names. My son the car: At least three parents named their sons after the Chevrolet motor company in 2013 . The weird girl names include Archita, Blip, Nyx, and Ezgi. While some seem random, others among the bizarre names have a familiar ring to them. Wrigley, for instance, conjures images of the glory days of baseball in Chicago. Though it should be noted, it’s on the girl list. Ajax isn’t just a bath and tile scrub but also a classical soldier’s name. It’s on the boy list. Two for one: For girls, Wrigley was named as one of the oddest baby names of the year. And Cub was one of the boy names . In addition to Cheese, other food related names include Danish, Kiwi and Chow. Bears were also a popular inspiration. Included on the weird name list were Cub, Kodiak, and Panda (all boys). Like the top names in BabyCenter’s survey, the bottom names are just a guess at the oddest names of 2013. The official list won’t be released until May. However, the top names will likely be the names we see popping up everywhere like Ava, Zoe, Lily, Aiden, and Mason.

Portable pot vaporizers known as 'vapes' or 'pocket hookahs' are encouraging minors to smoke marijuana, critics have claimed, because they make it so easy to hide. The products, which have boomed in recent years with the rise of electronic cigarettes, can look like nondescript writing pens, asthma inhalers or lip-gloss sticks or hang on gold neck chains. But the fact they can be so well disguised is concerning groups who are worried about keeping legalized pot out of the hands of youths. Discreet: Portable pot vaporizers known as 'vapes' or 'pocket hookahs' are encouraging minors to smoke marijuana, critics have claimed, because they make it so easy to hide . 'This is incredibly concerning,' Colorado Tobacco Education and Prevention Alliance executive director Bob Doyle told the Denver Post. 'The . marijuana vaporizing industry is as advanced or more advanced than the . e-cigarette industry. The products are appealing to kids, and they . promote the ability to hide marijuana use.' The . tiny electronic devices, which are charged with small wall plug-ins, . were dubbed 'the iPod of getting baked' in the June issue of Rolling . Stone magazine. Marihuana users fill the chambers of the vaporizers with dried weed or with butter, waxes or oils processed from marijuana. 'There is serious potency in these,' said Doyle. Booming: The products, which have boomed in recent years with the rise of electronic cigarettes, can look like nondescript writing pens, asthma inhalers or lip-gloss sticks or hang on gold neck chains . He added that high school students are sometimes even using the tiny, odorless devices on campus. Thousands of brands have sprung up with questionable names such as Trippy Stix, Vapbong, E-Buzz. RemPen and Puffit-X. Michael Mahaney, whose wife owns a store that sells vaporizers in Englewood, told the Denver Post that the devices were increasingly popular. 'They came on the market a couple years ago, and they've really picked up steam. It seems like everybody and their brother are selling these,' he said. While they do not sell to minors, he acknowledged that young people were easily able to purchase the vaporizers online. But Safer Alternative for Enjoyable Recreation co-founder Mason Tvert said it was 'absurd' to suggest the devices were encouraging kids to use pot. 'These products are not made, marketed or sold for kids,' Tvert told the newspaper.","Portable pot vaporizers have boomed in recent years with the rise of electronic cigarettes .

The official announcement will be made . in the next few days and Khan has already pulled out of his  challenge . to world welterweight champion Devon Alexander, scheduled for December 7 . in New York, to ensure that his dream fight with Mayweather is not . jeopardised. Khan is being . given this opportunity of a lifetime thanks to a conviction in America . that his exceptional speed will present a unique test to Mayweather, who . has dealt imperiously with all threats from bigger and supposedly . stronger foes. Stephen . Espinosa, head of sports for the giant Showtime cable TV network which . bankrolls both men, says: ‘Floyd has seen off the tough, heavy . punchers. It remains to be seen what he will do against extreme speed . and I like the Khan fight very much.’ Khan . had already begun preparing in California to face Alexander and will . remain almost permanently in camp there with his new trainer Virgil . Hunter for the next seven months. Mayweather . had expressed interest in fighting at Wembley but reliable sources in . America confirm that prospect has been discounted on financial grounds. Not . only would an early-afternoon timing in the US compromise pay-per-view . takings there but even a live gate of 70,000 at the stadium would . generate revenue of no more than £7million. There are also significant . tax benefits from boxing in Nevada. Reaching out: Mayweather lands a punch against Alvarez as he extended his unbeaten record . On the defensive: Khan was unconvincing in his victory over Diaz but has the fight he wanted . Mayweather’s . master-class victory over Canelo Alvarez broke the $20m (£12.5m) barrier for ticket sales at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in . Vegas, while Showtime pay-per-view subscriptions reached $157m… and rising. Khan’s . chance comes even though, as a two-time world light-welterweight . champion, he lost his belts in successive bouts with Lamont Peterson and . Danny Garcia. Even though . he has redeemed himself with comeback victories over Carlos Molina and . another former world champion, Julio Diaz, he will be viewed in some . quarters as jumping the queue to board the Mayweather money train. However, . the ring’s newest mantra is ‘speed kills’ and Golden Boy, the promoters . of both men, will be using that special asset of Khan’s as a . foundation of the massive marketing campaign to come. That . will include a TV documentary series, with the episodes focusing on . Khan providing an exotic and fascinating insight into the life and times . of the world’s pre-eminent, newly-wed Asian boxer. There will also be a multi-city promotional tour in the new year, which will bring Mayweather to Britain. Out of the ring: Mayweather at a basketball game and (below) Khan and his wife Faryal at Wimbledon . Initial . public reaction is likely to be that Khan has little chance against the . the superlative ring craftsman of his generation and he will enter the . betting as a heavy underdog. Those . odds are likely to shorten, however, as boxing weighs up all the . factors surrounding the most extraordinary evening of Khan’s existence. While Mayweather . is nothing short of being a genius in the ring he struggled in the early . rounds against the speed of Zab Judah – who Khan KO’d in six -  before . securing a points victory. Nor is he a one-punch knockout artist like the two men to have stopped Khan, namely Garcia and Breidis Prescott. Mayweather . is more a cumulative puncher and when he stopped Ricky Hatton six years . ago the concussive effect was compounded by Manchester’s Hitman . striking his head against a corner post as he went down. High-profile defeat: Khan lost first to Lamont Peterson (above) and then to Danny Garcia who knocked him out . Then . there is the age factor.  Khan, who will be 27 in December, is 10 . years younger than Mayweather, who has announced that he is in the . final stages of his career. This . will be the third in his series of six fights with Showtime on a . contract expected to net him more than $200m. He has banked $41.5m from his virtuoso performance against Canelo, with more to come . when figures are in for overseas TV and merchandising revenue. It . is unclear whether he will box on beyond the end of that contract in . the autumn of 2015. That decision is likely to depend on whether he . shows signs of slowing down. Older boxers can hit the age barrier at any . moment, virtually without notice. While . that is unlikely to afflict Mayweather as early next May, the interim . does give Khan the time to be in the most potent condition of his life. Challenge: But Khan has been told to up his dedication to 100 per cent to reach Mayweather's level . All smiles: But Mayweather (centre) has warned Khan (left) is has to earn the right to fight him . Khan has promised Hunter that he will eschew his celebrity lifestyle of . late, after his trainer warned that nothing less will do from now on than Mayweather’s exemplary, rigorous commitment to ‘hard work and . dedication.’ He will have to . remain grounded through the star-spangled hype which will precede this . happening of immense sporting magnitude, complete with its chat show . appearances on network television. And . where Alvarez whipped up the support and hard cash of tens of millions . of his Mexican fans, Khan will be expected to excite massive interest in . Asian communities in America, Britain, the Middle East and across the . world. No matter how wary . the British reservations may be about his chances of dethroning the . great Mayweather, there is certain to be a trans-Atlantic invasion of . Las Vegas next spring. Invasion: Las Vegas was taken over when 30,000 Brits travelled to see Ricky Hatton take on Mayweather . While . the number of supporters following Khan may not reach the 30,000 who . made the pilgrimage for Hatton’s tilt at Mayweather in 2007, the British . interest seems certain to push the MGM gate revenue record for boxing . in Nevada even higher. And, . in one crucial sense, the belief that Mayweather is omnipotent works . heavily in favour of our highest profile ambassador for Anglo-Moslem . relations. Khan is totally convinced that his speed and skills can overcome Mayweather. Even if he fails in that ambitious bid for ultimate ring glory, no-one will think any the worse of him. And . if he were to lose heroically in a terrific fight he will enjoy . enormous exposure and acclaim around the world – with his market value . for future world title challenges as significantly enhanced as his . experience of the mega-occasion. This, for Khan, this, is a  no-lose situation.","$200m bout in May will be richest to involve a British boxer .

A powerful storm that crept across the country dropped snow, freezing rain and sleet on the Mid-Atlantic region and headed northeast Sunday, turning NFL playing fields in Pennsylvania into winter wonderlands, dumping a foot of snow in Delaware and threatening a messy Monday commute in the northeast corridor. The storm forced the cancellation of thousands of flights across the U.S. and slowed traffic on roads, leading to a number of accidents, including a fatal crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike near Morgantown that led to a series of fender-benders involving 50 cars that stranded some motorists for up to seven hours. More than two dozen vehicles were involved in another series of crashes on nearby Interstate 78. What was forecast in the Philadelphia area to be a tame storm system with about an inch of snow gradually changing over to rain mushroomed into a full-blown snowstorm that snarled mid-afternoon traffic along Interstate 95 in Pennsylvania from the Delaware to New Jersey state lines.

Emily Ortega, 21, gave birth in a destroyed airport compound that was turned into a makeshift medical centre, with her bed a piece of dirty plywood resting amid dirt, broken glass, twisted metal, nails and other debris. 'She is so beautiful. I will name her Bea Joy in honour of my mother, Beatriz,' Ortega whispered shortly after giving birth. Scroll down for video . Safe delivery: Cheers broke out this morning when 21-year old Emily Ortega gave birth to a baby girl in the city of Tacloban.  Bea Joy is carried by her aunt . Ortega said her mother was swept away . when giant waves generated by Super Typhoon Haiyan surged into their . home near Tacloban city, the capital of Leyte province which was one of . the worst-hit areas, and she has not been seen since. More than 10,000 people are believed . to have died in Leyte, and many hundreds on other islands across the . central Philippines, which would make Haiyan the country's worst . recorded natural disaster. But, in the most tragic of circumstances, Bea Joy restarted the cycle of life. 'She is my miracle. I had thought I . would die with her still inside me when high waves came and took us all . away,' she said, as her teary-eyed husband, Jobert, clasped the baby and . a volunteer held an IV drip above them. Miracle birth: New-born baby Bea Joy is held as mother Emily Ortega, 21, rests after giving birth at an improvised clinic at Tacloban airport .

He said the entire community had been . washed away, with the once picturesque area replaced by rubble and the . bloated remains of people and animals. 'We are supposed to be celebrating today, but we are also mourning our dead,' Jobert said. He said it was God's will that he found his wife floating amongst the debris.

The couple and their surviving . neighbours subsisted there until Monday morning only on bottles of water . they found among the debris. Jobert said he knew that his wife was . about to give birth any day, but no help or aid had come. 'She began labour at 5:00 am (Monday) so we had to walk several kilometres before a truck driver hitched us a ride,' he said. The young military doctor who . attended to her, Captain Victoriano Sambale, said the new mother had . already broken her waters by the time the couple stepped inside the . building, and then developed bleeding during the delivery. 'This is the first time we have . delivered a baby here. The baby is fine and we have managed to stop the . bleeding of the mother,' he said. However, he cautioned doctors were . extremely concerned about potential infections that could easily be . caught amid the unsterile conditions, with the medical team almost . powerless now to help her.

The president of PayPal has had his credit card details skimmed and used for an illegal shopping spree. David Marcus believes his credit card, which had the more secure EMV chip technology, was skimmed during a recent trip to the UK. The business executive added that the fraud would never have happened if he had been able to use his PayPal account in the shops and hotel he visited. Fraud victim: PayPal president David Marcus had his credit card details stolen and used for a shopping spree . Mr Marcus said that because PayPal doesn't share card or bank account details with merchants, unlike credit cards, it is a safer way to pay. The traditional magnetic strip on the back of cards contains all the information a would-be thief needs to steal data, and even EMV chip cards can be hacked into. On Monday, Mr Marcus tweeted about the fraudulent activity on his account, saying: 'My card (with EMV chip) got skimmed while in the UK. Ton of fraudulent txns. Wouldn't have happened if merchant accepted PayPal...' 'They then cloned it and went on a shopping spree,' he added. Although his card had an EMV chip - an embedded microchip that uses a PIN to verify transactions - it also had the traditional magnetic strip. 'Basically, the magnetic strip contains all the data needed for credit card fraud,' Lamar Bailey, director of security research for Tripwire, told Forbes. Secure: PayPal protects customers by never handing over details of their bank accounts . 'Unfortunately, these strips are very easy to read and duplicate and are a favorite target for a wide variety of financial fraud,' he said. Data thieves use skimmers, a device fitted to the front of an ATM or terminal, which lifts information from swiped cards. The technology has been around for years, but thieves are constantly improving it, cyber security expert Brian Krebs told USA Today. PayPal takes customer security further by never handing over their financial information. The company has been tried to expand from its online presence, and encourage stores and restaurants to accept PayPal as a method of payment. 'Obfuscating card data online, on . mobile, and now more and more offline remains one of PayPal's strongest . value props,' Mr Marcus tweeted, after announcing he had been a victim of fraud.","David Marcus says his card details were used to pay for 'thousands of transactions'

I'll be flying with my 10 wk old son and he won't nurse with a cover or take a bottle. Thanks [sic].' The Newport Beach, California native was shocked when Delta responded: 'Lindsay unfortunately you are not able to breastfeed if you don't have a cover up. I'm sorry.' Scroll down for video . Heated debate: Delta Airlines has sparked a huge Twitter backlash after telling passenger Lindsay Jaynes (pictured) she wasn't allowed to breastfeed her ten-week-old son on a plane without covering herself up . Exchange: When the Newport Beach, California native tweeted to Delta that her baby won't nurse with a cover or take a bottle, the company responded: 'Unfortunately you are not able to breastfeed if you don't have a cover' Delta has since apologized, calling the tweet 'miscommunication' - but not before it sparked a massive online debate. Determined to get a legitimate reason from the company, Ms Jaynes wrote to them: 'My flight is six hours and he needs to eat every two hours. What do you suggest?' 'I would suggest pumping if you can and bringing it on board with you. You are allowed to bring breast milk on board,' the company responded. Ms Jaynes posted the conversation online, quickly drawing angry feedback from breastfeeding support groups and other activists. TheBabyGuy NYC picked up on the exchange, which drew more than 1,600 comments when he shared it on Facebook. Controversy: Breastfeeding in public is legal in all 50 states, and 45 states specifically allow it anywhere. Still, companies continue to come under fire for telling mothers to take their nursing babies elsewhere . Hot topic: Ms Jaynes posted the conversation online, quickly drawing angry feedback from breastfeeding support groups and other activists who disagreed with Delta's statements . 'That is so stupid,' wrote one person. 'If others don't want to see it then they don't need to stare. How rude. Would they rather a screaming baby?' Another remarked: 'At ten weeks I couldn't even pump enough to last through one feeding. 'If others don't want to see it, they don't need to stare. Would they rather a screaming baby?' 'Pumping produces significant less milk in many women. It is not a reasonable option for some.' Several hours after sparking the heated debate, Ms Jaynes again tweeted to Delta, writing: 'So even though I am legally allowed to breastfeed without a cover, you're saying I can't? Is there a Delta written policy?' This time, another rep responded: 'Delta welcomes breastfeeding mothers and babies on our flights. We apologize for the misinformation earlier.' Apology: Finally, another rep responded to Ms Jaynes: 'Delta welcomes breastfeeding mothers and babies on our flights. We apologize for the misinformation earlier' That night, Delta called her to formally apologize, but the company still apparently refused to post its breastfeeding policy online, despite her requests. Breastfeeding in public is legal in all 50 states, and 45 states specifically allow it anywhere. Still, companies continue to come under fire for telling mothers to take their nursing babies elsewhere. In 2006, Delta sparked controversy yet again for telling mother Emily Gillette to leave a flight for refusing to cover her breast while she breastfed her baby. Six years later, she reached an undisclosed settlement with the airline.","Lindsay Jaynes tweeted to Delta Assist asking for their breastfeeding policy since her ten-week-old son won't nurse with a cover or take a bottle .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:35 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:38 EST, 24 February 2014 . Authorities are looking for three Asian men suspected of gang raping and beating a University of California, Santa Barbara student. The 19-year-old woman was attacked by several men sometime between 11pm Saturday and 4am Sunday, Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kelly Hoover said. The student was not sure where the attack happened, but it was either on the school's campus or in the neighboring community of Isla Vista, Hoover said. Scene of the crime: The student said the attack happened somewhere between the UCSB campus and Isla Vista . Sheriff's deputies and UCSB police were searching the campus Sunday, trying to determine where the alleged crime took place. 'The group acted together to commit the crime,' the spokeswoman said. The woman was able to return to her residence and tell her roommate. She was then taken to a local hospital for treatment. There were no known witnesses, and the woman's name was not being released. 'We have two really big challenges in this case: there were no witnesses that we know of, and we donâ€™t have much detail as to the description of the suspects,' Hoover told KTLA. 'Right now, what we have to go on is that the suspects are described as Asian males. Obviously this is a lot for the victim to go through, so we are working with her to try and get a better description and to find who did this,' Hoover added to CBS Los Angeles. At large: Sheriff's deputies and UCSB police were scouring the campus and Isla Vista Sunday looking for the three suspects . On Sunday, sheriff's deputies and UC Santa Barbara police appealed for the public's help. 'It's a very active investigation,' Hoover said. The Santa Barbara News-Press reported that another woman was sexually assaulted in Isla Vista early Saturday. Authorities said the assailant met the woman outside a party and took her behind a car, where he assaulted her. He remained at large. Hoover said investigators didn't know whether the crimes are related. The string of recent sex assaults has led many women on campus to fear for their safety.

RIP: Elizabeth Turner seemed like the all American girl but she was hiding a deadly heroin addiction that would eventually spell her doom . The bereaved family of a promising young Georgia student whose life was cut tragically short by a heroin overdose has spoken about their heartbreak a year after her death. Elizabeth Turner was a gifted athlete, scholar and the best daughter a mother could have asked for but her all-American looks and attitude were helping hide a deadly secret. 'She was perfect,' said her mother Teresa Turner. Or at least that's how the popular young woman appeared. Her mother recounts to the Marietta Daily Journal what a shock it was when it all came out in the wash that their squeaky clean little girl began experimenting with hard drugs at just 16 years old. Elizabeth kept her grades up and never got home past curfew. However, unbeknownst to her family she was spending here weekends taking prescription drugs, marijuana and drinking alcohol. 'She hid it very well. She fooled a lot of us,' said her sister Jennifer Echolf. Elizabeth enrolled at Auburn University in 2006 but her partying quickly took its toll on her grades. For the first time in her life, Teresa Turner's daughter was failing classes and by the end of her first year away at college she was addicted to OxyContin. The Turners pulled Elizabeth from college and began a struggle to keep her clean that lasted for six arduous years. Scroll down for video . Grieving: Turner died a year ago Feb 11 and her family gathered to pay their respects and release balloons at her grave. Some family members have also opened up about her shocking death a year after the fact . According to her family, sixteen of Elizabeth's friends died during those years. However, there were periods when the future appeared bright for Elizabeth. She enrolled in classes and even received a scholarship from Kennesaw State University. She would later receive a dental assitance certificate from another area school. At the time of her death, Elizabeth was waiting tables full time at an Italian restaurant, interning at a dental office and even attending regular addiction meetings. 'She hid it very well. She fooled a lot of us': Elizabeth was using prescription drugs throughout much of high school but her family says it wasn't apparent that she had a problem until her straight-A's became failing grades during her first semester at Auburn . Struggle: Elizabeth moved home after freshman year. There were moments when her future seemed bright once again, but she ultimately lost her battle despite the successes after years of going in and out of rehab . She left home to go to one such meeting on February 8, 2012 and never returned. She overdosed at a friend's house and was declared brain dead three days later. 'She was the all-American child, but she walked into something and never looked back,' Echolf said. And according to area officials, Elizabeth's story has become increasingly common. 'It’s on the rise,' said Mike Gerhard with the Medical Examiner’s office of Cobb County, where 84 people died of heroin overdose in 2013, up from 50 people the year before. As a way to cope with her own loss and to give others an outlet for dealing with their grief, Elizabeth's sister-in-law Shanon Turner created the website and accompanying Facebook page No Heroin in Heaven. The site links to resources for those struggling with addiction. She started it just last month, but it has already drawn hundreds of thousands of comments from users who've lost loved ones to drugs. 'It just blew up,' Turner said. 'We were absolutely shocked because not only is everyone being supported, this has built a community. It has become a full-time job. We are just one story. Together, everyone’s advice can help the community.' 'She was the all-American child, but she walked into something and never looked back,' said Elizabeth's sister Jennifer Echolf . 'She was the all-American child': Elizabeth spent her childhood winning awards for her swimming and scholarship only to see all she'd worked so hard for taken away .","Elizabeth Turner of Acworth, Georgia died of a heroin overdose on February 11, 2013 .

The family of a Georgia mom fears for her safety as she hasn't been seen or heard from since leaving a Walmart in September. Tiffany Michelle Whitton, a 27-year-old mother of a young girl, was last seen leaving a Walmart on Cobb Parkway in Marietta on September 13 of last year. Whitton, who once had a very strong presence on social media, hasn't updated her Facebook page since September 1. Missing: Tiffany Whitton, a 27-year-old mother, hasn't been seen or heard from since September . Without a trace: Whitton, who was very active on social media, hasn't updated her Facebook page since September . 'She really has kind of disappeared without a trace,' Marietta Police Department spokesman David Baldwin told CBS News Atlanta. 'Nobody has spoken to her, seen her, and there have been no phone . calls.' Her family has setup a Facebook page dedicated to finding the young mother, who identifies herself on Facebook as a 'former Hooters girl.' 'My daughter, Tiffany Whitton, has been missing since September 12, 2013. The police are involved but we need leads in order to find her. She has many friends and family members, all of whom are very worried and want to find her,' a message posted on the page says. 'We have no idea if she is missing because she chooses to be or if her safety is in jeopardy. All we do know is where she was last seen and that we want desperately to find her. If you have seen her or have any information as to her whereabouts, please send me a message on this page or contact Marietta Police at 770-794-5325. Thank you for your prayers and your support. We greatly appreciate all of you!' Vanished: Whitton was last seen leaving this WalMart in Marietta, Georgia, on September 13 . Baldwin says the investigation is a priority for authorities, and that Whitton's family - especially her young daughter - deserve to know what happened to her. 'That's probably one of the most concerning points is the fact that she does have a small child,' said Baldwin. In 2011, Whitton was charged with robbery, burglary (forced entry, residence), possession and use of drug-related objects, and giving false name/address/DOB to a law enforcement officer for an alleged home invasion authorities suspected was over a drug-deal-gone-wrong. According to Chattanooga.com, Whitton and several others went to a home in Dalton and kicked down the door as one of the alleged victims ran and hid in a bathroom. The victim's husband told authorities that after the group broke into the house, he witnessed a male suspect banging on the bathroom door with a tire iron as the man's wife was hiding inside and on the phone with police. Arrested: Whitton was arrested for breaking into a house in 2011 over what authorities suspect was a drug-deal-gone-wrong . When the suspects realized police had been called they left the house, but took the victim's purse. Both witnesses knew Whitton and identified her as one of the people who broke into her home. Following her arrest, Whitton told authorities that the victim had stolen $60 from her earlier in the day and that she and the others had gone to the victim's house to get the money back. Whitton told detectives that the money was stolen from her when she met the victim at a WalMart and the two chatted in her car. Authorities suspected that the $60 was part of a drug deal for pills that were never delivered. Whitton is described as being 5-foot-2, 100 pounds with green eyes and blonde hair that she frequently dyes different colors. She has several tattoos, including Chinese symbols on her left wrist and a butterfly on her hip.","Tiffany Whitton was last seen leaving a WalMart in Marietta, Georgia, on September 13 .

"By . David Martosko, Us Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 14:06 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 15:52 EST, 24 February 2014 . Kesha Rogers is an unconventional African-American Texan: She wants President Obama removed from office and she's happy to draw a Hitler moustache on poster-size photos of him – and she's eager to expose London bankers as the string-pullers behind everything that's wrong with the world. She's also running for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat, and leading the pack. The state-wide party isn't amused. Rogers ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012 and won the Democratic primary both times, despite being trounced in both general elections by Republican Rep. Pete Olson. In 2012 her campaign produced an anti-Obama music video, set to the tune of the Mary Poppins hit 'Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious' – titled 'Super-Ego-Genocidal-Narcissist-Psychosis!' It's little wonder the Texas Democratic establishment wants some distance. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Kesha Rogers, a Texas Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, collects supporters with roadside signs depicting President Obama as an impeachment-worthy Nazi . That's not Michelle: African-American Kesha Rogers (L) is waging a knife-in-the-teeth campaign for the U.S. Senate and is leading all Democrats, even though her own party wants nothing to do with her . Do they think they're voting for Ke$ha? The latest Texas Tribune poll shows Rogers outpacing the well-funded David Alameel and every other Democrat . The state-wide party has 'attempted to hide our campaign from their websites,' her campaign manager Ian Overton told Mailonline. And the influential African American Political Alliance 'have purposefully said she's running in a different race than for U.S. Senate.' 'The Texas [Democratic Party] executive committee has passed resolutions condemning her candidacy and denying all support or acknowledgments,' Overton said. 'They are more committed to sinking with the ship than returning to the Constitution.' Her coffers are almost empty, with barely $2,500 on hand and less than $27,000 in total donations. Yet she leads the rest of the Democratic field, according to a new Texas Tribune poll. The practical oddness of Rogers' platform, which also includes 'interplanetary defense' and Mars colonization – so the U.S. can shoot down asteroids approaching the earth – comes from her allegiance to Lyndon LaRouche, a 91-year-old conspiracy theorist who spent five years in federal prison for fraud in the early 2000s. LaRouche, she has said, is 'the world’s leading economic forecaster.' He also claims to have invented the Strategic Defense Initiative, President Ronald Reagan's proposed 'Star Wars' missile shield program. Conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche has attracted a global following of mostly young idealogues with his anti-establishment messages . Rogers doesn't run from the Lyndon LaRouche name, even though critics call him a cultist and a lunatic . The perennial presidential candidate's broader set of goals includes the restoration of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which prohibited commercial banks from doubling as investment speculators. He also wants to end the NSA's wiretapping programs and re-tune the world's orchestras a hair lower than normal. Rogers advocates for more NASA funding so it can engage in 'planetary defense' by stationing missiles on the moon to intercept asteroids as they hurtle toward the earth . Overton upped the ante from the concert hall by insisting that the Obama administration is 'supporting the swastika wearing Nazi Svoboda Party' in Ukraine. 'This is putting us directly into a thermonuclear war confrontation with Russia,' he said in an email. Rogers has turned heads with her Hitler-moustachioed Obama posters, as much as for her other 'far out stuff,' columnist David Freddoso told MailOnline. 'What can I say?' Freddoso shrugged. 'LaRouche is a nut and he has a big following. Often, when tea partiers are blamed for ""Hitler=Obama"" signs, it's actually the LaRouchies.' It was Freddoso who brought Rogers a wave of perhaps unwanted attention on Monday with an entry in his Conservative Intelligence Briefing blog. The Dallas Morning News, he noted, wrote that she 'has compared the Affordable Care Act to 1930s-era Nazi eugenics policies.' Regarding the Mary Poppins cover tune, he insisted he was 'not making this up.'","African-American candidate polls higher than other Democrats, but the party wants nothing to do with her .

Taco Bell is readying for the launch of its breakfast menu at all 5,500 locations on March 27, with items such as the A.M. Crunchwrap designed to appeal to its fan base of younger men. The addition of breakfast will be the largest menu expansion for Taco Bell in the chain's 50-year history. And the chain says breakfast will be available until 11am â€” a half hour longer than McDonald's offers its Egg McMuffins. 'We can turn the breakfast conversation into a two horse race,' Taco Bell president Brian Niccol said in an interview, noting that Taco Bell intends to be a 'strong No. 2' after McDonald's. Scroll down for full menu . Waffle Tacos for breakfast: Taco Bell will start serving breakfast at all 5,500 U.S. locations starting March 27 . McDonald's has long been the fast-food leader in the mornings, with its popular Sausage Biscuits, Hotcakes and other items pulling in roughly 20 per cent of the company's U.S. sales. But the chain has been facing stiffer competition in recent years, with competitors such as Starbucks and Subway rolling out breakfast sandwiches as well. It's not clear how Taco Bell's entry into breakfast will alter the fast-food landscape. Last year, an executive with Taco Bell's parent company Yum Brands said that breakfast accounted for about 4 per cent of sales in locations where it was tested. But that was before the chain put its full marketing might behind the menu, he noted. McDonald's, which has more than 14,000 U.S. locations, has also said it plans to step up its marketing of breakfast this year as it faces intensifying competition. The president of McDonald's USA, Jeff Stratton, said that the chain is in the early stages of looking at whether it can extend its breakfast hours. Stratton noted that cutting off breakfast . on the weekends at 10:30am 'doesn't go very well' with people in their . 20s and 30s in particular. Still, figuring out how to serve both . breakfast and lunch poses an operational challenge given the limited . kitchen space in restaurants. Watch your back Egg McMuffin: The chain is expanding to breakfast in order to compete with McDonald's . In the meantime, Kevin Newell, U.S. brand and strategy officer for McDonald's, seemed unfazed in an interview late last week by Taco Bell's plans to start serving breakfast. 'I think they're going to find that going into the breakfast business is not like what they're accustomed to, in terms of marketing,' Newell said. The addition of breakfast is a major undertaking that requires training existing workers, hiring more staff to cover morning shifts and buying new equipment. Taco Bell, for instance, is bringing in new equipment to its nearly 6,000 U.S. locations to start serving coffee for the first time. To keep operations simple at the start, Niccol said the chain will start with drip coffee before expanding to specialty coffees such as lattes. Check out the full menu: .

A South Carolina couple suspected in the mysterious disappearance of the husband's former lover have now been charged with murdering her. Sidney and Tammy Moorer kept their heads down as they appeared in court in Conway, South Carolina on Monday - three days after authorities searched the couple's home and found evidence giving them probable cause to charge the Moorers with killing 20-year-old student Heather Elvis. Horry County Police Chief Saundra Rhodes said that authorities have not yet found Elvis' body but continue to carry out investigations. Elvis' family have spoken of their hope she will be found alive. The couple, who have three children, were arrested on Friday on indecent exposure and obstructing justice charges.

New charges: The Elvis family, left, sits at a table at a hearing for Sidney Moorer on Monday . Elvis, a cosmetology student, vanished on December 18 after she drove her car - willingly, authorities believe - to a boat landing building in Myrtle Beach. It was found empty on December 19. Cell phone records show Sidney Moorer, 38, was in contact with Miss Elvis at 6am on the day she disappeared. In . the original police report, seen by WMBF News, Miss Elvis was said to . have been in a relationship with Moorer, who she had met while . working in a restaurant. Her . roommate had told police the affair had handed about a month before . Miss Elvis disappeared, and that on the night she went missing, the pair . were back in contact. The roommate allegedly said Miss Elvis told her Moorer had called to say he was leaving his wife so he could be with her. A December 19 police report . included a statement from Sidney Moorer admitting he had been in contact . with Miss Elvis, to tell her to 'quit calling him and that was it'. Mystery: Heather, 20, disappeared in December after driving herself to a boat landing in South Carolina . Where is she? Elvis drove to Peachtree Landing, pictured, on December 18 and her empty car was found there the next day. Authorities have not found her body but said they believe she has been murdered . The . couple's home was searched Friday morning by police who, Lieutenant . Robert Kegler said, had a search warrant after analyzing video . surveillance. On . the night Miss Elvis disappeared, she had been on a date with a man who . dropped her off at the apartment at about 2am. That man has been ruled . out of the investigation. Police . believe Miss Elvis later drove herself to the boat landing where her . car was found, although the reason she would go there is not known. Sidney Moorer's attorney T. Kirk Truslow said the case is a rush to judgment. 'Sidney . has no connection to, nor knowledge of, any facts surrounding the . disappearance of Heather Elvis,' Truslow said in a statement. 'I firmly . believe Sidney will be completely exonerated.' Tammy Moorer's attorney added that she will be cleared. 'To . the best of my knowledge, Tammy does not know Heather Elvis at all,' defense attorney Greg McCollum said. 'I don't think they've ever met.'

Mr Elvis explained in an essay on xoJane . that he has a manual transmission truck he had been saving to give to . one of his daughters, but that neither of them had ever learned how to . drive a stick shift. At the . end of her date the night before she disappeared, the man she was . meeting offered to teach her how to drive his manual truck  in a mall . parking lot and she excitingly sent the picture of her driving to her . father to share the accomplishment. 'It is the last communication I have had with my daughter, the last picture I have of her on my phone,' Mr Elvis said.

'Hold your loved ones close, tell them how much you love them every day. Never let them doubt how much love you have for them so that if you are ever in the position I am in, you will be able to look in the mirror with less regret,' Mr Elvis said.

Motorists testified at Kerry Kennedy's drugged-driving trial on Monday that she swerved her Lexus into a truck, damaging the car and blowing a tire, but kept driving and later was slumped at her steering wheel and disoriented. Her lawyer said she was 'sleep-driving' because she had accidentally taken a sleeping pill. Kennedy, 54, ex-wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, daughter of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and niece of President John F. Kennedy, went on trial today in White Plains, suburban New York. Legal battle: Kerry Kennedy, (second left) daughter of assassinated Senator Robert F. Kennedy and ex-wife of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, exits the courthouse in White Plains, New York, next to her mother, Ethel Kennedy (bottom), and her brother, Douglas Harriman Kennedy (center) Family: Kerry, 54, is charged with one count of driving while impaired, a misdemeanor. She was supported by her mother Ethel Kennedy, who exited the court in a wheelchair . She was supported by 85-year-old mother, who came to court, and brother Robert F Kennedy Jr. who defended his troubled sister before the trial began. In his opening statement, defense lawyer Gerald Lefcourt told the six jurors that Kennedy was not disputing that she drove erratically. But he said it happened because Kennedy accidentally took a sleeping pill that morning instead of her thyroid medication. Kennedy's blood tests revealed a small amount of the sleeping drug zolpidem. 'The zolpidem kicks in. It shuts her down. She's in a state of sleep-driving,' Lefcourt said. Prosecutor Doreen Lloyd said even if the pill were taken accidentally, Kennedy violated the law 'by failing to stop and pull over as she felt the onset of symptoms.' But Lefcourt said Kennedy never knew what the drug was doing to her. He said the medication 'hijacks your ability to make decisions.' Kennedy was arrested in 2012 after her car hit a tractor-trailer on an interstate highway near her home outside New York City. She drove to the next exit, where she failed a sobriety test, police said. Leaving court: Kennedy initially said a partial seizure was to blame but a toxicology report showed that she had sleeping medication in her system .

The weekend arrest of Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman - the brutal leader of the Sinaloa Mexican cartel and the countries most dangerous drug lord - is unlikely to put a dent in drug trafficking and may even fuel more violence as power struggles erupt, experts have warned. Mexican Marines stormed a condominium in the resort city of Mazatlan on Saturday and arrested Guzman, whose elusiveness after a 2001 escape from prison and $5 million bounty on his head elevated him to folklore status, NBC News reported. Guzman built an empire while on the lam and even made Forbes list of billionaires. His success was celebrated with a folk song. Scroll down for video . Powerful: Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman is escorted to a helicopter in handcuffs by Mexican navy marines at a navy hanger in Mexico City, Mexico, after finally being captured Saturday following years on the run . In recent years, he eluded authorities by scurrying to safety in a warren of underground tunnels. 'When most of America thinks of organized crime, they naturally think of guys like John Gotti, Sammy ‘the Bull’ Gravano, even guys like Al Capone,' Michael Braun, former chief of operations for the DEA told NBC News. 'But the reality of the situation is Chapo Guzman made those guys look like absolute Boy Scouts.' Some tens of thousands of people have died under Guzman's reign in drug-related violence. Experts say Guzman had a hand not only in drug trafficking but also the smuggling of guns and people across the border. But Gregory D. Lee, a retired supervisory special agent for the DEA and now criminal justice consultant based in Pebble Beach, Calif., told NBC News that Guzman’s arrest will have 'no impact whatsoever' on the flow of drugs from Mexico to the United States. Drug lord: Joaquin 'El Chapa' Guzman is led into a military helicopter following his arrest on Saturday . Most wanted: Guzman is one of the most wanted men in the world and is considered the 'Osama bin Laden of the drug war' 'As long as there’s a demand for drugs, people like El Chapo and his cohorts are going to continue to fill that demand,' Lee said. According to the State Department, Mexican drug gangs send between $19 billion and $29 billion worth of drugs each year into the United States, including marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and, increasingly, heroin. The amount of heroin seized at the Southwest border grew 232 percent — 559 kilograms to 1,855 kilograms — between 2008 to 2012, according to U.S. National Seizure System data. Guzman's capture also allows for rival gangs to seize control of the drug flow into the States. Escape: Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 by hiding in a laundry bin. Authorities believe he had inside help . Guillermo Valdes, former chief of the Mexican intelligence agency told Bloomberg news service that a top lieutenant, Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, is the likely successor to Guzman as leader of the Sinoloa Cartel. 'El Mayo has been leading the Sinaloa Cartel alongside El Chapo for 25 years,' Valdes told the news service. 'He’s very intelligent.' Guzman will face a host of charge in Mexico related to his rile as Sinaloa boss as well as grand injuries in at least seven U.S. federal district courts, including Chicago, San Diego, New York and Texas, who have come forward with indictments since his arrest. Raid: Clothes and toiletries are scattered across a bed where Guzman was found with an unidentified woman . Dawn raid: A pancake left in a frying pan can be seen on the stove of the condominium where Guzman was arrested . Trapped: Marines broke into the seaside home in a complex where apartments are rented for about $1,200 a month .

The Duchess of Cambridge flashes her new necklace, a gift from her sister Pippa, bearing the names of her husband and her son . It's a gift that allows the Duchess of Cambridge to keep her two Princes close to her heart. She has been proudly wearing a new necklace that carries a disc engraved with her baby Prince George’s full name – George Alexander Louis – and a heart-shaped charm inscribed with the letter  ‘W’ for her husband William. And though it is a precious token of love, it is hardly one of the Crown jewels. Kate’s new necklace is a gift from her sister Pippa which sells for £89 from an online boutique. The Duchess clearly loves it and has been seen wearing it several times over the past few weeks. Speculation has been rife as to where it came from and who made  it, and now it has been identified  as being from online boutique  Merci Maman, based in Fulham, West London. Boutique owner Beatrice de Montille, 37, said she recognised the necklace, which has a third charm of a little boy, as her creation. She said: ‘After Prince George  was born, we made this gold chain especially for the Duchess and sent it to Pippa to give to her sister as a gift, and she passed it on.’ Miss de Montille, who has been running her boutique for seven years, added: ‘I was so happy to see Kate wearing it. ‘She is easily the most inspirational woman of our generation, as she is very elegant, and comes across as so modest.’ Miss de Montille revealed that Pippa, 30, . has been a regular customer of Merci Maman for two years and has bought . a number of bracelets from the store. While the necklace mainly bears the name of her son in pride of place, it also has a slight addendum in the form of a small gold 'W', representing her husband . In 2012, Pippa even sent a thank-you email to Merci Maman after buying one of their creations. Miss de Montille said the necklace was the perfect gift as charms with babies’ names are worn by new mothers to symbolise their  love for the newborn. ‘You keep the name of your  baby close to your heart, wherever you go. It is a gift to new mothers, just like a baby is a gift to new mothers.’ The necklace was an small token to the Duchess from her sister Pippa Middleton, who says the has been going to the store where she bought it as a regular for two years . She added that since it emerged that  Kate had worn one of her boutique’s necklaces, interest in the store had soared. ‘We had 25,000 hits [on the website] in just three days, which is  the equivalent of all the traffic we get in December, our busiest month,’ said Miss de Montille. The Duchess was first spotted wearing the necklace two days after Prince George’s christening, when she went on a shopping trip to the high  street store Zara in Chelsea, West London. Kate, 32, wore the low- key necklace on top of an every-day-looking floral-patterned white blouse and a cream cardigan. She also wore a pair of figure-hugging dark-blue jeans and a set of suspended gold earrings that matched the dangling necklace. The simple charm pendant is a stark contrast to the Duchess’s other recent headline-grabbing necklace choice. Two weeks ago at a gala dinner at the National Portrait Gallery – her first public engagement of the year – she wore a Cartier-designed chain featuring 38 diamonds supporting a double-drop diamond pendant. The priceless piece was lent to Kate by the Queen from her ‘jewel pool’, a separate collection from  the Crown Jewels.","The necklace bears inscriptions of both Kate's son and her husband .

Team USA has been forced to defend its disappointing medal haul at Sochi, with U.S. Olympic officials insisting they are 'proud' of the country's athletes. America placed fourth in the gold medal tally behind host country Russia, Norway and Canada with just nine golds, but came in second with its overall medal haul. The country's poor show in the speedskating, hockey and figure skating has been blamed for its rankings drop, with this year's medal haul about 20 percent lower than the 2010 Vancouver total. Yet despite Russia's dominance, American officials argue this was one of America's best Games ever. 'I couldn't be more proud of our Olympic team,' U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst said. Medal count: Team USA came in second behind Russia in the total medal count, and finished fourth in the gold medal count . Final medal: Steve Holcomb piloted the United States to the bronze in the men's four-man bobsled at the Sochi Olympics, placing the US second in the Sochi medal count . A bronze in the four-man bobsled on a day Russia put an exclamation point on its games gave the U.S. 28 medals in Sochi, putting it behind just the host country in total medals. But Norway won more gold than the U.S. (11-9) and the 28 total medals were nine less than Americans won in a record-setting performance four years ago in Vancouver. That total - five less than won by Russia - would have been far less if U.S. athletes didn't win nine medals, including five gold, in sports that made their debut in these games. To make matters worse, Canada won more gold medals than its much bigger neighbor for the second Olympics in a row. 'We came here to compete,' said Alan Ashley, managing director of sport performance for the USOC. 'We came here with a great team and they've done a great job. Things don't always shake out exactly the way you think they're going to, but the surprises are sometimes way more surprising than the disappointments.' Among . the disappointments were the biggest U.S. stars going into the games. Shaun White got shut out in snowboard and Lindsey Vonn didn't even make . the trip because of injury. Disappointing: Snowboader Shaun White arrived in Sochi trying to win two gold medals, but left with none . Let down: Team USA figure skater Ashley Wagner became an internet sensation for her disappointed facial expression . But . at least one new star was born. Teen skiing sensation Mikaela Shiffrin . won gold in the women's slalom and liked it so much that she was already . making plans for a record-setting performance four years from now in . South Korea. 'Right now, . I'm dreaming of the next Olympics (and) winning five gold medals, which . sounds really crazy,' Shiffrin said the day after her win. 'I'm sorry I . just admitted that to you all.' Shiffrin's . win in her first Olympics couldn't make up for the collapse of the U.S. speedskating team, which was blanked in old suits and new. Can we clone her? Teen skiing sensation Mikaela Shiffrin, 18, won gold in the women's slalom at her first Winter Olympics . Talking it up: U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Larry Probst (right, pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin) insists he is 'proud' of the U.S. team . Speedskaters were kept off the medal podium for the first time since 1984, despite a switch midway through the games back to their old suits. 'Worst Olympics ever,' two-time gold medalist Shani Davis said. While the U.S. failed to win a medal on the Sochi big oval, skaters from the Netherlands piled on with eight golds and 23 medals overall in speedskating. 'If you look at speedskating results we weren't the only nation that got smoked by the Netherlands,' said Scott Blackmun, CEO of the USOC. However, commentators say that as . the rest of the world improves its training and performance, America is . lagging behind. CSMonitor.com reported the decision to train at high altitude . and outdoors in Italy before coming to an Olympics with an indoor track . at sea level became a cause of concern following the disappointing performance. U.S. Speedskating, the sport's governing body . in the U.S., has also been accused of 'losing its way'. 'It's like the fall of the Roman Empire,' coach Bob Fenn told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, citing constant . infighting and frequent turnover of coaches, high-performance . directors and executives. The Dutch, who won a . record 23 speedskating medals in Sochi, 'have trained right by the . water their whole lives and understand how to push heavy air and what . tempo is required,' one source told the Journal-Sentinel. 'Our team is . trying to glide and carry speed like in Salt Lake City and it's not . working.' Not the clothes: Olympics officials have dismissed claims US speedskaters performed badly because of the new uniforms made by Under Armour (worn here by Shani Davis) Trouble in paradise: Team USA's speedskating team, including, (pictured left to right) Brian Hansen, Shani Davis and Jonathan Kuck (right), failed to win a single medal at Sochi . Things weren't much better on the ice for U.S. figure skaters, who won a bronze in the new team event but were shut out individually. Charlie White and Meryl Davis took a bit of the sting out of that performance with a gold medal in ice dancing. However commentators say the absence of a 'four-year plan' has been blamed for the decline in Team America's performance in figure skating. Susan . Russell, editor-in-chief at International Figure Skating Magazine, said . this is merely a 'lull' or low 'cycle' that every nation experiences. However Chicago Tribune reported there is some hope for the U.S. team, with 18-year-old Gracie Gold establishing herself as a solid medal contender, while 19-year-old Jason Brown could be a threat once he masters the quadruple jump. 'The next (four years) should be really interesting,' Gold said after finishing fourth in women's singles. Winners: Charlie White and Meryl Davis took a bit of the sting out of the disappointing US medal tally with their gold medal-winning performance in ice dancing . Not so great: The U.S. men's hockey team, including goaltender Jonathan Quick, left Sochi disappointed . Meanwhile, both the men's and women's hockey team left disappointed. The women appeared on their way to winning gold before collapsing in the final minutes against Canada, while the men couldn't score against either Canada or Finland, which handed the U.S. an embarrassing 5-0 loss in the bronze medal game. On the slopes, Shiffrin and Ted Ligety both win gold and the U.S. took five medals, making for a respectable showing. But the U.S. was shut out in the new sport of women's ski jumping where Americans had looked promising, and there were no medals in either cross-country skiing or the biathlon, sports that Norway dominated. Figure skater: Gracie Gold, 18, has established herself as a strong medal contender . In addition to winning more golds . than the U.S., Norway - with a population of just five million - . finished just two medals behind in the total with 26. Ashley said the U.S. medal haul was lower partly because other countries are becoming more competitive in winter sports. He said the team would have liked to have won more medals, but called their performance excellent anyway. If . there is reason to be more optimistic heading toward the games in South . Korea in 2018, team officials said it was the strong performance in new . sports like ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe. But . replicating that success in extreme sports in future Olympics will be . difficult, said Steve Roush, the former chief of sport performance for . the USOC.

A Sunday school teacher who killed another man in a road rage brawl last year faces only one year in jail after an autopsy revealed he died because of a problem with a popular anti-stroke drug. Librado Cena, 58, killed William O’Brien with a single punch to the head last April after the two men fought in a Fairfax City mall parking lot because the 63-year-old honked at him too many times. Cena remarkably faces only 12 months in prison on a misdemeanor assault and battery charge in a trial set to start Monday after initially facing life because an autopsy revealed the unstoppable bleeding – not the punch – caused O’Brien’s death. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On trial: Librado Cena faces on year in prison after it was discovered Pradaxa was to blame for William O'Brien's death, not his punch . The bleeding on the brain caused by the punch was allowed to continue unabated because O’Brien taking Pradaxa prevented it from clotting, he died about one hour later. Mall surveillance video released to the Washington Post by local police shows Cena running up to O’Brien from behind. The two men then face each other and square off. They trade blows, shove each other and go their separate ways – O’Brien to Best Buy and Cena drives off. O’Brien initially was fine, similar to ski accident victims who hit their heads but initially feel fine before collapsing unconscious. Doctors refer to the brief time before realizing how grave their head injuries are as the lucid interval, it doesn’t last long. He was able to make it home after buying a router, according to the Post, but had already begun experiencing severe head pain. Where the fight occurred: Cena and O'Brien traded punches in this Fairfax City mall parking lot, O'Brien went to the Best Buy before collapsing only an hour later . ‘I have a headache that, it’s about to make my head blow off,’ he said in a 911 call an hour later, according to the Post. O’Brien collapsed on his floor and was unconscious before paramedics arrived. Authorities . charged Cena with aggravated malicious wounding as O’Brien lie in a . coma in a local hospital. He would have faced life in prison if . convicted of the felony. That changed after an autopsy revealed O’Brien’s Pradaxa, not Cena punch, is what killed him. Doctors . are aware of the problem, but an expert told the Post of their . inability to stop the blood from flowing into the cranium and squeezing . the brain. ‘We don’t have a good way to control it,’ said Richard Schmidt, a University of Utah School of Medicine professor who co-authored a paper on the topic. A spokesperson for Boehringer-Ingelheim, the Germany-based manufacturer of Pradaxa, did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Prosecutors were unable to figure out which charges to level against Cena, but a grand jury settled on misdemeanour assault. O’Brien’s family claimed to the paper his attacker was getting off with only a slap on the wrist. The brief encounter dramatically changed the lives of both families when O’Brien finally succumbed to his injuries. The culprit: Blood thinning anti-stroke drug Pradaxa has been blamed for O'Brien's death because it allowed blow to flow unabated into his cranium . Cena lost his job as the religious director of the local church, his wife told the paper. He has been out of work since. ‘Lee has been made to look like a monster,’ Janice Cena lamented  ‘Through this whole thing, we have been praying for truth and justice . . . that is all we ask.’ His daughter dropped out of school and is mired in depression. The Cenas are near insolvency while struggling to get by on one income and paying mounting legal bills. Librado Cena declined to talk to the paper, but issued the following statement: . 'The events of the past 9 months have been very difficult for me and my family. I know that Mr. O’Brien’s family has suffered tremendously as well and my wife and I are deeply sorry for their loss. 'We have prayed for Mr. O’Brien and his family and we will continue to pray for them.’","William O'Brien, 63, died after only one punch to the head from 58-year-old Librado Cena .

For Team USA, the Sochi Winter Olympics will be forever known as the 'No-Name Games' after a string of previously unknowns compensated for the failure of big names including Shaun White, Shani Davis and the men's hockey team to bring home the gold. U.S. Olympic officials have been forced to defend its ‘disappointing’ medal haul at Sochi, which has fallen short of the record 37 medal haul in Vancouver four years ago. America placed fourth in the gold medal tally behind host country Russia, Norway and Canada with just nine golds, but came in a more respectable second with its overall medal haul. Dig the new breed: Weeks ago they were unknowns but then Mikaela Shiffrin, left, and Joss Christensen, right, struck gold for Team USA at the Sochi 2014 Winter Games . With so many big names failing to deliver, it was left to a number of young and unknown talents to emerge at these games. Sochi marked the debut of 12 Olympic events, and the U.S. medaled in seven of them including team figure skating, women's ski slopestyle and halfpipe, and men's ski halfpipe. Some of the winners might have been familiar to fans of action sports, but their victories in Russia introduced them to a broader audience. One of America’s new heroes was Sage Kotsenburg, a little-known snowboarder from Utah whose surprise gold medal in the new slopestyle event was Team USA’s first gold in 2014.

'Worst Olympics ever,' two-time gold medalist Shani Davis said. While the U.S. failed to win a medal on the Sochi big oval, skaters from the Netherlands piled on with eight golds and 23 medals overall in speedskating. 'If you look at speedskating results we weren't the only nation that got smoked by the Netherlands,' said Scott Blackmun, CEO of the USOC. However, commentators say that as . the rest of the world improves its training and performance, America is . lagging behind. CSMonitor.com reported the decision to train at high altitude . and outdoors in Italy before coming to an Olympics with an indoor track . at sea level became a cause of concern following the disappointing performance. U.S. Speedskating, the sport's governing body . in the U.S., has also been accused of 'losing its way'. 'It's like the fall of the Roman Empire,' coach Bob Fenn told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, citing constant . infighting and frequent turnover of coaches, high-performance . directors and executives. The Dutch, who won a . record 23 speedskating medals in Sochi, 'have trained right by the . water their whole lives and understand how to push heavy air and what . tempo is required,' one source told the Journal-Sentinel. 'Our team is . trying to glide and carry speed like in Salt Lake City and it's not . working.' Not the clothes: Olympics officials have dismissed claims US speedskaters performed badly because of the new uniforms made by Under Armour (worn here by Shani Davis) Trouble in paradise: Team USA's speedskating team, including, (pictured left to right) Brian Hansen, Shani Davis and Jonathan Kuck (right), failed to win a single medal at Sochi . Things weren't much better on the ice for U.S. figure skaters, who won a bronze in the new team event but were shut out individually. Charlie White and Meryl Davis took a bit of the sting out of that performance with a gold medal in ice dancing. However commentators say the absence of a 'four-year plan' has been blamed for the decline in Team America's performance in figure skating. Susan . Russell, editor-in-chief at International Figure Skating Magazine, said . this is merely a 'lull' or low 'cycle' that every nation experiences. However Chicago Tribune reported there is some hope for the U.S. team, with 18-year-old Gracie Gold establishing herself as a solid medal contender, while 19-year-old Jason Brown could be a threat once he masters the quadruple jump. 'The next (four years) should be really interesting,' Gold said after finishing fourth in women's singles. Winners: Charlie White and Meryl Davis took a bit of the sting out of the disappointing US medal tally with their gold medal-winning performance in ice dancing . Not so great: The U.S. men's hockey team, including goaltender Jonathan Quick, left Sochi disappointed . Meanwhile, both the men's and women's hockey team left disappointed. The women appeared on their way to winning gold before collapsing in the final minutes against Canada, while the men couldn't score against either Canada or Finland, which handed the U.S. an embarrassing 5-0 loss in the bronze medal game. On the slopes, Shiffrin and Ted Ligety both win gold and the U.S. took five medals, making for a respectable showing. But the U.S. was shut out in the new sport of women's ski jumping where Americans had looked promising, and there were no medals in either cross-country skiing or the biathlon, sports that Norway dominated. Figure skater: Gracie Gold, 18, has established herself as a strong medal contender . In addition to winning more golds . than the U.S., Norway - with a population of just five million - . finished just two medals behind in the total with 26. Ashley said the U.S. medal haul was lower partly because other countries are becoming more competitive in winter sports. He said the team would have liked to have won more medals, but called their performance excellent anyway. If . there is reason to be more optimistic heading toward the games in South . Korea in 2018, team officials said it was the strong performance in new . sports like ski and snowboard slopestyle and ski halfpipe. But . replicating that success in extreme sports in future Olympics will be . difficult, said Steve Roush, the former chief of sport performance for . the USOC. 'The rest of the world is catching up,' he said.","USA was placed second in the overall medal tally with 28 medals, behind Russia .
Medal haul about 20 percent lower than in 2010 and results considered 'disappointing' with figure skating and speedskating blamed .
A lot of big names failed to deliver at Sochi such as Shaun White and Shani Davis .
New stars emerged to spare Team USA's blushes including Mikaela Shiffrin, Sage Kotsenburg and Joss Christensen ."
"By . Alexandra Klausner . PUBLISHED: . 11:18 EST, 24 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 24 February 2014 . One man from Texas wanted to cast his vote, but was cast out instead due to his T-shirt in support of 2nd amendment gun rights. Chris Driskill attempted to vote on the first day of early voting in the Republican primary but was nixed because he was wearing a t-shirt that read, '2nd Amendment -- Americaâ€™s Original Homeland Security.' The T-shirt is donned with a skull and crossbones made of shotguns. It's pro-gun and unbeknownst to him was against the Texas voting code. Chris Driskill wore a pro-gun shirt to the voting booth and was not allowed to cast his ballot . The shirt read, '2nd Amendment, America's original Homeland Security' and donned an image with a skill with cross bones made of guns . Driskill attended his local polling place at the Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead near Houston and overheard an employee discussing his controversial tee. 'I heard a gentleman's voice over my shoulder say â€˜he can't vote with that shirt on. You'll have to either turn it inside out or you'll have to leave,' Driskill told KHOU. Driskill initially didn't understand why the polling staff were so focused on his shirt. He thought it was because they were either 'liberal' or 'anti-gun.' 'I didn't quite understand it at first,' he said. 'I was thinking they just didn't like something about the 2nd Amendment.' The staff didn't stop Driskill because they were liberal. They targeted him because he violated section 85.036 of the Texas Election Code pertaining to 'electioneering' for or against any candidate. 'During the time an early voting polling place is open for the conduct of early voting, a person may not electioneer for or against any candidate, measure, or political party in or within 100 feet of an outside door through which a voter may enter the building or structure in which the early voting polling place is located,' states the code. The voting took place at the Waller County Courthouse in Hempstead . The Republican primary ballot includes a question asking yes or no in support of the 2nd amendment in places where people are allowed to bear arms. Since Driskill's shirt advocated the 2nd amendment in gun-friendly Texas, his shirt is considered an attempt to express his political point of view. Such electioneering is not allowed within 100 feet of the voting vicinity, as stated by the code. In addition to his wardrobe, Driskill's Facebook page is strongly pro-gun and his 'likes' include groups like 'Freedom Munitions,' and 'Trigger Pullers.' Even though he's a fan of guns and of expressing his support for them, when going to the ballots in the future he should maintain a neutral appearance. Officials explained that the code is not biased and that those wearing a shirt with an image of Obama on it also would be turned away from voting. Driskill was finally allowed to vote when he borrowed a suit jacket from a fellow Republican candidate outside the courthouse. The gun-lover wasn't angry with the polling staff and understood their point of view. He also said he had a message for his fellow Americans. 'If you have to turn around and go change shirts, you know, so be it,' he said. 'But get out and vote.' Driskill's Facebook likes strongly reflect someone who is pro gun .","Chris Driskill wasn't allowed to vote because of his shirt supporting 'the right to bear arms'
