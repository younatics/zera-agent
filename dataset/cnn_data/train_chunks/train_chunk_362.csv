"(CNN) -- The killing of 16 unarmed Afghan civilians is, as President Barack Obama has said, heartbreaking. Families have lost children, mothers and fathers in a rampage that has left Afghanistan reeling. For Afghans it is the latest in a pattern of disrespect and dishonor: the burnings of the Quran that ignited protests, video of U.S. soldiers urinating on Taliban corpses, kill teams in Kandahar. The horror of the killings offers a public relations victory for the Taliban and leaves Afghans wondering whose side they should be on. Is this the kind of ""peace"" they should believe in and rely on? Both hearts and minds have been shattered and lost. And, devastatingly, another casualty of this rampage is the quiet voices of men and women who risk their lives each day to fight for the progress of their country. Human rights activists, midwives, high school principals, doctors, entrepreneurs and young students crowding on to Facebook like kids everywhere else in the world. Their voices pleading for patience and calm are lost in the violence, mistrust and misunderstanding of the last few months. These warriors for progress are rarely heard in the media, but the jeopardy in which they place themselves is very real: Since 2011, Kandahar's mayor was assassinated in his home, the city's police chief was assassinated and an educator in Logar province was shot and killed for the crime of educating girls. The killings in Kandahar by insurgents are another strike against people who simply want to live in a secure country where they can support their families and send their children to school safely. The bloodshed thus far in 2012 bolsters those in the United States and Afghanistan who say that a swift international exit from Afghanistan is the only answer. On the other side are those who argue the United States must stay the course militarily. Stuck in between are the country's women, who have fought since the Taliban's departure to strengthen their own rights to go to work and to school and to lead their communities. More than 2 million girls are now in school. Women make up a quarter of the Parliament. And nearly 3,000 midwives go out each day to save women's lives in a country that Save the Children rated the deadliest for expectant mothers. Women I speak with feel caught in a political ambush. They enjoy little protection from their own government, they are under fire and constant threat from anti-government insurgents and now troops sent to protect them are contributing to the violence. Women who fear deeply for the erosion of their own rights if the Taliban return are told by some in their community: ""Would you rather have this? Is this alternative any better? Is this peace?"" And their push for progress this past decade is tied by their opponents to an international effort increasingly seen as drenched in disrespect. Afghan President Hamid Karzai has been balancing for political survival on a tightrope between the international community on one side and his country's most conservative elements on the other. The more peace talks with the Taliban in Qatar become a reality, the further the Karzai administration seems to tilt in favor of the conservatives: Recently, Karzai signed off on a code of conduct for women released by clerics on the Ulema Council that said women should not travel without a male guardian or mix with men in offices or schools. Women activists say they do not want troops in their country forever. But they worry what the international community will leave behind as it hurries for the exits. Timelines seem to determine events on the ground rather than the other way around. As parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi told me in the wake of the Quran protests, ""If the international community decides to leave tomorrow, women will be the first victim of the Talibanization of the government."" No one is championing endless war in Afghanistan. For Americans, too much national treasure has been spilled and the treasury has been depleted. Drawdown plans leading to 2014 are well under way and will continue to unfold in the coming days. But how the international community gets out matters. And so does what it leaves behind. We have trapped ourselves in an all-or-nothing conversation. The military alone cannot end the war in Afghanistan -- and U.S. military officials are the first to say this. But after ""drawdown,"" two other ""Ds"" are critical. Diplomacy -- talks about Afghanistan's future that involve all Afghan sides and regional players and include women. And development dollars -- funds that help local government and civil society keep schools open, clinics functioning and midwives working after 2014 has come and gone. Already an orphanage I know is facing funding problems as it works to keep boys and girls off streets and out of trouble. A withdrawal of troops should not mean an abandonment of Afghanistan. This is not simply about American altruism. This is about leaving behind a state stable and secure enough that American forces will never have to go back. Afghan women are not a pet project taken up by the international community. They are a stability indicator whose involvement in their own societies is in the best interest of lasting security. Any agreement that leaves them out will simply be a short-term deal, not a durable peace. Women's involvement in their own country's future is a must-have for the U.S. president to get what he has said he wants: a ""responsible"" end game for America's longest war.

"(CNN) -- Don't bother to send in the clowns. A rash of ""creepy clown"" sightings in California has left some residents unnerved. It all appears to have started with the ""Wasco Clown."" According to KernGoldenEmpire.com, the clown's appearances -- and subsequent social media postings -- in the San Joaquin Valley city are part of a photography project launched by a husband and wife team who wish to remain anonymous. But copycat clowns have arrived on the scene, including one who was reportedly armed. The Bakersfield Californian said police received a call about someone in a clown suit brandishing a weapon. ""We've had multiple (sightings) of these clown sightings all over town,"" Bakersfield police Lt. Jason Matson told the publication. ""He was gone by the time we arrived.""

"(CNN) -- A Rwandan accused of ""complicity"" in the massacre of students at the college he headed during the country's genocide 15 years ago has been arrested in Italy, where he served as a clergyman, an international police agency said. Officers from the Italian Carabinieri and Interpol's National Central Bureau in Rome, Italy, arrested Emmanuel Uwayezu -- who had been wanted in Rwanda, the international police organization Interpol said Wednesday in a news release. Uwayezu, 47, is accused of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, complicity in genocide and crimes against humanity. He is in Italian custody and is awaiting extradition to Rwanda. According to Interpol's statement, the Rwandan arrest warrant says Uwayezu was alleged ""to have acted individually and as part of a conspiracy to plan and commit genocide by instigating Hutus to kill Tutsis in the area of Gikongoro, as director of the Groupe Scolaire Marie Merci college in Kibeho."" He is accused of ""participating in meetings with government and military authorities which allegedly planned the extermination of the Tutsi ethnic group"" and ""complicity in the massacre of some 80 students in May 1994 in the college which he headed."" Uwayezu arrived in Italy in 1997, took an alias, and was working as a vicar at the Church in Empoli commune near Florence when he was seized, Interpol said. The man was identified after Interpol's fugitives unit received information and pictures from Rwandan authorities. The Archdiocese of Florence issued a statement about the arrest two days ago, saying it hopes the justice system will come up with the truth about the case. But, it said, ""we stand by the fact that Don Emmanuel has always declared his estrangement to the events in question and we accompany him in prayers."" One Italian news report noted that Uwayezu is a priest of Hutu ethnicity and lived and worked as vice-parish priest in Ponzano, part of the county of Empoli. Don Guido Engels, the head of the parish and a priest, told the ASCA news agency that ""Don Emmanuel never cultivated feelings towards another ethnic group. He always wanted peace."" ""The arrest of Uwayezu demonstrates the power and effectiveness of international co-operation between police worldwide in obtaining information in relation to the identification, location and apprehension of fugitives around the world,"" said Jean-Michel Louboutin, Interpol's executive director of police services. ""This operation is a credit to law enforcement officers and agencies in Italy and Rwanda."" Two years ago, Interpol created a unit dedicated to searching for fugitives in the genocide who were wanted by Rwanda and the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. So far, seven people wanted by Rwanda and five wanted by the tribunal have been arrested. Police in Uganda recently arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. Idelphonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala. The arrest, by Ugandan police, was part of an operation between the tribunal, Ugandan authorities, and Interpol. Nizeyimana was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based. The 1994 Rwandan genocide left an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus dead over a 100-day period, the United Nations and Interpol say. Millions more were raped and disfigured, and nearly an entire generation of children lost their parents.","Emmanuel Uwayezu accused of genocide .

"(CNN) -- What is the value and impact of international aid? In an era of global austerity, this is a question that is frequently posed by policymakers and the citizens they represent. The truth is, it is actually quite hard to measure. But there are important questions about both the quantity and quality of aid that must be answered. Contrary to popular perception, aid is not one homogenous entity or a single transfer of money from donor to recipient countries. The term ""international aid"" actually covers a wide variety of things, including food and commodities, advice and training, and debt relief. In 2011 -- the last year we have comprehensive data for -- total development aid from rich countries stood at nearly $150 billion, according to the Investments to End Poverty report. Only $59 billion identifiably involves the transfer of actual cash to, for example, recipient governments, NGOs operating on the ground or special project funds. Aid in kind makes up another $25 billion. Most of this is food aid, which is used to tackle acute hunger -- but even this form of aid is not without controversy. Many donors avoid shipping actual food to developing countries, aware that it destroys local markets and harms local farmers. Research demonstrates that food aid can be poor value for money, especially when food grown in donor countries is shipped to the developing world. Sorghum shipped from the United States is 200% more expensive than it is in Chad and almost 100% more than in Sudan, according to Development Initiatives calculations. Despite this, the United States and Japan continue to make extensive use of food shipments. Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that large amounts of aid money never actually leave rich countries. As much as $22 billion -- or 20% of bilateral aid spending -- is spent on activities in donor countries or put towards the cancellation of debt. This includes funds to cover housing, food and other services for the first 12 months of refugees' stay in the donor country. It also includes public spending on universities to cover the costs for students from developing countries. In 2011, $4.5 billion was spent on refugee costs, $3.5 billion on university costs and around $7.5 billion on debt relief. As important as these expenditures may be, they do not result in any transfer of resources to developing nations. These schemes may of course be beneficial to recipient countries in the long term -- for example, contributing to capacity development if students return to their countries. But it is undeniable that these schemes are at odds with the common perception of aid as financial support transferred from donor to recipient countries to fight poverty. These different elements of aid obviously have very different effects on economic development and growth. A dollar of cash will have a very different impact to a dollar's worth of food or a dollar's worth of a consultant's time. It is difficult to understand just how bundling all of these items into one lump sum can allow us to draw meaningful and reliable conclusions about the value of aid. This lack of clarity was part of the motivation for Investments to End Poverty -- a major new report that analyzes aid in all of its complexity. At Development Initiatives we reviewed each individual record of foreign aid from OECD donors over the period 2006-2011 -- over a million rows of data. Now, for the first time ever, we can see just how much aid flows between specific countries and, crucially, what that aid consists of. The results are striking. For example, according to our calculations, Italy and Denmark both gave very similar levels of bilateral aid, just above $2 billion, in 2011. But almost 70% of Italy's aid stayed in the country, spent on refugee costs and debt relief, whereas around 70% of Denmark's aid resulted in a transfer of resources to developing countries. On the recipient side, some countries that appear to receive considerable funds in fact receive a lot less than advertised. Our research found that of the $7.5 billion in aid reported as given to the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2011, more than $5 billion was not transferred to that country, and consisted instead of debt relief. All of this matters because we are at a crossroads in international development. In the last few decades, we have seen unprecedented progress in alleviating poverty, as recognised by world leaders meeting at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September. There is a growing consensus that we can end extreme poverty by 2030. The truth is that we cannot meet this goal without international aid. While FDI and remittances undoubtedly contribute to economic growth in developing countries, aid is the only international resource flow which can be targeted explicitly to improve the lives of the poorest people around the world. In sub-Saharan Africa alone, 400 million people live in extreme poverty and require interventions that are targeted and complementary to existing support to lift them out of it. Without the support of international aid, most poor people will be left behind. If we want to maximize the impact and reach of international aid, we need to ensure that every dollar is spent as efficiently as possible. We can only do this with better information and a clear understanding. Then policymakers in both donor and recipient countries can make better and more informed decisions, and civil society can better monitor progress and hold them to account. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Lwanga Ntale.","Impact of international aid is hard to measure, says Charles Lwanga Ntale .

"CNN -- Sebastian Junger found him crouched on a battlefield in Afghanistan, fighting to stay alive. Ahmad Shah Massoud, center in white shirt, leads his men in his beloved Afghan mountains. The Taliban had the man cornered and outnumbered. A sniper's bullet came so close to the man that it plucked dirt between his feet. But Junger watched him coolly orchestrate a cunning counterattack by his soldiers -- all while discussing his favorite poetry and international news. ""He had tremendous magnetism,"" says Junger, a noted journalist and author who has written bestsellers like ""The Perfect Storm,"" and ""A Death in Belmont."" ""You didn't even need to speak his language to fall under his sway. That's the only time I've ever really felt that from another person."" The man Junger met was Ahmad Shah Massoud, the ""Lion of Panjshir."" Today, Massoud is a national hero in Afghanistan, but he's also become something else: the prototype for the tough but enlightened leader Afghanistan desperately needs today, some Afghans say.  Watch how images of Massoud are everywhere in Afghanistan » . Massoud was assassinated two days before the September 11 terrorist attacks by agents linked to al Qaeda. Though he died eight years ago, his legacy looms over any would-be leader in Afghanistan, Afghans and scholars say.  See current key players in Afghanistan » . 'He would have found bin Laden' Afghanistan's government has been accused of being corrupt and weak. Massoud had a reputation for integrity and strength, says Junger, who traveled to Afghanistan in 2000 to profile Massoud for his book, ""Fire."" ""He would have been very hard for the warlords to intimidate,"" Junger says. Massoud had a reputation as a fierce nationalist who would not allow any outside group -- the Russians, Pakistan, the Taliban, even the United States -- to control Afghanistan, says Zieba Shorish-Shamley, an Afghan native and founder of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan. ""All he wanted was to have Afghanistan for Afghanistan,"" Shorish-Shamley says. ""If Massoud would have been in power, he would not sell out."" Massoud made his name as a brilliant guerrilla leader. He was born in Afghanistan's Panjshir Valley, the son of an Afghan army officer. He attended college as an engineering student where he became involved in student politics. Massoud became Afghanistan's most famous resistance leader after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. Widely read, he studied the works of famous guerrilla leaders. His army fought back nine major offensives by the Soviet army in the Panjshir Valley. After the Soviet army retreated, Massoud then waged war against the Taliban, objecting to their rigid interpretation of Islam and treatment of women. While battling the Taliban, Massoud became a bitter foe of the group's chief ally, al Qaeda's Osama bin Laden. Shorish-Shamley, the women's rights activist, says Massoud was assassinated just before the 9/11 attacks because bin Laden feared Massoud. Massoud's military prowess combined with his knowledge of the Afghan-Pakistan border would have made him an even more formidable threat against the Taliban with U.S. military muscle backing him. ""If they [al Qaeda leaders] were hiding under a rock, he would have found them,'' Shorish-Shamley says. ""He was that type of person. He would have found bin Laden."" 'He was a charming killer' Yet there are others who say Massoud wasn't that different from the warlords who try to control Afghanistan today. After the Soviet army left Afghanistan, various Afghan resistance leaders cobbled together a coalition government to run the country. Massoud was appointed defense minister. But a civil war soon erupted as various factions fought for control of the country. Men under Massoud's command were accused of massacring civilians. Paul Fitzgerald, co-author of ""Afghanistan's Untold Story,"" says Massoud was a ""charming killer."" ""He wasn't as bad as the worst,"" Fitzgerald says. ""But from the Afghan point of view, they're all war criminals. They really didn't do any good for the Afghan people."" The Taliban eventually stepped into the leadership vacuum created by feuding Afghan factions. When they gained control of Afghanistan, they pushed Massoud's army into the Panjshir Valley. There Massoud fought a rear-guard action against the Taliban while trying to warn the West about the global threat posed by bin Laden and the Taliban. Marcela Grad, author of the book ""Massoud,"" says he was the only Afghan resistance leader who never left the country to live abroad. He fought constantly for Afghanistan's independence, but constant war didn't appear to destroy his humanity. ""He had tranquility about him,"" says Grad, who journeyed to Afghanistan to talk to Massoud's friends for her book. ""He brought his poetry books to battle."" Grad says Massoud believed that his fight against the Taliban wasn't isolated but part of a larger battle against a Taliban-like Islam that threatened to spread across Central Asia. ""If Massoud and the Afghans were not being a front against intolerance in that part of the world, we would have had al Qaeda everywhere -- it would have been much worse,"" Grad says. Junger, who had interviewed Massoud the year before, says he was crushed by Massoud's death. ""A lot of people who knew him felt that he was the best hope for that part of the world,"" says Junger. There may be another Massoud in Afghanistan's future. A year after Massoud's death, he was named a ""National Hero of Afghanistan."" As dignitaries stepped on stage to honor Massoud, a thin adolescent with the same aquiline nose and almond-shaped eyes as Massoud stepped before the crowd. It was Massoud's only son, Ahmad, who was then 13 (he would now be about 20). CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour, who covered the event, reported that Ahmad said that terrorists may have killed his father but not his vision of a united and free Afghanistan. ""I want to follow in my father's footsteps,"" Ahmad said. ""I want to secure our country's independence. I want to be my father's successor.""","Legendary Afghan leader instilled fear in Taliban, Afghans say .

"(CNN) -- Like many visitors in Seattle, Glenn Nagel found himself in the city trying to avoid the rain. After wandering around, he eventually made his way to the Seattle Public Library to escape the dreary weather. Little did he know that stepping into Seattle's Central Library would spark his curiosity. The library's geometric glass and steel interior with its sprawling ""books spiral"" grabbed ahold of him. ""It's just an incredible building,"" he said, still remembering his awe during that 2013 trip. ""I spent an hour and a half just taking pictures, and while doing that, I was getting the idea that I should visit other libraries."" This past year, Nagel has traveled to 12 libraries across the United States, photographing their shelves and hallways like an explorer. He's one of many people discovering a renewed fascination with libraries. He and other iReporters shared photos of libraries they visited with CNN iReport for National Library Week, observed April 13-19 this year. Despite the expansive digitalization of information, the use of public libraries remains popular, according to Cathy De Rosa, vice president for the Americas and global vice president of marketing at OCLC, a nonprofit computer library service organization. ""It surprises people,"" she said, explaining there's a presumption amongst the public that libraries are becoming increasingly irrelevant. But despite enduring budget cutbacks and being forced to reinvent their services in the face of the ubiquitous Internet, public libraries remain staple institutions in various communities. There's been an increase in the use of public libraries in the U.S. over the past decade. Services such as public computers doubled in usage in the past 10 years, and libraries saw a circulation increase of 2.46 billion materials in 2010, the highest ever reported, according to a report by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Some libraries bring in more than just patrons. They are also popular amongst tourists, drawing visitors by the tens of thousands, if not millions. The Seattle Public Library system, for example, attracts more than 7 million people through its doors each year. ""The Central Library is one of the most beautiful modern buildings in Seattle, and it really celebrates the people,"" said Andra Addison, a spokesperson for the library. Smaller libraries matter, too . Americans strongly value the role of public libraries in their community, according to findings by the Pew Research Center. In fact, 94% of people polled in 2013 said that having a public library improves the quality of life in a community. Jennifer Roberts, a writing teacher, agrees. She spent many summer days with her daughters, Lucy and Miriam, visiting their local library in Grants Pass, Oregon. But in 2007, all the libraries in Josephine County closed down for a number of reasons. It devastated her daughters who were then 7 and 5. ""Lucy told me she was really sad she wouldn't get to 'visit the books,' "" Roberts said, remembering her daughter sobbing at the news. Roberts was determined to find a way to help reopen the libraries in her area. The community banded together to raise $300,000 in 18 months. They even got a matching grant from Josephine County, which helped the libraries reopen. The experience helped Roberts rediscover the value of her local library. ""I actually didn't grow up visiting many libraries,"" she said. ""I didn't discover that wonder until I was much older. Perhaps that's why they seem so magical to me now."" 'Libraries reflect who we are' Robert Dawson wanted to capture the value of public libraries through his lens. He spent the past 18 years photographing libraries and interviewing people who work and use them. In his recently published book, ""The Public Library: A Photographic Essay,"" which includes hundreds of photographs of libraries in 48 states, Dawson says he was drawn to libraries because they are vital part of a community's ecosystem. ""Often times, a library reveals things about a community. It was really sad to see a closed library when I was passing through the Mississippi Delta,"" he said, explaining how that was one of the poorer regions he visited. ""I am not a librarian, but 18 years of doing this, you peel away things,"" he said. ""It's interesting how libraries reflect who we are, and what we share. Barbara Stripling, president of the American Library Association, says libraries are also incredibly transformative. These spaces offer not only information but also provide resources and opportunities to socialize. Some libraries are ""becoming more of a community sharing, learning, conversation space,"" she explained. Programs such as the Chicago Public Library's One Book, One Chicago, an initiative adopted from the Seattle Public Library, aims to rally virtual community engagement around monthly book selections. Take a tour of the world's most exquisite libraries . Others are rebranding themselves as places where people can explore their passions. Programs such as Geek the Library, which is part of OCLC, partners with libraries to promote the idea that everyone ""geeks out"" about something, and a local library can help you recognize your special passion. Through his 18 years of documenting libraries, Dawson says he's seen many of them adapt and transform for their communities. Some took on new daily roles, such as teaching people to write resumes or providing social services. ""In San Francisco, they have a dedicated social worker, especially for the homeless,"" he said. Others became safe havens. ""When I was in Detroit, it one of the hottest days on record, I walked into a library. There was this huge guard at the front, the air conditioning was blasting, it was packed, and everyone was reading. And I sort of got it -- it was a place of shelter."" Olaf Eigenbrodt, librarian and senior head of user services and adviser for planning and construction at State and University Library Hamburg in Germany, says there are three main reasons why libraries continue to be popular today: They are information hotspots; they are places communities can gather; and they provide learning collaboration. They even provide an element of comfort. ""Libraries tend to become more cozy, relaxing and communicative places. Other than public spaces like museums, they have a certain private character, which makes them a living room for their community,"" Eigenbrodt said. Dawson thinks a part of people's fascination with libraries is sort of irrational, too, but in a good way. He attributes our love for libraries to our childhood memories. ""I think a lot of it goes back to being a kid. There's an emotional connection that is somewhat unique. A lot of kids discover libraries with their parents when they are younger,"" he explained. That affinity can be partially psychological, according to De Rosa of OCLC. ""I would find it difficult to find 10 people in a crowd who didn't have a positive experience in a library. That's a personal thing,"" she said. ""It's why libraries continue to be relevant."" Addison, from the Seattle Public Library, says the most alluring factor of a public library is simple -- it's free. ""Where else can you go that offers all this for free? Whether you're in a three-piece suit or a three-day beard, you can go into a library and be welcomed."" CNN's Daphne Sashin and Margaret Blaha, special to CNN, contributed to this story.","National Library Week is observed from April 13 through 19 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- When you are next in the lobby of a Westin hotel in North America, take a deep breath. It may not hit you at first, but if you're careful you should detect a hint of geranium or a note of freesia. Branded scents of flowers are becoming a common feature in hotel lobbies . The fragrance is part of the hotel chain's attempt to elevate the senses, transform the space and, above all, create a memorable experience for its guest. Westin are not alone in this approach. Other business travel environments including business class lounges and planes are filling their air with branded scents as companies cash in on the power of smell as a marketing tool. The idea is that the sense of smell is closely linked to the part of the brain that controls both emotion and memory. In fact, three quarters of our day-to-day emotions are thought to be influenced by what we smell. Brands for decades have created logos, and relied on their repeated use to build a visual association, and with that brand loyalty and engagement. But as Simon Harrop, executive director of Brand Sense Agency (that is spearheading the concept of sensory branding) says, vision goes to the part of the brain that controls rational thought. ""This means we tend to override the signals,"" he says. ""But because smell goes to the part of the brain linked to emotion, it creates a more direct and powerful response. If we can create associations with a fragrance, then it becomes a very powerful way to enhance the brand."" Using smell as a branding technique is not new. Since the 1990s, Singapore Airlines has been using its own fragrance, known as Stefan Florida Waters. Flight attendants wear it as perfume, it is blended into the hot towels served before take-off and it wafts through the cabin during the flight. As outlined in the book Brand Sense my Martin Lindstrom, also MD of Brand Sense Agency, you may not necessarily remember the smell, but as soon as you step into the aircraft it has the ""potential to kick-start a kaleidoscope of smooth, comfortable memories, all reflecting the more obvious customer service and quality efforts of the Singapore Airlines brand."" Harrop also founded The Aroma Co that specializes in providing aromatic solutions in marketing. Seven or eight years ago he worked with British Airways to develop a fragrance for seven the airline's business class lounges. The idea was to bring ""the outdoors in"", says Harrop, through the use of smell of running water. Unfortunately, this work coincided with British Airway's tail re-branding exercise and the smell was literally drowned out. Other smells have lingered, however. Retailers and food service companies are increasingly using it as a technique and Starwood Hotels has pumping smells into its 400 Sheraton and 125 Westin Hotels & Resorts for over 18 months. Amalie Craig, UK spokesperson for Starwood says the scent in the Westin hotels has proved a hit with guests. As a result, they have now created their own line of candles and potpourris so guests can take the smell home with them. ""Hundreds of guests asked how to purchase the scent for their home prompting a waiting list for the exclusive collection months before its debut,"" she says. But for those who might have thought existing advertising techniques were sinister enough, this new multi-sensory approach may really get up your nose. Literally. Others have been concerned about the overuse of chemicals and the risk of exacerbating allergies. (Starwood says its smells are natural and hypoallergenic). Other critics say smells are simply obtrusive. But Harrop is not deterred. This is not about bombarding people with a smell, he says. ""We are talking one or two parts of fragrance per billion molecules of air. Humans can detect tiny amount of air, so it should be done very subtly."" And after all, he adds, when you go into a business lounge it's going to smell of something. So rather than the whiff of a take-away burger or a sweaty traveller create the emotional response, why not use something a bit more refreshing?

"London (CNN) -- An Enigma machine which featured in a Hollywood movie about the codebreakers of World War II has smashed auction estimates and sold for a world record price. The encoding device sparked a three-way bidding war when it went under the hammer at Christie's in London Thursday, selling for £133,250 ($208,137) -- more than double the upper estimate of £50,000. Christie's said the previous record for an Enigma machine was £67,250, at the same auction house, in November 2010. Vitally important to the Nazi war machine, the Enigma machine was used by the German military to encrypt messages into a form they believed was unbreakable. However, the code was cracked by a team of cryptologists at Bletchley Park in southern England -- a breakthrough widely credited with having shortened the war by at least two years. Enigma machine to go under the hammer . The story of the codebreakers has inspired several books, and a movie starring Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet. The Enigma machine sold Thursday was one of several used in the 2001 film. Thousands of the machines are thought to have been produced from the 1920s, through to the end of the Second World War, but it is rare for one to come up for sale. James Hyslop, Christie's Travel, Science and Natural History specialist, said the machine's eventual sale -- to an unnamed collector -- had been greeted by a round of applause.

"(CNN) -- Can a secular, Hollywood insider make a religious movie Americans can fully, warmly embrace and -- wait for it -- actually learn from? We'll find out for sure on March 28 when the movie ""Noah"" opens in theaters nationwide. But, at first glance the answer is -- no. Paramount, eager to appeal to the religious crowd, arranged screenings of the movie before its release. Officially, some competing versions of the film ""tested poorly."" Sounds to me like audiences hated most of what they saw, although it's not clear exactly what version of the film they hated. Critics ""lucky"" enough to see early versions of the movie were sworn to secrecy. But, we do know their reaction prompted Paramount to not only recut the movie several times, but to take the extraordinary step of schmoozing the president of the National Religious Broadcasters group by agreeing to issue this disclaimer: ""The film is inspired by the story of Noah. While artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to the essence, values, and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of faith for millions of people worldwide. The biblical story of Noah can be found in the book of Genesis."" Even the actor who portrays Noah, Russell Crowe, tweeted: ""Dear Holy Father @Pontifex , Sorry that I have caused havoc in your social media world. Seriously though, #Noah the movie will fascinate you."" See, that's the thing. The director, a self-described atheist, is Darren Aronofsky, who produced the movie ""Black Swan."" He is way more interested -- and I mean way, way more interested -- in making Noah ""fascinating"" than ""true to the Bible,"" telling the New Yorker, ""'Noah' is the least biblical biblical film ever made. I don't give a f--- about the test scores (early negative audience reaction to ""Noah""). My films are outside the scores."" Put that in your pipe and smoke it! It's not that religious audiences dislike artistic license, they just hate it when Hollywood exploits a sacred story to promote a secular agenda. Brian Godawa, blogger and author of the book ""Noah Primeval,"" sparked a firestorm when he reviewed an early script of ""Noah."" Godawa's article was titled: ""Darren Aronofsky's Noah: Environmentalist Wacko."" It promptly went viral. He says Aronofsky, at least early on, turned a Bible story into ""environmental paganism."" ""It's not that (Christians) are intolerant, but look, you're playing with their sacred story."" Godawa says the story of Noah was not about ""God destroying the Earth because man was destroying the Earth,"" it was about God destroying the Earth because of ""man's sinfulness."" Mark Burnett, who produced the wildly successful ""Son of God,"" agrees. ""You know one thing is -- it's not just any book, correct? It's a sacred text. It's a sacred text that millions of people have willingly died for. It's not anything to mess around with. You've got to be faithful to a sacred text like this."" Hollywood has been making movies about the Bible since the silent era. ""Ben Hur"" and ""The Ten Commandments"" were huge hits. Did they stick to the sacred script? No. And, you guessed it, some biblical scholars were not pleased. ""Hollywood has an agenda and that's to sell films and make it exciting, not necessarily to convey historical accuracy nor to convey theological values,"" says Rabbi Steven Weil, executive vice president for the Orthodox Union. Even Cecil B. DeMille's popular ""Ten Commandments,"" which portrayed the Jewish enslavement in Egypt, ""gave a skewed, simplistic and primitive notion of religion. It almost had no value,"" Weil says. Seriously? No value? With all due respect, Rabbi Well, if we're in danger of becoming a nonreligious country -- according to Pew, just 58% of millennials believe in God -- why not attract young people to a movie that, at least, entertains them with stories inspired by the Bible? Movies unlike the hit film ""Son of God,"" which while successful, arguably did not attract the non-Christian crowd. Reza Aslan, a religious scholar who wrote the book-and-soon-to-be-movie, ""Zealot: the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth"" says, ""'Son of God' is a movie made by Christians for Christians. Non-Christians will not go see 'Son of God' -- because it's a terrible movie."" Aslan is eager to see ""Noah,"" and, no, it doesn't bother him in the least if Aronofsky takes liberties with his portrayal of Noah. He says the story of Noah in the Bible is barely forty verses long. ""If you wanted to make a biblically based Noah story it would be 10 minutes long. ...if you're going to approach this topic, you have no choice but to expand on it, to make things up, to create a narrative out of it."" The most interesting aspects of the Noah story, he says, come after the floodwaters recede. ""Noah gets drunk and lies naked in front of his son. Go and check it out. Open Genesis."" I'm pretty sure Aronofsky won't include that scene in his movie, but what if he did? Dr. Alan Cooper, provost and Biblical scholar at The Jewish Theological Seminary, says there is no harm in interpreting the Bible in a secular, Hollywood kind of way. ""The whole point of interpretation, whether it's in the form of a painting or a film, is to stimulate discussion of issues authors raise and don't always resolve. That's true throughout the Bible."" Roy Johnston, the pastor of the Bayside megachurch in California, is on board. ""You know, to be honest with you, I think unfortunately, a lot of Christians are known for what they are against, not what they are for. And so I think I'm going to go see the 'Noah' movie. I'm actually looking forward to it because at least it creates conversation."" Amen, Pastor Roy, amen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carol Costello.","Carol Costello: Will Americans embrace Hollywood version of ""Noah"" story? Probably not .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Several hundred Sri Lankan Tamil protesters shouted slogans at the British Parliament for a second day Tuesday, urging it to act to end the ""genocide"" against their people in Sri Lanka. Police clash with Tamil protesters outside the Houses of Parliament. ""Stop the genocide!"" they shouted. ""Stop the war!"" They waved the red flag of Tamil Eelam, the Tamils' traditional homeland in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. The flag is emblazoned with a yellow roaring tiger. Most of the protesters slept overnight on the streets around Parliament Square after beginning their unauthorized protest Monday afternoon. At one point, the protesters blocked the street leading to Westminster Bridge over the River Thames, police said. That led to road closures around Parliament. By Tuesday morning, a solid ring of police had hemmed the protesters in Parliament Square across the street from the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben. Roads were open again, but the protest and police presence caused traffic congestion in the area. Hariram Shan, 24, is a Sri Lankan Tamil who said he has lived in Britain for six years. He said the protesters hope the British government will intervene to stop Sri Lanka's crackdown on Tamil Tiger rebels, which he said harms civilians. ""They can force economic sanctions,"" Shan told CNN. Dushyanthy Sukumar, 47, said the Sri Lankan government is retaliating against innocent civilians. ""The Sri Lankan government has now cornered the rebels, the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam), and what they are doing is killing the people,"" she said. Sukumar, who said she has lived in Britain since leaving her homeland in 1987, said she is angry at the British government for supporting Sri Lanka. ""The Sri Lankan government is doing their dirty work through this government,"" she said. The Sri Lankan military said Sunday that it had captured the last rebel stronghold and killed five rebel leaders after three days of gunbattles. It said more rebels could still be hiding in a 20-square-kilometer ""safety zone,"" but that it would not enter the area because it is home to some 50,000 people. The Tamil Tigers have fought since 1983 for an independent homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority. The civil war has left more than 70,000 people dead.","Several hundred Tamil protesters demonstrate outside UK parliament .

"(CNN) -- Victims' family members and advocates are grieving anew as the only man convicted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland -- which killed 270 people -- was released Thursday from a British prison. Victoria Cummock holds daughter Ashley during a 1995 memorial service. John Cummock died in the bombing. ""I feel sick. I feel depressed and outraged. I mean, I am just heartbroken,"" said Susan Cohen, whose daughter Theodora, a 20-year-old Syracuse University music student, was killed in the bombing. Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, 57, sick with advanced prostate cancer, was released on compassionate grounds and sent home to Libya to die, Scottish authorities said. Megrahi, who prosecutors said was a Libyan intelligence agent, was convicted in 2001 of placing a bomb on the Boeing 747. Libya has formally accepted responsibility for the bombing and has compensated the families, although longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi denied any culpability in the attack. Cohen and others said international politics had trumped justice as U.S. and British relations with Gadhafi have thawed over the years. ""I feared they would do this,"" she said. ""Now that they've made friends with Gadhafi ... the Western countries want to give him everything that he wants, appease him. He wanted Megrahi, they are rushing Megrahi out; they aren't even giving this a day. And the tiny little shred of justice we had is gone.""  Watch Cohen vent her frustration » . ""I thought that our governments, both the U.S. and the U.K., owed it to the victims and their families to ensure that Megrahi would fulfill his sentence,"" said Victoria Cummock, whose husband, John, died in the attack. ""If he did the crime, he should do the time. ... (But) when you try to combine politics with justice, politics always wins."" ""I expected this,"" said Mark Zaid, a Washington-based lawyer for several victims' families. ""I work with governments all the time, and governments do not act to protect the interests of the people, they act to protect the interests of the country. And those are different."" Zaid said he might file a lawsuit under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act to learn what the governments promised each other to accomplish Megrahi's release. It especially galls the families that Megrahi's release was on compassionate grounds. ""This is mercy?"" Cohen said. ""Do you know what I've been living with for over 20 years now? This man deserves no compassion. He is a convicted mass murderer and terrorist. What have we come to, that this man is released?""  Watch Megrahi board a plane headed for Libya » . Added Cummock: ""I think it's unconscionable that he would have the audacity to apply on compassionate grounds to be released and that they would actually consider it. Nevertheless, not only did they consider it, they granted it. ""I think it's a huge disservice, not only to the families but also for the people of Lockerbie and everybody that was left to pick up the pieces over the years -- all of the prosecutors, the investigators and so on,"" she said. Zaid said his clients consider the decision ""a slap in the face."" ""He showed no compassion to the victims, and he's lived two decades more than any of their loved ones have,"" he said. Interest in long-out-of-reach Libyan oil dictated the decision, Zaid said. ""This is now catch-up time, and there's a lot of money to be made,"" he said. They'll come to regret it, Cummock predicted. ""It sends an awful message out to those who want to use violence or terrorism to affect U.S. policy,"" she said. The families didn't need this wound to be reopened, Zaid said. ""A lot of them have moved on,"" he said. ""The loss is never going to go away, but it doesn't help the situation to have their feelings played like political pawns as part of this international game."" But not all victims' families shared the outrage. Caroline Stevenson, whose son, Syracuse student Sandy Phillips, was aboard Pan Am 103, told CNN affiliate KARK in Little Rock, Arkansas, that she is ""not disturbed"" by al-Megrahi's release. ""Whether he's in jail or whether he's with his family, it doesn't impact me,"" she said. ""He should be able to be with his family and die in peace. And I hope he has found some peace."" ""I am not disturbed by it. I feel like if he is dying of prostate cancer, I don't have any problems at all with him being able to be with his family as he dies."" Stevenson added that she doesn't understand the U.S. government's opposition to al-Megrahi's release. ""I strongly believe in the Scottish Judical system, and I support their decision,"" she said. ""The people of Scotland have been very good to me and my family.""","Families appalled at release of Abdelbeset al Megrahi, who is dying of cancer .

"(CNN) -- It may not fly with those imagining Santa with magical ones on Christmas Day, but a U.S. lawmaker decided to share with the world that one reindeer -- in part, anyway -- ended up on his plate. ""From Oslo, Merry Christmas season to my Scandinavian friends. 'Enjoyed' a meal of lutefisk, reindeer, & lefse,"" Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, tweeted. Some commenters on Twitter and around the web were less than thrilled. But making a meal of reindeer meat is actually ""totally normal considering where he is,"" said food guru Kat Kinsman, who runs CNN's Eatocracy blog. ""People eat this whenever it's in season, and Norway is host to a pretty robust wild reindeer population. And if it was grown in the wild, ""that's the most sustainably raised food that you can get,"" she added. Meat actually played something of a role in popularizing the association of reindeer with Santa early last century, according to Laura Galloway, who wrote about the history for CNN.com. A businessman named Carl Lomen hoping to mass market reindeer meat worked with Macy's in 1926 to create a parade led by Santa and reindeer. Though Lomen's campaign for reindeer meat never took off in the United States, ""his marketing efforts unleashed a worldwide obsession with Santa and created a common narrative now known around the world, and even elaborated on,"" Galloway wrote. In 1998, CNN's Patricia Kelly paid a Christmas Eve visit to Rovaniemi, Finland, where a tourist tradition claimed Santa liked to hang out. Reindeer meat was on the menu, she wrote, ""if you can bear not to think about Rudolph, Dancer, and Prancer."" You might be enjoying a very different Christmas feast. Enjoy!

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- Anti-whaling activists are accusing a Japanese boat of destroying their vessel Wednesday by ramming into it during a skirmish in the Southern Ocean. But Japanese authorities deny their boat intentionally rammed the activists' catamaran and said instead the incident happened accidentally when the activists were harassing their whaling fleet. Sea Shepherd Conservation Society says its boat was ripped apart by the Japanese vessel during the incident. ""In an unprovoked attack captured on film, the Japanese security ship Shonan Maru No. 2 deliberately rammed and caused catastrophic damage to the Sea Shepherd catamaran Ady Gil,"" said a statement from Sea Shepherd. The statement said six crew crew members, five from New Zealand and one from the Netherlands, were rescued by the crew of the Sea Shepherd ship Bob Barker. None of the Ady Gil crew were injured, the statement said. The statement quoted the captain of the Bob Barker as saying the Shonan Maru No. 2 deliberately rammed the Ady Gil, ripping off eight feet of the bow of the vessel. ""The Japanese whalers have now escalated this conflict very violently,"" said Captain Paul Watson. ""If they think that our remaining two ships will retreat from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in the face of their extremism, they will be mistaken. We now have a real whale war on our hands now, and we have no intention of retreating."" A Japanese Fisheries Agency statement blamed the conservation group for the incident. ""This is a continuation of the harassment of the Japanese research whaling program by Sea Shepherd and is extremely dangerous to threaten vessels and its crew. This is absolutely unforgivable,"" the statement said. The incident continues an ongoing feud between conservation agencies and Japanese whaling fleets. The Southern Ocean is a term used to describe parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans that surround Antarctica.

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- You might excuse Ben Silbermann, co-founder and CEO of photo-sharing site Pinterest, if he looks a little overwhelmed these days. Pinterest, which encourages users to collect images of their passions on digital pinboards and share them with others, has exploded in popularity in recent months. Reporters are besieging the soft-spoken 29-year-old for interviews. And on Tuesday, Silbermann found himself blinking under stage lights at the South By Southwest Interactive conference, where more than 1,000 tech-literate folks packed a hall to hear him talk about his website -- one that few people had heard of six months ago. ""It's a really humbling feeling that all these people are using something that you helped make,"" he said during a Q&A with Hunch co-founder Chris Dixon. Their chat, a last-minute addition to the SXSW schedule, was one of the more talked-about events at the tech festival. Pinterest has more than 11 million unique monthly users, according to recent numbers from Internet-monitoring firm comScore, and has more than doubled its audience over the past six months. The average Pinterest user spends some 98 minutes per month on the site -- more than any other social platform except Tumblr and Facebook. And Pinterest is responding to its newfound popularity with a few changes. Silbermann said the site will soon roll out profile pages that have been redesigned to look ""more beautiful"" and to display users' influencers more prominently. An iPad app is also in the works, he said, although he declined to give a release date. Many of Pinterest's core users have employed the site as a sort of online scrapbook to catalog their hobbies. The service has proved especially popular with women who use it to store and share crafts, recipes, wedding tips and home-decorating ideas. But Silbermann said that people are finding more surprising uses for the site as well. He cited the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which shares images from its collection; a woman in Spain who shares elaborate travel guides to cities she's visited; and a political parody page that displays GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's ""yacht collection."" ""It's exciting to see people using the product in ways we never expected,"" he said. It's a far cry from two years ago, when Pinterest was struggling to find an audience. A Yale grad with no engineering background, Silbermann worked for Google before launching Pinterest with some friends in late 2009. Real-time text feeds were the rage at the time, and some observers felt that an image-based pinboard was doomed to fail. Nine months later, the site still had less than 10,000 users. ""I think I personally wrote to the first 5,000 users,"" said Silbermann, who also gave the site's users his cell phone number and met some of them for coffee. ""A lot of people ask, 'Why did you keep going? Why didn't you bail?'"" he said. ""I think the idea of telling people, 'We blew it,' was just too embarrassing."" Small but steady growth, and a belief in their product, kept his team going. As recently as last summer, Silbermann and a few programmers were running Pinterest from a small apartment. But then the site began to gain traction and tech blogs took notice. ""It was surreal,"" he said. Now he's fending off copycat sites and answering the inevitable tech-media questions about scale and monetization. Silbermann, unlike some tech CEOs, sounds as though he'd rather talk about his product. ""To me, boards are a very human way of seeing the world,"" he said. ""It [Pinterest] is about helping people to discover things they didn't know they wanted -- things that feel like they've been handpicked just for you.""","Ben Silbermann is co-founder and CEO of photo-sharing site Pinterest .

"(CNN) -- What if, instead of climbing Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments from God, Moses had turned to the Israelites and asked: Hey, what do you guys think we should do? Considering the Hebrews' bad behavior in the Bible, what with the coveting of neighbors' wives and murdering their own brothers, that might have been a disastrous idea. But in our own more enlightened age, we're perfectly capable of crowdsourcing our own commandments -- or, at least, that's what a new project would have us believe. Lex Bayer, an executive at AirBnB, and John Figdor, a humanist chaplain at Stanford University, delivered their own 10 ""non-commandments"" in a book they co-wrote: ""Atheist Heart, Humanist Mind."" Bayer said the book forced him to clarify and articulate his own beliefs, and he thought others could benefit from doing the same. ""A lot of atheists' books are about whether to believe in God or not,"" he said. ""We wanted to consider: OK, so you don't believe in God, what's next? And that's actually a much harder question."" Enter the ""10 'Non-Commandments' Contest,"" in which atheists were asked to offer modern alternatives to the famous Decalogue. And, to sweeten the pot, the contest offered $10,000 in moolah to the winning would-be Moses. (If it helped boost atheists' public image and drum up publicity for his book, all the better, Bayer said.) The contest drew more than 2,800 submissions from 18 countries and 27 U.S. states, according to Bayer and Figdor. The proposed ""non-commandments"" ranged from the quizzical (""Don't follow your nature"") to the quixotic (""Thriving in space is the ultimate goal""). A team of 13 judges selected 10 of the more sober and serious submissions, and announced the winners Friday. There's nary a ""thou shalt"" among them -- nothing specifically about murder, stealing or adultery, although there is a version of the Golden Rule, which presumably would cover those crimes. If they lack faith in the divine, the atheist ""non-commandments"" display a robust faith in humankind, as if Silicon Valley had replaced Sinai. Bayer said humans are hardwired for compassion, and the scientific method and wisdom of crowds -- or the tribes that gather online each day -- will weed out bad ideas. In other words, this is an open-ended, and hopefully progressive, process, he said. So, will the 10 ideas form a new moral foundation for atheists or build a Tower of Babel? Take a look and see what you think. Here are the ""Ten Non-Commandments"" chosen as the winners: . 1. Be open-minded and be willing to alter your beliefs with new evidence. 2. Strive to understand what is most likely to be true, not to believe what you wish to be true. 3. The scientific method is the most reliable way of understanding the natural world. 4. Every person has the right to control of their body. 5. God is not necessary to be a good person or to live a full and meaningful life. 6. Be mindful of the consequences of all your actions and recognize that you must take responsibility for them. 7. Treat others as you would want them to treat you, and can reasonably expect them to want to be treated. Think about their perspective. 8. We have the responsibility to consider others, including future generations. 9. There is no one right way to live. 10. Leave the world a better place than you found it.","A contest crowdsources 10 ""non-commandments"" for atheists .

"(CNN) -- Just how awful has Washington dysfunction become? America's military members and veterans -- once immune to political sniping -- are caught in the crossfire. Last week, members of the U.S. Senate again engaged in their usual political games, and this time, veterans lost out on critical support. Almost all Veterans Service Organizations strongly supported the Veterans Omnibus Bill, including Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA), The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans. It is a transformative bill that includes critical, longstanding priorities for veterans. The bill would provide additional advance funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs, help the V.A. end the disability claims backlog, improve health care services, strengthen the new G.I. Bill, support veterans hiring programs and expand survivor benefits. Each of these provisions has garnered bipartisan support. But when the legislation, introduced by Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders, reached the Senate floor, Republicans objected to the scope of the bill. Democrats wouldn't allow amendments. Republicans wouldn't provide the votes to move forward. Nobody would compromise and veterans were left getting the shaft. The Senate shenanigans capped a winter of discontent for our community in which Washington continually attacked military members, veterans and their families. It used to be that vets could count on bipartisan support in Congress. But clearly, no more. In December, Congress cut military retirement benefits as part of a bipartisan, backroom budget deal. Reducing the annual cost-of-living adjustment for most military retirees and survivors would have led to a 20% cut to retirement benefits over the course of their lives. For a retired Army sergeant first class (E-7) that would have meant the loss of $83,000 in retirement savings. After massive protests and pressure from veterans and supporters, Congress finally reversed course and restored the benefits for veterans who served or enlisted before January 1, 2014. Last week, Congress forced the Pentagon to make budget cuts that increased living costs for our service members. Our service members are faced with a budget that would raise their grocery prices at commissaries by at least 20% and force military families to pay an additional 5% out-of-pocket for housing. CNN reported that members of the military redeemed nearly $104 million in food stamps at commissaries in the fiscal year that ended September 30. The Defense Department budget would cut subsidies that service members use to pay for diapers for their kids and to put bread on the table. And then Thursday the Senate leadership put partisanship ahead of helping veterans. Veterans and those active in the armed forces don't have time for this nonsense. Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America will be going to the Hill next month to demand Congress stop the attacks and put veterans ahead of petty politics. Washington needs to do much more to support those who sacrificed for their country. There are many deep problems: . About 22 veterans die by suicide every day. And according to a new study, the suicide rate for young male vets has skyrocketed, up 44% from 2009 to 2011. The V.A. disability claims backlog has hovered near 400,000 for months. These are veterans whose lives are on hold, waiting for the benefits they have earned. The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans remains higher than the national average. Congress and the administration still have not truly reformed the broken military justice system, which has failed tens of thousands of survivors of military sexual assault. I had the honor of attending the State of the Union a month ago, when every member of Congress stood up to applaud Sgt. 1st Class Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger who was wounded in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan during his 10th deployment overseas. The sustained, thundering applause was an incredibly moving gesture. But ultimately, it was just that: a gesture. What has Congress done since the State of the Union to help veterans like Cory who put on a uniform to defend our country? Aside from fixing its own mess on military retirement benefits, Congress has done nothing. Absolutely nothing. Veterans have taken notice. And we're not going to sit by idly as Congress fails to act on our priorities and, worse, attacks the benefits we've earned. Winter mercifully is ending. We await a spring of hope for veterans and their families.

"(CNN) -- Are men stupid? How else can we explain the endless parade of otherwise successful individuals, who by all appearances seem intelligent and competent, and yet risk destroying their careers and their personal lives over the chance to have a sexual escapade? John Edwards crashing from the heights of promise to infamy, from presidential candidate to defendant in a trial after a secret affair; Secret Service agents ending their careers in disgrace over dalliances with prostitutes in Colombia, all join that long procession of men who managed to self-destruct, pulling a pin on the grenade of their careers and perhaps their personal lives for the sake of a little fun. The pageant of legacy-killing misjudgment includes a president, several might-have-been presidents, a few governors, a World Bank director, a former Dutch prime minister, an Israeli president and one of the top golfers of all time. And that is only a partial list. How to explain it? The question has baffled women, mostly, since biblical times. Perhaps the Secret Service agents thought their behavior, if discovered, would raise no eyebrows. But the stupidity was in evidence when one of the agents, who had earlier ""protected"" Sarah Palin, posted on Facebook that he was ""checking her out."" Sounds like the claim of a 13-year-old boy. And the decision to post the comment displays the common sense of an 8-year-old. But that level of maturity and judgment shines compared to the decision of, say President Bill Clinton, who risked his presidency to have an affair with Monica Lewinsky, and then lied about it repeatedly. A brilliant man, everyone said about the president, but also one of only two presidents in American history impeached. The Clinton experience almost numbed us to the epidemic scale of the problem. Over and over we hear stories that defy belief. Men whose lives are filled with gifts and opportunity, men who have worked hard to achieve, risk it all and sometimes lose it all. There's Edwards, of course, he of the winning smile, the heart-warming marriage, the beautiful children, and the gorgeous hair, still young enough to contemplate another run at the White House, now facing prison time after revelations that he had an affair, a child, and a complicated and foolish coverup during the last campaign . Another who might have reached the presidency, had he not succumbed to the same meltdown of reason is former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, the law and order guy who threw it all away to cavort with prostitutes. He might have known someone would take relish in turning him in. Some try to explain it as biology, testosterone's fault, they say. Others blame complex psychological needs. ""The appeal of hookers lies in the temporary psychic relief they supply to men struggling with conflicts about guilt and responsibility,"" wrote psychologist Michael Bader. But I believe the common denominator, the proximate cause of the irrational behavior, is arrogance; the belief by some powerful men that they can get away with it. That the world is still their unchallenged domain, as it was years ago, when few people knew about a president bringing women to the White House to have sex, as John F. Kennedy did, or pressuring his secretary to yield to sexual advances, as was common. It is willful ignorance that the world has changed. The sudden-IQ-drop syndrome affects Democrats and Republicans, Americans and Europeans, people of all colors and professions. Did Tiger Woods think nobody would even learn about his affairs, with more than a dozen alleged relationships? Did former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican, who couldn't come up with an excuse so he simply disappeared to meet his Argentinian lover, think no one would find out? Then there's the Democratic congressman who might have become mayor of New York. Anthony Weiner's tweeting ranks near the top of the stupidity charts. But the competition is arduous. Republican Christopher Lee answered a Craigslist ad with a photograph of his flexed biceps, describing himself as a ""fit fun classy guy."" Across the Atlantic, the man who almost everyone expected to become the next president of France, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, married to a multi-millionaire, may or may not have assaulted a maid at his New York hotel. (DSK denied the charges and the criminal case against him was dropped by prosecutors. He is seeking dismissal of a civil suit.) He now is under investigation in connection with procuring prostitutes for parties, a crime under French law. The former Dutch Prime Minister, Ruud Lubbers, called it a ""friendly gesture"" after a woman accused him of ""grabbing her behind."" Lubbers had served as prime minister of the Netherlands, crowning a stellar career with a post as U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, when the accusations came. A U.N. investigation found no proof, but discovered a pattern of sexual harassment by the commissioner, which he also denied. That we're finding out about these men, and that their political careers are in many cases ending, is a sign that society is changing. That it continues to happen, to seemingly intelligent, disciplined individuals, is a sign that the process will be slow. And that, in the final analysis, if it has to do with sex, some men really are stupid.

"Washington (CNN) -- Reports the United States is on the verge of a security agreement with Afghanistan that includes a formal letter of apology for past mistakes by American troops are completely false, the National Security adviser told CNN on Tuesday. The statements came amid claims by Afghan officials that the Obama administration offered to write the letter as part of an effort to keep a small number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan well past the 2014 deadline to withdraw. ""No such letter has been drafted or delivered. There is not a need for the United States to apologize to Afghanistan,"" National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on CNN's ""Situation Room."" ""Quite the contrary, we have sacrificed and supported them in their democratic progress and in tackling the insurgents and al Qaeda. So that (letter of apology) is not on the table."" Rice said she has seen news reports but has no idea where they are coming from, describing the claims as a ""complete misunderstanding of what the situation is."" The claim first surfaced following talks Tuesday between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, when Karzai's spokesman told reporters that Kerry said President Barack Obama would write an official letter guaranteeing the United States would not repeat ""past mistakes"" that led to civilian casualties. Asked later about such a letter, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""I don't have anything to tell you about whether there will or won't be a letter."" The conversation between Karzai and Kerry came ahead of a meeting of Afghan leaders -- known as a Loya Jirga -- to potentially sign off on a deal that would allow a limited number of American troops to stay to train Afghan security services. Kerry declined an invitation to attend to the Loya Jirga, but offered to write a letter to the leaders offering U.S. assurances about a future security relationship, said two senior U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The letter Kerry offered would also clarify the U.S. position on past issues, such as civilian casualties and a pledge to do everything possible to avoid them, said one of the officials. But the letter in no way would be offered as an apology, both officials said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said a ""general agreement"" between the two countries was reached last month. There have been talks in the weeks since ""to finalize the text,"" he said. Opium poppy cultivation rises to new levels in Afghanistan . Rice said the United States was in the last stages of negotiations on a framework that Kerry and Karzai signed off on last month during talks. ""Without such an agreement, that level of cooperation would be all but impossible."" Karzai's office issued a statement spelling out some points of contention, including the Afghan government's opposition to raids ""on any Afghan homes by U.S. forces,"" while Washington wants to be able to conduct such operations ""in exceptional circumstances."" According to the statement, Karzai proposed two alternatives: . -- Have Kerry himself make the case for military raids when the Loya Jirga convenes later this week . -- Don't sign any bilateral security agreement until a new Afghan government takes shape after the upcoming presidential election, set for next April . Karzai agrees to new deadline for prison handover . Carney acknowledged military raids were an issue, calling them a matter of concern for both countries. U.S. troops were deployed to Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, which were coordinated by al Qaeda leaders then based in the country. Obama has vowed to reduce U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, with the goal to end the U.S. combat mission by the end of 2014 . Several military and Pentagon officials have told CNN that one option now being considered calls for a total NATO force of 8,000 to 12,000 troops, with 3,000 to 4,000 coming from NATO countries, and the United States providing up the balance of troops. While the final numbers could change, a senior Defense Department official said it's not likely to change by much. If fewer than 8,000 were to stay, relatively few would be able to engage in actual missions. Obama signals Afghan war's next chapter .

"(CNN) -- I'm in a Las Vegas hotel room, hiding from Christmas. The odds are not in my favor. This is not a war on, jihad against or campaign to counter anyone else's annual allotment of holly jolly joy. If it were up to me, I'd quietly exile myself from the merrymaking so as not to dim others' bliss like a burned-out bulb on an otherwise twinkly light strand. I'm not a Grinch or a Scrooge or any of the other soot-stained slurs hurled by people fed up with a loved one's reluctance to join the reindeer games. What I am is depressed. In the cold, dark, ash-end of the dying year, it is hard for me to pry my head from my pillow and draw breath into my lungs -- let alone don gay apparel and fa-la-la along with the rest of the festive public. But I do it -- alongside countless other people suffering from seasonal affective disorder, active grief, debilitating panic, PTSD and a whole host of other emotional issues that are thrown into sharp relief amid the mandatory revelry. I don't want to drag anyone else into my darkness and take the shimmer off their star. I try to slough off my dull gray sweater and don a gaudy holiday number that I hope will distract from the listlessness in my eyes and my affect, and I will myself to snap out of it. That may successfully deflect attention from friends and family caught up in holiday chaos, but I am thoroughly unable to force myself into a state of good cheer. The attempt makes it worse. ""I think there must be something wrong with me, Linus. Christmas is coming, but I'm not happy. I don't feel the way I'm supposed to feel. ... I like getting presents and sending Christmas cards and decorating trees and all that, but I'm still not happy. I always end up feeling depressed."" Read more: Going public with depression . As a child, it was surprising and oddly comforting to see my strange feelings articulated by a beloved cartoon character amid the Technicolor cheer of holiday TV specials. But then again, I have always identified with poor ol' Charlie Brown -- and the response his confession of yuletide unease received from his peers. ""Charlie Brown, you're the only person I know who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem."" Nope -- not just you, Charlie Brown. The rest of us just don't talk about it for fear that the Linuses of the world will pass judgment; if you can't join in the joy of the most wonderful time of the year, you are clearly defective. You are a misfit toy, minus the solidarity of an island full of kindred spirits. Even for those who don't struggle with chronic or seasonal depression, there are myriad reasons why some approach December with dread. For many who have who always celebrated holidays with warmth and abandon, there's a raw and tender spot where a departed family member used to be. Even if the grief is not fresh, the rites and rituals that once brought such delight now awaken the ache of loss. For others, economic strain, family estrangement, the pressure of others' expectations, overtaxed schedules and plain old exhaustion can mount and crush the happiness out a season that was previously a source of comfort. But rarely, if ever, are we given a strings-free opportunity to opt out. ""It's only once a year!"" a friend said to me just yesterday, kvetching about her sister-in-law's reluctance to suck it up and make merry. I've never met the woman, but I had to argue on her behalf. I come from a family in which Christmas Day e-mails have become an acceptable level of holiday hoopla, but have married into a family heavily invested in the celebration. As much as I love and cherish every member of my husband's massive multigenerational clan, their celebrations operate at an unfamiliar frequency. Being launched into the holiday machine with a family that celebrates bigheartedly, boisterously and lavishly became a source of yearly panic and dread for me. I was terribly ashamed of myself for feeling that way. Yes, it's only once a year, but my mother-in-law is nearing 90. The desire to deliver the brand of holiday she's come to expect added so much weight to the event, I'd find myself almost unable to breathe at the very thought of it. Read more: National Depression Screening Day: Sharing experiences . Then I'd fret that someone would notice my distress (they did) and take it personally if I slipped away to compose myself. (Where's Kat? She's taking a nap again? Doesn't she want to spend time with us?) After several years of that stress, I realized something was going to have to give -- and it was going to have to be me. I can't say I'm ever going to actively enjoy Christmas, but I love my family (and myself) enough to make the most out of it and have found ways to manage my seasonally fragile mood in a way that might minimize upset from either side. I save up my vacation days, hotel points and and frequent-flier miles to visit somewhere sunny -- usually Las Vegas. While trees, cheeky holiday decor, and jazzed-up carols have begun to encroach upon this den of depravity and excess, it's still a relatively safe haven for Christmas cranks like me, and the darkness sets in a shade later than it does back home. On the ground at Christmas central with the in-laws, my husband and I have taken to getting a hotel room, rather than staying with family. Though that may not be the most economically sensible option, we don't have to worry about overtaxing anyone's generosity, and the autonomy offers a little breathing room that helps me more calmly and thoroughly appreciate the time we spend together in celebration. Once in the familial fray, I try to make myself as useful as humanly possible. Need that platter washed? Gimme! We're out of cinnamon? Where are the car keys? The children need someone to chase around the yard to wear them out? Whooooooooosh! And I've added my own ritual to the mix -- crafting multiple pitchers of rye sours made with freshly-squeezed lemons and clementine juice. It busies my hands for at least an hour, lightly buzzes the crowd for a couple more and I get to spend one-on-one time with each person as I serve them. It has by all accounts been a most welcome addition to the holidays, and for a while our moods align happily and brightly. This may not be ideal for every family, but we make the most of what we've been given. I'll take my Christmas spirit any way I can get it.

"(CNN) -- Flights to London's Gatwick Airport were diverted and departures delayed for a time Monday after a Virgin Atlantic plane made an emergency landing, the airport said. Flight VS43, heading to Las Vegas, landed safely at Gatwick after developing a technical fault with its landing gear, Virgin Atlantic said. The airport's runway was closed temporarily while the the plane was removed. It reopened at around 7 p.m. local time, and inbound and outbound flights resumed, according to the airport. The airport warned, however, that it might take ""some time"" before normal services resume. Gatwick describes itself on its website as ""the most efficient single-runway airport in the world."" Gatwick earlier said it had put its emergency services on standby for VS43 -- a Boeing 747 -- to make a ""non-standard landing.""

He provides commentary on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" daily from 4 p.m.-7 p.m. You can also visit Jack's Cafferty File blog. Jack Cafferty says John McCain shows virtually no intellectual curiosity, emulating President Bush . NEW YORK (CNN) -- Russia invades Georgia and President Bush goes on vacation. Our president has spent one-third of his entire two terms in office either at Camp David, Maryland, or at Crawford, Texas, on vacation. His time away from the Oval Office included the month leading up to 9/11, when there were signs Osama bin Laden was planning to attack America, and the time Hurricane Katrina destroyed the city of New Orleans. Sen. John McCain takes weekends off and limits his campaign events to one a day. He made an exception for the religious forum on Saturday at Saddleback Church in Southern California. I think he made a big mistake. When he was invited last spring to attend a discussion of the role of faith in his life with Sens. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, at Messiah College in Pennsylvania, McCain didn't bother to show up. Now I know why. It occurs to me that John McCain is as intellectually shallow as our current president. When asked what his Christian faith means to him, his answer was a one-liner. ""It means I'm saved and forgiven."" Great scholars have wrestled with the meaning of faith for centuries. McCain then retold a story we've all heard a hundred times about a guard in Vietnam drawing a cross in the sand. Asked about his greatest moral failure, he cited his first marriage, which ended in divorce. While saying it was his greatest moral failing, he offered nothing in the way of explanation. Why not? Throughout the evening, McCain chose to recite portions of his stump speech as answers to the questions he was being asked. Why? He has lived 71 years. Surely he has some thoughts on what it all means that go beyond canned answers culled from the same speech he delivers every day. He was asked ""if evil exists."" His response was to repeat for the umpteenth time that Osama bin Laden is a bad man and he will pursue him to ""the gates of hell."" That was it. He was asked to define rich. After trying to dodge the question -- his wife is worth a reported $100 million -- he finally said he thought an income of $5 million was rich. One after another, McCain's answers were shallow, simplistic, and trite. He showed the same intellectual curiosity that George Bush has -- virtually none. Where are John McCain's writings exploring the vexing moral issues of our time? Where are his position papers setting forth his careful consideration of foreign policy, the welfare state, education, America's moral responsibility in the world, etc., etc., etc.? John McCain graduated 894th in a class of 899 at the Naval Academy at Annapolis. His father and grandfather were four star admirals in the Navy. Some have suggested that might have played a role in McCain being admitted. His academic record was awful. And it shows over and over again whenever McCain is called upon to think on his feet. He no longer allows reporters unfettered access to him aboard the ""Straight Talk Express"" for a reason. He simply makes too many mistakes. Unless he's reciting talking points or reading from notes or a TelePrompTer, John McCain is lost. He can drop bon mots at a bowling alley or diner -- short glib responses that get a chuckle, but beyond that McCain gets in over his head very quickly. I am sick and tired of the president of the United States embarrassing me. The world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into Vladimir Putin's eyes and see into his soul. George Bush's record as a student, military man, businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure. And the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself. He will leave office with the country $10 trillion in debt, fighting two wars, our international reputation in shambles, our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises, our citizens' faith in our own country ripped to shreds. Yet Bush goes bumbling along, grinning and spewing moronic one-liners, as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been. I fear to the depth of my being that John McCain is just like him.

"(CNN) -- UPDATE: High school football coach Bud Walpole was offered his job back, effective Thursday, CNN affiliate WCBD reported. The school district superintendent invited him back Wednesday only after Walpole submitted a written commitment to focus more on diversity and sensitivity training, according to a statement. A high school football coach in Charleston, South Carolina, was fired after he permitted a post-game celebratory ritual involving a watermelon that some say is racist. After a parent reported the ""watermelon ritual"" to the school board, the Charleston County School District launched an investigation and ultimately fired Academic Magnet High School coach Bud Walpole, according to CNN affiliate WCSC. ""Players would gather in a circle and smash the watermelon while others were either standing in a group or locking arms and making chanting sounds described as, 'Ooh, ooh, ooh,'"" school district Superintendent Nancy McGinley said, describing the noises as ""monkey sounds."" The watermelon was decorated with caricatures drawn with Sharpie markers, she added. Dot Scott, president of the Charleston branch of the NAACP, said the organization supported the school's decision to fire Walpole. Scott thanked the superintendent at a Wednesday press conference ""for her swift attention to an inappropriate and racially insensitive ritual performed by the football team."" The school district has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment. A number of parents and students, however, are standing in support of Walpole, who coached at the school for 10 years. More than 4,000 people have signed a petition to reinstate the ousted coach, as of Wednesday afternoon. Some say they don't see the ritual as racist. ""I just don't understand why the school district is concerned this is an issue,"" Connie Biggs, the president of Academic Magnet's Booster Club told WCSC. ""Is it because it's a watermelon? If it had been a pumpkin or a cantaloupe would that have been a different reaction from the district."" Harry Griffin, a junior at The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, said he has known Walpole for six years and considers the coach a man of integrity. Griffin played for Walpole's high school team as a fullback and nose guard. CNN first learned of this story through an iReport Griffin uploaded. ""Coach Walpole was fired because his team had a harmless tradition that was made to seem prejudiced,"" Griffin wrote in a CNN iReport. ""They had a post-game ritual of smashing a watermelon and eating it after every victory. A parent on an opposing team deemed this act as racist and the school board decided to interrogate the players."" Some parents are taking issue with how the investigation was conducted and how students were questioned about the ritual. ""The school district is not telling us what they said to these kids,"" Biggs said. ""They're giving us two questions that they say that they asked but these interviews have lasted 10-20 minutes apiece, so I'm really unclear how two questions could take that long."" Griffin called Walpole's firing an injustice. ""I want to help my coach get his integrity back,"" Griffin said. ""You can ask anyone that has ever met Bud Walpole if he has ever said or done anything that would cause you to think he was racist. Nobody would ever say such a thing.""","High school football coach fired after controversial ""watermelon ritual""

"(CNN) -- Europe and the Muslim world seem to be on a collision course that could have major political, economic and ideological ramifications. January 23, 2012, may well come to be remembered as the crucial date when Samuel Huntington's ""clash of civilizations"" thesis, which many of us believed discredited beyond repair, was reaffirmed. Political scientist Huntington wrote in 1993 that cultural divisions preclude a defining global civilization, and the West and the Muslim world would never share the same values. Last month, Europe took two different actions that nonetheless sent the same message to the Muslim world: You are not our equals and are doomed to be judged by standards different from those by which we judge ourselves. Future historians might call January 23 the day when Europe irreversibly alienated not one, but both, pivotal powers -- Iran and Turkey -- that in all probability will dominate the political landscape of the Middle East for several decades. One action was the European Union's decision to ban oil purchases from Iran, including imports of crude oil, petroleum products and petrochemical products, to force Tehran to negotiate away its uranium enrichment program, which Tehran insists is for civilian use only. This is the latest in a series of increasingly stringent sanctions that Western powers have unilaterally imposed on Iran. These sanctions go well beyond those required by the U.N. Security Council. The EU sanctions attempt to hit the Iranian economy where it hurts most: Europe imports about a fifth of Iranian oil. When combined with a ban on transactions with Iran's Central Bank, this action is aimed at paralyzing the Iranian economy. At the same time, the French Senate passed a law making it a crime to deny genocides that are officially recognized by France. The two genocides in this category are the Holocaust and the killing of 1.5 million Armenians in Anatolia during the last years of the Ottoman Empire. Because the denial of the Holocaust is already a crime under French law, the obvious objective of the bill is to criminalize the denial of the 1915 Armenian genocide. The issue of Armenian genocide touches a very raw nerve in Turkey, which denies the scale of the killings -- Turkey maintains that roughly 500,000 Armenians were killed -- as well as the claim that it was planned. According to Turkey, the killings happened in the midst of the disarray accompanying World War I and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey says a nearly equivalent number of Turks and Kurds were also killed in inter-ethnic strife with the Armenians, who were allied with the Ottoman's Russian adversaries. It's not the accuracy of the opposing claims that is at issue; it's Muslim perceptions. Iran may well be trying to develop nuclear weapons, and what amounts to an Armenian genocide may well have taken place. What roils Muslim opinion worldwide is the perception that the West uses blatant double standards to pass judgment. Harsh sanctions on Iran are seen as an attempt to prevent a Muslim country from developing deterrents to attacks from Israel and the United States, both nuclear powers hostile to the Islamic Republic. Most Western discussions of the Iranian bomb do not make even passing reference to the well-documented Israeli nuclear capability, even as Israel threatens to militarily strike Iran's nuclear facilities. This omission is seen as hypocritical, dishonest and self-serving. For many in the Muslim world, double standards explain why France singled out Turkey, and didn't criminalize the denial of other nations' crimes against humanity. Although denying Germany's crimes is a crime, the Holocaust is universally accepted as genocide, while Turkey's is not. Many ask why disputing European massacres of non-European people is not criminalized -- such as the French actions in Algeria, as Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan has said. These would include the near-total extermination of native populations by European settlers in Australia, New Zealand, and North America. They would include the killings of millions of people by the Belgian administration of the Congo Free State, whose population was halved during the early decades of Belgian rule. Most pertinent of all, Muslims ask, why not criminalize the denial of the genocidal Spanish Inquisition that led to the extermination, expulsion or conversion of the entire Muslim and Jewish populations of the Iberian peninsula? Many Muslims perceive these moves as the West targeting Iran and Turkey in an attempt to prevent important Muslim countries from achieving the military capacity -- Iran -- and the political stature -- Turkey -- they deserve. Many see behind these moves the not-so-hidden hand of an ideology based on Huntington's theory of the clash of civilizations. Although these perceptions may not fully conform with reality, it is well established that perceptions count much more than reality in the conduct of international relations.

"KAMPALA, Uganda (CNN) -- Police in Uganda have arrested and extradited a man who is among the most wanted suspects from the Rwandan genocide. The 100-day killing rampage led to the loss of an estimated 10 percent of Rwanda's population. IIdephonse Nizeyimana was picked up at a hotel in Rubaga, a suburb of the capital, Kampala, by the National Central Bureau of Interpol, according to a news release from the U.N.-sponsored International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) on Tuesday. He was transferred Tuesday to a U.N. detention facility in Arusha, Tanzania, where the tribunal is based. Top officials who allegedly took part in the genocide, such as army generals and politicians, are tried by the tribunal. ""Nizeyimana is one of the four top accused who are earmarked by the prosecutor to be tried by the tribunal in Arusha after their arrest as part of the ICTR completion strategy,"" the tribunal's news release said. Of a list of 13 fugitives, he is the second to be arrested in less than two months, it said. In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus, and went on a 100-day killing rampage. Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors. It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million -- 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents. Nizeyimana was a captain the Rwanda Armed Forces, the tribunal said. He is accused of exercising authority over soldiers and personnel through a chain of command, and allegedly sent a section of soldiers to execute of Rosalie Gicanda, a former queen of Rwanda who was a ""symbolic figure for all Tutsis,"" it said. The tribunal noted this marks the second time Uganda has cooperated with it to make an arrest. ""The tribunal has commended the Interpol and the Ugandan authorities for their close cooperation,"" the news release said.

"(CNN) -- Investigators have pinpointed two men as ""possible suspects"" who were seen in images near the finish line of this week's Boston Marathon -- moments before twin bombs there exploded, killing three and injuring about 180 others -- a law enforcement official said. A circular sent out Wednesday to federal and state agencies features the photos ""in an attempt to identify the individuals,"" who were described as being of ""high interest"" to investigators. One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack. An FBI official earlier said that authorities believe the bombs were placed inside a black nylon backpack or bag. The source said that authorities had not yet identified the two men by name and that the photographs were not being released to the public for fear of impeding the investigation. Earlier Wednesday, two official sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man -- who also hasn't been named -- as a possible suspect in the attack. Seen on a video, this man wore a white baseball cap. One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket. It was not immediately known if this man is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials. This movement in the investigation came two days after the horrific blast shook the city, during what is traditionally one of its biggest and most beloved events each year. By Wednesday, authorities had made ""significant progress"" in the case but no arrests, a federal law enforcement source told CNN's John King. Sources previously told CNN that a suspect was in custody, but both Boston police and the FBI denied that any arrests had been made. A Boston law enforcement source told CNN, ""We got him,"" but wouldn't clarify whether that meant a suspect has been identified or arrested. Some federal sources said it was even too early to say investigators had identified the suspect, but several sources in Boston told CNN that they have a clear identification. Speaking on CNN's The Situation Room, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said investigators were closer to cracking the case ""every hour."" But he urged patience with the probe. ""What I would say and I would ask of everyone is we give law enforcement the space to do their work,"" Patrick said. ""When they are ready with a complete picture, they will tell us what that picture is."" He added, ""I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time."" Earlier Wednesday, investigators revealed more details about the makeup of the bombs, which exploded 12 seconds apart. One had been housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said in a joint intelligence bulletin. The device also had fragments that may have included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said. The lid of a pressure cooker thought to be used in the device was found on a rooftop at the scene, a federal law enforcement official with firsthand knowledge of the investigation told CNN. The second bomb was also housed in a metal container, but it was not clear whether it too was in a pressure cooker, the FBI said. The U.S. government has warned federal agencies in the past that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel and detonating them with blasting caps. The bombs . Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. Scraps of at least one pressure cooker, nails and nylon bags found at the scene were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices, the agent leading the investigation said Tuesday. The pieces suggest each of the devices was 6 liters (about 1.6 gallons) in volume, a Boston law enforcement source said. The recovered parts include part of a circuit board, which might have been used to detonate a device. A law enforcement official said Monday's bombs were probably detonated by timers. But the FBI said details of the detonating system were unknown. While the clues moved the investigation forward, they did not make it immediately apparent whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism. ""If your experience and your expertise is Middle East terrorism, it has the hallmarks of al Qaeda or a Middle East group,"" former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes said. ""If your experience is domestic groups and bombings that have occurred here, it has the hallmarks of a domestic terrorist like Eric Rudolph in the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics bombings."" Things we know . Fuentes said he has investigated both types of terrorism -- from Iraq to the United States -- and finds the Boston attack has elements of both. ""It has the hallmarks of both domestic and international (attacks), and you can see either side of that."" Opinion: Why is this so rare? Third victim identified . Boston University identified graduate student Lingzi Lu as the third person who died in Monday's bombings. Previously identified were Krystle Campbell, 29, of Arlington, Massachusetts, and Martin Richard, 8, of Dorchester, Massachusetts. ""She was the best,"" Campbell's distraught mother, Patty, told reporters Tuesday. ""You couldn't ask for a better daughter."" Martin ""was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future,"" his school said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken by this loss."" The hunt for the attacker . The attack left Boston police with ""the most complex crime scene that we've dealt with in the history of our department,"" Commissioner Ed Davis said Tuesday. Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips. They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images. ""Someone knows who did this,"" said Rick DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office, said. ""The community will play a crucial role in this investigation."" Medical personnel treating the wounded found evidence suggesting the bomb maker or bomb makers sought to maximize the suffering. Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found ""numerous"" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies. ""There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,"" Velmahos said. 'Human spirit' still alive . Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails. ""There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,"" he said. Victims continue recovery . As investigators continued to search for a suspect, those wounded in the incident continued to recover. Boston-area hospitals had released at least 112 of the 178 people injured in the attack, according to CNN's tally late Wednesday. Of the 66 people who were still hospitalized, 13 were in critical condition. Boston Medical Center has two patients in critical condition, down from 11 just after the bombings, Dr. Peter Burke, chief of trauma care, told reporters Wednesday. Ten patients are in serious condition and seven are in fair condition, he said. Spectator Steve Byrne was standing with a group of friends near a mailbox when the second blast went off. Now his face is scarred with shrapnel wounds. A BB pellet remains lodged in his neck. Doctors said they couldn't remove it because was too close to nerves that control his vision, but he was out of the hospital on Wednesday. Compared to how his friends are suffering, he told CNN's AC360 that he feels lucky. Four out of the five friends he was watching the marathon with have lost limbs, he said. One friend had 70 nails in his leg. He remembers the explosion in vivid detail: the blast that was so strong that it burned his clothes off; the carnage around him; and the haunting, slow-motion daze of searching for his friends. ""We were having a great day and waiting to see our friend cross the finish line,"" he said, ""and then all of the sudden it turned in a flash."" He told CNN he's worried about the financial burdens his friends could face as a result of the explosion. One friend is a carpenter and ""both his hands are incinerated. He can't go to work, and the bills keep coming in."" ""It's not just the hospitals. It's everyday life that doesn't stop. ... We're just hoping the mayor, the governor, President Obama don't let us as citizens down."" Beyond those seriously wounded, the incident affected thousands, including Candace Rispoli, who was cheering on a friend when the festive atmosphere turned into a ""terrifying hell."" She suffered minor injuries. ""I personally will never participate in an event of this nature in a city in fear that something like this could happen again,"" she said. ""I keep replaying the moments of terror over and over in my head and am just still in utter shock. Always seeing terrible things of this nature happen all over the world on TV, my heart would always go out to those directly affected. But I never imagined in a million years I would be a spectator at the Boston Marathon running for my life.""

"(CNN) -- When you hear the term ""working mom,"" what image comes to mind? Is it of a woman, perhaps dressed in a suit, dropping off her kids at school or day care before hurrying to the office? Or is it a mom, possibly dressed in yoga pants, booting up her computer from the confines of her own home? I bet many of you would pick the former -- the woman who works outside the house. I admit I tend to have that image in mind whenever I write about the juggling act facing working moms. But each time I do that, I am leaving out the women who work from home who face their own unique work-life balance challenges. (According to a recent Stanford University study, about 10% of American workers now regularly work from home.) Take the case of Lela Davidson, whose children are 13 and 15 and who has been working from home as a published author, freelance writer and blogger since her children were in elementary school. Recently, she has been recruited for a few jobs, which would require her to work in an office. ""My daughter told me, 'Oh Mommy, if you get that job, I'm going to be so proud of you, like you're going to have a real job,' But I have a real job right now,"" she told me while working during a vacation with her family. ""But I realized how different it is, because of the way the media portrays women and work ... corporate women hitting it hard and that's what my daughter sees."" ""It's a little bit more glamorous if you are leaving home because you get dressed. Maybe I should get dressed every day,"" she said with a laugh. Simply your life: Telecommuting isn't just for parents . There are a host of misconceptions about working from home, said Alex Iwashyna, a mom of two and freelance writer and blogger. One of the biggest, she said, is the sense that you are available to take care of all the household matters while also doing your job. ""You are really juggling everything at once with no lunch break, no coffee break and you don't go home at night,"" she said. ""Your office is right there and you have to learn to turn everything off, which is, I think, one of the biggest challenges."" Too often, Iwashyna, whose children are 4 and 6, would get back on her laptop after she put the kids down to finish up all the things she didn't do that day, but that meant she wasn't spending important time with her husband. ""You don't realize how much that time together, even if it's sitting on the couch watching bad TV, matters,"" she said, adding that she had to start scheduling evenings she doesn't work to make sure she and her husband have one-on-one time. Scheduling is a must to make working from home work, said Davidson, who blocks out her day in the morning or the night before. ""I have my little Google calendar, which makes my life happy."" She also said she needs to leave the house, on occasion, and work from a local coffee shop -- but it's not because she feels isolated. She works online and in social media, so she feels very social, she said. Heading somewhere other than home helps her focus. ""I go out and work in public coffee shops or with friends because I feel like that accountability, when there are other people around me who have gotten dressed, with their bag, gone into a place, I feel like I know they're working, so I can't play on Facebook,"" she said. Who works from home and how they do it . Holly Reisem Hanna, publisher and founder of The Work at Home Woman, recently named by Forbes as one of the top 75 career websites, said if you are thinking about working from home, you need to figure out if you have the personality to make it work. ""While working from home cuts down on typical office distractions for many individuals, for others the lack of physical boundaries and a manager standing over their shoulder may not be enough structure for them to effectively work,"" she said. The biggest benefit of working from home, hands down, is the flexibility. ""I have 24 hours in my day and I can structure them as I need to,"" said Davidson, who said she can work in between picking up the kids from school, attending school functions and cooking her children a healthy meal for dinner. Iwashyna bought a portable wireless device that allows her to be online anytime and anywhere. ""I carry that around with me so if I'm early to pick up the kids, and I have my laptop with me, I might get a little work done in the car,"" she said. Hanna, who launched a blog in 2009 devoted to helping women make telecommuting and home-based businesses work for them, said working from home gives women flexibility and freedom. Work from home and still be part of the office . ""Having a flexible schedule helps families to have more quality time together,"" she said. ""It provides greater overall satisfaction and it helps to lessen the guilt that many parents have because they're unable to do everything."" It also, in Davidson's case, allows you to do something else -- set up a yoga studio right in the office. So, whenever her neck starts to hurt from sitting too long in her chair, like mine is starting to do as I finish this column, she cues up a podcast and rolls out the mat right in her home office. ""My mat is always there next to my desk,"" she said. ""I probably wouldn't do that if I were wearing pumps and in an office.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Four men convicted of murdering 13 Chinese sailors on the Mekong River in the northern Thai province of Chiang Rai in 2011 were executed in China Friday, state media reported. Chinese authorities identified one of the men as a Myanmar drug lord named Naw Kham, with the other three -- believed to be members of his gang -- named as Hsang Kham from Thailand, Yi Lai, referred to as ""stateless,"" and Zha Xika, a Laotian, the state-run Xinhua new agency reported. Xinhua referred to Kham's nickname as ""the Godfather,"" saying that his was ""the largest armed drug trafficking gang on the Mekong River."" The four men were executed by lethal injection in the city of Kunming in southwest China's Yunnan Province, the Kunming Intermediate People's Court said, Xinhua said. Their appeal was rejected last month. Chinese prosecutors defended the decision, saying the case had built up sufficient evidence, and that the actions of the four men were held to be extremely cruel. Prosecutor Zhang Weiting from the People's Procuratorate of Yunnan Province told Xinhua that ""intentional murder is the heaviest crime in China and the murderers deserve their sentence."" Thai authorities discovered the gruesome murder scene in October 2011 after boarding two cargo ships that had come under gunfire. They found nearly 1 million amphetamines and 12 dead bodies, some with their hands bound. One sailor was missing. The gang was arrested in a joint operation by police from China, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand, according to Xinhua. The agency added that the gang colluded with Thai soldiers in the attack on the cargo ships, the Hua Ping and Yu Xing 8. Kham was also accused of directing several of his subordinates in the kidnapping of Chinese sailors and hijacking of cargo ships in exchange for a ransom in early April 2011, the court said, according to Chinese state media. In an interview from his prison cell with state broadcaster CCTV Friday, Kham appeared to express regret about his past. ""The Golden Triangle area is a place of evil,"" he said, referring to one of Southeast Asia's main drug-producing areas that overlaps several countries in the region. ""It turns good people bad. ""People come here doing business, but they couldn't resist the temptation of drugs, then they become drug dealers too."" After the execution, the court was to hand over their remains, wills and personal belongings to relatives or relevant consulates, Xinhua said. Two additional gang members received death sentences with reprieves and will serve eight years in jail. The death penalty remains an iconic form of punishment in China, where executions are used as a public warning. Sentencing is broadcast on state television. China carries out the most executions by far in the world each year, according to Amnesty International -- thought to number in the thousands -- though it does not provide an exact figure. The official number of executions is a state secret. However, the group admits Beijing has taken steps in recent years to reduce the number of capital crimes. In 2011, Amnesty said China abolished the death sentences for 13 non-violent offenses and in cases where the accused was over the age of 75 -- though it warned people were rarely executed in these cases, with the implementation of the death penalty often extended for other capital offenses. CNN's CY Xu in Beijing contributed to this report.","One of the four was a Burmese drug smuggler .

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department will collect data about police stops, searches and arrests, aiming to reduce possible effects of racial bias in the justice system, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Monday. The agency is launching a new National Center for Building Community Trust and Justice, which will focus data-collection on five cities over two years as part of a $4.75 million pilot program. Holder said in a video message the initiative grew from the case of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teenager shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Orlando in 2012 and from President Barack Obama to improve trust between law enforcement and the minority communities. Holder has ordered a federal civil rights probe of the racially-charged Martin case, which is ongoing. Holder cited a study that showed the majority of African-American men are arrested at least once by age 23, and that group was six times more likely than white men to be imprisoned. The figure for Latino men was 2.5 times higher than whites. ""This overrepresentation of young men of color in our criminal justice system is a problem we must confront â€” not only as an issue of individual responsibility but also as one of fundamental fairness, and as an issue of effective law enforcement,"" Holder said. ""Racial disparities contribute to tension in our nation generally and within communities of color specifically, and tend to breed resentment towards law enforcement that is counterproductive to the goal of reducing crime,"" he said. The five cities to be studied by the Justice Department under the initiative will be announced later.","Effort stems partly from Trayvon Martin shooting in 2012 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked the No.1 item on the president's congressional ""to-do-list,"" refusing to allow a vote on a bill that would give tax breaks for companies that ""insource"" jobs to the U.S. from overseas while eliminating tax deductions for companies that move jobs abroad. In voting against the bill, Republicans raised both substantive and procedural problems with the measure. The bill fell four votes short of the 60 needed to bring it to debate, with 42 voting against it. Four GOP senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Dean Heller of Nevada -- voted in favor of the bill. Romney drives a truck through Obama's 'build that' remark . With job creation the top issue this campaign season, and outsourcing being blamed as a big contributor to the high unemployment rate, Democrats saw the bill as an election-year winner. Sponsored by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who is running for reelection, the bill made it to the top of the ""to-do list"" for Congress President Barack Obama unveiled earlier this year. The Bring Jobs Home Act would provide a 20% tax break for the costs of moving jobs back to the United States and would rescind business expense deductions available to companies that are associated with the cost of moving operations overseas. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, had warned Democrats before the vote that his party would want to amend the bill -- possibly with hot-button issues like repealing the health care reform law or extending the Bush-era tax cuts for all income levels. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, responded that those amendments were not germane to the bill and he would not allow votes on them. In addition, Republican aides called attention to opposition by business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, who generally support Republicans. Biden knocks GOP over outsourcing . In a letter to senators this week, the Chamber of Commerce called the bill ""misguided"" and said it ""would hamper American worldwide companies' competitiveness, increase complexity in the Internal Revenue Code, and threaten economic growth.""

"(CNN) -- Finally, after days of listing on a disabled Carnival cruise ship without electricity and working toilets, thousands of passengers finished disembarking early Friday morning at the Port of Mobile. The frustration that many felt was typified by Janie Esparza, one of the first passengers to get back on land. ""It was horrible. Horrible,"" Esparza told a scrum of reporters. ""The bathroom facilities were horrible and we could not flush toilets. No electricity and our rooms were in total darkness. Honestly, think that this ship should have ever sailed out."" The Carnival Triumph, became a major media story, when it caught fire off the coast of Mexico. The blaze left the vessel listing to the side, drifting in Gulf of Mexico currents and the more than 4,200 passengers and crew on board in limbo. It took five days for the ship to dock at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, three days after it was due. Family members cheered as the ship pulled in and in the crowd also was Carnival CEO Gerry Cahill. The CEO had his own message for the weary passengers: Sorry. ""We pride ourselves in providing our guests with a great vacation experience, and clearly we failed in this particular case,"" he said. The beleaguered CEO went on the ship as passengers departed and delivered another apology. But for some, like passenger Norma Reyes, it was too little too late. ""The hallways were toxic,"" said Reyes, who said she would never go on a Carnival cruise again. ""Full of urine. It was horrible. If that ship caught on fire and they had not contained it where would we be? Floating in the ocean or dead."" Others were more forgiving. ""They did a good job of managing expectations,"" said Brett Klausman. ""The information that trickled out was probably well thought out to kind of keep people safe and calm."" Despite the ordeal, many passengers had nothing but praise for the crew, saying they had worked long shifts to make sure their guests were as comfortable as possible. ""No power, no toilets, nothing. Nothing. I mean, it was was disgusting, but the staff, they did such an amazing job,"" said Joseph Alvarez. ""And I give them so much props because they were amazing through it all. I mean, they worked their tails off to accommodate everybody's needs."" Five things we've learned about cruising . U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, Coast Guard members and a Carnival team boarded the ship before it arrived in port to help speed efforts to get passengers off as quickly as possible, he said. Some families gathered at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, far from where the ship was originally supposed to dock in Galveston, Texas. Marissa Jenks said her family reported they had a hot meal Thursday morning and crew members were trying to clean up the ship as it neared port. Boredom and stress . At some point during the ordeal urine and feces streamed in the halls and down walls after toilet facilities failed, soaking the mattress of a friend of his who was sleeping in a hallway, said Larry Poret. Emergency power failures caused section doors to slam shut, panicking some passengers who had no idea what was happening. ""We definitely (were) not adequately informed,"" Poret said. Opinion: The dirty secrets below decks . Poret said toilets on the ship worked on and off, but were too inconsistent to trust. He said waste tipped out of some commodes and sloshed across floors as the ship listed to the side. ""It runs down the walls from one floor to the next. It's running out of somebody's bathroom out into the hallway all the way across,"" he said. Long lines for food and frequent delays were constantly aggravating, he said. ""Here we are looking for hope that, hey it's 6 o'clock, it's going to get better,"" he said. ""And 6 o'clock comes and goes and all of a sudden an announcement at 8, 'Hey, we're running behind schedule.' Well, no joke."" The incident aboard the ship scared Poret's daughter and a friend taking the cruise with her, Poret said. ""As soon as you get them calmed down, the electric goes out and doors start slamming shut,"" he said. During less stressful times, passengers passed the hours playing cards, walking the deck and going to see what was happening on other areas of the ship, Poret said. Passengers set up charging stations to help their fellow passengers juice up cell phones and other devices, he said. Aboard the cruise ship? Share your story with CNN iReport . The final trip home . Carnival promised an army of about 200 employees would take care of its passengers once they cleared customs. Passengers boarded buses to Galveston, where the cruise originated, or Houston, or went to spend the night in a hotel in New Orleans. Carnival said it had reserved about 100 motor coaches, more than 1,500 New Orleans hotel rooms, multiple charter flights from New Orleans to Houston on Friday and transportation from Houston to the Port of Galveston so that guests may retrieve their cars if they drove to the port. Carnival officials had initially planned to tow the ship to a Mexican port, but after Gulf currents pushed it farther north before tugboats could take control, and considering that 900 of the passengers do not have passports, the company decided to take the Carnival Triumph to Mobile instead, where it can be repaired. Compensation for travelers . The cruise line said it would give each passenger $500, a free flight home, a full refund for their trip and for most expenses on board, as well as a credit for another cruise. The Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation into the cause of the engine room fire. Because the Carnival Triumph is a Bahamian-flagged vessel, the Bahamas Maritime Authority is the primary investigative agency. Read related: Cruise safety drill results in 5 deaths . Travelers have few options for compensation in these cases, other than what the cruise line is already offering, according to travel expert Jason Clampet of Skift.com, a travel website. ""The passengers on the ship aren't going to have a great deal of recourse when they get home,"" he said. Travel ""insurance really doesn't cover this sort of thing. Their trip wasn't interrupted and they aren't incurring extra expenses ... so they can't be compensated that way."" Still, there's no denying that the fire and resulting bad PR will hurt Carnival. ""It's a terrible sight, thinking of people trapped on a ship with limited food and filthy conditions, so I think people will think twice about taking a cruise,"" Clampet said. Read related: What caused the Costa Cruises ship disaster? Bad luck before . The fire is at least the second problem for the ship since late January, when it had an issue with its propulsion system, according to a notice posted on the website of Carnival senior cruise director John Heald. It's also not the first fire to disable one of the cruise line's ships. In 2010, the Carnival cruise ship Splendor lost power after an engine room fire, leaving it drifting off the Pacific coast of Mexico. The USS Ronald Reagan ferried 60,000 pounds of supplies for the ship's passengers and crew as the ship was towed to San Diego. After this ill-fated cruise, the Carnival Triumph won't host vacationing passengers until at least mid-April. Carnival has canceled a dozen voyages scheduled between February 21 and April 13. That makes a total of 14 scratched trips. The cruise line already had eliminated voyages slated for February 11 and February 16. Read also: Eight icy getaways .

"(CNN) -- The winter of 1609 to 1610 was treacherous for early American settlers. Some 240 of the 300 colonists at Jamestown, in Virginia, died during this period, called the ""Starving Time,"" when they were under siege and had no way to get food. Desperate times led to desperate measures. New evidence suggests that includes eating the flesh of fellow colonists who had already died. Archaeologists revealed Wednesday their analysis of 17th century skeletal remains suggesting that settlers practiced cannibalism to survive. Researchers unearthed an incomplete human skull and tibia (shin bone) in 2012 that contain several features suggesting that this particular person had been cannibalized. The remains come from a 14-year-old girl of English origin, whom historians are calling ""Jane."" There are about half a dozen accounts that mention cannibalistic behaviors at that time, although the record is limited, said Douglas Owsley, division head of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian National Museum of National History. The newly analyzed remains support these accounts, providing the first forensic evidence of cannibalism in the American colonies. What we know from the bones . Jane's remains were found in a 17th-century trash deposit at the former site of James Fort. William Kelso, chief archaeologist at the Jamestown Rediscovery Project said at a briefing Wednesday that the fort was built in 1607, but has been washed away. Kelso and colleagues began digging in 1994 and have been excavating the site on Jamestown Island ever since. Owsley and colleagues can tell quite a bit about what happened to Jane when at least one starving settler in the fort apparently tried to feed off of her. If it's any consolation, it appears that she was already dead at the time. Researchers say it looks like someone had tried, but failed to open the skull with four shallow chops to the forehead. The back of the skull contains markings that could have been made by a small hatchet or cleaver striking it. The cranium cracked open from the last hit. Forensic experts say it appears the person striking the skull was right-handed. The skull's mandible contains cuts all over it and inside, which experts say reflect an attempt to take tissue off of the face and throat with a tool such as a knife. The cheek area reflects a ""sawing action"" of a tool going back and forth, Owsley said. There are also sharp passages of a knife. At some point in the process, the head was removed, Owsley said. The damage done to these remains indicates that whoever inflicted it was not a skilled butcher, he said. ""Instead, what we see is hesitancy, trial, tentativeness and an absolute total lack of experience."" The shin bone that archaeologists recovered also appeared to have been chopped, but in a way that more resembles classic butchering techniques, Owsley said. ""The person doing this was clearly interested in, based on what would have been accepted cuisine in the 17th century, in cheek meat, muscles of the face -- that area -- and tongue, and also in terms of 17th century traditional cuts, would also include the brain,"" he said. It is possible that more than one person was involved in this, given the disparity in butchering practices seen in the head compared to the shin bone. What we know about the colonists . In the summer of 1609, the settlers experienced two significant setbacks, said James Horn, vice president of research and historical interpretation at Colonial Williamsburg. The first was that a large fleet bringing supplies and settlers to Virginia was scattered. It had been carrying 500 settlers from Plymouth along with provisions. ""The fleet represented a new beginning for Jamestown, which had struggled over the previous two years,"" Horn said. A hurricane scattered the ships a week before they were supposed to arrive. The flagship with the leaders of this pack ended up in Bermuda. Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest"" takes its inspiration from this event. Six ships reached Jamestown in August 1609, with spoiled or depleted food, and many settlers in poor health. ""On one of those ships was Jane,"" Horn said. At the same time, the relationship between the Jamestown colonists and the native Powhatan Indians had broken down. The existing settlers were already experiencing disease and a shortage of food, and the demands they made on the Powhatans strained their relations. That was the environment into which 300 additional settlers arrived at the James Fort. One of the leaders of the group, Captain John Smith -- the same one who was famously friends with Pocahontas -- returned to England in October 1609 because he was injured, Owsley said, leaving a leadership vacuum. In the fall, the Powhatans waged war against these colonists, and launched a siege against the fort. With no way to get food from the outside, the colonists resorted to eating horses, dogs, cats, rats, mice and snakes, Horn said, according to the accounts of George Percy, who was the president of Jamestown during this time. There are even accounts of people eating their shoes and any other leather that could be found. Anyone who left to try to scrounge for roots in the woods was killed by the Powhatans. Percy wrote, according to the Smithsonian, ""thatt notheinge was Spared to mainteyne Lyfe and to doe those things which seame incredible, as to digge upp deade corpes outt of graves and to eate them. And some have Licked upp the Bloode which hathe fallen from their weake fellowes."" In other words, cannibalism. It's not clear how many deceased colonists were cannibalized. Only 60 of 300 of the original colonists survived, described as ""looking like skeletons,"" Horn said. In May of 1610, the settlers finally arrived who had been shipwrecked in Bermuda, effectively saving the colony. Lord Delaware brought even more colonists and enough provisions to last a year. There are still more pits at the fort to be excavated, and only 10% of Jane's body has been recovered, Owsley said. ""I think there's going to be other examples,"" Owsley said. ""Whether that will be found -- with archeology you never know what's going to be under the next shovel."" A special exhibition will begin at the Smithsonian about Jamestown and Jane's story on Friday.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Tensions were high Friday night around Lebanon, hours after a top Lebanese intelligence official known for his anti-Syrian stance and at least two others were killed in a massive explosion in normally peaceful neighborhood of Beirut. Gunfire erupted in the capital and enraged citizens blocked roads after the blast, which left Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan dead and heightened fears that Syria's civil war could boil over into neighboring Lebanon. In Sidon, people shouted, blocked city streets and burned tires in protest, according to CNN iReporter Ernesto Altamirano. The friction turned to violence in other spots, including clashes in the seaside Lebanese city of Tripoli between supporters and foes of Syria's government. Saad Hariri, a Lebanese opposition leader and former prime minister, told CNN that he had no doubt who was responsible for the bloody car bombing: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He accused the Syrian leader of ""killing his own people"" and said ""he will not think twice"" about killing Lebanese in order to protect himself. ""The message from Damascus today is anywhere you are, if you are against the regime from Lebanon, we will come and get you,"" said Hariri, who blames the 2005 assassination of his father, former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, on Syria's government. ""No matter what you try to do, we will keep on assassinating the Lebanese."" The blast took place during Friday afternoon rush hour in East Beirut's cosmopolitan Ashrafiyeh district, a predominantly Christian and populous area replete with shops, churches and office buildings. The neighborhood is considered among the safest in the city, said Aram Nerguizian, who teaches around the block from the attack site. The huge blast shattered this peace -- spurring panicked and tearful residents to pour out of their apartments, with some carrying victims to nearby ambulances. The bomb's impact created a crater near Sassine Square, tore balconies off apartments, left rows of mangled cars and charred buildings, and shook the windows in CNN's offices, about a 10-minute drive from the scene. Photos: Aftermath of Beirut blast . At least one car was engulfed in flames, blackened wreckage littered the street, and windows were blown out. The exact casualty count was unclear: Lebanon's National News Agency said eight people died and more than 90 were injured, but it later amended the figure to at least three deaths and 110 injuries. Reports said al-Hassan was among the dead. And a Lebanese political source who did not want to be named told CNN it was 99% confirmed that al-Hassan had been killed. ""There is an unrecognizable body found, and they have found his personal belongings at the scene,"" the source said. The intelligence official's killing brought a sense of deja vu to Lebanese, recalling the 2005 assassination of Rafik Hariri, which triggered the end of Syria's occupation of Lebanon, and the turmoil that followed. Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan a pivotal, 'polarizing' figure . Al-Hassan, the chief of the Internal Security Forces Information Branch, was a powerful Sunni Muslim figure aligned with a political movement that emerged after Rafik Hariri's assassination and opposes Syria's government under al-Assad. He was also leading an investigation into a Lebanese politician accused of working with two Syrian officials to plan attacks inside Lebanon. That former minister and member of parliament, Michel Samaha, is in jail awaiting trial after being accused of trying to arm and form an armed group to spread sectarian violence in Lebanon by plotting political and religious assassinations. Two Syrian security officers also have been charged in the case. ""Unfortunately, today, al-Hassan paid the price for his success,"" Saad Hariri said. His brother Ahmed Hariri, a top party official in the March 14 movement opposition bloc, said in a press conference that he holds Lebanon's government responsible for inadequate security and not doing more to prevent the blast. He urged Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati and his government to resign immediately. Mikati declared Saturday a day of national mourning in decrying the ""abominable crime"" in a statement. But his failure to appear publicly after the explosion elicited criticism, including from one protester in Beirut who said, ""This government is killing us by not doing anything. It is not acting like a government. It is like a ghost government."" Human rights groups, foreign governments and world leaders condemned the attack, demanded justice and called for calm in the volatile Middle East nation. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, for instance, urged ""all Lebanese parties not to be provoked by this heinous terrorist act and to maintain their commitment to national unity."" The Shiite militant and political movement Hezbollah -- which has a prominent role in Lebanon's government and which the U.S. government labels a terrorist organization -- also criticized the blast, which it described as a ""sinful attempt to target the stability and national unity."" Syria called the attack a cowardly, ""unjustifiable"" terrorist act. Yet some, including Saad Hariri and Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, are not convinced, believing Damascus is responsible either directly or indirectly for the bombing. Many Lebanese believe al-Assad wants to promote instability in Lebanon and elsewhere to turn attention away from the 19-month long civil war in his country. Lebanon is still recovering from its own 15-year civil war, which ended in 1990. Since then, the country has been plagued by assassinations and sectarian tension among Sunnis, Shiites, Christians and others. ""An event like this can increase the risks of Sunni-Shiite conflict in urban centers like Beirut,"" Nerguizian said. ""It could be a harbinger for more instability."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and Mohammed Jamjoom reported from Beirut. CNN's Joe Sterling reported from Atlanta. CNN's Greg Botelho, Saad Abedine, Amir Ahmed, Nada Husseini and Tracy Doueiry contributed to this report.","NEW: Prime Minister Mikati declares a day of mourning, but one man says action is needed .

"(CNN) -- A Carnival cruise ship was adrift 150 miles off the coast of Mexico after an engine room fire. Cruise passengers were complaining about the lack of air conditioning, hot cabins, cold food and toilets that wouldn't flush. As I watched the news broadcast, I thought it was a documentary about the Carnival Splendor, which suffered a disabling engine room fire in November 2010 off Mexico. But the story was about the Carnival Triumph, which caught fire early Sunday after sailing from Galveston, Texas, with more than 3,100 passengers. The cruise industry says cruise ship fires are rare, but they are not rare. They happen with alarming frequency. In the two years between the Splendor and the Triumph fires, more than 10 cruise ship fires were reported in the media. Several cruise ships were completely disabled, including the Costa Allegra, the Bahamas Celebration and the Ocean Star. The Azamara Quest was partially disabled and had to crawl back to port in Indonesia. The Allegra and Quest broke down in waters where pirates frequent, to add to the drama. A fire aboard the Queen Mary II was later determined to have been caused by a ""catastrophic explosion."" Other cruise ships experienced what the industry would either deny or call ""minor fires,"" including the Adventure of the Seas, the Crown Princess, the MSC Musica and the Allure. But there is nothing minor about a cruise ship, filled with thousands of passengers, catching on fire on the high seas, even for a matter of seconds. I have attended seven congressional hearings since 2005 regarding issues of cruise ship passenger safety. At the last hearing, before Sen. Jay Rockefeller, cruise expert and author Ross Klein said fires broke out in 79 cruise ships from 1990 to 2011. Most of these fires received little coverage in the U.S. press. It is a topic that the travel publications avoid and travel agents do not like to hear. Concordia disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates . The cruise industry does a remarkable job advertising that cruising is a safe and affordable family vacation. It certainly is affordable, in large part because major cruise lines such as Carnival and Royal Caribbean are incorporated in foreign countries like Panama, the Bahamas, Bermuda and Liberia. Their ships fly the flags of foreign nations and thus avoid all U.S. federal taxes, labor laws and safety regulations. In 2011, three-quarters of the nearly 16 million cruise bookings worldwide were made from the United States, according to the industry group Cruise Lines International Association, which represents 26 cruise lines, including the world's largest, Carnival and Royal Caribbean. You can't find a cheaper vacation than spending a week on one of these ""fun ships."" But the vacation comes with a hidden price. The cruise lines are working their crew members excessively long hours and paying them extremely low wages. The Cruise Lines International Association says its ""crew members are provided wages that are competitive with international pay scales."" But a cleaner aboard a Royal Caribbean ship, for example, will work 12 hours a day, seven days a week, for as little as $156.25 a week with no tips. U.S. labor laws are not applicable to provide protection to crew members at sea, nor is there any real oversight of the cruise lines' operations. The cruise industry insists that it is regulated and that the safety and security of its passengers and crew is its highest priority. Ships are subject to inspections by the countries they call on. In the United States, ships must pass initial and annual U.S. Coast Guard Marine inspections. But the Coast Guard is underfunded and understaffed and can't possibly conduct adequate inspections of the hundreds of cruise ships that call regularly on U.S. ports across the nation. And the ships are getting bigger and carrying more passengers every year. For example, Disney Fantasy -- whose safety is not in doubt -- is 14 decks high and more than three football fields long and can carry about 5,500 people. Cruise ships theoretically follow guidelines set forth by the International Maritime Organization and the recommendations in the Safety of Life at Sea. But the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations organization, does not have the authority to enforce its own guidelines, nor can it impose fines or criminal sanctions against cruise lines that flout Safety of Life at Sea recommendations. This obligation falls to flag states, like Panama. The result is that cruise lines are largely unregulated. They offer low-price cruise fares to get the passengers aboard and then make their profits from alcohol sales; casino, spa and photography activities; and shore excursions. The cruise lines operate their ships virtually 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. Cruise ships do not make money unless they are operating. The cruise lines push the ships just as hard as they push their crew members. A ship out of service for a week for routine maintenance means the loss of tens of millions of dollars and thousands of dissatisfied customers. Talk Back: How should cruise passengers be compensated? It is in this environment that the 13-year-old Carnival Triumph was trying to sail back to Galveston. Cruise ships, like their foreign-based crew members, are treated as fungible goods. When crew members get debilitating injuries because of overwork and exhaustion, they are left in their home countries. The Triumph, sailing since 1999, will eventually end up being sold to the European market, renamed and abandoned as well. The push to always keep the show on the road without long delays causes the same problems in investigations of passenger disappearances, shipboard crimes and gastrointestinal illnesses. These investigations are often rushed so the cruise is held up for as little time as possible. When there is a norovirus outbreak on a ship, cruise lines are faced with the prospect of disembarking hundreds of ill passengers, sanitizing the ship and then reloading several thousands of passengers on board. It is an impossible prospect to locate and kill the virus on the massive ships given the short turnaround on an embarkation day. But the business model of the cruise industry is: Strike up the band and hand out the daiquiris, the cruise must go on. It is also impossible for governmental entities such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct a thorough, painstaking epidemiology study to ascertain the type of virus and its origin. Cruise lines quickly blame the passengers for not washing their hands, but the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration concluded long ago that the most likely and common source of norovirus is contaminated food or water. Crew members say that infected workers often do not complain of their illness out of fear of not being paid or of losing their jobs. Cruise lines tell the passengers to use hand sanitizers, but the culprit may be norovirus-laden salad. Unlike the U.S. commercial aviation industry, with strict Federal Aviation Administration oversight that can ground a fleet of aircraft, the cruise industry is largely accountable to countries like Panama or the Bahamas -- which may or may not want to offend their cruise line friends in Miami. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Walker.","James Walker: Carnival Triumph was a rerun of Splendor, which also had engine room fire .

"(CNN) -- Health officials in Glasgow, Scotland, have confirmed a case of Ebola. ""The patient is a health care worker who was helping to combat the disease in West Africa"" and returned from Sierra Leone late Sunday night, the Scottish health agency NHS Scotland said. The patient flew via Casablanca, Morocco, and London Heathrow Airport, arriving at Glasgow Airport on a British Airways flight around 11:30 p.m., the statement said. ""The patient was admitted to hospital early in the morning after feeling unwell and was placed into isolation at 7.50 a.m. All possible contacts with the patient are now being investigated and anyone deemed to be at risk will be contacted and closely monitored. However, having been diagnosed in the very early stages of the illness, the risk to others is considered extremely low."" Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's head of government, led a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee ""to ensure all necessary steps are being taken,"" and she spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron, NHS Scotland said. Following established protocol, the patient ""will be transferred to the high-level isolation unit in the Royal Free hospital, London, as soon as possible. This is where the facilities, staff and systems are in place to ensure the best quality and safest care."" Access to the unit is restricted to specially trained medical staff. A specially designed tent, with controlled ventilation, will be set up over the patient's bed. ""Scotland has been preparing for this possibility from the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa and I am confident that we are well prepared,"" Sturgeon said in the statement. ""We have the robust procedures in place to identify cases rapidly. Our health service also has the expertise and facilities to ensure that confirmed Ebola cases such as this are contained and isolated effectively minimizing any potential spread of the disease."" She added, ""Scotland's NHS has proved it is well able to cope with infectious diseases in the past, such as swine flu, and I am confident we will be able to respond effectively again."" The patient was working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone, according to Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization.

"Islamabad (CNN) -- ""Terrorism and violence cannot be permissible in Islam,"" Tahir ul Qadri told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in 2010 after declaring a Fatwa on terrorism. The bold pronouncement thrust Qadri into headlines worldwide and led to an invitation to speak at the prestigious World Economic Forum and United States Institute for Peace. Two years on, the religious cleric has resurfaced in Pakistan, demanding free and fair elections, after spending the last six years living in Canada. Qadri has come a long way since his time as a parliamentarian during General Pervez Musharraf's regime in the early 2000s. After promoting his agenda from abroad -- speaking out in videos and books -- he is now back in the political spotlight in his home country, calling for a caretaker administration to take the government's place and carry out election reforms ahead of an upcoming vote. According to Qadri, the composition of the caretaker government should be decided with the input of the judiciary and the military. But in a country with a history of military coups, Qadri's mention of the army in the electoral process set off alarm bells with the current government and opposition who quickly reassured the Pakistani people that nothing would stand in the way of timely elections and the democratic process. Some Pakistanis have suggested Qadri is working on behalf of the military -- an allegation he denies. He maintains that he is working only to ensure a corruption-free electoral process. Qadri threatened that unless his election reform demands were met by Thursday, he would stage a ""Million Man March"" to the capital, paralyzing the city with thousands of supporters. ""We will not succumb to these illegal demands,"" Senator Rehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister told media Thursday, in anticipation of the protest, which is expected to arrive in Islamabad on Monday. Malik said he would not allow the rally to enter downtown Islamabad as it posed a security risk and would disrupt business operations in the city; he said the Pakistani government had cordoned off sensitive areas of Islamabad. ""The residents of Islamabad are scared that mobs will raid their houses and there will be violence and murder,"" Malik said. ""I will hold Qadri personally responsible if there is any violence or murders during this rally."" Malik announced last week that he had intercepted intelligence that the Pakistan Taliban was planning to attack the gathering on Monday. Despite criticism from the government, Qadri seems intent on marching to the capital, spending millions on prime time television advertising to urge others to join him. ""We are expecting one to two million people who will join the march"", Shahid Mursaleen, spokesman for Tahir ul Qadri, told CNN. ""We plan on removing the barricades put up by the government and we will remain in the city whether it is [for] two days or 30 days, until our demands are met,"" Mursaleen said. However, just two days before the planned march on Islamabad, the only political party supporting Qadri's march, the Mutahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), a coalition partner in the current government, pulled its support. Supporters maintain that Qadri is only trying to make a positive change in a country that is in need of help. They point to his welfare organization, called Minhaj ul Quran, which promotes ""true Islamic teachings."" According to its website, it has up to 280,000 members worldwide and works to build madrassahs around the country to teach young children the Quran. The ""Million Man March,"" which is expected to reach Islamabad on Monday, could be a game changer, analysts say, because it could have a major impact on the democratic process -- but whether the outcome of that would be positive or negative at this crucial time for Pakistani politics is still unclear.","Religious cleric Tahir ul Qadri to lead mass march to Islamabad .

"(CNN) -- Human remains have been found on the wrecked Costa Concordia, possibly answering what happened to the last two missing people from the cruise liner that struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in 2012, a spokesman for the head of Italy's civil protection agency said Thursday. Divers will try to recover the remains, which were found on deck 4, on Thursday afternoon, the spokesman said. The discovery comes a week after engineers finally righted the ship, which capsized when it hit rocks in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board. The toll of 32 includes the two people who were missing but presumed dead: Russel Rebello of India and Maria Grazia Trecarichi of Sicily. Their bodies were long believed to be either trapped beneath or inside the ship. Tragedy transforms island paradise . Rebello, 33, was a cruise waiter who was last seen helping passengers off the ship. Trecarichi was on the cruise to celebrate her 50th birthday with her 17-year-old daughter, who survived. Authorities say the ship struck the rocks off Giglio Island after the captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered the liner to veer more than four miles off course to salute a former sea captain who had retired on Giglio. How the ship was raised . Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. His trial, which began with preliminary hearings in March, resumed Monday in Grosseto. Schettino argues that he is a hero who saved the lives of more than 4,000 people, not a villain whose negligence led to the deaths of 32. His defense is trying to prove, among other things, that the ship's watertight doors did not function properly, and that is the reason the ship sank, leading to all 32 deaths during evacuation. Engineers rotated the ship back to vertical last week after it rested 20 months on its side. The unprecedented maneuver, called parbuckling, exposed a twisted mass of metal dotted with mattresses, passenger luggage and deck chairs on the ship's previously submerged starboard side. With the Costa Concordia now upright, judges on Wednesday agreed to Schettino's request for a new examination of the ship. He also wants to walk the judges through the command bridge in a re-creation of the night of the crash. Inside a wrecked cruise ship . Schettino also has told the court that the ship would not have crashed had his helmsman executed his instructions. According to recordings from the ship's bridge from the vessel's black box, Schettino directed the helmsman to turn ""hard to starboard"" in English, but the helmsman can be heard asking ""hard to port?"" The helmsman then turned the ship right instead of left just 13 seconds before it hit the rocks. A maritime expert has testified that those 13 seconds made no difference, saying it takes longer than that to change a ship's course. But Schettino told the court that if the helmsman ""had not turned the wheel the wrong way, we would have avoided hitting the rocks."" The trial is expected to last through the fall with a string of witnesses, including passengers, crew members and islanders, who say they saw the captain on shore looking for dry socks before all the passengers had been safely evacuated. The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, and four others were convicted in a plea deal in July for their role in the disaster. A Florence court is considering the validity of those plea bargain agreements.

"(CNN) -- A testy exchange erupted on Thursday between Sen. John McCain and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey during the latter's testimony about September's deadly attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. ""Gen. Dempsey, I was just going over your written statement and I have to admit it's one of the more bizarre statements that I have ever seen in my years in this committee,"" McCain said, referring to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Thursday's testimony is the latest in a string of accounts to congressional committees about the attacks, which occurred September 11 and resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. ""When you're talking about the Benghazi issue, you say, 'We positioned our forces in a way that was informed by and consistent with available threat estimates,'"" McCain continued. ""Then you go on to say, 'Our military was appropriately responsive,' even though seven hours passed and two Americans died at the end of that. Then you go on and say, 'We did what our posture and capabilities allowed.'"" McCain said a base in Crete was just 90 minutes away. ""We could have placed forces there,"" he said. ""We could have had aircraft and other capabilities a short distance away at Souda Bay, Crete. So, for you to testify before this committee that they were consistent with available threat estimates is simply false; that our military was appropriately responsive."" ""I stand by my testimony, your dispute of it notwithstanding,"" Dempsey replied. McCain countered, ""Well, perhaps you can give me some facts that would substantiate it."" Dempsey then said that a contingent was not sent because the State Department didn't request one. ""So it's the State Department's fault,"" McCain challenged. ""I'm not blaming the State Department,"" Dempsey responded. ""I'm sure they had their own assessment."" Dempsey said he stood by the conclusion of an independent review board, which concluded the ""interagency response was timely and appropriate, but there simply was not enough time, given the speed of the attacks, for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference."" The board has made 29 recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the State Department. Later in his testimony, Dempsey told Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, that the bases in the Mediterranean have aircraft, which ""wasn't the right tool for the particular threat we faced."" Dempsey noted that, at the time, he was also concerned with other potential flashpoints -- Sanaa, Yemen; Khartoum, Sudan; Islamabad and Peshawar, Pakistan; Kabul, Afghanistan; and Baghdad, Iraq. ""We had some pretty significant intel threat streams against those places as well,"" he said. But McCain said he had seen the threat estimates ""and none of them rose to the level of the threat in Benghazi ... that they could not withstand a sustained attack."" In response to a question from Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he was aware of a cable sent in August by Ambassador Stevens that said security in Benghazi was not adequate. ""Unfortunately, there was no specific intelligence or indications of an imminent attack on that -- U.S. facilities in Benghazi,"" Panetta said. ""And frankly without an adequate warning, there was not enough time given the speed of the attack for armed military assets to respond."" He also noted that the National Counterterrorism Center had identified some 281 threats to U.S. diplomats, diplomatic facilities, embassies, ambassadors and consulates during the six months before the attack in Benghazi. ""And to deal with that, I mean, that's not our responsibility,"" he said. ""That's the State Department's responsibility."" Panetta said that U.S. officials learned in the months after the incident that ""there were actually two short-duration attacks that occurred some six hours apart,"" the first on the consulate and the second on an annex two miles away. ""The bottom line is this: That we were not dealing with a prolonged or continuous assault, which could have been brought to an end by a U.S. military response, very simply, although we had forces deployed to the region,"" he said. Dempsey said he could not have gotten troops on the ground within 13 to 15 hours. Panetta was firm throughout his testimony that there were no ""undue delays"" in decision making and there was no denial of support from Washington or from the military combatant commanders when the attack happened. ""Quite the contrary: The safe evacuation of all U.S. government personnel from Benghazi 12 hours after the initial attack"" and transfer to the Ramstein Air Base in Germany ""was the result of exceptional U.S. government coordination."" He said the U.S. military response helped save lives. Obama's talk with Panetta . In the months since the attacks, Washington has been a center of debate about how much the State Department had known about threats in the region and whether, after the attacks, the administration tried to mislead the public about its nature. An independent review released in December lambasted the State Department, saying ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" led to inadequate security at the Benghazi post. In his remarks, Panetta said the initial reports of the attack were given ""almost immediately"" to the U.S. Embassy in the Libyan capital of Tripoli. Within 17 minutes, Panetta said, an unarmed, unmanned surveillance aircraft was dispatched to give U.S. officials a better idea of what was happening. It arrived at the site about 70 minutes after the attack, he said. Soon, Panetta and Dempsey met with President Barack Obama, the secretary told lawmakers. Obama ordered that the Defense Department respond to the attack with ""all available DOD assets"" and try to protect U.S. personnel, Panetta said. Ayotte and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina asked how many times Obama spoke with Panetta and Dempsey after learning about the attack. Once, in a half-hour conversation with the president, the men said; Obama did not personally get back in touch with them to ask how the mission to help personnel in Benghazi was going. ""Do you think it's a typical response of the president of the United States to make one phone call, do what you can and never call you back again and ask you, 'How is it going, by the way?'"" Graham asked. Panetta replied, ""The president is well-informed about what is going on, make no mistake about it."" ""Was any airplane launched in the world before the attack was concluded?"" Graham asked. ""If you're talking about a strike aircraft, no, senator,"" Dempsey said. ""Did anybody leave any base anywhere to go to the aid of the people under attack in Benghazi, Libya, before the attack ended?"" Graham asked. ""No,"" Panetta responded. ""Because the attack ended."" Orders without action . But orders to prepare had been given, the defense secretary testified. Panetta said a Marine security team platoon stationed in Spain was ordered to prepare for deployment while another platoon prepped to head to the embassy in Tripoli. A Special Operations force, then training in Central Europe, was told to prepare to deploy to a staging base in Southern Europe, and another Special Ops force, based in the United States, was told to prepare to move there, too. ""Some have asked why other types of armed aircraft were not dispatched to Benghazi,"" he said. Armed drones, AC-130 gunships or fixed-wing fighters with the associated tanking, armaments, targeting and support capabilities were not near Libya, and it would have taken at least nine hours to deploy, he said. ""This was, pure and simple, in the absence, as I said -- of any kind of advance warning -- a problem of distance and time,"" Panetta said. The quickest response option available was a Tripoli-based security team, he said. Within hours, Panetta said, that six-person team, including two U.S. military personnel, chartered a plane and flew to Benghazi. Within 15 minutes of arriving at the annex facility, they came under attack by mortar and rocket-propelled grenades, he said. Members of the team and others at the annex facility provided emergency medical assistance and supported the evacuation of all personnel. All remaining U.S. government employees were evacuated from Benghazi, Panetta said. Beefing up security . There will ""always be tension"" between how much security is adequate and how much would create a ""bunker-like mentality"" at global posts, Panetta said. The answer is not to assign the military to run a ""fire house"" next to every U.S. diplomatic location. Panetta noted that Congress, too, plays a role in the security of the nation's diplomatic missions, and that the Department of Defense faces the prospect of sequestration -- which would result in billions of dollars of cutbacks to the Defense budget -- on March 1. ""If Congress fails to act, sequestration is triggered,"" he said. Panetta also said there must be some reliance on host countries to help with security. The attack in Benghazi ""raises concerns"" about whether that's always possible. Libya's government has been on shaky ground since Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was ousted in 2011. The defense secretary's testimony comes a few weeks after Clinton told lawmakers that the State Department was moving fast to beef up security at U.S. posts worldwide. During her testimony, Clinton teared up as she recounted meeting the arrival of the caskets containing the bodies of Stevens and former Navy SEAL commandos Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both of whom had been working as diplomatic security officers. Sean Smith, the fourth American killed, was an information management officer. Panetta said an FBI team that includes CIA and DOD members ""has made very good progress"" in identifying the attackers.","Aircraft ""wasn't the right tool,"" Dempsey says .

"(CNN) -- Chinese state media is proclaiming the Xinjiang bomb blast ""case closed"" after authorities claimed to have identified the suspected assailants. Two ""religious extremists"" have been pinpointed as the alleged assailants behind the bombing and knife attacks that took place at Urumqi South Railway Station on Wednesday, reports Xinhua, China's state news agency. Both suspects were killed in the incident. One of them has been identified as Sedirdin Sawut, a 39-year-old man from Aksu in southern Xinjiang. Xinhua, quoting police, also said ""knife-wielding mobs"" attacked people at one of the station's exits following the blast. One innocent bystander was also killed in the blast and 79 were injured. Xinhua says some of the injured victims have been released from hospital. Police evacuated people from the square in front of the station, deployed armed officers and cordoned off entrances to the station, where train services had been suspended. The station reopened about two hours later with passengers re-entering under a heavily-armed police presence. The attacks took place on Wednesday evening, coinciding with the end of a four-day tour of the Xinjiang region by Chinese President Xi Jinping. After the blast, President Xi urged ""decisive actions"" against violent terrorist attacks. The fight against separatist violence in the autonomous region in the northwest of the country was a focus of the Chinese leader's visit. Frequent outbreaks of violence have beset the resource-rich region, where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the past few decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. In March a violent terror attack took place at a train station Kunming in Yunnan province when ten men armed with knives killed 29 commuters.","Chinese media blame two religious extremists for Xinjiang blast and stabbings .

"(CNN) -- In multiple 911 calls shortly before he was killed, a man said he was being chased by an enraged motorist -- right up to when he was apparently run off the road in Pennsylvania and then shot to death, police said Friday. Timothy Davison, 28, was driving home to Maine along Interstate 81 early last Saturday when he was shot multiple times and killed in Antrim Township. So far, there is no indication that Davison initiated the incident or provoked the shooter, Pennsylvania State Police Capt. Steven Junkin told reporters Friday. Davison may have first encountered the shooter on Interstate 70 in Maryland and traveled between 13 and 15 miles, with the gunman in pursuit, before being forced off the road just beyond the Pennsylvania state line, authorities said. Junkin said Davison called 911 from Maryland and Pennsylvania, but he declined to provide details. Authorities have not released the contents of those 911 calls, citing the ongoing investigation. A task force made up of Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia state police, as well as FBI agents, is seeking help from the public and operators of body shops in finding a ""dark colored"" Ford Ranger XLT pickup with damage on the driver's side from ramming into Davison's car. ""How concerned are we that it'll happen again?"" Junkin asked. ""We obviously have an individual out there who was so incensed that he continued to pursue Mr. Davison and took it to that next step. He murdered an individual for whatever slight that he perceived. Will this person do it again? We don't know. We don't want to take that chance."" The Maine resident ended up shot multiple times, a death that authorities have ruled a homicide. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 800-472-8477. Investigators initially believed the same motorist may have been behind another road rage shooting eight hours earlier and 56 miles northeast, but Junkin said Friday that the two crimes do not appear to be related. James Allocca, Davison's uncle, told CNN this week that the family ""wants justice before someone else gets hurt."" The victim's father, Timothy Davison Sr., said he learned about his son's death when police arrived at his door Saturday. ""I can't begin to tell you what it's like to hear that,"" he said. ""It's not right."" He went to Pennsylvania on Tuesday to collect his son's personal belongings. His son, he said, was a ""great guy and a very easy kid to raise."" ""He cared for everyone around him,"" he said. ""He was a rugged kid, extremely sensitive."" Davison worked at his father's construction business. He said he hoped to meet his son's killer. Asked what he would say, Davison said: ""That is for me."" ""There are different levels of loss,"" Allocca said. ""This has to be the worst."" Motorcyclist charged in beating of SUV driver .

"Washington (CNN) -- Indiana Gov. Mike Pence met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, as part of a nine-day trip to the nation that's sure to set tongues wagging about his plans for the 2016 presidential race. Netanyahu's Twitter account sent out a quick clip of the two during their meeting Monday in which Pence expressed support for Israel, and said he believes ""the strong and broad and bipartisan support for the state of Israel...will be reflected in the decisions our United States Congress makes in the months ahead."" The meeting was part of a busy day in Israel for Pence, which included stops at a Holocaust memorial and a meeting with the Israeli minister of economy. It's the first of three days he'll spend on an ""economic development mission to bring jobs and investment to Indiana,"" his office said â€”Â and part of a broader nine-day trip that's included a visit to the Western Wall and time spent with Israeli troops. Pence's office said Pence and his wife's expenses during the cultural visits are being paid for by Christians United for Israel, and the economic development portion of the trip is being covered by the Indiana Economic Development Foundation. The state is paying for his security detail. It's the governor's fifth ""international job-hunting mission"" as governor, according to his office, and while the trip was ostensibly organized around an economic development agenda, it's also a signal he's contemplating a presidential run. Strong support for Israel will be a litmus test for any GOP presidential contenders hoping to compete in the primary, and a trip to the nation has become a traditional pilgrimage for potential candidates looking to burnish their foreign policy credentials. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, another Republican who has left the door open to 2016, visited Israel this weekend, physician Ben Carson was there last week and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also contemplating a run, is planning another trip there in February.","Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with Indiana Gov. Mike Pence on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Attempts to purge Muslims from parts of the war-torn Central African Republic have prompted ""a Muslim exodus of historic proportions,"" rights group Amnesty International warned Wednesday. International peacekeepers have ""failed to prevent the ethnic cleansing of Muslim civilians in the western part of the Central African Republic,"" the group said. Another rights group, Human Rights Watch, also warned Wednesday that the country's minority Muslim population is ""being targeted in a relentless wave of coordinated violence that is forcing entire communities to leave the country."" The Central African Republic, a former French colony, was plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels dubbed Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. They have since been forced out of power, but Christian militias, known as the anti-balaka, which translates as ""anti-machete,"" have been allowed to fill the power vacuum, Amnesty International said, with dire consequences for Muslim civilians. ""Anti-balaka militias are carrying out violent attacks in an effort to ethnically cleanse Muslims in the Central African Republic,"" said Joanne Mariner, senior crisis response adviser at Amnesty International. ""The result is a Muslim exodus of historic proportions."" The Amnesty International report said international peacekeepers in the country must do more to protect Muslim communities and rein in the anti-balaka militias. There are about 1,600 French troops on the ground, alongside about 6,000 soldiers from an African Union-led peacekeeping force, known as MISCA. Forcible expulsion . The rights group also said the backlash against Muslim civilians was foreseeable -- and should have been prevented. ""In power for nearly 10 months, the Seleka were responsible for massacres, extrajudicial executions, rape, torture, and looting, as well as massive burning and destruction of Christian villages,"" it said. ""As the Seleka withdrew, the international forces allowed the anti-balaka militias to take control of town after town. The resulting violence and forcible expulsion of Muslim communities were predictable."" For its report, Amnesty International interviewed more than 100 people who witnessed attacks against Muslims firsthand. The worst violence documented was in the northern town of Bossemptele, where at least 100 Muslims were killed in January, it said. Among the dead were women and old men, including an imam in his mid-70s. Other northwestern towns where Muslims communities have been attacked include Bouali, Boyali and Baoro, it said. The spiraling ethnic violence in the Central African Republic has led some observers to fear another genocide like that seen in Rwanda nearly 20 years ago. Antonio Guterres, head of the U.N. refugee agency, said he has ""witnessed in the Central African Republic a humanitarian catastrophe of unspeakable proportions. Massive ethno-religious cleansing is continuing."" He cited ""indiscriminate killings and massacres"" and ""shocking barbarity, brutality and inhumanity."" He said he's ""deeply distressed that nearly half a million Central Africans have been newly displaced since December alone. In all, 2.5 millions are in desperate need."" He said the country is ""falling through the cracks of international attention"" and that can't be permitted. ""Tens of thousands of people are fleeing the country for their safety, many are trapped with nowhere to go. In Bangui alone, thousands of people are in ghettos in grave conditions,"" he said in a statement. He said the international community must act by deploying forces on the ground. ""It is imperative to re-establish security, law and order. For the people of the Central African Republic, safety and security for all is the most urgent priority,"" Guterres said. ""Acting in concert, particularly with the support of religious leaders, all actors must enhance mediation and pave the way for the restoration of peace and sustainable reconciliation."" Human Rights Watch highlighted the language used by the anti-balaka militias -- which, it said, ""suggests their intent is to eliminate Muslim residents from the Central African Republic."" ""At this rate, if the targeted violence continues, there will be no Muslims left in much of the Central African Republic,"" said Peter Bouckaert, emergencies director at Human Rights Watch. ""People whose families have peacefully lived in the country for centuries are being forced to leave, or are fleeing the very real threat of violence against them."" Human Rights Watch cites the example of a gold trading center, Yaloke, which had an estimated Muslim population of 30,000 and eight mosques before the conflict. When the group visited the town last week, fewer than 500 Muslims and one mosque remained, it said. Fled into exile . The medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, last week also warned of ""extreme and unprecedented levels"" of violence against civilians as Muslim and Christian militia groups clash. ""Although the conflict is complex and all communities are affected by the violence, the minority Muslim community is increasingly targeted,"" the group said in a statement. ""In many towns, Muslim groups are isolated and threatened by anti-balaka forces while tens of thousands of Muslims have already left the country into exile in Chad or Cameroon."" The African Union also raised concerns over violence toward Muslim civilians and Chadian nationals. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Fatou Bensouda, said Friday that she was opening a new investigation into serious abuse allegations. ""In many incidents, victims appear to have been deliberately targeted on religious grounds,"" she said . Support for peacekeepers . A jointly penned column by Presidents Barack Obama and Francois Hollande, published Monday in The Washington Post, said the two nations were working together to confront the crisis, as the French leader pays a state visit to Washington. ""In the Central African Republic, French and African Union soldiers -- backed by American airlift and support -- are working to stem violence and create space for dialogue, reconciliation and swift progress to transitional elections,"" it said. The U.N. Security Council voted last month to continue its peacekeeping mission in the country and to authorize the use of force by European Union troops there. The decision came after the nation tapped Catherine Samba-Panza, mayor of the capital of Bangui, as its interim president. She replaced Michel Djotodia, the leader of the Seleka rebels who seized power in March only to step down in January after failing to halt the escalating violence. Last year's coup was the latest in a series since the country gained independence in 1960. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","NEW: Head of U.N. refugee agency 'deeply distressed'

"(CNN) -- CNN Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos recently highlighted a fact that few in the United States are even aware of: Tens of thousands of Americans who hold U.S. passports are denied legal recognition as U.S. citizens. The reason? They happen to be born in the U.S. territory of American Samoa instead of somewhere else in the United States. Cevallos gets the basic unfairness of it all right: ""The United States laid claim to these eastern islands of a South Pacific archipelago in 1900, and since that time, American Samoans have served in the U.S. military, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan."" But his conclusion that ""citizenship for them is not a constitutional right"" because ""only Congress can choose to grant citizenship to territorial inhabitants"" rests on an assumption that has no basis in the Constitution or any decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. It is easy to see where this assumption comes from. After the United States acquired Puerto Rico and other territories in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, the Supreme Court decided a series of deeply divided and controversial cases known as the Insular Cases. While none of these cases addressed constitutional issues relating to citizenship, Justice Henry Billings Brown wrote an opinion in Downes v. Bidwell that suggested, in passing, that citizenship was not a fundamental right in these newly acquired areas, which were populated by what he called ""alien races."" Although his opinion was not joined by a single other justice, it was good enough for those in Congress who thought birthright citizenship was not such a great idea for the inhabitants of these areas, who did not look like or speak like them. The assumption that Congress controls citizenship in overseas territories has survived since, but not without disagreement in the lower courts. Leneuoti Tuaua, the Samoan Federation of America, and several others born in American Samoa are challenging this faulty assumption in a federal lawsuit  pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. They argue that so long as American Samoa is under the U.S. flag, with American Samoa's sons and daughters fighting and dying to defend that flag, the U.S. Constitution guarantees them birthright citizenship, regardless of what Congress has said. What does the Constitution itself say? The Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment -- part of the Constitution since 1868 -- states that ""All persons born ... in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States."" The great Chief Justice John Marshall explained decades earlier that the Constitution used the phrase ""the United States"" as ""the name given to our great republic, which is composed of states and territories."" It is no surprise then that those who drafted the Citizenship Clause understood its guarantees to extend to U.S. territories, explaining that ""the first section (of the 14th Amendment) refers to persons everywhere, whether in the states or in the territories or in the District of Columbia."" Just four years after the Citizenship Clause was ratified, the Supreme Court stated that the clause ""put to rest"" the notion that ""those ... who had been born and resided always in the District of Columbia or in the territories, though within the United States, were not citizens."" This original understanding makes sense. The 14th Amendment was intended to overturn the Supreme Court's infamous Dred Scott decision and put the question of citizenship by birth on all U.S. soil beyond Congress' power to deny. In 1868, nearly half of all land in the United States was in a U.S. territory. An amendment that failed to guarantee citizenship in U.S. territories would not have been much of an amendment at all. Birthright citizenship remains a hotly debated topic. But there is a remarkable cross-ideological consensus among legal scholars about what exactly the Constitution guarantees when it comes to birthright citizenship. Former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, who represented President Bush in Bush v. Gore, and Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe, a renowned liberal scholar, argued in a 2008 joint memo that Sen. John McCain was eligible to run for president based solely on his place of birth: the Panama Canal Zone, a former U.S. territory. Olson and Tribe explained that ""birth on soil that is under the sovereignty of the United States, but not within a state"" satisfies the requirement for being a "" 'natural born' citizen,"" in light of ""the well-established principle that 'natural born' citizenship includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the United States."" President Clinton's Solicitor General Walter Dellinger and former Texas Solicitor General James Ho have echoed similar views on the geographic scope of birthright citizenship. What the Insular Cases mean for U.S. territories today also remains hotly debated. On Wednesday the Harvard Law School is holding a conference titled ""Reconsidering the Insular Cases,"" with federal Circuit Judge Juan Torruella delivering the keynote address ""The Insular Cases: A Declaration of Their Bankruptcy."" Torruella has long compared the Insular Cases to Plessy v. Ferguson, criticizing the Insular Cases as establishing a race-based doctrine of ""separate and unequal"" status for residents of overseas U.S. territories. In 2008, the Supreme Court also expressed skepticism of the idea that Congress has the power to deny constitutional rights in current U.S. territories, stating that ""it may well be that over time the ties between the United States and any of its unincorporated territories strengthen in ways that are of constitutional significance."" The court went on to explain that ""the Constitution grants Congress and the president the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply."" Although the Constitution grants Congress broad powers in U.S. territories, one that it clearly withholds is the power to rewrite the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship. Denying citizenship in American Samoa is not just unfair, it's unconstitutional. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Neil Weare.","Neil Weare: There's a compelling legal case for citizenship for American Samoa residents .

"(CNN) -- A Tunisian opposition leader was fatally shot outside his home Thursday, setting off protests in a nation still raw from the February assassination of a different politician who opposed the Islamist-led governing party. The slaying of Mohammed Al-Brahmi and the public's reaction are the latest bout of turmoil striking the North African country that had been seen as a poster child of stability after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Al-Brahmi, a member of Parliament and leader of the liberal Popular Movement, was shot as he tried to drive away from his home in Ariana, near the Tunisian capital of Tunis, the state-run news agency TAP reported. Afterward, thousands of people protested the killing outside the Interior Ministry in Tunis on Thursday, according to Tunisian state TV. Presidential spokesman Adnene Mansar called the incident a ""heinous crime"" and urged Tunisians not to fall into a ""trap of discord."" ""The crime, whose perpetrators decided to commit it on Republic Day, came as the outlines of the transition phase start to emerge and as the establishment of Independent High Authority for Elections (ISIE) is nearing (an) end,"" Mansar said in a statement distributed by the state-run news agency TAP. ""Apart from the thugs they have used this time to carry out their new crime, the hidden forces of corruption remain a threat to the country's future,"" Mansar's statement said. ""The blow we can bring to these forces and their plans is to remain united against all those who dare to undermine the stability and security of the country."" Thursday's protest may be just the beginning. A labor union called for a general strike for Friday, TAP reported. ""(Al-Brahmi's death) is likely to reactivate the mass protests and strikes across multiple sectors,"" Anna Boyd, a senior Middle East analyst at IHS Country Risk, said in an e-mailed statement Thursday before news of the day's protests came. Al-Brahmi is the second leftist opposition figure to be killed in Tunisia since February 6, when gunmen killed Chokri Belaid outside his home. Belaid helped lead Tunisia's Popular Front, a coalition of a leftist political parties. Al-Brahmi's movement recently joined with that group. Both politicians opposed the Islamist-led Nahda party, which swept into power following the revolution that toppled longtime President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. Belaid's assassination -- the first time since Tunisia's 1956 independence that a politician had been a target inside the country -- roiled the nation, setting off massive protests and leading to the resignation of the prime minister. Al-Brahmi's body was found with at least 11 gunshot wounds, the Interior Ministry told CNN Arabic. Witnesses said that two people on a motorcycle shot Al-Brahmi before fleeing, TAP reported. A U.N. statement from a spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called both Al-Brahmi and Belaid's assassinations ""acts of political violence (that) weaken legitimate state institutions."" Al-Brahmi's death ""must not be allowed to derail the progress that Tunisia continues to make in its democratic transition, including on the Constitution, and in meeting the social and economic aspirations of the Tunisian people,"" said the U.N. statement. CNN's Caroline Faraj, Laura Smith-Spark, Ammar Benaziz, Schams Elwazer, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Greg Botelho and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","NEW: U.N. says ""this heinous must not ... derail the progress"" toward democracy in Tunisia .

"(CNN) -- Attorneys general in 17 states have banded together to call on Craigslist, the online classified ad website, to discontinue its adult services section. ""The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it,"" the attorneys general said in a Tuesday letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and founder Craig Newmark. The letter continued: ""We recognize that Craigslist may lose the considerable revenue generated by the Adult Services ads. No amount of money, however, can justify the scourge of illegal prostitution, and the suffering of the women and children who will continue to be victimized, in the market and trafficking provided by Craigslist."" A Craigslist spokeswoman said Wednesday that the site agreed with at least some of the letter. ""We strongly support the attorneys general desire to end trafficking in children and women, through the Internet or by any other means,"" Susan MacTavish Best, who handles media inquiries for Craigslist, told CNN Wednesday. ""We hope to work closely with them, as we are with experts at nonprofits and in law enforcement, to prevent misuse of our site in facilitation of trafficking, and to combat such crimes wherever they appear, online or offline."" In their letter, the attorneys general highlighted an open letter, which appeared as a Washington Post ad, in which two girls said they were sold for sex on Craigslist. When the ad came out, Buckmaster wrote a blog post in response that said, ""Craigslist is anxious to know that the perpetrators in these girls' cases are behind bars."" The letter also highlighted a report in May by CNN's Amber Lyon, who posted a fake ad in the adult section. She received 15 calls soliciting sex in three hours. Earlier this month, Lyon interviewed a woman named ""Jessica"" who sells sex on Craigslist. She told Lyon a Craigslist ad was ""the fastest, quickest way you're for sure going to see somebody that day."" In a later blog, Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009. ""Since that time, before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney."" He said the attorneys are trained to enforce Craigslist's posting guidelines, ""which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages, newspapers, or any other company that we are aware of."" Attorneys general from Arkansas, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia made the request a week after accused ""Craigslist killer"" Philip Markoff committed suicide in jail. Markoff was charged with the April 2009 killing of Julissa Brisman. Boston Police said that Brisman, a model, advertised as a masseuse on Craigslist, and Markoff might have met her through the website. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's ""adult services"" section, which replaced ""erotic services ads"" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Many offered thinly veiled ""services"" for anything from $50 for a half hour to $400 an hour. Newmark has defended his site, saying it is doing more than any other site that hosts adult ads to help filter out underage prostitutes and report them to police. Best, the Craigslist spokeswoman, said that fewer than one ad in 10,000 meets the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines for anti-trafficking action. ""Only Craigslist has the power to stop these ads before they are even published, and sadly they are completely unwilling to do so,"" Kansas Attorney General Steve Six said in a statement.","Attorneys general urge Craigslist to drop adult services ads .

"(CNN) -- The disease that carves an insidious path through the brain seems to be doing the same through sports. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the degenerative brain disease associated with concussions, has been identified in both a soccer and a rugby player, according to a review in the journal Acta Neuropathologica. The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau -- a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear. CTE can be diagnosed only after death. According to Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist who has examined dozens of brains found to have CTE, the brain of the soccer player -- Patrick Grange -- displayed diffuse disease. ""There was very severe degeneration of the frontal lobes with widespread tau pathology in the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes,"" McKee, director of neuropathology at the Bedford VA Medical Center, said in an e-mail. ""He is one of the youngest players to have shown this much disease."" Former NFLer: 'Your mind just goes crazy' Grange played with the Chicago Fire Reserve MLS team and the Albuquerque Asylum semi-pro team, according to his obituary. He died in 2012 at 29 after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a rare, incurable neurodegenerative disease. About 13% of the 103 CTE cases uncovered by McKee and colleagues also showed evidence of progressive motor neuron disease. ""(Grange) had no known genetic predisposition for ALS,"" said McKee, professor of neurology and pathology at the Boston University School of Medicine. ""And no family members have been diagnosed with ALS."" An autopsy showed that Grange had Stage 2 CTE with motor neuron disease, according to a statement from Boston University. His case is interesting because it raises questions about the relationship between heading the ball and CTE. ""The fact that Patrick Grange was a prolific header is important,"" Chris Nowinski, co-founder and executive director of the Sports Legacy Institute, said in an e-mail. ""We need a larger discussion around at what age we introduce headers, and how we set limits to exposure once it is introduced."" Heading would seem to be innocuous compared with the brutal hits that can be dealt in a football or hockey game, but the damage, according to studies, can add up. Headers in soccer are associated with microstructural damage to brain tissue and memory problems; and an Italian study linked them with ALS. Similarly, researchers found Australian rugby union player Barry ""Tizza"" Taylor died in 2013 of complications of severe CTE with dementia at age 77. Taylor played for 19 years in amateur and senior leagues before becoming a coach, according to Boston University. ""Cognitive problems, memory loss, attention difficulties and executive dysfunction were first noted in his mid-50s, followed by depression and anxiety, worsening explosivity and impulsivity,"" the statement said. By his mid-60s, the statement said, Taylor was ""physically and verbally abusive"" and ""paranoid."" Tony Dorsett: 'I'm going to beat this' CTE is most commonly associated with football and boxing, but the disease has been found in the brain tissue of hockey players, wrestlers and, recently, in a Major League Baseball player. With the most recent findings, it would seem that virtually no sport is immune.","A new study identifies CTE in soccer and rugby players .

"(CNN) -- It was one of those oh-by-the-way moments -- an afterthought really. It wasn't supposed to be a coming out party. Sure, the subject matter was serious, but in the end the mood was lighthearted. Lawmakers gathered in the Pennsylvania state capital in Harrisburg on Tuesday to propose a major change in the state's hate crime law to extend protection to those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Lawmakers made their pitch for getting the legislation to the governor's desk by the end of the year. Then bill sponsor, Sen. Jim Ferlo of Pittsburgh, made his surprise announcement -- very casually. ""Hundreds of people know I'm gay. I just never made an official declaration,"" he said. ""I never felt I had to wear a billboard on my forehead. But I'm gay. Get over it. I love it. It's a great life."" The announcement capped a momentous day for the LGBT community. Earlier, charges were filed against three people in the recent beating of a gay couple in Philadelphia. All are charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and criminal conspiracy, CNN affiliate WPVI reported. They could not be charged with a hate crime for the same reason lawmakers held their news conference -- people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender are not covered under Pennsylvania's hate crime law. Kevin J. Harrigan, 26, Kathryn G. Knott, 24, and Phillip Williams, 24, surrendered to police on Wednesday, according to WPVI. Later, Ferlo, who will be leaving the state Senate in November, said his remarks weren't planned. ""It was totally impromptu. I've never denied it.

"(CNN) -- Visitors be warned: Security around the White House about to intensify. In the wake of last week's unprecedented security breach, the Secret Service is planning to increase surveillance around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has ordered a full review of Friday's incident. Omar Gonzalez, an Iraq war veteran, is accused of carrying a small knife, scaling the White House fence, sprinting roughly 70 yards across the North Lawn and making it pass the North Portico doors, which were not locked. Investigators said they later found more than 800 rounds of ammunition, plus two hatchets and a machete, in his car. Here's a look at four possible measures the Secret Service could implement to increase the security around what's supposed to be the most fortified residence in the country: . 1. Increase the number of agents patrolling the grounds . The uniformed division of the Secret Service -- the part of the agency responsible for patrolling the premises -- is immediately visible walking past the White House. They're on the lawn, they're on the roof, and most notably, they're carrying some very intimidating rifles. White House security was increased immediately after Friday's breach, but permanently adding more guards on the lawn and around the entrances would help prevent jumpers and make it easier to catch anyone who successfully jumps in the future. A federal law enforcement official tells CNN's Jim Acosta that this is a step the service plans to take, with officers patrolling the area in greater numbers and ""looking for individuals who do not look like tourists."" 2. Expand the barrier around the entrance . Creating an additional no-go zone around the fence separating the public from the White House grounds is another possible option for the Secret Service. Despite the fence and the armed guards, the White House North Lawn is relatively accessible to the public. Pedestrians can walk right up to the wrought-iron gate, and partial closures of the North Lawn -- because someone on the public side of the gate threw a bag or dropped something on the White House side of the gate -- are common. Earlier this year, a toddler even managed to squeeze through the gate. The approachability of the White House is of course a major draw for visitors, and the optics of an additional perimeter could be problematic. ""The White House is still the people's house, and we are long passed the days when anybody could walk up and get in, but the fact that anybody could walk so close to it -- I think makes an important and powerful statement in a democracy,"" said Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, told CNN. ""Keeping the White House within public reach, if you will, sends an important political message,"" said Engel, who specializes in presidential security. 3. Set up metal detectors around the premises . This would be the most complicated and likely controversial security measure to implement. Metal detectors are set up inside the gates that visitors must pass through to continue to the White House, but nothing is on the outside of the gates. In addition to the optical problems, setting up this measure would bring about a lot of logistical questions: Where exactly would they be? Which law enforcement agency would be responsible for staffing them? Which agency would pay for them? This step is also the most unlikely; law enforcement officials tell CNN that they won't be going up on Pennsylvania Avenue's pedestrian area. 4. Always lock the doors . All of the details of Friday's breach are surprising, but perhaps the most shocking of all was that the North Portico doors -- a large main entrance to the White House -- were not locked. ""They should lock the door,"" Ronald Kessler, author of ""The First Family Detail"" and outspoken critic of the Secret Service, said. ""It's just common sense."" The North Portico entrances are frequently used, and that's why they are not always locked, but the doors were not in use on Friday at the time of the intrusion. Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, told reporters on Monday that going forward, those doors will be locked when not being used. Tough time for the Secret Service . Friday's breach is just the latest embarrassing incident for the U.S. Secret Service. The agency has not had a great run of it in recent years -- from the prostitution scandal in Colombia in 2012, to the incident in the Netherlands earlier this year in which three agents were sent home for drinking. The attention on the Secret Service is counter to the entire purpose of the organization, Engel notes. ""They would love to be secret. If you never see them, then they are doing their job,"" Engel said. ""If we are never talking about them, then they are doing their job the way that they want. The last thing that they want is for people to be discussing them."" President Barack Obama reiterated his support for the agency that protects him on Monday. ""The Secret Service does a great job. I am grateful for the sacrifices they make for me and my family,"" he told reporters. CNN's Jim Acosta contributed reporting .","Secret Service under criticism after an armed man was able to enter North Portico doors .

"(CNN) -- A man convicted of a brutal 2007 home invasion in which a Connecticut mother and her two daughters were killed was sentenced to die for the crime Thursday. New Haven Superior Court Judge Jon Blue imposed the death sentence agreed upon last month by jurors. Jurors in October convicted Steven Hayes, 47, of 16 of the 17 charges against him, including murder, capital murder and kidnapping. Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, died as a result of the home invasion, along with her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. ""This is a terrible sentence,"" Blue told Hayes. ""But in truth, it is a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames on July 23, 2007."" Prosecutors alleged that Hayes and co-defendant Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, Connecticut, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. The two daughters, who had been tied to their beds, died of smoke inhalation. Petit escaped to a neighbor's home. Hayes also forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000 from an account after finding evidence the account held between $20,000 and $30,000, authorities said. Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately later. At least four jurors were in the courtroom for the sentencing. Before it was pronounced, the court heard emotional impact statements from relatives of the three victims including William Petit as photos of the family were projected onto a screen. In his remarks, which brought many in the courtroom to tears, Petit said the impact of the crime on his family was akin to ""a bomb going off in your house."" He said he would always remember his father's face when he asked him about the girls. ""He just shook his head from side to side and sobbed ... Our home was no more."" Hayes told the court in his statement that death ""will be a welcome relief."" ""I am deeply sorry for what I've done,"" he said. ""... I stand before the court as Steven Hayes, convicted murderer, but that is not the real Steven Hayes."" He acknowledged he ""destroyed innocent lives and took away a family. I did what I did, and live with it ... I was an out-of-control train destined to crash. The death I wanted was my own, not the death of others."" Hayes was also seen looking at the photographs of the family. ""I think he knows the devastation that he caused,"" defense attorney Thomas Ullmann told reporters afterward. Ullmann earlier had told jurors that in recommending Hayes die for his crimes, they would be providing him with what he wanted, saying life in prison without parole would be a greater punishment. Ullmann said Thursday he thought it was a ""barbaric sentence."" ""In my lifetime, I hope I never stand next to another person getting sentenced to death,"" he said. Blue gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011. However, that date is a formality, he acknowledged. In reality, unless Hayes chooses to waive some or all of his appeals, it could be decades before he is put to death. Petit wiped his eyes, cried and embraced family members after the sentence was handed down. He and other family members did not speak to reporters outside the courthouse, saying they wanted their words inside the courtroom to be their statement. Petit told the court that following the crime, he lost all interest in practicing medicine. At first, he was unable to sleep; given medication to relieve his insomnia, he had nightmares, he said. His vision was impaired by the blows to the head he suffered, which also caused balance and vertigo problems. ""I seriously considered suicide many times,"" he said. ""No wife, no children, no home."" He called his wife ""the spiritual anchor of our family"" and ""my best friend,"" adding that she taught him about prayer. He said when he saw the video of his wife at the bank for the first time, ""I saw the strain on her face ... but I suspect she was praying."" He also spoke about his daughters, recalling how pleased he was when Hayley told him she wanted to major in biology so that she, too, could go into medicine. ""I grieve,"" he said, ""because she never got to love somebody for a long time."" After that sentence, he paused for several minutes to compose himself, then went on to note that his elder daughter was a ""hard worker, honest and very brave."" She raised $55,000 for multiple sclerosis research after Jennifer Hawke-Petit was diagnosed with the disease, he said. Petit remembered Michaela, or ""K.K."" as her family called her, as a gifted cook who loved to help him in the garden. ""I miss my entire family, everything we had together,"" he said. ""... They were three special people. My children were my jewels."" He said he will never get to walk his daughters down the aisle, or meet his grandchildren. Now, he said, he is left to deal with ""a giant hole in the universe, in my heart."" ""I lost my entire family,"" he said. ""... I lost my past and my future."" His only hope, he said, is for justice to be served. ""Evil does exist, and it can strike at any time ... Evil is among us, and we need to rid the world of it."" Earlier, Jennifer Hawke-Petit's younger sister, in an impact statement recorded on DVD, said, ""You felt it was your right in life to take what others had."" Cynthia Hawke-Renn recalled looking to her sister for guidance and advice. ""You stole from all of us,"" she told Hayes. ""You interrupted our cycle of life."" The girls' grandfather, William Petit Sr., recalled his anguish at learning of the deaths, choking back tears as he spoke of trying to call his son's home on the morning of July 23 and hearing Hawke-Petit's voice on the answering machine. It was, he said, ""the last time I heard her voice."" If Hayes is executed he will die peacefully, without difficulty breathing, anxiety or pain, Hawke-Renn said, according to a copy of her statement posted on the Hartford Courant newspaper's website. ""I would have given anything for my loved ones to have died in this same peaceful manner,"" she said. ""Steven Hayes has no empathy,"" said Johanna Petit Chapman, William Petit's sister. ""... He has no remorse; the only thing he's sorry about is that he got caught."" The murders were so heinous, she said, that ""the state of Connecticut was aghast."" ""Some people are so evil that they do not deserve life,"" she said, ""and Steven Hayes falls into that category."" The deaths shocked the affluent Connecticut suburb of Cheshire, where Petit is a prominent endocrinologist. His wife was a pediatric nurse who did not let multiple sclerosis keep her from working or raising a family. Hayley Petit had just graduated from Miss Porter's School, a prestigious private school that counts Gloria Vanderbilt and Jackie Kennedy among its alumnae. The deaths also led to a public outcry for Connecticut to strengthen its laws against repeat offenders when it was learned that the suspects had previously been convicted of multiple felonies. Citing the Cheshire case, Gov. M. Jodi Rell vetoed a resolution that would have eliminated the death penalty in the state.","NEW: Steven Hayes apologizes: ""The death I wanted was my own""

"(CNN) -- It's almost over. The slow-moving storm system that brought deadly tornadoes to the Plains and the Deep South, and flooding from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast could pop off a few more storms before sliding out to sea, forecasters said Thursday. But, thankfully, the system doesn't appear to have enough left to be much more than an annoyance. Saying the heaviest rains appeared over, forecasters dropped flood watches and warnings in many places while still warning of the potential for continued minor flooding in some -- such as parts of New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Rhode Island. On Wednesday, the storm brought a taste of its mayhem to the mid-Altantic states and the Northeast, with flooding covering some roads in the region and delaying some New York City-area train service, CNN affiliate WUSA reported. Bob Bonenberger found himself cut off at every pass Wednesday trying to get to his Skippack, Pennsylvania, home. ""It's just terrible,"" Bonenberger told affiliate KYW. ""The flooding is everywhere."" Fears concerning a dam in Laurel, Maryland, receded on Thursday. City authorities lifted their evacuation order after the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission said it had stabilized the situation, lowered the flow of water and determined the dam is sound. Residents from an apartment complex, a senior center and a hotel had been moved to a community center after the commission opened the dam's gates to relieve pressure, causing some flooding. Florida sets rain record . In coastal Alabama and Florida, residents continued to struggle with the aftermath of flooding that washed out roads, chewed up parts of some buildings and caused at least $100 million in damage in Pensacola, Florida, alone, according to the city's mayor. A 67-year-old woman drowned after she was swept into a drainage ditch in Escambia County, a county spokeswoman said. Mayor Ashton Hayward described the damage on one street overrun by retention ponds near the city airport. ""It was an old riverbed, you know, over 100 years ago, so the water just completely blew out,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""The asphalt blew out, the sewer blew out, the gas blew out. It devastated homes right there. It was really almost -- it was surreal,"" he said. Pictures from Thursday posted to Facebook by the Walton County Sheriff's office showed roads turned into waterfalls, cars sitting abandoned and half-submerged in front of tourist condominiums, and damaged buildings. ""Obviously we're prepared for hurricanes but when you talk about flooding, Pensacola has never had this kind of flooding,"" Ashton said. Pensacola got an estimated 20.47 inches of rain over the two days of the storm, the National Weather Service said Thursday. On Tuesday alone, at the airport in Pensacola, an estimated 15.55 inches of rain fell -- the largest amount in a single calendar day since officials started keeping track in 1879, the weather service said. The area around Orange Beach, Alabama, got even more -- a staggering 22 inches to 26 inches in less than 24 hours, the agency said. Water rushed in so fast that residents climbed on top of furniture and waited on rooftops to be rescued, said Reggie Chitwood, deputy director of emergency management in Baldwin County. ""The waters rose at a historical level. ... People had to scramble,"" Chitwood said. CNN iReporter Randy Hamilton described the scene Thursday as similar to that of the aftermath of a hurricane, with ""abandoned and flooded cars just littering the streets."" ""Debris from trees everywhere. Standing water all around, gray skies, and wind gusts that make you fear something will blow down on you,"" he said. There was one drowning death tied to the flooding, Florida officials said. The victim, a 67-year-old woman, drove or was swept into a drainage ditch Tuesday night, Escambia County spokeswoman Kathleen Castro said. 'People have lost everything' Florida Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency. ""It's unbelievable the amount of flooding we've had. We've have roads torn up, water clear through homes. I went to one home where the foundation was gone. ... You saw cars just thrown down a road, pushed down upside down,"" Scott said. ""People have lost everything, and they didn't buy flood insurance because they didn't think they were in a flood area,"" he said. Arkansas tornado was EF-4 . The storms were part of the same system that has spawned tornadoes and other severe storms since Sunday, claiming at least 39 lives in Oklahoma, Iowa, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee and Florida. In addition to the Florida flooding death, police in Athens, Georgia, said a driver was killed Wednesday when storm winds toppled a tree onto a car. On Thursday, authorities in Mississippi confirmed another death from storms that struck three days earlier, bringing its statewide total to 14. State emergency spokesman Brett Carr said that the body of a missing boy was found in Winston County. Officials revealed new details Wednesday about the powerful tornado that struck the Arkansas towns of Mayflower and Vilonia. The twister was rated an EF-4 on the Enhanced Fujita Tornado Damage scale, with an estimated peak wind speed between 180 and 190 mph, the National Weather Service said. It was on the ground for 41.3 miles on Sunday and was responsible for 15 deaths, officials said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A bi-partisan group of lawmakers lashed out at officials from the Veterans Affairs Department on Wednesday, accusing the agency of allowing veterans to die from delayed or absent medical care at its facilities and stonewalling a follow-up congressional inquiry. Barry Coates, 44, said at an unusually emotional U.S. House hearing that he is dying of cancer because a simple medical procedure was delayed at several VA facilities, including the William Jennings Bryan Dorn VA medical center in Columbia, South Carolina. Coates, who was featured in a CNN investigation in January about delayed care and veterans' deaths, testified how for a year he complained to VA doctors about his excruciating pain and rectal bleeding. CNN investigation: Veterans dying because of health care delays . The Army veteran went to several VA clinics and hospitals in South Carolina, trying to get help. But the VA's diagnosis was hemorrhoids, and aside from simple pain medication he was told he might need a colonoscopy. ""Due to the inadequate and lack of follow up care I received through the VA system, I stand before you terminally ill today,"" Coates told members of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Congress demands answers . The CNN investigative piece found that at least 19 veterans died because of delays in simple medical screenings like colonoscopies or endoscopies at various VA facilities, according to an internal agency document. They were among 82 people who have died or are dying or have suffered serious injuries as a result of delayed diagnosis or treatment for colonoscopies or endoscopies. ""This is an outrage! This is an American disaster!"" Rep. Jackie Walorski, an Indiana Republican, nearly screamed, her voice quavering. ""My dad was a veteran. He died of colon cancer,"" she said crying softly. ""This is so personal to me."" House hearing on VA deaths . Rep. Julia Brownley, a California Democrat, told the VA officials she believes the number of veterans who have died from delayed or absent care is likely much higher than has been reported or been identified by the committee. ""I was very saddened to learn of the 19 deaths,"" she said. ""But really, 19? I believe in my heart of hearts there are probably more."" Rep. Brownley asked Coates, ""Have you had any formal apology from the VA?"" ""None,"" Mr. Coates replied. ""I think it is good that we hear these stories,"" Dr. Thomas Lynch, a senior VA official, told the committee. ""We need to learn from them, and we need to do better."" But Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy under secretary for health for clinical operations, came in for tough criticism as lawmakers grew angrier and accused agency officials of withholding information from them and delaying care. ""The department's stone wall has only grown higher and non-responsive,"" said Rep. Jeff Miller, the committee chairman, ""There is no excuse for these incidents to have occurred."" Miller has been pushing for months to get answers about deaths and delayed care, and where the incidents occurred. He told the hearing his committee has received virtually no answers. ""This committee has reviewed at least 18 preventable deaths that occurred because of mismanagement, improper infection control practices, and a host of other maladies plaguing the VA health care system nationwide,"" Miller said. He asked Lynch repeatedly when the committee would get more details. Just before the hearing, the VA provided the panel with the first precise details of some veterans who died in various facilities. ""I don't mean to sound like a broken record,"" Lynch told him. ""We know you take this seriously. We will get back to you."" Minority vets receive overdue honor . Asked if he was aware of Coates's situation, Lynch said: ""I have not received specifics of his situation and I assure you I will."" Lynch testified that the ""VA is committed to consistently delivering exceptional health care, which our veterans have earned and deserve. ... Regrettably, as in any large health care system, errors do occur. The ""VA constantly strives to eliminate administrative and systemic errors, including those attributed to leadership and training shortfalls,"" he said. First-of-its-kind clinic saves vet's marriage . But as Lynch continued, the committee leaders grew more exasperated. ""I'm very angry,"" said Rep. Dan Benishek, a Michigan Republican. ""This man did not receive the standard of care. ... He did not even receive an apology. It's hard to understand."" Lynch told Benishek that ""I'm angry as well,"" and ""I share your frustration.""

"(CNN) -- On nine occasions, New York City child welfare caseworkers visited the home of 4-year-old Myls Dobson without even realizing that the boy's father was in jail, according to a review of the case. The child later died after being tortured. The boy's father, Okee Wade, 37, who has an extensive criminal record, was awarded custody of his son in August 2012 on the condition that the city Administration for Children's Services check up on the child for a year and contact the father's parole officer. Caseworkers, however, never consulted the parole officer and never learned that Wade was jailed in connection with a fraud case during their visits to the Brooklyn apartment where he was staying with his son, a review of the case ordered by Mayor Bill de Blasio found. His partner at the time told caseworkers that he was working. ""We were told that the father was working, and was working very long hours, 16 hours a day, and that's why he wasn't available,"" Gladys Carrion, the head of ACS, said at the news conference with de Blasio on Friday. She added, ""Should we have done something differently? Yes, we should have."" The review revealed that the agency charged with protecting children missed signs that the boy was at risk. ""We can't look at a situation like this and say that business as usual is acceptable,"" de Blasio said. Dobson died January 8 after his father was jailed again on another case and left the boy in the care of a Manhattan woman who, according to a criminal complaint, told investigators she starved, beat and burned him. He was found unconscious and unresponsive on the floor of a bathroom at the woman's apartment at the Ritz Plaza, a luxury high-rise in the Hell's Kitchen section. Myls was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 2011 abuse allegation . Myls' family first came into contact with the ACS in January 2011, when the agency received an allegation of abuse against his mother, Ashlee Dobson. The review found that caseworkers failed to learn that Wade was in jail from September 2012 to February 2013, despite visiting his home. At the time, Wade had custody of Myls and a family court judge has ordered ACS to monitor the child's well-being. Carrion said that caseworkers reported that Myls appeared safe and healthy during the visits. De Blasio ordered a review of all cases involving court-ordered supervision at the agency and said custodians must now get a family court judge's approval before supervision ends. ""It is very, very painful to know that this child went through such agony,"" the mayor said. The review of the case found that the ACS ""did not explore in detail"" the allegations of abuse and did not seek an emergency removal of the child from the home. Wade pleaded guilty in New Jersey on Thursday to a charge of second-degree racketeering in connection with an elaborate bank fraud scheme unrelated to the case that landed him in jail when caseworkers visited his home in 2012. A judge ordered him released on his own recognizance last week until February 6 to attend his son's funeral, according to the state attorney general's office. Wade had left Myls with a woman in Manhattan days before he was arrested, police said. The woman, Kryzie King, 27, was indicted in connection with the boy's death in Manhattan criminal court Wednesday. She has been charged with first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. A prosecutor told the court that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder and faced additional charges. The indictment will be unsealed on February 5. In a statement after her arrest, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: ""My client is not charged with homicide at this time, and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not to jump to any conclusions at this time."" Myls' mother, Ashlee Dobson, faced abuse and neglect charges in South Carolina and New York City before ultimately losing custody of the boy. Myls' parents are expected at attend his memorial service Tuesday night at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem. De Blasio has been invited. Myls' body was claimed from the morgue in New York on Wednesday, one week after his death. In the final weeks of his brief life, Myls suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence, according to a criminal complaint. The boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles, court papers said. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared to be malnourished, the complaint said. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. ""We lost a child in a horrible manner,"" De Blasio said.

"(CNN) -- I am staring down a $71.97 box of Lego Friends at my local Walmart. My daughter wants Santa to bring her one of these pretty pink and purple kits for Christmas. These are the toys that Lego made to appeal to girls after decades of making toys they once marketed as being gender neutral. See the evidence in a 1974 Lego's note to parents who bought its toys, noting that parents should let their children create whatever they want without regard to gender or skill. ""The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them,"" the note says. Now Lego wants my daughter to play with Andrea, Emma, Mia, Olivia and Stephanie, characters Lego has already named and decided should go to hair salons, save animals and work at a cafÃ© in Heartlake City. Boys, on the other hand, can go to a different aisle at the store I'm visiting to buy ""Star Wars""-themed fighter jets, with their weapons designed to blow up everything. While I don't object to haircuts or animal rescue efforts or ""Star Wars,"" I don't know why a toy designed to foster children's creativity -- explicitly not making pieces that predecide what my child should create -- now needs to decide everything for her. ""Everything"" includes what boys and girls should like. And so far, my daughter -- who loves all the colors of the rainbow but isn't a big fan of the color gray -- loves her Lego Friends. I worry what those purple and pink Legos are telling her. Seeking gender equality in a Lego world . ""Toys traditionally tell our children what we expect their roles to be as adults,"" says Peggy Orenstein, author of ""Cinderella Ate My Daughter."" ""That's why girls had dolls and dustpans, and boys had erector sets."" ""I don't think any parent wants to limit their children now, and I think all of us know that our kids -- boys and girls -- need skills in both construction and caretaking to be successful adults,"" said Orenstein. ""So during the holidays, I'd try to think creatively on a number of fronts: where gender is concerned broadening (your child's) concept of what it might mean to be female or male where and when you can."" A classic study of young children's bedroom toys found boys had action toys, moveable toys, things children can use to act. By comparison, young girls' rooms were more likely to be filled with soft, frilly and cuddly toys. While some of those toys can be connected to children's preferences, there's no way to know whether children might like toys associated with the other gender if they never have them in their rooms. When kids play across gender lines . How to combat it? Parents can actively engage their children in play that defies traditional gender stereotypes, says Deborah Best, a Wake Forest University psychology professor who specializes in gender stereotypes among young children across cultures. Parents can also choose toys that encourage children's imagination, Best says. ""One of the sad things about toys these days is they do everything for the kid,"" says Best. ""Some of the things I loved were totally neutral: Taking cardboard boxes and drawing on them, making forts by spreading bed spreads across the chair, putting on shows (with my cousins)."" That ability to think creatively, not just for a puppet show but complex challenges in adult life and work, is crucial. I am grateful that my child's school focuses on creativity and noncommercial play, and teachers actively discourage television viewing. Her teachers want to know what's in her imagination, not in the imagination of the adults at Disney, Nickelodeon or Mattel. Most of the toys in our house are raw material for her imaginative play: paint, clay, beeswax, yarn, felt, bits, crayons, bits of nature, lots of costumes that turn her into anyone she wants to be -- and Legos. And of course cooking and baking, the bike, the soccer ball and jump ropes. We are striking a balance, I hope. Lest the Disney fans think we are deprived, we let ""Frozen"" into our world. (I blame Idina Menzel, the voice of Elsa, whose singing I adore.) My child didn't choose the sweeping gowns and odd makeup Anna or Elsa for Halloween. She wanted Olaf, which she got, and she gave us lots of warm hugs. Teen says pink toy ovens discourage boys from kitchen play . Back to my original challenge: What is Santa to do? My daughter doesn't ask Santa for a lot: one big present, rarely more. I get her a few things from the real me, and other members of the family give her fun and thoughtful presents. She's not greedy, which makes me happier than I can say. So I turn to the best source on my child, the child herself. Why not the ""Star Wars"" Legos, segregated in with the other ""boy"" toys in the Walmart near our house? ""They're all gray, and they just have guns. You can't build other fun stuff with them."" That makes sense. When she received a smaller version of the Lego's Friends kit a couple months ago, she quickly built it according to the Legos directions to see that she could do it. ""Now I'm going to break it apart and build what I want."" She still wants to build what she wants, despite Legos' directions. Lego's mission, despite the current betrayal of the company's goals, is still in place in my daughter's brain. Their plans aren't enough for her imagination. She is reaching for more. And, yes, Santa will bring her a pretty pink and purple kit and some new female scientist Lego people to build and break apart.","Legos used to be known for gender-neutral toys that inspired children to create .

"(CNN) -- Complete this sentence: In the event of a loss of cabin pressure ... Air New Zealand crew members ""bared all"" for their preflight safety video to show they have ""nothing to hide."" If you guessed, ""oxygen masks will drop from above,"" you are not alone. Because the federally mandated preflight safety announcement is about as well known as the pledge of allegiance to many travelers, they immediately tune it out. So airlines are getting creative to grab passengers' attention. According to a 2001 National Transportation Safety Board study, 69 percent of passengers who completed the survey did not watch the entire safety briefing because they had seen it before or because they considered it common knowledge. How do airlines compete with more entertaining options, like texting or leafing through Sky Mall magazine? They are employing a variety of creative techniques, from naked cabin crew members to witty cartoons.  Watch videos of the creative tactics » . In late June, Air New Zealand rolled out a decidedly different approach to the preflight safety video for its domestic flights, and it doesn't leave much to the imagination. As part of its ""Nothing to Hide"" marketing campaign, which highlights the carrier's lack of fees compared with its so-called low-cost airline competition, the airline professionally body-painted five naked airline employees to perform the safety video with a pinch of cheeky humor, literally. ""We wanted to point out we have nothing to hide, and there are no surprises,"" said Steve Bayliss, general manager of marketing for the Auckland-based carrier. Set to a poppy song by New Zealander Gin Wigmore, the 3½-minute video debuted with much fanfare and a warm reception, Bayliss said. ""It was overwhelming, with 99.9 percent of the reaction positive,"" Bayliss said. ""What it has done for the airline was quite amazing. It was really innovative and shows we are up to trying new things."" Atlanta, Georgia-based Delta Air Lines made an attention-grabbing foray in May 2008 when it introduced a seductive flight attendant, nicknamed ""Deltalina"" by her fans because of her resemblance to actress Angelina Jolie, for its preflight safety video. The video has been viewed on YouTube more than 1.3 million times. But are passengers paying attention? While there is no hard data, Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliott says yes. ""We know they are paying attention because they are talking about it,"" Elliott said. ""The response from customers is overwhelmingly positive."" Delta will introduce a new version of the video in 2010 when the airline's merger with Northwest Airlines is completed. As for ""Deltalina,"" Elliott said only that she will ""very likely play some role"" in the new video. Companies must tailor their marketing efforts to our shrinking attention spans, said Larry Chiagouris, a professor of marketing at Pace University. Whoever delivers the most concise and compact information wins the consumer over, he said. ""We are now accustomed to getting our information fast and quick; as a result, we don't have the staying power to sit and listen,"" Chiagouris said. Cait Poynor, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said that as people's attention spans grow more divided, they can focus on only one thing at a time, making a company's goal to attract your attention more difficult. Poynor and Stacy Wood from the University of South Carolina are researching what companies are doing to draw people's attention to information they feel they already know. ""We don't pay attention because we already feel like we know everything that's being said,"" Poynor wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We're unlikely to give our precious attention to that safety video."" As of Tuesday, Air New Zealand's safety video had racked up more than 4.4 million views on YouTube, giving the airline priceless viral buzz. But Chiagouris ""guarantees"" we won't see this type of buzz again for an airline safety video and believes that the standard preflight briefing won't be going away. Other airlines that have gone the creative route to spice up the monotonous preflight safety videos include Virgin America and its sister airline, Virgin Atlantic. They use sassy cartoons to explain the safety procedures. The short-lived carrier Independence Air employed celebrities and political pundits for its audio safety announcements. Southwest Airlines' flight attendants, who do not have video equipment on board, occasionally sprinkle their instructions with quips: ""If you are traveling with two or more children, please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite. Help that one first, and work your way down."" In March, flight attendant David Holmes gained some fame when a passenger uploaded his preflight safety announcement rap. British charter airline Thomson Airways has kids brief passengers about safety requirements. Thomson said in a news release that its internal studies found a 15 percent increase in attention from passengers. Poynor said these creative methods will hopefully perk up passengers' attention spans. ""By doing this, they're hoping they can make consumers think, 'Hey, there might be something new here. I should pay attention,' and get just a little bit more of their resources,"" Poynor said. Bayliss, the Air New Zealand general manager of marketing, said companies need to adjust their marketing efforts, especially in the current consumer climate. ""The grand corporate brand is over,"" he said, referring to the buttoned-up appearance that airlines like British Airways uses. As for the future, Bayliss remained mum about what Air New Zealand will do next. But it's unlikely their employees will bare all again. ""If we do a plain old traditional video, our consumers will hang us up to dry,"" he said. ""The challenge is to come up with something to interest them.""","The preflight safety video may be too familiar to passengers .
69 percent of passengers said they don't pay attention to the announcement .
Airlines are getting creative to recapture passengers' attention .

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court prosecutor handling accusations of crimes against humanity against four prominent Kenyans -- including the country's newly elected president -- dropped charges Monday against one of the men, citing dead, fearful or tainted witnesses and government stonewalling. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said the decision to drop charges against former Cabinet Secretary Francis Kirimi Muthaura in connection with post-election violence in 2007 had nothing to do with last week's election of Uhuru Kenyatta as Kenya's next president. ""My decision today is based only on the specific facts of the case against Mr. Muthaura, and not on any other consideration,"" Bensouda said in a statement posted to the court's website. ""While we are all aware of political developments in Kenya, these have no influence, at all, on the decisions that I make as prosecutor of the International Criminal Court."" Instead, Bensouda said investigators had run up against myriad problems pursuing the case, including witnesses who had died and others who were too afraid to testify. The Kenyan government failed to help and prosecutors also had to drop a key witness who recanted some evidence and acknowledged taking bribes, Bensouda said. Last year, ICC judges found probable cause to pursue charges against Muthaura, Kenyatta and two others of being ""indirect co-perpetrators"" in the 2007 violence following a disputed presidential election. According to the ICC, Kenyatta, Muthaura and the others directed a wave of mostly ethnic violence in January 2008. The violence followed the 2007 elections in which the incumbent president was declared the winner despite widespread allegations of vote fraud. As many as 1,220 people died and more than 350,000 people were displaced by the violence, according to the ICC. Prosecutors accused Muthaura of making connections, providing funding and using intermediaries to mobilize attackers. Kenyatta, prosecutors say, provided ""institutional support"" for the violence. It's unclear what impact the decision to drop charges against Muthaura could have on the case against the remaining three defendants. But a source close to the situation at The Hague, Netherlands, said the decision could have a ""snowball effect"" that could lead to the dismissal of all the charges. ""There's more evidence, but not much more,"" the source said. ""This case is not a done deal."" ICC officials did not immediately respond Monday to CNN requests to comment on the source's allegations. Kenyatta, who like the others charged has said he is innocent, has asked the court to reconsider whether the charges are valid, citing a lack of eyewitness evidence, according to court filings. Zain Verjee reported from London, Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Nima Elbagir also contributed to this report.","NEW: Politics isn't behind dropping the charge against the official, the prosecutor says .

"(CNN) -- Kim Kardashian has 22 million followers on Instagram. In fact, she has more followers than the entire population of Scandinavia. In November, she tried to ""break the Internet"" with her provocative nude pictures. As a child psychiatrist and mother of three, I am not shocked by the exhibitionism or desire for publicity at all costs. I am struck by the disconnect between what educators and policy makers are saying about growing up in the digital world and the reality of popular culture. I am also reminded that parents are far too ambivalent about so called ""privacy"" online. We tell our kids not to share personal information or sext, yet our tweens and teens roll their eyes at us because sexting and over-sharing (a la Kim Kardashian) is ubiquitous. The American Academy of Pediatrics has taken a strong stance on no screen time before the age of 2 and less than 2 hours of screen for older kids. This is a far cry from the reality in which tweens and teenagers can average over 8 hours a day. Most parents are inundated with the message that they should limit screen time at all costs and take away the phone if their teens and tweens misbehave. But removing devices from the equation temporarily does little to address the issue. The Atlantic magazine reported on a high school sexting scandal so rampant that the police had to stop interviewing teenagers due to concern that they would end up confiscating the majority cell phones belonging to teens in the county. We either ""respect"" our children's privacy and have no clue about what they are doing online or we act cowardly by ""spying"" on them, which only creates a foundation of mistrust to build upon. Up until now, digital immigrants (that is all of us born before the Internet explosion) have espoused a dialogue of fear. We worry that the Internet is rotting our children's brains and destroying any chance of developing empathy or relationships. Rule 101 of child psychiatry, is that children can smell fear and ambivalence. Children take their cues from their parents' behavior and reactions. Parents' fear of too much screen time is valid but outdated and not useful in carving out a thoughtful road map. I recently attended a talk with Sherry Turkle, author of ""Together Alone"" and an insightful MIT researcher on how technology is pulling us apart. She spoke about research indicating that empathy must be developed with face-to-face interactions, not with devices. This is undeniably true, but I feel that we should give parents more credit. We get that empathy is best cultivated with face-to-face interactions and experiences. However, kids spend more time on their devices than sleeping, eating or going to school. Isn't a more useful research question, ""How can we help kids to use their devices to cultivate empathy?"" In truth, kids can use their devices to be kind, creative, closer and even more empathetic. We need to stop taking away the phone so much and start teaching tweens and teens how to responsibly use and thoughtfully live with their phones. Parents, researchers and educators are beginning to get the message about flexibility and fear but we have a way to go in understanding identity and privacy. Zero to Three, a nonprofit organization, published a guide titled ""Screen Sense: Setting the Record Straight."" It stresses that human interaction and play are critical to development but screen time that is interactive and cooperative also has its benefits. Leaders in the field are urging the American Academy of Pediatrics to make the distinction between passive TV and interactive apps and games. Educators are publishing guides on how to make technology a tool for teaching and learning. We are finally catching up with our toddlers. There will be screen time and hopefully it will be limited, thoughtfully chosen, interactive and collaborative. So how can Kim Kardashian help guide parents of older children? Kim is an adult who has charted a purposeful -- and arguably successful -- course online. A child's digital footprint starts at birth and parents are now responsible for their children's growth and development offline and online. There needs to be a dialogue at home and at school about online celebrity. Being famous carries a lot of weight and parents need to discuss online overexposure. What is the cost of 5 minutes of ""Facebook Fame""? The goal should be to earn fame for a worthy accomplishment, not fame for fame's sake. Children as young as 8 need to understand what and how to share and that they will be judged by their choices both offline and online. Secondly, parents will have to monitor their tween or teen's growth online just like they would offline with full transparency. That means no spying!! The goal of ""monitoring"" is not simply to manage our children's online portfolio, but to cultivate online resilience. We all agree that resilience, more popularly called ""grit,"" is a key component to success and happiness in adult life. Our children must metaphorically ""skin their knees"" online. We must be there to apply a Band-Aid and guide them to safety next time. We don't take away a 5-year-old's bike when they fall off of it. Instead, we encourage them to get right back on, face their fears and develop the balance and coordination needed for success. When parenting online, we must monitor our kids so we can identify when they make small mistakes. We need to tell them when they post a mean comment or send a slightly inappropriate picture. Kids' online identity is a window into their real identity. Understanding how your daughter chooses a selfie may give you valuable information into her body image issues. By reading your son's blog, you may better understand his frustrations and anxieties. Don't send your teens off alone into their rooms to play games, develop avatars and create new personas. Parents must be present so they can provide alternatives to how Kim Kardashian presents herself online. Teenagers must learn to reveal their true but ""best self"" online without being too revealing. The opinions expressed are solely those of Jodi Gold.","Kids get the impression from the likes of Kim Kardashian that any attention is good .

"Washington (CNN) -- In an interview with congressional investigators, a former top diplomat in Libya expressed concern that more could have been done by the military on September 11-12 last year to protect those being attacked at the U.S. compound and annex in Benghazi, Libya. Specifically, Greg Hicks wondered why the military did not send a plane into Libyan airspace as a show of force, and why four U.S. Special Operations soldiers were not permitted to travel to Benghazi on a Libyan plane the morning of September 12. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee will hear from Hicks and others in a Wednesday hearing on the Benghazi tragedy, which ended in the deaths of four Americans -- U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, information officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. The committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, told CNN Monday that Hicks, who was the U.S. deputy chief of mission in Libya at the time of the attack, ""is going to testify that from the get-go, he knew this was a terrorist attack and communicated that to the White House, to the State Department, to anyone that would listen before, during, and after."" Issa asserted that the Obama administration's ""talking points"" afterward -- specifically the statements by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, which did not acknowledge that it was a terrorist attack, ""had an effect on our diplomatic relations"" with Libya and ""was an unnecessary error."" He said he wants to know ""who made the decision to change the talking points in a way that caused the American people to be lied to."" Issa denied that the hearing is a Republican effort to discredit a Democratic administration, and asked, ""Why aren't the Democrats just as upset that we didn't do all we could do to save American lives?"" Beyond the Benghazi attack, he said, he expects the hearing to shed light on a failing war on terror, one in which Syria is erupting, one in which Egypt is erupting, one in which Boston is the result of terrorists, of Islamic extreme groups, and I think that's the message the American people want to hear is, tell us the truth, do what it takes to have us be protected, don't tell us things aren't terrorist attacks when they are."" Hicks spoke to investigators on April 11 of this year, and excerpts of transcripts of the interview were obtained by CNN. ""The Libyans that I talked to, and the Libyans and other Americans who were involved in the war have told me also, that Libyan revolutionaries were very cognizant of the impact that American and NATO airpower had with respect to their victory,"" Hicks said. ""They are under no illusions that American and NATO airpower won that war for them. And so, in my personal opinion, a fast mover flying over Benghazi at some point, you know, as soon as possible might very well have prevented some of the bad things that happened that night."" Hicks went on to say he believes ""if we had been able to scramble a fighter or aircraft or two over Benghazi as quickly as possible after the attack commenced"" -- around 9:30 that night -- ""I believe there would not have been a mortar attack on the annex in the morning because I believe the Libyans would have split. They would have been scared to death that we would have gotten a laser on them and killed them."" The former deputy chief of mission suggested that the Libyan government would have granted the United States permission to fly the planes. ""I believe that the Libyans were hoping that we were going to come bail them out of this mess,"" Hicks said. ""And, you know, they were as surprised as we were that ... the military forces that did arrive only arrived on the evening of September 12th."" Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, a member of the committee, tells CNN that ""military personnel were ready willing and able, and within proximity, but the Pentagon told them they had no authority and to stand down."" Issa added that the personnel ""may not have arrived in time to save lives, but at the time the decision was made, the decision was wrong."" In February, the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Martin Dempsey, was asked by Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, why F-16s at Aviano Air Base in Italy weren't deployed to Benghazi that night. ""This is the middle of the night now, these are not aircraft on strip alert,"" Dempsey said. ""They're there as part of our commitment to NATO and Europe. And so, as we looked at the time line , it was pretty clear that it would take up to 20 hours or so to get them there. Secondly, senator, importantly, it was the wrong tool for the job."" Then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta testified that ""unfortunately, there was no specific intelligence or indications of an imminent attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi. And frankly, without an adequate warning, there was not enough time given the speed of the attack for armed military assets to respond. ""That's not just my view or General Dempsey's view. It was the view of the Accountability Review Board that studied what happened on that day,"" he added. ""This is not 9/11,"" Panetta said in a February interview on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""You cannot just simply call and expect within two minutes to have a team in place. It takes time. That's the nature of it. Our people are there, they're in position to move, but we've got to have good intelligence that gives us a heads up that something's going to happen."" Hicks said that around 10 p.m. on the night of the first attack, he was at the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli talking to State Department officials in Washington, regional security officer John Martinec at the U.S. Embassy, defense attache Lt. Col. Keith Phillips and others. Phillips was reaching out to officials with the Libyan Ministry of Defense and to the chief of staff of the Libyan Armed Forces, as well as officials with the Joint Staff and the U.S. Africa Command. Hicks recalled asking Phillips, ""Is there anything coming?"" He said Phillips replied ""that the nearest fighter planes were Aviano, that he had been told that it would take two to three hours to get them airborne, but that there were no tanker assets near enough to support a flight from Aviano."" There was one team that headed from Tripoli to Benghazi, arriving at around 1:15 a.m., Hicks said. Phillips, Hicks recalled, ""worked assiduously all night long to try to get the Libyan military to respond in some way."" The Libyan prime minister called Hicks and told him that the U.S. ambassador had been killed, after which ""the Libyan military agreed to fly their C-130 to Benghazi and carry additional personnel to Benghazi as reinforcements."" Hicks said that four U.S. Special Forces troops in Tripoli -- led by the leader of the U.S. Special Operations Command Africa, SOCAfrica -- planned to hitch a ride on the Libyan plan to travel to Benghazi to help. ""We fully intended for those guys to go, because we had already essentially stripped ourselves of our security presence, or our security capability, to the bare minimum,"" Hicks recalled. But the four were informed by someone with SOCAfrica that they didn't have the authority to go, Hicks said. ""So Lt. Col. Gibson, who is the SOCAfrica commander, his team, you know, they were on their way to the vehicles to go to the airport to get on the C-130 when he got a phone call from SOCAfrica which said, 'you can't go now, you don't have authority to go now,'' Hicks said. ""And so they missed the flight."" ""They were told not to board the flight, so they missed it,"" Hicks said. ""I still remember Col. Gibson, he said, 'I have never been so embarrassed in my life that a State Department officer has bigger balls than somebody in the military.' A nice compliment."" The C-130 left between 6 and 6:30 a.m., so the four Special Forces troops would not have arrived in time to fend off the 5:15 a.m. attack on the CIA annex in Benghazi. Hicks said he recalled asking Phillips again if any military help was coming. ""The answer, again, was the same as before. It's too far away, there are no tankers. ... There is nothing that could respond. ... ""I guess they just didn't have the right authority from the right level,"" Hicks recalled. Panetta, in his February testimony defending officials' actions, said, ""The bottom line is this, that we were not dealing with a prolonged or continuous assault, which could have been brought to an end by a U.S. military response, very simply, although we had forces deployed to the region. Time, distance, the lack of an adequate warning, events that moved very quickly on the ground prevented a more immediate response. ""Despite the uncertainty at the time, the Department of Defense and the rest of the United States government spared no effort to do everything we could to try to save American lives. Before, during and after the attack, every request the Department of Defense received we did, we accomplished.""","Former U.S. official in Libya wonders why no plane was sent during the Benghazi attacks .

"(CNN) -- While such situations are rare, the puzzling disappearance of the Malaysian jetliner is not the first time a plane has vanished without a trace. Here are nine cases of mysterious plane disappearances and disasters. Some remain unsolved, decades later. 2014: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . The Boeing 777 passenger jet vanished early Saturday, about an hour into its flight from the Malaysian capital to Beijing. There was no distress call before contact with it was lost over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Search teams from various nations are combing the waters on the Malay Peninsula for traces of it, but so far, nothing has been found. The mystery over the fate of the jet and the 239 people aboard has baffled government officials and aviation experts. 2009: Air France Flight 447 . The Airbus A330 took off from Rio de Janeiro en route to Paris on May 31, 2009. A few hours later, as it crossed the Atlantic, it told control center its position. That was the last contact with the plane. Its last known position -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports -- and the ocean's depth hindered searches. It took almost two years before the bulk of the wreckage, the majority of bodies, and the voice and data recorders were recovered. All 228 aboard died. In 2012, French authorities said ice crystals disrupted the system used to determine the plane's airspeed, causing the autopilot to disconnect. The plane plunged into the ocean. 2003: Boeing 727 . Eleven years ago, a Boeing 727 vanished in the Angolan capital of Luanda. The plane took off from the Quatro de Fevereiro International Airport on May 25, 2003, headed for Burkina Faso. It departed with its lights off and a dysfunctional transponder. There are conflicting reports on the number of people in the company jet, but flight engineer Ben Charles Padilla is believed to be one of them. Some reports say he was alone, while others say three people were aboard. The plane has not been heard from since. Its whereabouts are unknown to this day. 1999: EgyptAir Flight 990 . Fifteen years ago, EgyptAir Flight 990 made a rapid descent, plunging almost 14,000 feet in 36 seconds. The 767 jet, en route to Cairo from New York City, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the Massachusetts coast. Though its debris was later found, speculation remains on the cause of the October 1999 crash that killed all 217 people aboard. Theories included a possible suicide by the pilot or co-pilot, complete with tales of a chaotic struggle for controls in the cockpit. Egypt said it was a mechanical failure. 1996: TWA Flight 800 . The Paris-bound plane exploded in midair shortly after takeoff from New York City, killing all 230 people aboard. Witnesses said they saw a streak of light and a fireball, leading to suspicions that terrorists struck the plane with a rocket. Others blamed a meteor or a missile. The National Transportation Safety Board ruled that the explosion was caused by an electrical short circuit, which detonated the fuel tank and caused the Boeing 747 to break into pieces in the waters off Long Island. Despite the explanation, conspiracy theories of a government coverup abound. 1947: British Stardust . Sixty-seven years ago, a British aircraft vanished in the Argentine Andes after takeoff from Buenos Aires, headed to Chile. After searches for the plane named Stardust turned up nothing for more than 50 years, conspiracy theorists jumped into action. But theories of aliens, among others, were invalidated in 2000, when the wreckage of the plane was found buried deep in a glacier. The crash on August 2, 1947, killed 11 people, the BBC reported. Stardust's final Morse code transmission was the word ""STENDEC."" Decades later, the meaning of the word remains a mystery. 1945: Flight 19 Navy bombers . Flight 19 does not refer to a single plane, but to five Navy bombers that disappeared off the Florida coast on December 5, 1945. A flight instructor flew one plane, and qualified pilots with 350 to 400 hours of flight time were in the others, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Radio transmissions indicated that the instructor got lost when compasses malfunctioned. Radio contact was lost before the exact problem was determined, and no traces of the planes were ever found. Adding to the mystery, a search aircraft sent to look for Flight 19 also disappeared. The patrol plane, which took off later that day, has not been seen or heard from since. Flight 19 was reported in the area informally known as the Bermuda Triangle. 1942: British fighter . A stray Royal Air Force fighter crashed in the blistering sands of the Egyptian Sahara on June 28, 1942. Its pilot was never heard from again, and the damaged P-40 Kittyhawk was presumed lost forever. But two years ago, an oil company worker discovered it 70 years after the accident. Surprisingly, it was extraordinarily well-preserved, and most of its fuselage, wings, tail and cockpit instruments were intact. Back then, experts say, planes flew with basic supplies, so its pilot's chances of survival were not good. 1937: Amelia Earhart . The disappearance of Amelia Earhart is possibly the most famous unsolved aircraft mystery. The groundbreaking aviator was on her most ambitious flight, vying to become the first woman to fly around the world. In 1937, she attempted the voyage in her twin-engine Lockheed Electra. With about 7,000 miles left to go, she made a challenging landing at Howland Island in the mid-Pacific. Her radio transmissions became unclear, and the last thing she reported over her radio was, ""We are running north and south,"" according to her biography. After spending $4 million and searching 250,000 square miles of ocean, the U.S. called off its search. Many theories exist today, but her fate and that of navigator Fred Noonan remain unknown.

"(CNN) -- Before the world reaches a conclusion as to the outcome of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, it's important to understand that the details are far too limited for drawing a parallel to Malaysia Flight 370. Implying that the airplane disappeared suggests it vanished into thin air. At this point, the Airbus A-320 has simply not been found, but the search is in its infancy compared with the months of searching since Malaysia Airline's Boeing 777 went missing in March. A crucial difference in the Flight 8501 event is that the airplane had been in constant radar contact, at least from the information provided thus far. Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed. This will assist in more accurately defining the search area. With Malaysia 370, radar data was sketchy; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area. Although it appears AirAsia 8501 flew through a large area of convective weather, this fact might have been a contributing cause and not the only cause of the event. No matter how obvious it might appear, airplane incidents and accidents generally involve more than one factor. Any good accident investigator will tell you that it is important not to focus on one theory until all the facts have been ascertained. So what could have occurred? No doubt, the crew was attempting to circumnavigate thunderstorm cells through the use of sophisticated on-board weather radar. On occasion, deviating around storm activity becomes a matter of determining the path that has a lower probability of turbulence encounters. Airline pilots always attempt complete avoidance, steering a wide berth around thunderstorms. Unfortunately, route restrictions, other aircraft traffic and altitude constraints sometimes prevent our flights from deviating as far as we'd like. This isn't to say we jeopardize safety, only that we might not be able to provide the most comfortable conditions for flying. Experience dictates much of the decision process that airline pilots use to deviate around convective weather. Operation of the radar itself can be an art with respect to adjusting the tilt angle and intensity the antenna reflects on the display screen. Although airliners are structurally designed to withstand turbulence, intentional flight into a thunderstorm is never an option. And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude. This request may not have been an indication of a problem. Oftentimes, a request for a higher altitude is to provide a smoother ride. Yes, it is possible to ""top"" a thunderstorm cell, but most airline pilots attempt to turn away from the weather because turbulence can still be encountered above a building storm cell. But there may be other contributing factors to the possible loss of AirAsia Flight 8501. Investigators will want to know whether the pitot tubes that provide airspeed data to the cockpit computer systems froze as a result of a heater failure, similar to the circumstances with Air France Flight 447. Erroneous airspeed data would send confusing information to the instrument panel displays. Because of the confusing information, pilots would have difficulty reacting. It is also possible that the airplane flew through heavy precipitation, flaming out both engines. Although the A320 is designed to continue flying without engine power, being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge, especially in turbulent conditions. If the airplane flew to the limits of its capabilities in regard to altitude, the difference between maximum airspeed and its lowest airspeed would have been a very small margin. Perhaps a high altitude stall occurred and the airplane never recovered. Regardless of any speculation, it is much too early for theories. For the moment, I am keeping my fingers crossed that a search and rescue operation will find survivors. Bigger miracles have occurred.","Les Abend: It's premature to compare missing AirAsia plane wto MH370 .

"(CNN) -- A modern-day David and Goliath story is unfolding in Washington state over whether you have the right to know what's in the food you purchase. The outcome will likely have national implications. What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified. In support, you have a large grassroots movement that includes farmers and ranchers, fishermen, business owners and consumers. On the other side, you have a handful of large corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont and Dow that are fueling the food fight by spending millions of dollars to stop the people's right to know. For Ben and myself, it's simple -- being honest with your customers is the foundation of good business. Companies ought to be proud of the ingredients they use and the products they sell, and they ought to be happy to disclose what's in those products. About 60% to 70% of processed foods contain laboratory-grown, genetically modified ingredients known as GMOs -- genetically modified organisms. According to a New York Times poll released in July, 93% of Americans want labels on food with GMOs. Eatocracy: How is genetically modified food labeled? GMO labeling is being considered in almost 30 states. Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory GMO labeling laws. But in a political system where money talks, too often the people are silenced. According to analysis from Maplight.org, a similar initiative failed in California last year after opponents spent $46 million -- five times more than proponents. In Washington, supporters of labeling have raised money from more than 13,000 contributors, with the median donation of $25 a pop. The opposition, on the other hand, has raised money from 10 donors, with the average donation of $545,827. As a result, the citizens who support labeling are being outspent three to one. If I-522 passes in Washington, it would be the first no-strings-attached legislation for mandatory labeling. And that's a good thing. It would create the momentum and the precedent for more states and federal protections to follow. In other words, it would be another big win for David.

"(RollingStone.com) -- Where do lonely hearts go? Rolling Stone: Who Is Sam Smith? A Quick Primer on the U.K. Soul Singer . British singer Sam Smith, 21, has written a dissertation on the question with his debut LP. Smith -- a gifted blue-eyed-soulster with Barry Gibb's flexible falsetto and Mark Ronson's ear for throwback grooves -- got noticed last year for his vocals on house duo Disclosure's slow jam ""Latch."" Rolling Stone: Sam Smith comes out, says debut is dedicated to unrequited love . With In the Lonely Hour's orchestral flourishes and focus on a single unrealized affair, it seems the baby-faced singer is being positioned as a male Adele. But while the album flirts with a few radiant moments, Smith's endless yearning isn't wrapped in as many irresistible packages. Rolling Stone: Sam Smith dazzles in 'SNL' debut . He rolls deepest on the gospel-powered ""Stay With Me"" -- a spare track with a simple arrangement that matches its bare plea -- and ""Like I Can,"" a blissful groove that packs a Seventies rock-radio punch. Elsewhere, though he reaches for his upper register with the same eagerness that he grasps for love, his emo hopelessness is a flood drowning everything in sight. The album's team of producers gives Smith a mostly blank canvas to showcase his vocals, providing room for soaring riffs over fingerpicked guitars on ""Not in That Way"" and ""Leave Your Lover.""

"(CNN) -- A 6-foot-long boa constrictor named Rocky stole the show Friday during a rehearsal for Nicki Minaj's performance of ""Anaconda"" at the MTV Video Music Awards when he bit a backup dancer in the arm, according to a statement from MTV. The female dancer, who was not identified by Viacom representatives, was treated immediately on the spot by a medic at The Forum in Los Angeles and later sent to a local hospital for treatment, Chris Velvin, director of production safety for Viacom Media, told CNN. Her injuries were not life-threatening. Minaj was on stage for the rehearsal but was not involved in the incident, according to the statement on the MTV website. She remarked, ""Did she get bit by the snake?"" Boa constrictors are not venomous, and Velvin said this snake had never attacked anyone before. ""He's a professional entertainment snake,"" Velvin said. ""He's been doing this for 15 years."" The snake's owner, Hollywood Animals, did not return calls asking for comment. The snake was draped around the dancer's shoulders when it bit her on the inside of her left arm, according to the statement. It's unknown what provoked the snake, Velvin said, but the rehearsal had been going normally and the injured dancer had practiced with the snake in the past. Sunday's live performance of ""Anaconda,"" a raunchy remix of Sir Mix-a-Lot's ""Baby Got Back,"" will still include a snake, but it will not be Rocky, Velvin said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- As the manhunt for the renegade ex-cop accused of killing three people in a revenge plot targeting the Los Angeles Police Department enters its second week, the big question facing authorities is: Where is Christopher Jordan Dorner? The search, considered one of the largest in the history of Southern California, has taken authorities from Orange County to the border of Mexico, from Los Angeles to the Big Bear Lake resort area of the San Bernardino Mountains. Even so, a week after Dorner allegedly began targeting police officers and their families, putting the region on edge, there was no sign of the man on Monday. A ""no bail"" arrest warrant was issued for Dorner after the Riverside County district attorney filed a murder charge Monday against him in the killing of Riverside Police Officer Michael Crain. ""That allows him to be apprehended anywhere within California, out of state or out of the country,"" District Attorney Paul Zellerbach told reporters at a news conference Monday. The murder charge is accompanied by two ""special circumstances,"" including killing a police officer on duty and firing a weapon from a vehicle, Zellerbach said. Dorner was also charged with the attempted murder of three other police officers, including a Riverside officer who was wounded when Crain was killed. That officer, whose name has not been made public, is in a lot of pain and faces ""many surgeries,"" Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz said. The other two charges accuse Dorner of opening fire on two LAPD police officers, wounding one, in the suburb of Corona. Los Angeles police spokesman Lt. Andy Neiman said the department had received more than 700 tips on Dorner's whereabouts. Some of the calls have come from Dorner's past acquaintances or people who think they have spotted the fugitive. The city of Los Angeles put up $1 million in reward money Sunday for help catching Dorner, an announcement that followed news that the LAPD was reopening the case that resulted in his termination. Dorner accused his training officer of kicking a mentally ill man during an arrest in 2007. The LAPD ruled the complaint unfounded and booted Dorner off the force for filing a false complaint. He challenged his firing in court and lost. In a manifesto released last week, Dorner blamed racism and corruption in the LAPD for his termination and vowed to wage ""unconventional and asymmetrical warfare"" against LAPD officers and their families. He called it a ""last resort"" to clear his name and strike back at a department he says mistreated him. LAPD Chief Charlie Beck had a different term for it Sunday. ""This is an act -- and make no mistake about it -- of domestic terrorism,"" he told reporters Sunday during a televised news conference. ""This is a man who has targeted those that we entrust to protect the public. His actions cannot go unanswered."" Time line in manhunt . Targeting police . Authorities say Dorner began making good on his threats on February 4 when he allegedly killed Monica Quan and her fiance, Keith Lawrence, in an Irvine parking lot, south of Los Angeles. Quan was the daughter of a now-retired Los Angeles police officer, who represented Dorner during the disciplinary hearing that resulted in his firing. The officer was among dozens named in the manifesto. The retired officer told investigators that he received a call from someone identifying himself as Dorner who told him he ""should have done a better job of protecting his daughter,"" according to a federal arrest warrant affidavit. Investigators traced the call to Vancouver, Washington, but based on the timing of other sightings, they don't believe Dorner was in Vancouver at the time, the affidavit states. Days later, early Thursday morning, Dorner allegedly opened fire on two LAPD police officers, wounding one, in the suburban city of Corona. Roughly 20 minutes later, Dorner allegedly fired on two officers in the nearby city of Riverside, killing one and wounding another. On Sunday, authorities identified the slain officer as Michael Crain, an 11-year veteran of the Riverside Police Department. Since then, the LAPD has provided more than 50 police officers and their families -- many of whom were named in the manifesto -- with security and surveillance details. Additionally, the LAPD is no longer releasing the police chief's schedule to the public or the media. Beck refused to discuss whether Dorner had been observed in the neighborhoods of any of those named in the manifesto, but added: ""You fish where the fish are, and Mr. Dorner has made his intentions very clear."" In recent days, the search for the 270-pound, 6-foot Dorner has been focused on the Big Bear Lake area, where authorities say his burning truck was discovered last week after he allegedly began carrying out his threats to kill police and their family members. Search continues . The search in Big Bear continued Monday night into Tuesday morning, the San Bernardino County sheriff's department said. About 30 officers are searching for Dorner, police said. There have been no sightings of Dorner in the Big Bear area, the news release said. There has been speculation, based in part on an arrest warrant affidavit filed last week, that Dorner could have crossed state lines into Nevada or made his way to Mexico. Federal authorities, meanwhile, were asking anyone across the country with information about Dorner or his whereabouts to contact their local FBI or U.S. Marshals Service. ""Should any citizen have information, I encourage you to make that phone call,"" said Bill L. Lewis, the assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles division. Police were also chasing down unconfirmed sightings of Dorner, including one Sunday in the San Fernando Valley after two people reported seeing someone who resembled the former police officer inside a Lowes home improvement store. The store in Northridge was evacuated, but there was no sign of Dorner. The LAPD, meanwhile, also beefed up security at the Grammy Awards on Sunday ""out of an abundance of caution,"" police Cmdr. Andy Smith said. 'Ghosts' of the LAPD's past . It's Dorner's allegations of racism at the LAPD that led Beck over the weekend to reopen the investigation into his claims. Beck said he was not doing it to ""appease a murderer"" but out of concern that Dorner's allegations will resurrect a painful part of the department's history. For years, the LAPD was dogged by complaints of racism and corruption. In 1965 and 1992, the city was rocked by racial riots that were sparked, in part, by claims of police racism and brutality. ""I hear the same things you hear: The ghosts of the past of the Los Angeles Police Department,"" Beck said Sunday. ""I hear that people think maybe there is something to what he says, and I want to put that to rest."" Despite numerous reviews of Dorner's case, he said it has ""never been reviewed by me."" ""If there is anything new, we will deal with it, and we will deal with it in a public way,"" Beck said. LAPD haunted by past . CNN's Matt Smith and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.

"(CNN) -- It's been a little more than 3 years since Steve Jobs passed away. But like other notable and historical figures, there remains an enormous appetite for anything Jobs related, including movies and books about his life. That's why a never-before-seen video deposition is likely to generate massive interest when it gets played in an Oakland, California, courtroom. Jobs gave the deposition in April of 2011, just months before he succumbed to pancreatic cancer. The trial, with opening statements beginning Tuesday, centers around digital music and how things existed a decade ago. The plaintiffs allege that Apple engaged in antitrust behavior by not allowing music sold in other digital stores to play on iPods, specifically iPods sold from 2006 to 2009. In his deposition, Jobs testified that Apple's deals with the music companies didn't allow for interoperability. Today, consumers have no shortage of options when it comes to downloading or streaming their favorite artists. But if you hit the rewind button and go back 10 years, the choices were limited. For many, Apple's iTunes was the only legitimate game in town. And it paired up beautifully with the iPod. It was classic Apple. A walled-in system that got you sucked into its ecosystem. If you bought a song from another music marketplace, it wouldn't play on Apple devices. Digital music is now basically a commodity and can be heard on an infinite amount of devices from many different providers. In his deposition, Jobs testified that Apple's deals with the music companies didn't allow for interoperability. ""We had pretty much black and white contracts with the labels,"" he said. ""And we went to great pains to make that people couldn't hack into our digit rights management system because if they could, we would get nasty emails from the labels threatening us."" The deposition took place for approximately 2 hours with Jobs often saying he couldn't remember certain e-mails or conversations. Other prominent Apple executive are expected to testify, including marketing chief Phil Schiller and Eddy Cue, who runs Internet and software services. The stakes are relatively small for Apple - 350 million, a tiny fraction of the company's revenue. (Apple generates more than $180 billion in annual sales. ) But Apple decided to take the case to trial rather than settle. And by doing so, an adoring public will get another glimpse into the style and personality of the legendary founder.","Never-before-seen deposition featuring Steve Jobs will be shown .

"(CNN) -- D-Day for rhinos is 2026, according to South African officials -- the year the majestic mammals will near extinction if current poaching rates continue. ""It's not that far away, it's around the corner,"" cautions Edna Molewa, minister of water and environmental affairs in South Africa, the country where about 75% of the world's rhinos are found. ""It's scary -- I don't want us to get to that point,"" she adds. ""We don't really want to be caught napping."" Decimated by illegal poaching, the endangered rhino has increasingly come under attack in recent years. In South Africa alone, some 480 rhinos have been killed since January, while last year there were 668 slaughters, a nearly 50% jump compared to 2011. The alarming surge in rhino killings has been fueled by unsubstantiated beliefs in southeast Asia that their horns can treat all kinds of conditions, from hangovers to cancers. Buyers in countries such as Vietnam and China are willing to pay big sums for traditional cures and this has helped create a lucrative poaching market, which is often run by sophisticated criminal syndicates. No time to waste . But now the South African government wants to cripple that black market by launching a legal once-off sale of part of its billion-dollar stockpile of rhino horns. It plans to put forward a proposal at the next Conference of Parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, in 2016, requesting the removal of a decades-old ban on rhino horn trade. ""We think that this is probably one of the measures that can actually help us alleviate this problem,"" Molewa told CNN. Read this: Drone to spy on rhino poachers . With South Africa sitting on a stockpile of more than 16,400 kilograms of rhino horn, proponents of the auction argue that the move could have an immediate impact on the fight against rampant poaching. The government's thinking is that it can flood the market by selling stockpiled horn and regulating trade. The move, advocates say, would send the current sky-high prices tumbling, thus remove the incentives for poaching, and ultimately help prevent further mass killings of the species. ""The reality is that there are people who believe ... that this thing (rhino horn) has something for them,"" says Molewa, stressing that there is an urgent need to act before it's too late. ""We have to convince them otherwise but (this) ... will not just be an easy thing,"" she adds. ""It will not take us a year, two years, 15 years; so by the time we are still doing this convincing and mobilization and actual awareness and education ... our rhino population will have been decimated."" 'Extremely naive' But critics say a once-off sale could end up fueling the trade even more by allowing buyers to believe that horn is a legalized commodity that it's OK to acquire. Jason Bell, regional director Southern Africa of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, describes South Africa's proposals as an ""extremely naive"" experiment. He says that it's not sensible to talk about flooding the market with horns when no one knows the extent of the potential demand. ""Firstly, we don't understand the market at all,"" he says. ""No one has any idea of how much horn the Chinese market could absorb and, in fact, most would argue that you couldn't ever flood the market -- that based on very simple math and a very basic understanding of demand."" Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . ""Without even a reasonable understanding of demand we are walking a very dangerous line, and a spurious one at that,"" Bell adds. ""The illicit trade will not go away as long as demand exists and putting horn into an unknown, but seemingly infinite market, will do nothing but stimulate demand and thus continued poaching and illicit trade."" Opponents also argue that authorities won't be able to regulate such a trade. The way to deal with the crisis, they say, is by stifling demand and dispelling the notions of rhino horns' supposed healing powers. ""Consumer countries need to address demand,"" says Bell. ""That is the bottom line. This is being confused by proposals to trade."" Molewa acknowledges the risks of the move but says non action would have negative repercussions both for South Africa and the world. ""We all have to go into that battle together in convincing people that this (rhino horn) doesn't really work as they think, but will that happen before 2026? That's a question I doubt. ""We can't sit back as we're seeing the heritage of our country actually being poached,"" adds Molewa. ""We can't let the security of the country be undermined.""","South Africa will ask for permission to sell some of its stockpiled rhino horn .
Government hopes the move will prevent more mass killings of rhinos .
But critics argue that this could risk fueling demand even further .

"(CNN) -- A cameraman with Sky News was killed in Egypt Wednesday as he covered the violent unrest in Cairo, the UK-based news channel reported on its website. Mick Deane, 61, had worked for Sky for 15 years, based in Washington and then Jerusalem, the channel said. He previously worked for CNN, based in London and Rome. A Sky News team member told CNN that Deane was shot inside the Rabaa al-Adawiya camp, where security forces have been trying Wednesday to clear supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy. ""Michael was about to lift the camera on his shoulder (when) a sniper from the other side opened fired and killed him instantly,"" he said. ""The moment he lifted the camera he was shot dead by a sniper."" John Ryley, head of Sky News, paid tribute to Deane as the very best of cameramen and a brilliant journalist. The channel's website quoted Sky's foreign affairs editor Tim Marshall as saying Deane was ""a friend, brave as a lion but what a heart ... what a human being."" A Reuters photojournalist, Asmaa Waguih, was shot and wounded covering the clashes in Cairo, Jo Crosby of Reuters in London told CNN. Waguih is currently receiving hospital treatment, Crosby said. Habiba Abdel Aziz of Gulf News' sister publication, ""Xpress,"" was also killed Wednesday, editor at large Francis Matthew told CNN. She was in Egypt in a personal capacity, not on a work assignment, Matthew said. 'So much more than a cameraman' CNN anchor Jim Clancy recalled working with Deane in Beirut in 1982, as CNN covered the Israeli invasion and ongoing civil war in Lebanon. ""Mick was so much more than a cameraman and video editor, he was an extremely active journalist who contributed to every aspect of our coverage,"" he said. At one point, Clancy's urgings for one more shot meant the CNN team became trapped as warplanes dropped large bombs. ""Mick turned to me, not angrily but sincerely, and looking me straight in the eyes said: 'You know, Clancy, you can get killed here,'"" Clancy said. ""It is heartbreaking that someone always looking out for the safety of his colleagues would lose his life covering the story in Cairo, Egypt. I'm heartbroken. I can only imagine the pain being felt by his wife and two sons today and my thoughts and prayers are with them."" Deane's widow is Daniela Deane, a former Washington Post writer. CNN's U.N. correspondent, Richard Roth, recalled how Deane first joined CNN's then-fledgling Rome bureau in 1982 and over time became a good friend as well as ""the voice of reason"" in the office. ""I guess my main point is how smart, calm and helpful Mick was,"" Roth said. ""He spoke the local language and could quietly charm anyone in our way to a story. The word that always came to me regarding Mick was 'wise'. And his dry humor was superb."" He added, ""I can't believe he is gone."" CNN's Tim Schwarz described Deane as ""a consummate professional, courageous but careful, never rash. I worked with him in my earliest years in television and he taught me more than anyone ever since."" UK Prime Minister David Cameron said via Twitter: ""I am saddened to hear of the death of cameraman Mick Deane, covering Egyptian violence. My thoughts are with his family and @SkyNews team."" The Foreign Press Association said it is ""shocked and appalled"" by the news of Deane's death and expressed its condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.

"(CNN) -- Turns out, Vince Lombardi was wrong. Winning isn't the only thing. In some NFL cities this season, losing matters even more. From Miami to Indianapolis, from Minnesota to St. Louis, some fans want their team to lose as many games as possible to get the No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft, which would give them an opportunity to draft the player who is widely regarded as the most polished prospect at quarterback in years to enter the league. Or, to use the rallying cry that's becoming popular, they want their team to ""Suck for Luck."" His name is Andrew Luck, and he's a redshirt junior at Stanford. He would have been the No. 1 pick had he declared for the draft after his junior season, when he completed 70.7% of his passes for 3,338 yards, 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. He is on pace to match or even top those numbers this season for the Cardinal, which is 6-0 and hosts Washington on Saturday. But his value is more than just numbers. He has all the tools that make a great quarterback, a 6-foot-4 frame with a cannon for an arm, plus a feel for the game beyond his 22 years. One player cannot transform a football team. But every team covets a franchise player at the most important position on the field, and Luck, who has another year of eligibility that no one expects him to use, is probably the best to come out of college since Peyton Manning in 1998. Even the great Manning, however, wasn't a lock for the No. 1 pick like Luck is in 2012. Hard as it is to believe, some analysts thought Ryan Leaf, an eventual bust in the NFL, was a better choice. Nobody is a close second this year. Luck, barring a catastrophe, will go to the team with the worst record in the league. ""He is the real deal,"" John Madden, the longtime NFL analyst and Hall of Fame coach, said on Sirius satellite radio this week. ""I've been watching the NFL for years, and I don't remember a more automatic, sure thing."" Which leads to the ""Suck for Luck"" movement. The precise origins of that phrase are unknown. It has become a Twitter handle -- @SuckForLuck -- which is ""imploring the Miami Dolphins or the terrible NFL team of your choice to tank for the #1 overall pick."" The Dolphins are the clear favorites in the Suck for Luck sweepstakes, but hardly the only contender. Here are the teams with the best shot at sucking enough to get the No. 1 pick, with their odds: . Miami: Not only do the Dolphins (0-5) have a lame duck coach, Tony Sparano, and an overmatched quarterback, Matt Moore, they also have an owner who seems resigned to the quest. According to the Miami Herald, owner Stephen Ross has told his friends he's willing to put up with short-term losses if the end result is the franchise quarterback his team needs. Odds: 2-1. Indianapolis: Colts Vice Chairman Bill Polian recently scouted Luck, and with good reason. The Colts (0-6) are owners of the worst record in football and seem completely hapless without Manning. But Manning is expected to return from neck surgery and just agreed to a $90 million contract with the team. Could the Colts really draft Luck and start him as a backup? You bet. Odds: 4-1. Minnesota: The Vikings (1-5) rolled the dice in the offseason, acquiring veteran quarterback Donovan McNabb, but he has struggled mightily and will be replaced this week by untested Christian Ponder. Viking fans have been waiting years for a great quarterback in his prime, and have to be salivating at the prospects of having Luck and All-Pro running back Adrian Peterson in the same huddle. Still, with Peterson, Minnesota is going to win games this year. Odds: 8-1. St. Louis: The Rams (0-5) certainly have the suck part covered, but they believe, in young quarterback Sam Bradford, that they already have their franchise quarterback. Would they bail on him to grab Luck? Hey, they could always trade him. But playing in the woeful NFC West will lead to a few victories for Bradford and Co. Odds: 10-1. The field: Carolina (1-5) is off to a slow start but just used the No. 1 pick in the 2011 draft on former Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, who has dazzled at times in his rookie season. Arizona (1-4) has lost four straight games, but made the trade for quarterback Kevin Kolb. Denver (1-4) made the switch to Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, a folk hero for his conservative views, so it seems unlikely the Broncos would suck enough. Odds: 15-1. One other wrinkle: Luck's father, Oliver, is a former NFL quarterback himself. Would the Luck family try to pull a draft-day power play like some other franchise quarterbacks, including Eli Manning and John Elway, and refuse to sign with a team it deems unacceptable? Until April, it's all speculation ... and, for the contenders, losing. ""We don't really pay much attention to it, to be honest with you,"" Denver coach John Fox said this week when asked about the Luck sweepstakes. ""But it's part of the popularity of our great game of NFL football. Being a competitor, I don't know many coaches or players to be different. You're trying to win every game."" Luck, not surprisingly, thinks this entire ""Suck for Luck"" thing is ridiculous. He returned to Stanford this season because he loves the college experience, not to create a year of fans hoping for their teams to lose. His former college coach Jim Harbaugh, now the 49ers coach, has called Luck ""as good a competitor as you'll ever see."" He is 26-5 as a starter. ""I am aware of it,"" Luck told the New York Times. ""A couple of guys told me about it. I think it's stupid. Simply put."" It may be stupid, but it'll be one of the most-watched storylines of the 2011 season. While the teams at the top chase a Super Bowl title, ultimately the biggest winner could end up being this year's biggest loser.","Stanford senior and football quarterback Andrew Luck called No. 1 pick in the next NFL draft .

"East St. Louis, Illinois (CNN) -- In a letter sent to the East St. Louis school board in April, the Illinois superintendent of education said the board was engaged in acts of corruption. Specifically, the letter alleges, board members tried to hire unqualified family members to administrative positions. The letter also alleges that board members stonewalled reforms, disobeyed state rules, mishandled important personnel issues and hired a lawyer who has never counseled the board, at a cost of $6,000 per month. State Superintendent Christopher Koch has ordered the state to take over the district. But in an interview with CNN, school board member and former East St. Louis Mayor Carl Officer says it is the state that's corrupt. He denies the charges of widespread cronyism and blames poor performance at the schools on greedy politicians and ""poor parenting."" Officer is suing the state to keep local control of the board. Caught in the middle are the approximately 7,000 students attending schools in the district. East St. Louis is an impoverished, blighted and economically depressed area. There are many abandoned lots and partially burned houses. Violent crime in the city is more than 15 times higher than the rest of nation, according to police statistics. The unemployment rate was 13.9% in May 2012, more than five percentage points higher than the national average. U.S. Census figures show 41% of the 27,000 residents live below the poverty line. Louis Jones grew up in East St. Louis. The 17-year-old brought the school district's problems to our attention through his video submission. Jones, who says he was ""lucky"" because he went to a private school, lived next to an East St. Louis middle school. Although Jones didn't attend public school, he says his friends that did often complained about poor teachers, a lack of school support, and shoddy classroom conditions. Watch Lewis Jones' original story on CNN iReport . ""It was extremely horrible,"" Jones says. ""The teachers didn't really care. They were basically there to have a job, and they didn't really care for the kids. Like, they didn't learn anything. They came out with basically nothing. Nobody ever took books, nobody ever took a backpack, nobody, like ... it was almost like it wasn't even a school, it was just like a day care center."" According to the most recent U.S. Census statistics, more than 25% of youth in East St. Louis did not graduate high school. Only 11% of students met or exceeded exceeded proficiency standards in math and reading in 2011. East St. Louis High School student Danasia McDonald says some of her teachers will show movies during class time. McDonald recalls a time that her teacher insulted the entire class. ""We (were) working on something, and (the teacher) was moving too slow,"" McDonald recalls. When they tried to tell the teacher that they were retreading old ground, the teacher, according to McDonald, said: ""Well, we dumb the lesson down for you all so you all can get it. You act like y'all can't comprehend."" Hear from another student who lives on the other side of the river . For over a month, CNN Radio contacted several East St. Louis schools for comment, including East St. Louis High School, but those calls were not returned. Schools in the district had closed for summer recess when CNN Radio made the phone calls. ""You got to realize that kids are coming from homes that are distraught ... divorces, job losses (and) family problems,"" says Brenda Mitchell, an elementary school teacher who works for the adjacent Cahokia School District. Mitchell says many of her students will attend middle and high school in East St. Louis. ""It's just not (the lack of) money for our district, but there's, you know, a lot of challenges we in education have to face, and we have to pick them up from where they are and take them on forward,"" Mitchell says. Officer says the problems in the district are no different than those in other blighted and economically depressed areas. ""Quite frankly, what happens here is probably not any different than what's happening in Harlem or Cleveland or Appalachia,"" Officer says. ""There's no difference between a fifth-grade student in West Virginia and a fifth-grade student in Louisiana or California. It really starts with the basic premises of having a moral commitment by parents. I don't care how good the teachers are or how much money you have inside of the school district. Unless a parent wants to see their child succeed, you're fighting an uphill battle."" What could have been better about your education? Share your story with CNN iReport. Several studies, including one from the child welfare foundation America's Promise Alliance, show a high dropout rate in the nation's 50 largest cities. In those cities, only 53% of high school students graduate within four years. That rate drops further in urban schools in economically depressed areas; Indianapolis, Cleveland, Baltimore and Los Angeles all have low graduation rates.

"(CNN) -- I rarely agree with Justice Antonin Scalia, much less side with him in a public debate. But, like Scalia, I am a believer: I believe in God and the devil, and I believe it's bizarre that so many find that belief so curious. In a widely discussed New York magazine interview with Scalia published Sunday, journalist Jennifer Senior prods the justice about his legacy until he proclaims, ""When I'm dead and gone, I'll either be sublimely happy or terribly unhappy."" That's where a discussion of heaven and hell, God and the devil, begins. Her reaction seems to be that it is outlandish to believe in God, much less the devil. From this point onward, the tension in the interview is palpable. Yet Scalia gamely answers her questions about his beliefs. Yes, he believes in heaven and hell. No, you don't have to believe in heaven and hell to go to heaven -- everyone's going one place or the other. For me this exchange recalls my first brushes with insistent secularists and atheists. I come from North Carolina, buckle of the Bible Belt, where few would proudly announce contempt for faith. It had not occurred to me before I left North Carolina that my religious beliefs might become a reason to feel alienated. I am culturally Catholic, the product of Irish, Colombian and Spanish immigrants, but was not baptized in infancy or confirmed in adolescence. As a child, I said the Lord's Prayer because it comforted me, prayed for the souls of the dead because I loved them, but I hadn't met a catechism. Opinion: Hey Justice Scalia, let's be friends . When I moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for college, I was surprised to confront pervasive, vocal disdain for religion. I chalked it up to culture clash: These were brash young adults who'd seen less of the world than they'd studied, knew less about actual Americans than their counterparts on MTV. In reality, I had just moved from a culture in which faith was presumed to one in which the presumption was against faith. Scalia's awareness of elite bias against belief shows. In the interview, he tries to make his beliefs legible to nonbelievers, showing humility and alluding to cultural touchstones. He admits, ""I don't even know whether Judas Iscariot is in hell. I mean, that's what the pope meant when he said, 'Who am I to judge?' "" (If you don't know Judas from the Bible, you'll recognize him from Dante's ""Inferno."") I can relate: Explaining faith, especially dogma, is difficult. As many of my peers seemed to be pulling away from formal religion, I opted in: I was baptized and confirmed at 27 -- in a triple-dunk, full-immersion baptism at the university church. Friends asked, what did my initiation mean -- and why Catholicism? Most queries seemed to demand that I justify my faith; some exoticized my Christian beliefs. I don't have all the answers yet. Discussing faith in public life is many orders of magnitude harder, but Scalia tried. Scalia's interviewer was moving on when the justice ""stage-whispered,"" ""I even believe in the Devil."" Senior pursues this out of curiosity, presumably, but her questions are inadvertently tinged with condescension: a surprised, ""You do?"" Even I, a literal neophyte, know most Christians believe in the devil in some form or another. Scalia doesn't get testy until Senior asks, ""Isn't it terribly frightening to believe in the Devil?"" He replies: ""You're looking at me as though I'm weird. My God! Are you so out of touch with most of America, most of which believes in the Devil? Jesus Christ believed in the Devil! It's in the Gospels!"" He admonishes, ""You travel in circles that are so, so removed from mainstream America that you are appalled that anybody would believe in the Devil!"" Senior apologizes, explaining, ""It wasn't your belief that surprised me so much as how boldly you expressed it."" Scalia replies honestly: ""I was offended by that. I really was."" Scalia may have been harsh, but he's not wrong. Today, as a third-year law student, I sit in seminars with students who scoff at the idea of lawmaking informed by religion, even though most Americans are religious. I struggle with the question of how to make room for faith in conversations such as these. Should I interject, offer a different view or suggest lawmakers don't lightly disregard constituents' convictions? The same tensions are present in boardrooms, courtrooms and newsrooms across America -- New York magazine's interview of Scalia is just one demonstration. I do not offer evidence of the devil, just a proposition for secularists and atheists: Even if you do not believe as people of faith do, respect their right to believe and hold opinions informed by belief. Starting from this position in discourse and debate might inaugurate a long overdue -- and respectful -- dialogue about faith in law and politics.

"(CNN) -- ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" I was not yet four years old when Dr. Martin Luther King spoke those words on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. But in a way I have lived my life as if I were one of those children. For more than 40 years I have fought to make this country a place where those words would be true for all of us, where all Americans can be Dr. King's spiritual grandchildren. I am not naÃ¯ve enough to think that with the election of Barack Obama racism has disappeared from America. In fact, according to a new AP Poll, racism has increased since 2008. According to the poll, ""51% of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48% in a similar 2008 survey."" The three percentage point rise is not large, and within the poll's margin of error. But, at the very least, it indicates we have not reached the post-racial world that some hoped Obama's election would usher in. And the prejudice isn't limited to blacks: 52% openly express anti-Hispanic sentiments. The numbers go up when measured by an implicit racial attitudes test. That is, when the survey takes into account the ""dog-whistles,"" the new buzz word for code language only those ""tuned in"" will hear, anti-black sentiment is 56% and anti-Hispanic sentiment is 57%. Opinion: Don't let superstorm sway your vote . This racism has consequences. Alan Jenkins, an assistant solicitor general during the Clinton administration and now executive director of the Opportunity Agenda think tank, told the AP that negative racial attitudes affect ""the way people are treated by police, the way kids are treated by teachers, the way home-seekers are treated by landlords and real estate agents."" The racial divide increasingly reflects the generation gap. According to the ninth annual Martin Luther King Jr. Day report, published by the Boston-based group, United for a Fair Economy, ""Increasingly elderly Americans do not identify with young Americans who are far more racially and ethnically diverse, leading to reductions in future-oriented public investments."" The report notes that almost half of Americans under 18 are minorities and 80% of retirees are white. By 2030, the majority of those under 18 will be people of color, and by 2042 nonwhites will be the majority of the population. And as has become obvious in this campaign, the racial and generational divide is driven by the economic divide. In simple terms, the older white population has accumulated more of the wealth. The key political question is how they relate to and interact with a younger, more diverse -- and yes, more tolerant -- demographic. Frum: Let's get real about abortions . This may explain John Sununu's recent comment. Explain, but not excuse. In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, former New Hampshire Gov. Sununu said, when asked about Gen. Colin Powell's endorsement of Barack Obama, ""You have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or that he's got a slightly different reason for supporting President Obama...I think that when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him."" The wording is a well-constructed dog-whistle. It's also tone-deaf. What's meant to deflect criticism -- ""somebody of your own race that you're proud of ... I applaud Colin"" -- sends a different signal: condescending and contemptuous. Just how condescending and contemptuous is easy to see if we reverse it: Sununu is endorsing former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney not because of policies or philosophy, but because both are old, rich and white. Either formulation should make us very uncomfortable. Opinion: What is presidential greatness? In fact, Powell gave cogent, powerful reasons for his endorsement. He noted the difficulty of the recession, the job losses, the fiscal implosion, the unemployment and auto industry collapse. He said that he'd seen ""stabilization ... in the financial community, housing ... starting to pick up ... consumer confidence rising."" On foreign affairs, Powell said President Obama has gotten us out of one war, started to get us out of a second and that the president's actions ""with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very, very solid."" Powell also explained why he was not endorsing Romney: ""The governor was saying things at the debate on [foreign affairs] that were quite different from what he said earlier ... As I listen to what his proposals are ... with respect to the economy, it's essentially let's cut taxes and compensate for that with other things."" Those responding to Sununu's racist dog-whistle miss a critical point: each of us has a history -- be it racial, ethnic, religious -- that is a source of pride and sorrow. Our heritage helps shape our identity. But neither history nor heritage defines an individual's character. Only the individual's actions can do that. In human terms, what-you-see-is-what-you-get refers not to something superficial or external, but to what a person does, for character is expressed in action. Are we honest; are we just; are we compassionate? Where are our acts of goodness and kindness? What a shame that some who would lead, whether in politics or the media, still pretend otherwise. Powell argued about character; Sununu insinuated about race. And Dr. King's dream is still not yet a reality. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: This country should be one where Dr. King's vision of racial equality prevails .
But she says new poll shows rise in anti-black, anti-Hispanic attitudes, far from post-racial .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Six astronauts lie motionless in a row of compartments with medical monitoring cables connected to their bodies, as their space ship cuts through the silent blackness that separates Earth from Mars. They're sound asleep and will be for the extent of their six-month trip, having been placed in an artificially induced state of hibernation called torpor. This is the way a NASA-funded study sees space explorers traveling to Mars -- unconscious, with their metabolism switched into slow motion. Sending astronauts that far into space would be too challenging, costly and grueling without it, says space engineer John Bradford, whose Atlanta-based company SpaceWorks wrote the study for NASA. ""Ultimately, it's what we'll have to do,"" he says. Sci-fi becomes reality . Sleeper spacecraft with crews in suspended animation have been flying through futuristic science fiction movies like ""Avatar,"" ""Alien,"" ""Pandorum"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for decades. Now science reality is catching up, as medical advances have made stasis possible via a method called therapeutic hypothermia. It has been used since the early 2000s to treat patients with traumatic injuries. Formula One racer Michael Schumacher, for example, who suffered a brain injury while snow skiing, was reportedly put into therapeutic hypothermia. It renders the patient unconscious by lowering the body temperature. In Schumacher's case, it also prevented swelling of his brain. The torpor stasis, which greatly slows metabolism, can help injured patients survive longer, while medical teams work to rescue them, Bradford says. But doctors usually induce it for only three or four days at a time, not the 180 days it would take for astronauts to get to Mars, nor the 180 it would take to get back to Earth. ""It may take some time to get it to the state of effectiveness we want it to go to,"" Bradford says. That involves animal testing, then some extended testing on humans, perhaps on the International Space Station. It could take decades. MAVEN spacecraft enters Mars orbit to explore its climate change . A short-cut . There is a possible work-around, though, that astronauts could start out with. SpaceWork found a Chinese medical study in which trauma patients stayed in torpor for longer periods. ""They had a sample of about 80 people that went through therapeutic hypothermia for all sorts of traumatic injuries. And those periods did range from three to up to 14 days."" The patients who stayed under for two weeks fared as well as those who were put under for a shorter time. Two weeks is a time frame SpaceWorks can live with and one that Bradford says his medical partners at the Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins University are more comfortable with. Aboard the spacecraft . Here's how it would work during space flight. The two-week torpor periods would be straddled, so that there is always one astronaut who is awake for a brief period. The colleague currently awake could check in on the other ones who are still unconscious to make sure their intravenous feeding tubes are clear, and urine removal systems and so on are working properly. He can also communicate with Earth. ""He can check emails,"" Bradford says. Then after two or three days, he wakes up the next astronaut by activating a heating system that brings his or her body temperature up to normal. Then the awakened astronaut straps the other into the hibernation module, hooks up the medical systems and inserts a body cooling tube through a nostril. Heating pads behind the astronaut make sure the nasal tube doesn't cool down their body too much. A temperature drop of only about five degrees Fahrenheit is necessary -- from 98.6 to about 93 degrees. Trace amounts of sedatives in the feeding line would suppress the astronaut's shiver reflex. The habitat unit housing the sleepers would rotate to create centrifugal force simulating gravity. That would help to mitigate the reduction in bone density that naturally occurs in zero gravity. How long until this is scenario is reality? Less than 30 years, Bradford thinks. ""I think it's something that can and will be used on the first mission to Mars."" Mars rover reaches key destination . Lighter, easier, happier . Getting astronauts to hibernate like bears makes the mission much easier and more affordable, Bradford says. They can be stacked up in small habitats; with minimal metabolism, they don't need as much food, no daily change of clothes. Exercise equipment is replaced by electrodes that stimulate their muscles while they're asleep. That saves lots of space and altogether more than half the weight of the fully equipped rocket that it would take to transport a crew that was not sleeping through the voyage in torpor. And it would be more pleasant for the crew. Astronauts traveling in waking condition would likely arrive in decent physical shape, but ""mentally, I'd worry about them,"" Bradford says. ""You're going to be in a pretty tight space -- nothing as voluminous as the ISS -- for the mission,"" he said. Space is dark and feels isolating. In June 2010, Russia's space agency simulated a trip to Mars by closing up astronauts in a mock space ship for about a year and a half to see how it affected them psychologically. They became reclusive, got depressed and slept 12 to 14 hours a day because there was nothing to do, Bradford said. NASA's next Mars rover will make oxygen, look for farmland . Ultimate goal? After six months of travel to Mars, the astronauts would face a 500-day mission on the barren planet's surface, according to SpaceWorks' assessment. Then they'd have to endure another 180 days in the cramped rocket to get home to Earth. Ideally, Bradford would like to see the astronauts complete both travel phases in torpor stasis and not even have to wake up every two weeks. Therapeutic hypothermia would also allow space agencies to pack more astronauts into one ship. That's vital to meeting an often-mentioned possible ultimate goal for travel to Mars, he says. ""If we're looking at colonizing, you've to do more than send six or eight people every year.""","A study done for NASA foresees astronauts being unconscious for Mars travel .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Tuesday unveiled a $100 million initiative to unlock the ""enormous mystery"" of the human brain in hopes of boosting the understanding and treatment of brain disorders. ""What if computers could respond to our thoughts? Or language barriers could come tumbling down? Or if millions of Americans were suddenly finding new jobs in these fields -- jobs we haven't even dreamt up yet because we chose to invest in this project? That is the future we are imagining. That is what we are hoping for,"" the president said in an event in the East Room of the White House. The initiative, dubbed Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, or BRAIN, ""aims to help researchers find new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury,"" the White House said in a release issued in advance of the event. ""There is this enormous mystery waiting to be unlocked,"" Obama said, ""and the BRAIN Initiative will change that by giving scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain in action and better understand how we think and how we learn and how we remember. And that knowledge could be -- will be -- transformative."" Mapping the brain: Top brain scientist is 'philosopher at heart' Obama said he will seek the $100 million funding in the budget he sends to Congress next week. In an environment where both parties are seeking significant spending cuts, the expenditure faces an uncertain reception. In his remarks, Obama said the funding would be in line with a promise he made earlier this year to increase levels of research. In his State of the Union address in February, he said, ""If we want to make the best products, we also have to invest in the best ideas,"" and alluded to scientists ""mapping the human brain to unlock the answers to Alzheimer's."" The money to study the brain would support research by the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Science Foundation. The research would involve both federal research agencies and private partners. A major goal is to reveal ""how individual brain cells and complex neural circuits interact at the speed of thought,"" the White House said. Brain map seeks to unlock mysteries of the mind . ""Our ultimate objective is a deep understanding of the human brain and its understanding,"" said Arati Prabhakar, director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, in a conference call with reporters. In the same call, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins said that ""advances in tech which are coming along very quickly make it possible to take a look at what's happening in the brain,"" and the research ""leads us to believe we can accomplish something very dramatic."" The hope is that these new technologies will lead to insights into how the brain processes information and how it is linked to behavior.

"(CNN) -- Three experienced hikers were rescued from California's Mount Whitney, but a father and son in a separate group are missing, the National Park Service said. Battling heavy snow, rescue personnel and a California National Guard helicopter reached the three men around noon (3 p.m. ET) Thursday. The men were part of a group of 10 hikers who set out on their journey up the mountain on Monday. About 45 people looked for the three hikers -- Phillip Michael Abraham, 34; Dale Clymens, 45, and Stevan James Filips, 45 -- the National Park Service said in a statement. All three were able to walk and move during a general health assessment. Two other hikers on a 36-mile cross-country loop were supposed to return Tuesday. They are Sinh Baghsohi, 27, and his father, whose first name is unknown, park officials said. Both men are originally from Iran, but their current residences are not known. The younger Baghsohi is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs about 287 pounds. His father is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds. They had hiked in with a friend, who became ill and hiked out, the park service said. Dave Paladino, an Omaha, Nebraska, resident and leader of the larger group, said extreme weather dumped up to three feet of snow and drastically lowered visibility in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks. The group of 10 hikers shared a love of climbing, outdoor activities and adventure, Paladino said. They set out on their hike shortly after 4 a.m. Monday in several sub-groups, including one led by Paladino and another including all three missing hikers. ""Every single one had been training for this event for years,"" said Paladino. The snow began for Paladino's group when they reached 10,000 feet up what he called the ""10-mile hill,"" and picked up significantly as they went up another 2,000 feet. His group reached the summit around 3:30 p.m. Monday, staying briefly at a shelter there before going back down the mountain. The climb back down was much more difficult than expected, according to Paladino, due to the heavy snow. ""It was by far the hardest thing we've ever done,"" said Paladino, who said he has climbed Mount Rainier in Washington state, among other peaks. At one point, his group met and talked briefly with the climbers who later went missing.  Abraham later sent several texts, the last of which was between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday in which they said they couldn't find the trail because of the snow and were heading to the summit shelter. The three climbers did not have snow shoes, said Paladino.  However, they likely had enough food and water to last several days, he said. Temperatures near the mountain's peak were in the 20s, Paladino added, not low enough to make frostbite a major concern. A rescue operation involving two hikers was begun and aborted Wednesday because of the snow. On Thursday morning, ""bigger and more experienced teams"" were brought in, said Paladino. ""We wanted to do this,"" said Paladino. ""These guys were doing what they loved, and we'll continue to do what we love.""","Two hikers still missing are from a separate group on Mount Whitney .

"(CNN) -- More than half of the suspects Mexican authorities arrested in the bust of an alleged kidnapping gang were active-duty federal police officers, a top official said Tuesday. ""It is unfortunate that among those who have the high honor of serving citizens, some commit acts of treason against the citizens who they swore to protect,"" government security spokesman Eduardo Sanchez told reporters. The 18 suspects arrested, including 13 federal police officers, are connected with at least seven homicides and four kidnappings in Guerrero state, Sanchez said. If convicted, he said, the federal police officers could face sentences of up to 70 years in prison for each alleged kidnapping offense. Sanchez said the arrests showed the government's commitment to cracking down on any corruption within its ranks. Mexico: As dangerous -- and safe -- as ever . But the bust was the latest public relations blow for the port of Acapulco, where Sanchez said the alleged crimes had been committed. The Pacific resort city and surrounding towns were battered by Tropical Storm Manuel last month and made global headlines with the alleged rape of six Spanish tourists there earlier this year. Sanchez said a citizen's tip helped authorities uncover the criminal group and arrest the suspects in an operation earlier this month. He declined to provide details about the victims and said authorities were still investigating to determine whether the suspects were connected to crimes in other parts of Mexico. Since President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto took office in December, 81 federal police officers have been accused of committing crimes, Sanchez said. ""So the message is very clear,"" he said. ""We are not going to tolerate any act of corruption from any public servant."" For years Guerrero state, which includes Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation. Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last week painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country. A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide last year, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.

"(CNN) -- An audit team sent to the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida, discovered a list of patients needing follow-up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the VA's electronic computer system. As a result, the VA's Office of Inspector General has opened an investigation and three members of the Gainesville VA's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of an investigation, VA Sunshine Healthcare Network (VISN 8) spokeswoman Mary Kay Hollingsworth said Monday. The latest allegation comes as the Department of Veterans Affairs defends itself against claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities nationwide. For six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in medical appointments suffered by veterans across the country and veterans who died or were seriously injured while waiting for appointments and care. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days. The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month as inside sources revealed to CNN details of a secret waiting list for veterans at the Phoenix VA. Charges were leveled that at least 40 American veterans died in Phoenix while waiting for care at the VA there, many of whom were placed on the secret list. But even as the Phoenix VA's problems have riveted the nation's attention, numerous whistle-blowers from other VA hospitals across the country have stepped forward. They described similar delays in care for veterans and also varying schemes by officials at those facilities to hide the delays -- in some cases even falsify records or efforts to ""cook the books."" The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by Veterans Affairs managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources who spoke exclusively to CNN. Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. They acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there, but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died. CNN has submitted numerous requests for an interview with Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki; the secretary has refused them all. Support for Shinseki holding for now among Senate Democrats .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two families, two political parties -- one family business. It's hard to understate the depth of the Bush-Clinton impact on American politics. Think of it this way: For 32 years, there was either a Bush or a Clinton in the White House or the Cabinet. And in 2016, the families could be competing again -- in a Jeb Bush vs. Hillary Clinton face off. Whether that should come to pass has been a topic of lots of debate and speculation -- even inside the Bush family. After Barbara Bush made her now infamous pronouncement last year on the ""Today"" show that Jeb should sit it out (""We have enough Bushes,"" she said), there's been lots of private family discussion. But in an exclusive interview with CNN, Jeb's brother, Neil, made it clear that his dad -- George H.W. Bush -- wants his son to run, no matter what his wife says. ""If you asked Dad the same question 'Should Jeb run?' he'd say yes."" Asked again whether Bush 41 would specifically be for it, Neil Bush replied, ""Yeah, he would say yeah."" Has Neil asked his father himself? No. But he allowed, ""I have heard him answer that question."" And right now, that's as close as you'll get to the family thinking. A common concern . Barbara Bush's concern -- that there are ""other families"" out there who can serve -- may be anathema to the family, but it's a common concern in the rest of the political world. Isn't it an advantage, for example, for a name brand to raise gobs of money from a standing start? Not to mention starting out with a ready made political organization. David Frum, a speechwriter in the George W. Bush White House, likens it to something, well, un-American. ""The thing that they bring to the table that nobody else has is the massive preexisting ability to raise money,"" he said. ""If we end up having a presidential race in which one dynasty plays off against another dynasty, you'll say is this America or is it the last days of the Roman Republic."" He has a point. A Jeb-Hillary 2016 matchup wouldn't be the first time a Bush faced a Clinton. Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush in 1992; now the men are the closest members of the ex-presidents club. ""I think there is a great, you know, kind of bond ...,"" Neil Bush said of Clinton and his family. ""I think George (W. Bush) calls him 'Bubba.'"" The next chapter . What happens next with the Clintons and the Bushes is the story of great expectations. In many ways, said political commentator and author David Maraniss, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have had similar trajectories. ""Jeb ... was the chosen one. He was the one who would be president someday and succeed his father, but 'W' was the oldest and had better political skills and came first,"" Maraniss said. ""And similarly with Hillary, there was a feeling before she even married Bill Clinton. People in the early '70s were starting to think someday there would be a woman president."" Of course, not all Bushes and Clintons are created alike. Some have political skills and some don't. And former Bush 41 and 43 adviser Mary Matalin said both Jeb and Hillary offer some things others don't -- experience and ideas. ""This campaign particularly at this time in our country's history is gonna turn on message, candidate skills, candidate policies -- not their names,"" Matalin said. ""They can run as Hillary and Jeb Smith and people will be listening to what they are proposing."" There are real downsides to carrying the Bush or Clinton moniker -- preexisting family friends and enemies, unwelcome comparisons to what came before, a sense that you can't be about ""change"" if you've been around forever. And one more thing: fatigue -- as in, aren't we just too tired of these families to watch another replay in 2016? A longing for familiarity . Well, maybe. But Maraniss figures that one of the reasons we keep coming back to them is the familiarity we can also scorn. ""It's true that things are constantly changing and new names are arising all the time, but still there's a longing for familiarity and celebrity that lasts through all of that,"" he said. ""It's just like Hollywood or anywhere else. There are certain names that stick and people remember."" And close Clinton ally Paul Begala makes the case that Hillary Clinton earned this on her own. ""They don't want Hillary to run because her husband did a great job. They want her to run because they think she'd be a great president,"" Begala said. As for looking like yesterday instead of tomorrow, Begala argued that, ""When you're seeking to be the first woman president, it's kind of impossible to paint you as the past."" The durability of the families is obvious. Not only because they're fixtures in American politics, but also because the younger generations have shown an aptitude for it as well -- Jeb's son, George P. Bush in Texas, and perhaps even Chelsea Clinton, who isn't ruling anything out these days. But if you call either of these families a dynasty, there's pushback from the patriarchs. ""A dynasty involves people who get jobs solely because of what their last name is,"" Bill Clinton said in 2008 as Hillary Clinton mounted her first presidential run. ""The question is where she should be eliminated because she happened to have married me a long time ago ... this is not a blood deal."" George H.W. Bush had a similar take in 1999, standing next to his son George W. at the family compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, the day after he had announced his own White House campaign. ""We never felt we were entitled to something. Dynasty at least connotes, has a connotation, of something coming your way,"" he said. Dynastic terminology . Neil Bush is one of the rare family members who seems to have no problem with the dynastic terminology. ""I don't have a problem with it. My mother doesn't like to use the word 'dynasty' because she thinks it's elitist or whatever,"" he told CNN. ""The fact that there happens to be name recognition or brand recognition of the Bush name or brand shouldn't be a handicap."" Neil tells the story of watching his mother's candor on the ""Today"" show when she and the family were preparing to leave for the opening of the George W. Bush presidential library. ""We were all watching Jeb standing in the corner just like ... What's your response to that? I don't know,"" Neil recalls. ""You know, Mom is just going to say what's on her mind and she just really believes that it's time for the country to look at different families, but it's not going to affect Jeb's decision."" For the Bushes, the family's political dominance is a matter of longevity and sheer size. For the Clintons, it's a newer business -- more of boutique operation. ""It's a powerhouse. Clinton and Clinton. It's a law firm. It's a political law firm and a powerful one,"" Maraniss said. ""The most powerful one in the country still."" Will they run? While Hillary Clinton herself stays noncommittal about a potential second White House run -- despite all of the activity on her behalf -- her backers seem to be gearing up for another Clinton campaign. As for Jeb Bush, he's continuing to travel the country on behalf of 2014 Republican candidates, collecting chits along the way. Funders have shown more interest in his candidacy now that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's star has dimmed. As for Neil Bush, it's all in the family. He recounts a funny story about growing up Bush. He was 8 and big brother, George, was 16. There was a BB gun fight, and Neil lost â€” getting shot in a most uncomfortable place. ""When Dad became president, it was like the fulfillment of an expectation. He's always been my hero. He's always been Mr. Perfect,"" Neil said of his father's election in 1988. In the end, Neil admired what his brother W accomplished as president, but early on he couldn't imagine it. To him, ""W"" was the the guy ""who shot me in the ass.""","It's hard to understate the depth of the Bush-Clinton impact on American politics .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama promised accountability, but he made clear Wednesday he won't fire Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki -- yet -- over excessive and sometimes deadly waiting times faced by veterans seeking government health care. The controversy has mushroomed since CNN first reported the problem last November in a detailed investigation examining several VA hospitals. Hospital delays are killing war veterans . After meeting with Shinseki at the White House, Obama held a hastily arranged news conference in which he said he needed more time to review what was going on. ""If these allegations prove to be true, it is dishonorable, it is disgraceful, and I will not tolerate it, period,"" the President said in his first public comments in weeks on the issue. However, he made clear his main target for now was anyone who actually carried out improper practices at VA, rather than the retired Army general at the top. ""Anybody found to have manipulated or falsified records at VA facilities has to be held accountable,"" Obama said. Emotional issue . The VA problems touch on an emotional topic -- caring for America's military veterans, many of whom served in war -- and the revelations of scheduling tricks and secret lists to hide months-long waits for care prompted criticism of Shinseki and the VA on both sides of the aisle. ""My attitude is, for folks who have been fighting on the battlefield, they should not have to fight a bureaucracy at home to get the care that they've earned,"" Obama said. Asked if Shinseki offered to resign, he said the retired Army general ""cares deeply about veterans and he cares deeply about the mission, and I know that Rick's attitude is if he doesn't think he can do a good job on this and if he thinks he's let our veterans down, then I'm sure that he is not going to be interested in continuing to serve."" His remarks did little to soothe critics, with House Republican leader Eric Cantor of Virginia quickly asserting that the President ""is known for talking about accountability without ever holding anyone accountable."" Rep. John Barrow of Georgia became the first congressional Democrat to publicly call for Shinseki's dismissal since the controversy erupted after CNN's initial reporting. Barrow released a statement after Obama's remarks that said: ""While I don't think a change in leadership will immediately solve the serious problems that plague the VA, I do think it's time to give someone else an opportunity to lead the agency and begin the rebuilding process to ensure these issues never happen again."" Calls for Shinseki's dismissal . The American Legion, a major veterans' group that has called for Shinseki's ouster, labeled Obama's decision to keep him in office ""unfortunate."" ""Words are nice, and even somewhat comforting, but when will the VA's house be cleansed of those who are soiling it and dishonoring the system?"" said Daniel Dellinger, the legion's national commander. Obama noted that the public wants a ""swift reckoning"" on the VA issue, but he defended the record of his administration and Shinseki -- who has been the only Veteran Affairs secretary of his presidency. In particular, the President cited increased spending for VA, expanded services, efforts to help veterans go to college and get jobs, and reducing a backlog of benefits claims. CNN reported last month that in Phoenix, the department used fraudulent record-keeping -- including secret lists -- that covered up excessive waiting periods for veterans, some of whom died in the process. Bonuses paid . In a new development, Shinseki has rescinded an $8,495 bonus awarded to Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman last month. Helman is on administrative leave in response to the allegations of misconduct under her watch. ""Secretary Shinseki today exercised his authority to rescind Sharon Helman's fiscal year 2013 performance award immediately,"" a VA statement said on Wednesday. ""Previously, Ms. Helman received the performance award due to an administrative error."" Meanwhile, the number of VA facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the agency's Office of Inspector General said Tuesday. Last week, the inspector general told a Senate committee that 10 facilities were being investigated. Obama's deputy chief of staff, Rob Nabors, will head to Phoenix on Wednesday night to interview the VA office's interim director and visit the facility. Nabors is aiding Shinseki with a review of the allegations, and Obama said he expects a preliminary report from them next week. In addition, Nabors is conducting a broader review of overall VA health care administration, with a deadline to report back to Obama in a month, the President said. For six months, CNN has been reporting on delays in medical appointments for veterans across the country, with some dying or suffering harm while waiting for appointments and care. The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month, with sources revealing to CNN details of a secret waiting list. According to the sources, at least 40 American veterans died in Phoenix while waiting for care at the VA there. An internal VA memo from 2010, first disclosed at a congressional hearing last week, showed officials warned of ""inappropriate scheduling practices"" to cover up excessive waits for veterans four years ago. Problem cited in 2010 . The memo by William Schoenhard, who was a VA deputy undersecretary, referred to a growing practice of ""gaming strategies"" that he said would not be tolerated. However, the CNN investigation shows such practices have continued. One of CNN's sources, Dr. Samuel Foote, a retired VA hospital physician, said Wednesday that VA managers worried about being able to report they were meeting deadlines for providing care to veterans, rather than getting accurate information on what was happening. If the numbers provided to superiors looked good, then the VA looked good, Foote explained, adding, ""There's really no incentive for the upper management to get accurate numbers."" He said, ""I think the VA needs to get out of its delay and deny mode and start admitting that there really is a problem, and that's generally the first step in solving a problem is admitting you have one."" The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to excessive waits by veterans for care, and the VA inspector general launched an independent investigation of the Phoenix allegations and other VA problems in addition to the internal review by Shinseki and Nabors. At a Senate hearing last week, the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix but added there was no evidence that the excessive waiting caused those deaths. More details . Obama sought to provide a more detailed description of the allegations on Wednesday, saying the cooked books and excessive waits applied more to veterans with chronic conditions who are among the 85 million VA appointments each year instead of those needing emergency care. At the same time, he wondered if a 14-day deadline for the VA to provide service to newly registered veterans -- a policy implemented under Shinseki -- was realistic. ""What is not yet clear to me is whether enough tools were given to make sure those goals were actually met,"" Obama said. ""I won't know until the full report is put forward as to whether there was enough management follow up."" On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged the White House learned of the situation at the Phoenix VA from CNN reports in April. Asked Tuesday about the 2010 memo by Schoenhard, Carney refused to answer and instead referred reporters to the VA because it was an internal agency document. The administration's response so far has included putting three Phoenix VA officials on administrative leave; recently accepting the resignation of VA Undersecretary for Health Robert Petzel shortly before he planned to retire this year; appointing Nabors to review VA operations, and the inspector general's independent investigation. Since the initial CNN report, whistleblowers from other VA hospitals have stepped forward to describe similar schemes by officials to hide the extended waits. The chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, GOP Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, called Wednesday for Obama to take executive action to get waiting veterans the help they need. Miller also has threatened to propose a contempt motion against the VA for what he calls its failure to adequately respond to his panel's May 8 subpoena, which included a request for information about the alleged destruction of the secret wait list in Phoenix. Officials have denied any knowledge of it. He called three senior VA officials to a committee business meeting on Thursday to discuss the matter. The VA said earlier this week that it was complying with the request for information. Obama said at his news conference that he wanted Shinseki and the VA to act now to provide care for veterans who have been waiting. Separately, the House overwhelmingly approved legislation proposed by Miller on Wednesday that would make it easier to fire or demote senior executives at Veterans Affairs. The bill would give the VA secretary the authority to remove at any time any of the agency's senior executives based on performance. Currently, executives get at least 30 days' notice of a potential firing and the option of an appeal. Companion legislation has been introduced in the Senate, but its prospects are not clear. Florida problems . Meanwhile, an audit team sent to the Malcom Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida, discovered a list of patients needing follow-up appointments that was kept on paper instead of in the VA's electronic computer system. As a result, three members of the Gainesville VA's supervisory staff have been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of the inspector general's investigation, VA Sunshine Healthcare Network spokeswoman Mary Kay Hollingsworth said this week. The secret waiting list in Phoenix was part of an elaborate scheme designed by VA managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources. Phoenix VA officials denied any knowledge of a secret list, and said they never ordered any staff to hide waiting times. They acknowledged some veterans may have died waiting for care there, but they said they did not have knowledge about why those veterans might have died. CNN has tried repeatedly to interview Shinseki, but the requests have been denied. Rights group calls VA 'scapegoat' in scandal over wait times, care . CNN's Nelli Black, Paul Courson, Scott Bronstein, Deirdre Walsh, Jim Acosta, Virginia Nicolaidis and Becky Brittain contributed to this report, which was written by Tom Cohen in Washington.","Shinseki rescinds 2013 bonus for Phoenix VA director .

"Camden, Maine (CNN) -- Facebook updates and YouTube videos are becoming more important to global affairs than governments, Iceland's president said this week. ""This so-called social media has transformed our democratic institutions in such a way that what takes place in the more traditional institutions of power -- congress, ministries, even the White House or the presidency and the cabinet in my country -- has become almost a sideshow,"" Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, Iceland's president, said in an interview with CNN on Thursday at the PopTech conference here in coastal Maine. ""I know it's a strong statement, especially coming from someone who spent most of his life within those institutions. But the power of the social media is, in my opinion, transforming the political process in such a way that I can't see any chance for the traditional, formal institutions of our democratic systems to keep up."" The statement comes after years of hardship for Iceland, which suffered the collapse of its financial system in 2008 and a massive 2010 volcano eruption that shut down international travel in the region. The country saw widespread political protests during this period, leading Grimsson to say Iceland was the example that Egyptians and now the global Occupy Wall Street movements followed. Grimsson, an even-spoken figure with Bill-Clinton hair and a charming Nordic accent, said protests organized by social media and technological developments are healthy for society, whether or not that offers him much in the way of job security. He sees technological development as a way to move Iceland forward after tragedy. ""Reading was always important to people in Iceland and a literary creativity,"" he said. ""Somehow, with the digital revolution, this interest was transported over to computers, websites, mobile phones and so on. So Iceland now ranks among the top countries in all of these areas, and it has brought forward a new generation of people who are creating companies in these fields."" The country has rebounded significantly since the 2008 meltdown, he said, and that's because Iceland bucked the advice of the international community and decided not to bail out the banks and financial institutions that helped create the foreclosure crisis. ""We are coming out of this crisis earlier and more effectively than I think anyone, including ourselves, could have expected. Iceland is now serving as an interesting example of how you can get out of a very deep financial and economic crisis."" Iceland's unemployment rate dropped to 5.9% in the third financial quarter of this year, down from 8.5% earlier this year. The United States' unemployment rate is higher, at 9.1%, but Iceland's unemployment rate is still up compared to pre-crisis levels, which hovered around 2% to 4 % in 2006 and 2007. A creative spirit helped the country recover, as former bankers found new jobs in other industries that are, on the whole, more helpful for the country, he said. ""One of the lessons is that if you want to grow your economy towards the creative direction of the 21st century, a big banking sector, even if it is successful, is in fact bad news,"" he said. Iceland is also trying to develop itself as a hub for Internet traffic. Grimsson says new data centers -- the computer warehouses that essentially house the Internet -- are coming to Iceland because they can be powered by clean energy, and because the country is a smart linking point between North America and Europe. Underwater broadband cables connect the island nation to both of those continents. ""The climate in Iceland is such that if you want to cool the storage center, to put it simply, you open a window,"" he said, ""whereas 40% of the data center's running costs in other locations is spent on air conditioning. So the operation is much cheaper in Iceland."" He's also using the Internet to promote tourism in his country. A video posted on the site Vimeo shows the president sitting behind a wooden desk and inviting anyone who will listen to come to his house for ""delicious pancakes."" ""It's a great idea because it also displays that the essence of Icelandic society is openness and friendliness,"" he said. ""It's one of those countries that's still assuming that anyone who come comes as a friend until proven otherwise, whereas most of the world is moving in a different direction -- assuming everyone is a threat, until proven otherwise."" The offer for presidential pancakes, by the way, is still on the table for those who act fast; and he'll serve them just the way his grandmother did, ""with cream and jam."" ""I'm not going to open a pancake restaurant,"" he said, laughing. ""I'm just going to do it on a smaller scale.""","Iceland's president: Social media is more powerful than government .

"(CNN) -- Cat poop could be a ""vast and underappreciated"" public health problem, according to Drs. E. Fuller Torrey and Robert H. Yolken. The pair on Tuesday published a paper on the dangers of Toxoplasma oocysts, which are found in cat poop, in the journal Trends in Parasitology. In the journal article, Torrey and Yolken call for better control of the feral cat population and more research on the parasites. In the meantime, CNN asked the doctors how we can keep our families safe. Torrey and Yolken responded to the questions via e-mail. CNN: We've heard that cat poop can be dangerous for pregnant women. Should other people be wary, too? Drs. E. Fuller Torrey and Robert H. Yolken: It is true that some cat poop contains Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite for which cats and other felines are the definitive host. This parasite can affect the fetus if a woman becomes infected while pregnant. That is why pregnant women are warned against changing cat litter. It's also well-known that Toxoplasma gondii can cause major brain infections in individuals with AIDS and other conditions associated with immune deficiency. Chain of cat feces can harm humans, sea otters . So what's new? Recent studies suggest that individuals with disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis or brain tumors are more likely to have Toxoplasma gondii antibodies than other people. There are also suggestions that Toxoplasma gondii can affect memory and other cognitive function in people who are not otherwise ill. In no way have we established Toxoplasma gondii as a cause of these disorders, but it has led us to rethink the possible risks of cat poop. CNN: How big of a risk are we talking about? Torrey and Yolken: There are an estimated 82 million owned cats and another 25 million to 60 million feral cats in the United States, and their numbers have increased markedly in recent years. Based on studies done in California, it is estimated that these cats deposit 1.2 million tons of cat poop into the environment each year. At any given time, approximately 1% of cats are infected with Toxoplasma gondii. The infective form of Toxoplasma gondii deposited in cat poop are called oocysts; a single infected cat can deposit millions of oocysts, each of which may survive in moist soil for 18 months or longer. It's thought that it only takes one oocyst to infect a human, which is concerning. CNN: So what can people do to protect themselves? Torrey and Yolken: It is important to note that cats that are always kept indoors are usually not a problem. Almost all cats that become infected, and thus deposit infective oocysts, are outdoor cats. Keep in mind cats are no respecters of property lines so a neighbor's cat could deposit Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in your garden or children's play areas. Weird science: Kitty litter increases risk of suicide? To stay safe, follow these suggestions: . • Cat litter should be properly disposed of in the garbage, not flushed down the toilet where it can enter rivers and lakes. • Children's sandboxes and play areas should be covered when not in use. Cats selectively relieve themselves in areas with loose soil or sand. In the studies we reviewed, we found very high concentrations of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts in these areas. If a sandbox has not been covered, the sand should be replaced and then kept covered. • Gardeners should wear gloves since gardens are another favorite place for cats to relieve themselves. One study reported that gardeners may have as many as 100 oocysts in dirt under their fingernails. • Vegetables from gardens should be thoroughly washed.

"(CNN) -- When clinging to life at sea, even a non-believer might be moved to pray for salvation. Imagine their surprise then, when on the horizon they see not only a rescue vessel inspired by Pope Francis, but Hollywood star Angelina Jolie. The glamorous actress was the unlikely guest at a naval base in Malta recently, meeting Syrian refugees who had survived deadly boat journeys to Europe. Among them were a couple from Damascus whose three children had died during the crossing, and a doctor from Aleppo whose wife and three-year-old daughter drowned. ""We have to understand what drives people to take the fearful step of risking their children's lives on crowded, unsafe vessels,"" said Jolie, the Special Envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. ""It is the overwhelming desire to find refuge."" As conflict rages in the Middle East, over 130,000 people have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year -- 2,500 of these dying while attempting to cross the Mediterranean, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency. Jolie is not alone in her mission to save them. A wealthy philanthropist couple has backed her campaign, saying: ""The world needs to wake up to the scale of this crisis."" Now they've put their money where their mouths are, launching a state-of-the-art rescue vessel -- inspired by the leader of the Vatican. Sea savior . Introducing the ""Phoenix,"" a 40-meter converted fishing trawler owned by Chris and Regina Catrambone; a couple describing themselves as ""social entrepreneurs,"" who make their money by running an insurance, emergency assistance, and intelligence company. Digging deep into their own pockets, they are spending $445,000 each month on the ship's operating costs. The boat has so far helped over 2,000 migrants crossing the Mediterranean from North African shores -- believed to be the first privately-funded vessel ever to do so. It follows the Pope's visit to the small island of Lampedusa -- where 366 migrants died in shipwreck last year -- where he criticized the ""global indifference"" to the refugee crisis. Just a few weeks ago another migrant boat sank carrying 500 people near Malta, in one of the worst wrecks in the region. ""The words of the Pope, appealing to people to help with their skills, their ability, their free time -- we had to do something,"" said Regina Catrambone, originally from Italy and now living in Malta with her American husband and daughter. ""When you see in the face of a seven-year-old child that they are safe on the boat -- there's no price you can put on that."" While other ships celebrate their maiden voyage with a bottle of champagne, this hefty 483-ton boat was launched with holy water sprinkled by a priest. ""We are normal people that are wealthy, but we are far from millionaires,"" said Regina, adding that the family choose to invest their money in human life, rather than making a profit. ""It's a lot of time, and a lot of energy. But our belief and our faith is the big push."" Reality check . The biggest wake-up call for the couple -- both in their 30s -- came while holidaying on board a luxury yacht in the Mediterranean last summer. ""I saw a winter jacket in the water, and I said to the captain, who is also a retired coast guard of Malta: 'Look isn't it strange,'"" said Regina. ""And his face became very sad, and he told me: 'The person who was wearing this jacket is not with us anymore.'"" The comment struck Regina like a lightning bolt --""it was like 'boom!'"" she said. ""Here we were in this nice boat, when the migrants, people like us, are attempting to cross because there's a war in their country."" Mission improbable? If sending one boat to rescue hundreds of thousands of people seems naÃ¯ve, the project -- called Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS) -- comes with serious credentials. Director of operations, Martin Xuereb, is the former chief of defense of the armed forces of Malta -- the body responsible for search-and-rescue in the area. Along with a crew of 16, including two paramedics, the boat is equipped with two high-tech drones, a medical clinic, 1,000 liters of water, hundreds of life jackets, and food. ""The primary aim is to prevent the loss of life, not ferry migrants,"" says the organization on its website. Once at sea, the Phoenix sends out drones equipped with camcorders to search for migrant boats. The MOAS team then reports back to the nearest authorities and awaits instructions and help. If necessary, it will offer life jackets, medical assistance, and evacuate refugees on board. Captain Filippo Marini, spokesman for the Italian Coastal Guard, would not comment on the merits of the Maltese-based mission, saying: ''They are a resource but it's not up to us to say if it's an appropriate initiative."" The Maltese government was unable to provide a comment on the MOAS mission, despite numerous requests. After recently rescuing nearly 250 people -- including nearly 50 children -- from a leaking wooden boat, the Phoenix later transferred the migrants to an Italian navy ship, where they were taken to Italy and processed by authorities, they said in a statement . ""They were Syrians and Palestinians,"" said Xuereb. ""And talking to these people, one realizes they are fleeing from desperate times,"" he said. ""There were doctors, teachers on board. These are people who, had the situation been different, would never have left their country."" Could a Hollywood star and ""Pope Boat"" be the ones to save them? Perhaps...but their efforts are a drop in a very big ocean. Travel: Is it a bird... or a desert boat?

"(CNN) -- These days, stories about airline crew-member meltdowns and traffic controllers asleep on the job are enough to make even the bravest fliers clutch their armrests a little tighter. But despite these unusual incidents, the U.S. airline industry is enjoying one of the safest periods in its history. ""It's really pretty amazing -- not just the year-to-year safety record -- but when you consider that air travel involves doing some fairly risky things, like flying an aircraft in bad weather and all kinds of conditions,"" says Bill Voss of the Flight Safety Foundation, a nonprofit group focusing on safety research and advocacy. Although regional airline crashes in 2009, 2006, 2004 and 2003 killed 133 people, the most recent deadly U.S. crash of a large airliner was in 2001, when American Airlines Flight 587 went down in Belle Harbor, New York, killing 265. In the 1990s there were at least five fatal mid-size or wide-body domestic airline crashes, and in the '80s there were at least three. ""We've seen a dramatic improvement since the 1990s,"" says Voss. ""Everybody uses different stats, but you used to have probably between one and two accidents per million departures. Last year we were down to well below one accident per million departures."" It's not overstating it to say the nation has entered an unprecedented era of safer skies, according to industry experts including a former National Transportation Safety Board official. A combination of improvements introduced and implemented in the '80s and '90s gets credit -- including innovations in pilot training, better sharing of safety solutions, and technological advances. An electronic on-board system called TCAS, which is aimed at preventing midair collisions, has probably saved countless lives. So has something called ground proximity warning systems, which alert pilots if they're in danger of crashing into the ground when weather makes visibility difficult. Also developed in the past decades: cockpit resource management -- a fancy term for procedures first developed in the 1980s to help flight crews behave and communicate better to avoid circumstances that could have deadly consequences. In last month's JetBlue incident during a flight between New York and Las Vegas, Capt. Clayton Osbon began acting erratically, prompting the co-pilot to lock him out of the cockpit. ""I don't know if 15 years ago whether a co-pilot would have had the guts to trick that captain into getting out of the cockpit,"" says Peter Goelz, former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board. ""That all comes from CRM -- which is saying that everybody's got a responsibility for safety."" ""What was a very hierarchical authority-based crew structure back in the early 1980s has been completely overhauled,"" says Voss.""You have a whole new generation of crews that don't even think the same way anymore. They work as a team together, not just in the cockpit, but with the cabin crew."" Air travelers have benefited from vastly improved satellite and weather prediction technology. Pilots and controllers have much more precise data allowing them to more accurately fly around dangerous storms. But weather data systems aren't infallible. Air France Flight 447, from Brazil to Paris, which crashed into the Atlantic in 2009 killing 228, paid a price, says Goelz, because it flew through a storm, while other aircraft avoided it. Heavy news media coverage of terrible crashes in the '90s, like ValuJet Flight 592 near Miami and TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, ""allowed safety to really go to the top of the agenda in the aviation discussion,"" says Goelz, giving the NTSB more influence to push Washington and the airlines toward more safety improvements. ""Safety is a nonevent which gives you the impression that it doesn't require active effort,"" says Voss, a former FAA official and air traffic controller. ""But it does."" About 731 million U.S. passengers flew in 2011, according to the FAA. The yearly projection for 2032 is 1.2 billion. For that reason alone, there are serious questions about whether the industry can maintain its safety record. The biggest threat, says Voss, would be aggressive budget cutbacks, either on Capitol Hill or in corporate boardrooms. ""Will we have enough money for the infrastructure? Will we have the appropriate number of regulators available to support the growth that we are going to have and keep the brilliant safety record that we have?"" The FAA's plan to improve air traffic efficiency and communication, called NextGen, is the key to safely managing the anticipated surge in passengers, says Goelz. In 2009, a regional air carrier -- Colgan Air Flight 3407 -- crashed near Buffalo, New York, killing 50 people. That tragedy offered the industry a warning about how a shifting economy can affect airline safety, says Voss. ""It was a product of a burst of growth,"" he says. ""Airlines started running out of people to fill seats in the cockpit and in certain circumstances you may see cases where someone is not as qualified or trained or as experienced as you might like being pushed into the (pilot's) seat."" Colgan concluded the crash of the Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 was caused by the crew's ""loss of situational awareness and failure to follow Colgan Air training and procedures."" The FAA has proposed more stringent qualifications for pilots in the wake of that accident. Voss sees ""a very strong correlation between extreme growth pressure and accidents."" As examples he cites air crash upticks in the past decade in Indonesia and Africa. ""All of them were preceded by a sudden boom in the industry,"" says Voss. ""We got a little taste of that with Colgan -- and now the system has settled back down and hopefully we've taken some lessons away from that.""","Experts: The U.S. airline industry has never been safer .

"Paris (CNN) -- French police traded gunfire Saturday in a Strasbourg apartment building with the top suspect in a September supermarket bombing, leaving the 33-year-old man dead and one police officer wounded, prosecutors said. The incident was part of a far-reaching, coordinated counterterrorism operation targeting radical Islamists that led to 10 arrests, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters. A chief focus of Saturday's sweep was Jeremy Sidney, a 33-year-old former convict who at one point ""converted to radical Islam,"" Molins said. The prosecutor said Sidney's DNA was found on a small explosive device thrown September 19 into a kosher supermarket in Sarcelles, outside Paris, wounding one customer. Police officers went Saturday morning to an apartment building in Strasbourg, in eastern France, that was home to one of Sidney's two ""religious wives,"" said Molins. According to preliminary reports, Sidney shot at police as soon as they opened the door -- firing six shots and emptying his .357 Magnum revolver before being killed in an exchange of gunfire. A police officer who was shot in the thorax is expected to survive, said Molins. He credits the officers' bulletproof vests and helmets with preventing more injuries. Inside the man's apartment, police found a female companion with a 6-year-old child and a 1-month-old infant, according to Strasbourg prosecutor Patrick Poirret. The woman was taken into custody as part of the terrorism case, Poirret said. Child welfare workers took custody of the 6-year-old, but the infant was allowed to remain with the woman because she is breastfeeding, Poirret said. Sidney -- who was born in Melun, France -- was sentenced to two years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of drug trafficking, said Molins. French intelligence operatives had been monitoring him since spring -- well before the Sarcelles' attack -- but he had not been questioned by authorities. ""He appeared (to be) a delinquent converted to radical Islam,"" said Molins, who later added that Sidney never trained to fight abroad. A total of 10 people were arrested Saturday across France, as part of the law enforcement operation. One man who was arrested on top of a building in Torcy, about 25 kilometers (16 miles) east of Paris, was armed with a loaded. 22 caliber pistol, Molins said. Authorities can detain the suspects for 96 hours from Saturday morning, at which time they must press charges or release them. All 10 people are being held on suspicion of having links to terrorism, manufacturing deadly explosives, illegal possession of weapons and attempted homicide of police officers. Three of them have criminal records for drug trafficking, theft or violence, according to Molins. ""They are common criminals who started to be radicalized to become radical Islamists and jihadists,"" he said. Police seized a number of items such as ammunition, a list of ""Israelite"" organizations in and around Paris, a publication produced by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, wills, computer equipment and 27,000 euros ($35,000) in cash, the prosecutor added. Saturday's operation targeted members of what Molins called an organized terrorist cell. ""We are dealing with a group of a few people who are in constant contact and are supporting each other on a regular basis,"" he said. French Interior Minister Manuel Valls briefed President Francois Hollande on the operation Saturday. Hollande reiterated his country's determination to protect the French people against all forms of terrorist threats. He praised the action of police and asked Valls to take necessary measures to maintain vigilance, Hollande's office said.

"(CNN) -- A federal court judge on Tuesday ordered Massachusetts officials to provide sex-reassignment surgery for a transsexual prison inmate, after determining that it was the only adequate treatment for the inmate's mental illness. The state's Department of Correction said Michelle Kosilek, previously known as Robert, who is serving a life sentence without parole for murdering his wife in 1990, has a gender identity disorder. She attempted to castrate herself and tried to commit suicide twice while incarcerated in an all-male prison in Norfolk, according to a court order. ""We are very happy with the ruling, of course. We are still reviewing the opinion and we anticipate the Department of Corrections will follow Judge Wolf's order and promptly arrange for Michelle Kosilek to receive her treatment,"" Kosilek's attorney Joseph Sulman said Tuesday. The Chart: Treatment guidelines for Gender Identity Disorder in development . Chief Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled that sex reassignment surgery is the ""only adequate treatment"" for Kosilek, and ""that there is no less intrusive means to correct the prolonged violation of Kosilek's Eighth Amendment right to adequate medical care."" ""This is the first decision in which the court has ordered a prison to provide sex reassignment surgery as the necessary medical treatment for a transsexual inmate,"" said Ben Klein, senior attorney with the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders. But according to court documents, this ruling was not an unfamiliar case for this court. Kosilek's case dates back two decades ago, when she was first incarcerated. According to Francis Cohen, the lead counsel of Kosilek's initial lawsuit, Kosilek did not receive any treatment for her disorder from 1992 to 2002, even though she had repeatedly asked the prison for help. It wasn't until 1999, when Kosilek first filed suit, that the court recognized her medical needs. In 2002, the court found that the Department of Correction had refused to provide Kosilek with the proper medical treatment she needed as had been prescribed by the department's doctors. In that ruling, the court found that the department's refusal was ""rooted in sincere security concerns, and in fear of public and political criticism as well."" That year, Kosilek began to receive necessary medical treatments in the form of psychotherapy and hormone treatments. ""It's quite common that the denial of important medical treatments is based on a bias against transgender people rather than on science,"" Klein said. Miss Universe pageant ends ban on transgender contestants . A 2009 University of California, Irvine study of prison inmates in California found that a transgender inmate is 13 times more likely to be sexually assaulted than the average inmate, adding on to security concerns above medical ones. ""[Kosilek]'s very excited and very, very pleased. She's very glad the court has recognized her need for this surgery,"" Cohen said of her client. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, with all operations, therapy, hormone injections and electrolysis, the cost of sex reassignment surgery can range from $30,000 to $80,000. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, said in a statement Tuesday that the court's decision is ""an outrageous abuse of taxpayer dollars. ... I look forward to common sense prevailing and the ruling being overturned."" The court ruling left it up to the Department of Correction to decide where Kosilek will be incarcerated after the surgery.

"(CNN) -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano on Friday canceled the controversial virtual fence along the U.S. border with Mexico, citing technical problems, cost overruns and schedule delays since its inception in 2005. The Secure Border Initiative-network, a high-tech surveillance system to reduce border smuggling, so far has cost taxpayers almost $1 billion for two regions in Arizona, covering just 53 miles overall on the 2,000-mile border, according to a homeland security report. Napolitano announced ""a new path forward for security technology"" along the border that is tailored to the needs of each region and provides ""faster deployment of technology, better coverage, and a more effective balance between cost and capability,"" she said in a prepared statement. ""There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution to meet our border technology needs,"" Napolitano said about her decision to end the problem-plagued virtual fence. Her new plan would use mobile surveillance systems, drones, thermal imaging devices, and tower-based remote video surveillance, she said. ""Where appropriate, this plan will also incorporate already existing elements of the former SBInet program that have proven successful, such as stationary radar, and infrared and optical sensor towers,"" Napolitano said. Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, lauded the decision. ""The secretary's decision to terminate SBInet ends a long-troubled program that spent far too much of the taxpayers' money for the results it delivered,"" Lieberman said in a written statement. ""From the start, SBInet's one-size-fits-all approach was unrealistic. The department's decision to use technology based on the particular security needs of each segment of the border is a far wiser approach, and I hope it will be more cost effective."" Rep. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Mississippi, ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said the virtual fence ""has been a grave and expensive disappointment since its inception."" Thompson said he is glad that homeland security officials are ""finally listening to what we have been saying for years -- that the sheer size and variations of our borders show us a one-stop solution has never been best,"" he said in a prepared statement. ""I applaud them for taking this critical step toward using a more tailored technologically based approach to securing our nation's borders."" The decision ends the work of federal contractor Boeing to build the virtual fence, and the homeland security agency will conduct open bidding for the new border plan, agency officials said. Boeing spokeswoman Jenna K. McMullin said in a statement that the firm remains ""committed to providing valuable solutions and supporting"" the federal agency. ""We appreciate that they recognize the value of the integrated fixed towers Boeing has built, tested, and delivered so far,"" McMullin said. ""We are proud of the accomplishments of our team and of the unprecedented capabilities delivered in the last year that provide Border Patrol agents increased safety, situational awareness, and operational efficiency."" Napolitano said ""unprecedented"" manpower, infrastructure and resources along the border will complement her new border security plan. The U.S. Border Patrol is better staffed than at any time in its 86-year history, having nearly doubled the number of agents from approximately 10,000 in 2004 to more than 20,500 in 2010, according to a homeland security report. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has increased the number of federal agents deployed to the Southwest border, with a quarter of its personnel currently in the region. President Obama has also deployed 1,200 National Guardsmen to the border. In fiscal years 2009 and 2010, federal agents seized more than $282 million in illegal currency, more than 7 million pounds of drugs, and more than 6,800 weapons along the border -- increases of more than $73 million, more than 1 million pounds of drugs and more than 1,500 weapons compared with 2007-2008. Also, the Border Patrol's nationwide apprehensions of undocumented immigrants decreased from nearly 724,000 in 2008 to about 463,000 in 2010, a 36 percent reduction, indicating that fewer people are attempting to illegally cross the border, a homeland security report said.","Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano cites cost overruns and technical problems .

"(CNN) -- The fate of Darren Wilson -- the Ferguson, Missouri, police officer who killed Michael Brown -- is heading to a jury. But it may not be what you think. For the first time Wednesday -- after 11 days of often emotional, sometimes violent protests demanding ""justice"" in the form of formal charges against Wilson -- his case could move to court. Yet, in stark contrast to the media frenzy on the streets of Ferguson in the aftermath of Brown's death, cameras won't be allowed into the courtroom. As activists stress the need for transparency, these proceedings will be secret. Here are a few things to know about how the grand jury system should work as it pertains to this case and others in Missouri. Is the grand jury the only way that a person can be charged with a crime? No. In fact, it's not the way most people are charged with crimes. It's used by prosecutors only in a small percentage of cases. Authorities can file a criminal complaint, which could then lead to a probable cause hearing in court. Such a proceeding is open to the public and media. That's not the case with a grand jury proceeding. So it's closed to the public? Yes. And that doesn't sit well with Brown's family. ""It's about transparency,"" family lawyer Benjamin Crump told CNN. ""This community has a distrust for the local enforcement officials. So if you have a secret grand jury proceeding, where nobody knows what the prosecutor presents ... and the grand jury comes back and says we find this (shooting) justified, I think that's going to be very problematic for this community to accept."" Still, while they might not like it, the Brown camp's opposition to the secretive grand jury process won't open it up. This may be convenient for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch given the intense public pressure on the case, said veteran criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos. ""He's already, I think, kind of punted this over to the grand jury,"" said Geragos, a CNN legal analyst. ""So that (if) they don't bring an indictment, he can say 'well, it's out of my hands.' The members of the community said that there is no crime here."" How is a grand jury picked? Just like any other jury. Citizens get a summons in the mail telling them to come to court. If they make the cut, they are on a grand jury. In this case, the jurors will come from St. Louis County, Missouri. How many people are on a grand jury? In Missouri, it's 12 people. (The number might be different in other cases.) Does their decision have to be unanimous for a charge to be filed? No. It's true that, in a criminal trial, all jurors must agree to convict someone on a given charge. But in Missouri only nine jurors -- or three-fourths of the grand jury -- have to agree. So what are the grand jurors deciding? According to the Missouri state attorney general's office, a grand jury is looking at two things. One, was a crime committed? Two, is there probable cause that the accused -- in this case Officer Darren Wilson -- committed the crime. It is very significant that this is a lower standard than for a criminal trial. In that case, jurors must decide if someone is guilty of a crime ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""Probable cause"" isn't as stringent. Is the process overseen by a judge? No. As Neil Bruntrager, a criminal defense lawyer and general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officer Association explains, it's just the grand jurors, the prosecutors and the witnesses. That means no judge or defense lawyers. ""The prosecutor simply presents the information that they have,"" Bruntrager explains. Does that mean the accused can't present a defense? Yes and no. First off, unlike during a regular trial, defense lawyers can't rebut the prosecution or cross-examine a witness. It's the prosecutors who present their case, without interruption. That doesn't mean that the voice of the accused isn't heard. As the attorney general notes, ""defendants do not attend unless they are testifying as witnesses."" Since Darren Wilson witnessed what happened on August 9 as much, if not better, than anyone else alive, he might be invited to testify in court. ""Usually an accused will not be invited to testify,"" Bruntrager told CNN. ""But I would expect, in a case like this, that an invitation would be extended to him."" What will the prosecution present to the grand jury? In a word, everything. Just take McCulloch's word for it, according to the Wall Street Journal: ""Absolutely everything will be presented to the grand jury. Every scrap of paper that we have. Every photograph that was taken."" Will McCulloch himself present the case? Ed Magee, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the prosecution will be ""handled by the attorney regularly assigned to the grand jury. It will not be by Mr. McCulloch."" So how long will this process take? A grand jury could indict some one as early as tomorrow. But that doesn't mean it's going to happen that fast. In fact, it could be weeks or months. After all, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder has said the Justice Department -- conducting a parallel federal civil rights investigation into this case -- has interviewed hundreds of potential witnesses. There's no reason to believe local authorities haven't similarly conducted lots of interviews and collected various pieces of evidence to sort through and present to the grand jury. Doing so should take some time. 5 things to know about the shooting . Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests .

"(CNN) -- The United States will not accept North Korea as a ""nuclear state,"" Secretary of State John Kerry warned on Tuesday, just hours after Pyongyang announced plans to restart a nuclear reactor it shut down five years ago. North Korea's decision comes as tensions on the Korean peninsula escalate over Kim Jong Un's threats to wage war against the United States and South Korea. ""The bottom line is simply that what Kim Jong Un is choosing to do is provocative. It is dangerous, reckless. The United States will not accept the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) as a nuclear state,"" Kerry said during a joint briefing in Washington with South Korea Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. ""And I reiterate again the United States will do what is necessary to defend ourselves and defend our allies, Korea and Japan. We are fully prepared and capable of doing so, and I think the DPRK understands that."" North Korea's declaration that it would reopen the reactor demonstrates Kim's commitment to the country's nuclear weapons program that the international community has tried to persuade it to abandon. The North's state-run Korean Central News Agency, KCNA, reported that the reclusive state's atomic energy department intends to ""readjust and restart all the nuclear facilities"" at its main nuclear complex, in Yongbyon. Those facilities include a uranium enrichment facility and a reactor that was ""mothballed and disabled"" under an agreement reached in October 2007 during talks among North Korea, the United States and four other nations, KCNA said. The announcement was followed by a plea for calm from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who is South Korean. North Korean defectors return rhetorical fire . ""The current crisis has already gone too far,"" he said in a statement from Andorra. ""Nuclear threats are not a game. Aggressive rhetoric and military posturing only result in counteractions, and fuel fear and instability. ""Things must begin to calm down, as this situation, made worse by the lack of communication, could lead down a path that nobody should want to follow."" Ban said dialogue and negotiations are ""the only way to resolve the current crisis."" The tensions on the Korean Peninsula have led Pyongyang to sever a key military hot line with Seoul and declare void the 1953 armistice that stopped the Korean War. The United States has made a show of its military strength amid annual training exercises with South Korea, flying B-2 stealth bombers capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, Cold War-era B-52s and F-22 Raptor stealth fighters over South Korea. On Tuesday, the United States positioned a second destroyer -- the USS Decatur -- near the Korean peninsula, a defense official said on condition of anonymity. The official was not authorized to release details to the media. A day earlier, the U.S Navy moved a warship and a sea-based radar platform closer to the North Korean coast in order to monitor that country's military moves, including possible new missile launches, the Defense Department said Monday. North Korea on Wednesday also blocked more than 480 South Korean workers from entering the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Complex, which sits on the North Korea side of the border, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry. ""North Korea said today that it is only approving people to go back to South Korea and not approving entrance"" to the complex, said Kim Hyung-seok, a spokesman for the ministry. He urged the North to resume letting workers enter. There are 861 South Koreans inside Kaesong at the moment, the ministry said, and 446 have registered to leave. The symbol of an era of better relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, Kaesong is a joint economic cooperation zone between the two Koreas where scores of South Korean companies operate. It also is an important source of hard currency for the North. The move comes after threats in recent days by Pyongyang to shut down the industrial complex. Seoul, meanwhile, on Monday warned that any provocative moves from North Korea would trigger a strong response ""without any political considerations."" U.S. moves warship, sea-based radar to watch North Korea . Murky motivation . The motivation behind the North's announcement Tuesday on the nuclear facilities was unclear, said Ramesh Thakur, director of the Center for Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament at Australian National University in Canberra, suggesting that it was unlikely to make a big difference militarily for the country, which is already believed to have four to 10 nuclear weapons. The North Koreans may be hoping to use the move as a bargaining chip in any future talks, he said, or it could be an attempt by the country's young leader to shore up support domestically. ""It's just a very murky situation,"" Thakur said. ""The danger is that we can misread one another and end up with a conflict that no one wants."" China, a key North Korean ally, expressed regret over Pyongyang's announcement about the reactor. ""China has consistently advocated denuclearization on the peninsula and maintaining peace and stability in the region,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hong Lei said Tuesday at a regular news briefing. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the move would need to be dealt with in a serious manner, noting that it breached the North's previous commitments. On Tuesday, Kerry refused to speculate about North Korea's intentions or what its strategy may be with regard to its plans to reopen its reactor. ""We've heard an extraordinary amount of unacceptable rhetoric from the North Korean government in the last days. So let me be perfectly clear here today: The United States will defend and protect ourselves, and our treaty ally, the Republic of Korea,"" he said. Kerry reiterated the U.S. policy with regard to North Korea, saying the United States believes there is ""a very simple way"" for Pyongyang to end the sanctions by ending its nuclear ambitions. Kerry was scheduled to visit Seoul next week, while South Korea's president was due in Washington for talks with President Barack Obama. South Korea warns North of 'strong response' to any attack . A torrent of threats . The North's latest declaration comes after a stream of verbal attacks against South Korea and the United States in recent weeks, including the threat of a nuclear strike. Pyongyang's angry words appear to have been fueled by the recent joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea in the region, as well as tougher U.N. sanctions in response to North Korea's latest nuclear test in February. Much of the bellicose rhetoric, analysts say, isn't matched by the country's military capabilities. Nuclear weapons: Who has what? The North's announcement Tuesday follows a new strategic line ""on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of the nuclear armed force."" It was announced Sunday during a meeting of a key committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea headed by Kim Jong Un. The work of adapting and restarting the nuclear facilities ""will be put into practice without delay,"" KCNA said. The measures would help solve ""the acute shortage of electricity,"" as well as improving the ""quality and quantity"" of the country's nuclear arsenal, it said. Threats of annihilation normal for South Koreans . Yongbyon's back story . In June 2008, the usually secretive North Korean government made a public show of destroying the cooling tower of the Yongbyon reactor to demonstrate its compliance with a deal to disable its nuclear facilities. But two months later, as its then-leader, Kim Jong Il, balked at U.S. demands for close inspections of its nuclear facilities, the North started to express second thoughts. It said it was suspending the disabling of its nuclear facilities and considering steps to restore the facilities at Yongbyon ""to their original state."" In November 2009, it announced it was reprocessing nuclear fuel rods as part of measures to resume activities at Yongbyon. It noted success in turning the plutonium it had extracted into weapons-grade material. OPINION: Why Kim Jong Un is not crazy . CNN's K.J.

"(CNN) -- Former President Clinton published a list of donors to his foundation Thursday to help clear the way for his wife to become secretary of state. Bill Clinton speaks to at the Clinton Global Initiative conference in Hong Kong in early December. The donations to the William J. Clinton Foundation include amounts of $10 million to $25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of Clinton's. The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. Bill Clinton agreed to the release the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become secretary of state. The governments of Kuwait and Qatar are also on the list, as is Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi, reputed to be one of the richest men in the world, is among the donors as well. Both Saudis contributed in the $1 million to $5 million range. A group called Friends of Saudi Arabia and the Dubai Foundation appear in the same category. Indian businessman Lakshmi Mittal also donated between $1 million and $5 million, as did the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Princess Diana Memorial Fund and the Open Society Institute, which George Soros founded. Israeli-born television mogul Haim Saban, owner of the Spanish-language TV station Univision, donated between $5 million and $10 million personally or through his foundation. The two biggest donors are UNITAID, a new international organization that purchases drugs for the world's poorest people, and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, both of which donated more than $25 million. Clinton donated between $500,000 and $1 million personally or through his family foundation, which is separate from the William J. Clinton Foundation. The foundation's projects include the Clinton Global Initiative, which seeks to combat poverty and climate change and promote health and education programs worldwide, as well as separate initiatives directed at childhood obesity, global warming, HIV/AIDS and malaria, inner city entrepreneurship and economic growth in Latin America.

"(CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, saying he abused his power by trying to pressure a district attorney to resign. The two felony counts against Perry, a Republican, stem from his threat to veto funding for a statewide public integrity unit run by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg unless she stepped down, the special prosecutor in the case, Michael McCrum, said. Perry attorney David L. Botsford called the indictment a ""political abuse of the court system."" He said the action ""violated the separation of powers"" and ""sets a dangerous precedent by allowing a grand jury to punish the exercise of a lawful and constitutional authority afforded to the Texas governor."" CNN affiliate KVUE reported that Perry will have to report to the Travis County Jail in the capital of Austin to be booked, fingerprinted and have his photo made for a mugshot. Perry can continue to serve as governor while under indictment, KVUE reported. His attorneys could seek to have the charges thrown out, a motion that would delay the case, at the very least. The grand jury in Travis County indicted the governor on charges of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity. Read the indictment (PDF) The charges have serious political implications, both in Texas and beyond. Perry is entering his final few months in office after a historic 14-year run in Austin. The Republican running to replace Perry is state Attorney General Greg Abbott, who will have to answer questions about the legal drama. Abbott is facing off against Democratic star Wendy Davis, whose campaign is already making hay of Friday's news. Perry's presidential prospects could be damaged. It's an open secret he's laying groundwork for a second presidential campaign after his disastrous 2012 effort. The governor has positioned himself as an early conservative alternative to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, another GOP presidential contender. Perry is scheduled to visit the early primary states of New Hampshire and South Carolina in the coming weeks to meet with Republican activists and legislators. According to McCrum, the indictment alleges that the circumstances around Perry's veto threat amounted to a misuse of state money earmarked by the Legislature to fund the public integrity unit in Travis County run by Lehmberg. The second charge alleges that he improperly used the veto threat to get her to resign following her arrest on a drunk driving charge. She stayed in office. ""I'm ready to go forward (in) my task as district attorney. In this case, the grand jury has spoken and I'm going forward to carry out the duties that have been bestowed upon me,"" McCrum said. ""I feel confident about the charges that have been filed,"" he added. Mary Anne Wiley, general counsel for Perry's office, said the ""veto in question was made in accordance"" with the authority ""afforded to every governor"" under the state's constitution. ""We will continue to aggressively defend the governor's lawful and constitutional action, and believe we will ultimately prevail,"" Wiley said in a statement. Political opponents of Perry, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, urged him to resign. ""Governor Rick Perry has brought dishonor to his office, his family and the state of Texas,"" the Texas Democratic Party said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- Even the Pope was one of Eli Wallach's biggest fans. So said the cheeky chameleon of an actor when he received an honorary Oscar in 2010 and remarked that the pontiff -- he didn't say which one -- wrote him a fan letter extolling his performance as the bandito Calvera in ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960). This struck Wallach as odd. ""I've played more bandits, thieves, killers, warlords, molesters and Mafiosi than you can shake a stick at,"" he said. No doubt he got a pass from the Pope because as the bad guy, the famed character actor, who died Tuesday at 98, had a smile as lethal as his aim. The most beloved of his screen roles were as Calvera in ""Magnificent Seven"" and Tuco, the opportunistic robber, who was sometimes an ally but more often the adversary of Clint Eastwood in the 1966 Sergio Leone spaghetti Western ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."" But surely Wallach, a prolific actor who made more than 50 films and almost as many television appearances, possessed the universal blood type. His screen niche was the American ethnic. In addition to Hispanics, his characters included Arabs, Greeks, Italians and Poles. He appeared in films large and small, from ""The Misfits"" (1961), where he played a mechanic besotted by Marilyn Monroe, to ""Baby Doll,"" his 1956 screen debut as Silva Vacarro, the wily cotton planter who aims to deflower his rival's virgin bride, Carroll Baker. Sometimes he was the lead, more often the supporting player. But when Wallach was on screen, you forgot that Eastwood, Clark Gable or Ben Stiller was next to him. Occasionally the sinewy Wallach-- born to a Jewish family in 1915 in what then was the predominantly Italian-American neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn -- played a Jew. Like the rabbi who helps convert Gentile Jenna Elfman so she can marry Stiller in ""Keeping the Faith"" (2000). And the aging screenwriter who befriends Kate Winslet in ""The Holiday"" (2006). Though he made more than 50 films, Wallach treated movies as a way to finance his work in theater: ""I don't live to act, I act to live,"" he said. Indeed, he was set to make his film debut as Maggio, the character Frank Sinatra ultimately played in ""From Here to Eternity,"" in 1953 (Sinatra won an Oscar). Instead, he chose to appear on stage in ""Camino Real."" He was a founding member of The Actors Studio and appeared in 30 Broadway plays. Among his triumphs were Tennessee Williams' ""The Rose Tattoo"" (1951) and ""Camino Real"" (1953); the latter earned him a Tony Award. Among his personal triumphs: Wallach and his wife, actress Anne Jackson, with whom he often appeared on stage from the 1960s through 1990s, were married 66 years. (The secret of their marital longevity, claimed Jackson, was that her husband did the ironing.) A captivating storyteller who first gained attention as a student at the Actors Studio for his monologues about his time as an Army medic in World War II clearing soldiers out of brothels, Wallach was beloved by directors and co-stars as much for his humor as his professionalism. In his 2005 memoir, ""The Good, the Bad and Me."" he claimed that the role of Mr. Freeze, the subzero doctor who turns adversaries into ice in the 1960s TV show ""Batman,"" was responsible for the largest percentage of his fan mail. Nothing else came close, not even his role of dapper Don Altobello in ""The Godfather, Part III."" He continued working well into his 90s, in roles such as the liquor-store proprietor in ""Mystic River"" (2003) and a financial bigwig in ""Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps"" (2010), his last movie. And Wallach left 'em laughing: When he received his honorary Oscar in 2010, he told the joke about the nonagenarian whose friends send a hooker to house for his birthday. When she arrives, and promises the man ""super sex,"" he says, ""I guess I'll take the soup.""","Carrie Rickey: The late charactor actor Eli Wallach told a story that the Pope sent him a fan letter .

"(CNN) -- When crudely drawn animated shorts about a dysfunctional American family began appearing on Fox's ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987, nobody predicted the birth of a cultural phenomenon. But Wednesday marks the 25th anniversary of ""The Simpsons,"" which debuted as a half-hour sitcom on December 17, 1989. That's 561 episodes and counting -- and a lot of D'ohs! and donuts. To commemorate this milestone, here are 25 random facts about the show: . 1. Creator Matt Groening named the characters after his own family members but substituted ""Bart"" for his own name. 2. The characters' distinctive yellow hue was chosen in part to make the show stand out when someone was flipping through TV channels for something to watch. 3. It took Danny Elfman three days to compose the show's opening theme song. He's called it the most popular piece of music of his career. 4. Its town of Springfield was named for its generic Anywhereness (there are Springfields in 30 U.S. states). Over various episodes, the town's geography has contained rivers, deserts, farmland, mountains or whatever the story requires. 5. Time magazine named it the best TV show of the 20th century. 6. Bart is voiced by a woman, Nancy Cartwright. In an opening sequence during the show's second season, Bart wrote on the chalkboard, ""I am not a 32-year-old woman"" (Cartwright's age at the time). 7. Dustin Hoffman had an uncredited speaking role in the show's second season, playing Lisa's kindly substitute teacher Mr. Bergstrom. Hoffman wasn't sure he wanted to be identified with a cartoon show at the time, so he chose the name ""Sam Etic"" in the closing credits -- a play on the word semitic, alluding to the fact that he and Mr. Bergstrom are Jewish. 8. An official version of Duff beer, Homer's favorite brew, is sold in three variations near The Simpsons Ride at Universal Studios. 9. In the show's early-'90s heyday, school principals around the country banned Bart Simpson T-shirts, fearing he was a bad role model. 10. Of Krusty the Clown's resemblance to Homer, Groening once said: ""The satirical conceit that I was going for at the time was that 'The Simpsons' was about a kid who had no respect for his father but worshiped a clown who looked exactly like his father."" 11. The University of California-Berkeley has offered a for-credit course on ""The Simpsons."" The 'Simpsons' comedy tree . 12. During a speech in 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, ""We are going to keep on trying to ... make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons."" In response, the show's writers rushed out a short segment soon after in which Bart said, ""Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too."" 13. Harry Shearer said he modeled the voice of wicked tycoon Mr. Burns in part on that of Ronald Reagan. 14. In an episode that aired in 2003, Homer gave his email address as ChunkyLover53@aol.com. The episode's writer, Matt Selman, signed up for the ChunkyLover53 email address beforehand and within minutes of the show's airing found his inbox packed to its 999-message limit. 15. The show earned guest star Anne Hathaway a Primetime Emmy for outstanding voice-over performance. 16. Groundskeeper Willie's description of the French as ""cheese-eating surrender monkeys"" was used by conservative columnists in 2003 after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. 17. An episode during the fourth season featured guest star Elizabeth Taylor voicing a single word: Maggie's first word, spoken during a flashback. The word? ""Daddy."" 18. Michael Jackson guest-starred as a mental patient during a third-season episode, ""Stark Raving Dad,"" in which Homer Simpson is sent to a mental institution. For contractual reasons, he was credited as John Jay Smith. 19. In 2010, elusive street artist Banksy created a darkly subversive montage for the opening sequence that showed children and animals slaving in a hellish underground sweatshop to produce ""Simpsons"" memorabilia. Of the bold move, ""Simpsons"" showrunner Al Jean told the New York Times: ""Well, I haven't been fired yet, so that's a good sign."" Is it time for 'The Simpsons' to 'g'oh'? 20. Veteran actor Hank Azaria supplies the voice for 16 recurring characters, including Moe the bartender, Chief Wiggum and convenience store owner Apu. 21. Exiled WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange guest-starred as himself on an episode in the show's 23rd season. He recorded his lines over the phone from the Ecuadorian embassy in Britain, where he has been granted asylum. 22. At one point, ""The Simpsons Movie,"" a hit in 2007, was planned as a musical. 23. Homer's signature ""D'oh!"" has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary, and an expression he frequently uses has inspired a much-quoted toast: ""To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems."" 24. Among the celebrities who have turned down guest-starring roles on the show, according to creators' comments on the DVDs, are Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Michael Caine, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood, Anthony Hopkins, Quentin Tarantino and Prince. 25. Showrunner Al Jean told The Onion's AV Club in August that if the series ever ends, he would like the final episode to end with the arrival of the Christmas pageant from the first scene of the pilot episode ""Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire,"" making the whole series a continuous loop.","The first episode of ""The Simpsons"" aired on Fox on December 17, 1989 .

"Washington (CNN) -- MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber apologized Tuesday for his ""glib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting comments"" about Obamacare and the intelligence of American voters. Gruber, who had tremendous influence in shaping the Affordable Care Act, came under fire last month after newly unearthed videos showed him suggesting that Democrats purposefully misled Americans while passing the President's signature health care law. ""I would like to begin by apologizing sincerely for the offending comments that I made,"" he said in his testimony before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. ""I sincerely apologize both for conjecturing with a tone of expertise and for doing so in such a disparaging fashion,"" Gruber added. ""It is never appropriate to try to make oneself seem more important or smarter by demeaning others. I know better. I knew better. I am embarrassed, and I am sorry."" Years-old but newly surfaced video show Gruber saying the legislation was drafted amd sold to the public in a way that masked the penalty for not getting health insurance, so that voters wouldn't consider it a tax. Calling the plan a ""clever"" and ""basic exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the American voter,"" Gruber hailed how the measure passed ""because the American people are too stupid to understand the difference."" While Gruber has previously described himself as an ""architect"" of Obamacare, he sharply denied the label on Tuesday, arguing that his role in the legislation has been inflated in the past. Still, he helped create the health care law in Massachusetts under then Gov. Mitt Romney, and went on to play a key role in crafting the idea behind the series of exchanges, subsidies and taxes that form the federal law's centerpiece. Both Democrats and Republicans hounded Gruber during the hearing. House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa blasted his initial comments as an ""insult"" to voters, while ranking member Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee, slammed Gruber's remarks as ""absolutely stupid"" and ""irresponsible."" Cummings added that he was ""extremely frustrated"" because it ""gave Republicans a public relations gift in their relentless political campaign to tear down the ACA."" At one point, Rep. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming referenced her recently deceased husband to issue a sharp warning to Gruber. Her husband, she said, was having chest pains, but due to confusion over whether the couple was covered by Obamacare, he didn't have all the tests the doctor recommended. He died from a heart attack in his sleep Oct. 24. ""The so-called glibness that has been referenced today have direct consequences for real American people, so get over your damn glibness,"" Lummis said. While he regretted his initial comments, Gruber did not deny the substance of the arguments he was making about the legislation. He also drew ire from lawmakers when he confirmed that he was paid nearly $400,000 for his work on the health care law but said he could not recall how much he received for other federal and state contracts -- a sum estimated to be in the millions. Issa and Republican members of the committee threatened to subpoena Gruber for that information. ""It is very clear we're going to have to do more discovery,"" Issa said at the end of the hearing. While Gruber conceded that he ""behaved badly,"" he defended the Affordable Care Act as a significant law that benefits the public. ""My own inexcusable arrogance is not a flaw in the Affordable Care Act.""","Jonathan Gruber appeared before a House hearing on Tuesday .

"Constitucion, Chile (CNN)  -- The only thing that seemed to frighten Pedro Munoz that dark morning was that a guilty conscience would haunt him if he did nothing. He'd been a fisherman all his life and was familiar with the fury of the sea. Still, he chose to sail into the oncoming tsunami, sacrificing his own life so others could live. Tabita Bravo sits on a riverbank, perching on the side of a 15-foot wooden boat like her husband's. It's a struggle to hear her small voice above the sound of waves rolling over the pebbles. ""My husband always said to me that if God took him before his time, that he hoped it would be doing something for his town and his people,"" Bravo said. Bravo had been camping with her 54-year-old husband, her 20-year-old son, Luis Anabalon, and family friend Juan Padilla on an island in the River Maule. The island is a few hundred yards from the ocean and closer still to the town of Constitucion. It was a tradition here to camp out on the island in the closing days of the Southern Hemisphere's summer. The family was asleep, and scores more were camping nearby when they were awakened by the massive quake about 3.30 a.m. local time February 27. Munoz took one look as the river began to rapidly ebb and knew that a tsunami was on its way. ""Pedro and my son dragged the boat down to the water line and shouted 'Women and children first!' I ran to get everybody together. But the boat was too small, and there was not enough space for everybody,"" Bravo explained. Bravo refused a spot on the first boat. She, her son and Padilla helped load four women and their six young children aboard. A first wave came rolling in, and Munoz ferried the first group out of harm's way. He shouted that he would be back. Just before the second wave hit, Munoz sailed the 400-yard round trip and departed the island a second time, taking his wife and nine others. His stepson and friend stayed behind to organize the others still stranded. Time was running out as the tsunami waters rose. ""As I looked back, I heard screams and laments,"" Bravo said. ""I shouted to my son Luis to run to the trees and climb up. He shouted back, 'I'm OK, Mum. Never forget I love you. I love you.' "" Witnesses say Munoz saved at least 20 people in two trips. His wife begged him not to go back and instead head for higher ground. But a neighbor appeared and begged Munoz to make a third and final trip. ""He said, don't worry, he'd be back. But he said, if he didn't make it, then that's God's will,"" Bravo said. ""He said if he didn't try to rescue more people, then he'd always have it on his conscience."" Those were Munoz's last words to his wife. She waited for him by a bridge until the water levels forced her to flee to high ground. ""I heard the third wave coming and destroying everything in its path. I heard ships' moorings snap. I ran up the hill, and when I looked back, I realized Pedro, Luis and Juan were gone. I knew I'd never see them again."" Bravo said. Inhabitants of Constitucion found Munoz's body six days later. He had been dragged 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) into the thick forests that line the banks of the River Maule. Debris and bits of houses litter the forests. Three fishing boats, each about 70 tons, lie battered and beached there, too. A short bit away, the digging arm of a bright yellow backhoe can be seen jutting out of the water. On the opposite side of the river, the back of a cement truck rises just above the water level. If the tsunami has destroyed those objects, each weighing many tons, one can't even begin to imagine how Pedro Munoz must have battled to keep his 15-foot skiff on course. There's no record of the names of the 20 women and children whom witnesses say Munoz saved that morning. Events unfolded too fast, and the situation was too desperate to make a note. The tsunami has wiped out most of Tabita Bravo's physical reminders of her marriage to Munoz, too. She clutches just three damp photos she rescued from the sludge. But she will never forget. ""I always knew Pedro was a hero. Now, the memories are in my heart,"" she said.","Pedro Munoz was camping on island in river when earthquake struck .
He made two trips in his boat to save at least 20 people .
""He said, if he didn't make it, then that's God's will,"" widow says ."
"Washington (CNN) -- A senior Iranian naval official says Iran is sending warships toward U.S. maritime borders to send a message, a move a U.S. defense official characterized as an announcement, not a deployment. ""Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message,"" Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Saturday. The plan, according to Fars, is a response to the United States beefing up its naval presence in the Persian Gulf. The U.S. 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain. Haddad said the Iranian fleet was under way and approaching the Atlantic Ocean ""via the waters near South Africa,"" a claim that has not been confirmed. It's not the first time Iran has made such a threat, said the U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""It's important to understand that, at this point, we have an announcement not a deployment. They've stated this aspiration before,"" said the defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. In 2011, Iran twice announced plans to send ships toward the U.S. maritime borders. ""Freedom of the seas doesn't just apply to fish. It applies to all maritime nations, all navies, everywhere -- so long as they understand the responsibilities which come with that freedom,"" the defense official said. ""So if they chose to send their ships to the Atlantic, I'm sure they won't be surprised to find many, many others already there.""

"(CNN) -- A nurse with Ebola may have shown symptoms of the virus as many as four days before authorities once indicated, meaning that she might have been contagious while flying on not just one, but two commercial flights, officials said Thursday. Amber Vinson was hospitalized Tuesday, one day after she took a Frontier flight from Cleveland to Dallas. Tests later found that Vinson -- who was among those who cared for Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital -- had Ebola. Authorities indicated Vinson had a slightly elevated temperature of 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit, which was below the fever threshold for Ebola, but didn't show any symptoms of the disease while on her Monday flight. This is significant because a person isn't contagious with Ebola, which spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids, until he or she has symptoms of the disease. But on Thursday, Dr. Chris Braden of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters in Ohio that ""we have started to look at the possibility that she had symptoms going back as far as Saturday. ... We can't rule out (that) she might have had the start of her illness on Friday."" ""So this new information now is saying we need to go back now to the flight that she took on Friday the 10th and include them in our investigation of contacts,"" said Braden. The CDC announced later Thursday that is ""expanding its outreach to airline passengers now to include those who flew from Dallas-Fort Worth to Cleveland on Frontier flight 1142"" last Friday -- which is how Vinson got to Ohio, from Texas, originally. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? The medical director in Summit County, Ohio, where Vinson spent time before returning to Texas, told CNN that two things have changed: what the CDC defines as a ""contact"" of someone with Ebola and more information has been gathered on how Vinson was feeling. ""What the CDC has discovered, through interviews, is that she may not have been feeling well earlier than we initially thought on (Monday),"" said the director, Dr. Marguerite Erme. ""... It was nothing you could point your finger at and say, 'Ah, this is a particular disease,"" Erme added. Nonetheless, the new information ""kind of signified that maybe she had the illness longer than what she had when (hospitalized)."" Her uncle, Lawrence Vinson, said Thursday night that his niece didn't feel sick until Tuesday morning, when she went to the hospital with a temperature of 100.3 degrees (which is still below the CDC's Ebola threshold). Yet a federal official with direct knowledge of the case gave different information to CNN's Elizabeth Cohen, relating that Vinson said she felt fatigue, muscle ache and malaise while she was in Ohio. She did not have diarrhea or vomiting while in that state or on the flight home. The fact health officials are working from this latter assumption -- that Vinson may have been ill for longer than once thought -- could significantly expand the number of people who might have been in contact with Vinson while she was contagious. Earlier, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden had said there's an ""extremely low"" risk to anyone on Frontier's Cleveland-to-Dallas flight, though his agency was reaching out to all 132 passengers as part of ""extra margins of safety."" Frontier is also grounding its six crew members for 21 days -- the maximum time between when a person can contract Ebola and show symptoms -- out of what its CEO says is ""an abundance of caution."" Frontier now says it is notifying up to 800 passengers total, a figure that includes those on last Friday's Dallas-to-Cleveland flight, the return flight four days later, plus five subsequent trips taken by the plane used in that last flight. And now ""12 confirmed contacts of Amber Vinson in Ohio ... are currently under quarantine,"" according to Summit County's assistant health commissioner Donna Skoda. They include at least two people who worked at a bridal store, where the 29-year-old nurse went as part of her wedding planning. Latest Ebola developments . Nurse moving to National Institutes of Health hospital . Vinson was flown Wednesday to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, where her uncle Lawrence Vinson said she is ""feeling OK."" Workers at that hospital -- which previously treated Americans Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol for Ebola -- are also caring for an unnamed person with Ebola who came there September 9. Another person being treated for the virus, freelance NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, is ""getting better every day"" at Nebraska Medical Center, hospital spokesman Taylor Wilson said Thursday. The fourth person with Ebola in the United States,Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital nurse Nina Pham, arrived via plane in Maryland on Thursday night. She was then transported, by ambulance, to the National Institutes of Health hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, just outside Washington. The Dallas hospital said that transferring Nina Pham ""is the right decision (because) many of the medical professionals who would normally staff the intensive care unit (are) sidelined for continuous monitoring."" Some 76 workers who cared for Duncan, like Vinson and Pham, have been asked to do things like regularly take their temperatures to gauge whether they have Ebola. Texas Health Presbyterian's critical care medicine chief Dr. Gary Weinstein said ""she has improved so much in a short period of time."" Pham sounded upbeat and grateful in the same statement about her upcoming move to Maryland. ""I'm doing really well thanks to this team, which is the best in the world,"" Pham said. ""I believe in my talented co-workers."" How the Ebola virus spreads . Many of those co-workers are subject to heightened concern and scrutiny, due to their involvement in Duncan's care. To that end, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night that about 50 people from Texas Health Presbyterian have signed a document legally restricting where they can go and what they can do until they totally clear of Ebola. Among other things, they'll be placed on a ""Do Not Board list"" that would prohibit them from flying commercially like Vinson did. (Frieden . ""They can't take public transportation. They must have personal monitoring twice a day,"" Rawlings said. ""Furthermore, they cannot go to public places."" Complete coverage on Ebola . Schools closed, National Guard deployed to Africa . That wasn't the only government move Thursday related to Ebola. In Texas' Belton Independent School District, several schools shut down because two students were on the same Cleveland-to-Dallas flight as Vinson. Two schools in the Solon school district in suburban Cleveland also closed because a staffer ""traveled home from Dallas on Frontier Airlines on Tuesday on a different flight, but perhaps the same aircraft"" as Vinson, the school district said in a statement. In Washington, President Barack Obama voiced opposition to a travel ban from the countries ravaged most by the virus but did signal openness to appointing a so-called ""Ebola czar"" to focus on the issue at home. He also signed an executive order authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops to West Africa -- where most all of the nearly 9,000 reported Ebola cases and 4,500 deaths have been occurring, according to the World Health Organization -- to help authorities there deal with the devastating outbreak. Obama: Ebola czar 'may make sense' Federal and Texas health officials faced heated questioning on Capitol Hill about how Ebola has been handled so far in the United States and how it will be handled in the future. Dr. Daniel Varga -- the chief clinical officer for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's parent company, Texas Health Resources -- admitted hospital staff ""made mistakes"" the first time that Duncan visited there in late September, letting him leave despite his symptoms and the fact he'd just come from West Africa. ""We did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of Ebola,"" Varga testified Thursday to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""We are deeply sorry."" 5 things nurses say the Texas hospital got wrong . While procedures may change -- especially after some well-publicized mistakes -- Frieden said his agency's overarching goal will not. ""Our top priority, our focus is to work 24/7 to protect Americans,"" Frieden said. ""That's our mission."" U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the polls close in most other democracies, the results are known almost instantly. Ballots are usually counted accurately and rapidly, and nobody disputes the result. Complaints of voter fraud are rare; complaints of voter suppression are rarer still. The kind of battle we are seeing in Florida -- where Democrats and Republicans will go to court over whether early voting should span 14 days or eight -- simply does not happen in Germany, Canada, Britain or France. The ballot uncertainty that convulsed the nation after Florida's vote in 2000 could not happen in Mexico or Brazil. Almost everywhere else, elections are run by impartial voting agencies. In France, elections are the responsibility of the Ministry of the Interior, which establishes places and hours of voting, prints ballots (France still uses paper) and counts the votes. In Germany, an independent federal returning officer oversees a complex state and federal voting system. Share your reaction to the election results . In Canada, federal elections are managed by a specialized agency, Elections Canada. Mexico, emerging from a sad history of electoral manipulation, created in the 1990s a respected independent agency, the Federal Electoral Institute. Brazil has nationwide electronic voting, producing instantaneous, uncontested results. President Barack Obama: My vision for America . No voting system is perfect. Britain has faced allegations of chronic fraud in absentee balloting. As I write, Lithuanian politics are convulsed by allegations of vote buying by one of its political parties. But here's what doesn't happen in other democracies: . Politicians of one party do not set voting schedules to favor their side and harm the other. Politicians do not move around voting places to gain advantages for themselves or to disadvantage their opponents. In fact, in almost no other country do politicians have any say in the administration of elections at all. Here's a story from the 2000 election. Like many old cities, St. Louis has not invested in modern voting equipment. Voting delays are notorious. At the scheduled poll-closing time, voters were still lined up throughout the city. Al Gore's campaign, desperate to win the state, asked a judge to extend voting for three more hours in the heavily Democratic city -- but only in the city. A state judge agreed. Republicans appealed, the state judge was overruled, and the polls were closed after remaining open a total of 45 additional minutes beyond the legal closing time. Republicans won Missouri's 11 electoral votes by a margin of 78,786 out of the almost 2.4 million cast. Think about what's incredible here: . Lines were lengthy in St. Louis City because in the United States, almost uniquely, local governments choose how voting is cast and counted. People who live in localities with less capable governments, such as St. Louis, will face greater delay and difficulty in casting their vote. Mitt Romney: My vision for America . When local Democratic officials saw themselves disadvantaged by the existing rules, they appealed to a judge for special treatment for its (likely) voters -- and only for those voters. (Good news: In Missouri, circuit judges are appointed by the governor and then confirmed in office by nonpartisan vote. In many states, however, judges are themselves elected in partisan elections.) The other party demanded that the existing rules be upheld, and the case was litigated on the fly, ending in a weird compromise that only failed to become a national scandal because the events in Florida were so much more dramatic. In any other democracy, voters nationwide would have cast their votes on the same kind of balloting equipment, subject to the same rules. Your take: Should we have polling places in churches? The parties would have had a minimal role in supervising the election, and certainly would not have been allowed to ask for rule changes as the vote occurred. The voting would have been overseen by a national election commission, not by local judges, who might be nonpartisan -- but who very well might not. Change the list: You convinced them to vote . Americans worry more about voter fraud than do voters in other countries, because they are the only country without a reliable system of national identification. In no other country, including federal systems such as Germany, Canada and Australia, does the citizen's opportunity to vote depend on the affluence and competence of his or her local government. In every other democracy, the vote is the means by which the people choose between the competing political parties -- not one more weapon by which the parties compete. The United States is an exceptional nation, but it is not always exceptional for good. The American voting system too is an exception: It is the most error-prone, the most susceptible to fraud, the most vulnerable to unfairness and one of the least technologically sophisticated on earth. After the 2000 fiasco, Americans resolved to do better. Isn't it past time to make good on that resolution? Opinion: On Election Day, pause to soak it in . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Tuesday's vote is subject to all manner of disputes between parties .
He says U.S. voting system is locally controlled, gives too much power to politicians .
Other democracies establish national standards and enforce them equally, he says .
Frum: After dispute over 2000 election, reforms were promised but haven't materialized ."

Fatu, 36, died Friday of a heart attack in a hospital in Houston, Texas, a family friend confirmed. Also known as ""The Samoan Bulldozer,"" the 6-foot-4-inch, 350-pound wrestler earned a reputation for executing moves with more ease than one might expect from someone his size, facing off in high-profile bouts with WWE celebrities such as Triple H and Ric Flair. ""He was basically known for being an athletic, big man who carried some extra weight around, but moved very well for a guy his size,"" said Kevin Eck, an assistant sports editor of the Baltimore Sun who also runs its professional-wrestling blog, Ring Posts. Comments on Eck's blog range from messages of condolences to speculation over whether drugs were involved and the struggles wrestlers grapple with outside of the ring. ""[H]ardly do we realize what do these wrestlers go through.....not that long ago he looked as if he could go on for 20 years in the ring looking as vicious as he was,"" one post says. Fatu worked on and off for the WWE for several years before the organization terminated his contract in June for violating the WWE's Wellness Program and refusing to enter rehab, the WWE said on its Web site, without providing specifics. The organization offered its condolences to Fatu's family in a brief statement on its site. Details of Fatu's death have not been released, but Eck said the death highlights a larger problem of professional wrestlers dying in their 30s and 40s. Fatu's death comes less than nine months after Canadian pro wrestler Andrew Test Martin reportedly died of a drug overdose, and follows a string of high-profile deaths in the past decade, including those of Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero. ""It's happening a lot more frequently in the sport than it ever did, and it's a huge problem,"" Eck said. ""If this was Major League Baseball and you had guys dropping dead under 40, it would be a much bigger deal -- but because it's wrestling, it flies under the radar."" Though wrestlers today have more support systems available through the WWE and other groups, the rigors of the sport have increased dramatically compared to the days of Capt. Lou Albano, who died this year at 76, Eck said. ""The expectations for what wrestlers are supposed to look like have evolved. In Albano's day, some were in good shape, some were not, but you didn't see the superhuman physiques like you started seeing in the 80s,"" he said. As the industry has gone global, wrestlers also are traveling more and going farther than they did pre-WWE, when wrestlers and promoters worked within limited territories, he said. And the demands in the ring are higher than ever. ""You could get by with doing less back in the day, you didn't see a lot of high-risk maneuvers. And as it has evolved, so has the need to do more risky-looking stunts, and that's why guys get a lot of bumps and bruises, and you can sort of make the correlation that that leads to more painkillers."" In an interview with CNN after Albano's death, WWE spokesman Robert Zimmerman said the organization provides medical assistance and financial guidance through the WWE's Wellness Program to all its wrestlers, even though they are considered independent contractors. ""If they're injured on the job in the ring, we take care of their medical expenses and get them to the best doctors possible,"" Zimmerman said. ""In addition to their physical well-being, we also take them through financial counseling and financial workshops so they know what to do with their money as far as income, earnings and sponsorships. And those are just a few aspects of the program."" To friends and family, Fatu was a devoted family man who was looking forward to spending more time with his children after leaving the WWE. ""He had his demons, but he found a lot of strength in his family,"" said family friend and former WWE personality Dawn Marie Psaltis. ""He comes from a long line of professional wrestlers and did his family proud."" Psaltis, the founder of Wrestlers Rescue, a support group for aging and retired wrestlers, says Fatu's death highlights the unique struggles that wrestlers face as independent contractors who don't receive the benefits of athletes or professional actors. Like many wrestlers, Fatu did not have health insurance when he died, leaving friends and family scrambling to cover his medical expenses, Psaltis said. ""We make above average income, but most of what we make goes toward the expense of being in the business, and health care is a huge expense for a wrestler,"" Psaltis said. Psaltis said she started Wrestlers Rescue with the goal of working with insurance companies to create an affordable health care plan for wrestlers. ""To find health care that covers wrestlers costs quadruple the price of regular coverage, so a lot of the guys end up going without. They continue to wrestle way past their prime because there's no pension, and because there's no health care, they never prepared for their future health concerns. It's an endless cycle."" But Psaltis and former WWE diva Terri Runnels say camaraderie and the thrill of being in the ring are worth the risks. ""Yes, we make good money, but for what we do it's paltry. We are like paupers compared to most other professions, but our pride in entertaining and making sure that when you pay money and come to a show you are absolutely entertained, that's why we do what we do,"" Runnels said.","Eddie Fatu's death highlights trend of pro wrestlers dying young, sports blogger says .

"(CNN) -- For far too long, according to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, his committee was nothing more than ""a U-Haul trailer of money for a presidential nominee"" who lacked a permanent, sustainable presence in crucial states. ""We had been a party that has shown up once every four years about five months before an election,"" Priebus told CNN, arguing that no matter how much money you have, that model won't work and hasn't worked in recent years. So after the drubbing the party took at the ballot box in 2012 -- failing to win the White House and losing seats in the House -- Priebus ordered a much-talked about top-down review of the party in an effort to stop Republicans for taking big losses during presidential elections. The report -- titled the ""Growth & Opportunity Plan"" -- was stark and blunt, challenging the Republican Party to make substantial changes to the way it interacted with voters. Republicans want to end perception as 'stuffy old men' Less than a year after the report was released and as Republicans nationally venture to Washington for the group's winter confab, Priebus and other Republican leaders are looking back on 2013 and heralding the moves they made in implementing their plan. ""A lot of it comes down to mechanics,"" Priebus said. ""Here is the point, if you are not in Hispanic communities on a year-round basis. If you don't represent those congressional districts, if you don't represent those Senate districts, who is there? Who is there telling the story of the Republican Party, of opportunity and freedom."" There are fundamental areas that RNC re-tooling has focused on: improving a lackluster ground game, growing Republican standing in minority communities, investing in a data infrastructure and revamping the GOP primary system. All of this, Priebus and others said, is in an effort to turn into a year-round organization with a sustainable presence in crucial states. After President Barack Obama beat Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the way to winning reelection in 2012, many in the party felt changes needed to be made. As the GOP report touts on one of its first pages, it had ""lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections"" and Obama just won the Hispanic vote by a whopping 44%, African Americans by over 80% and Asians by 47%. In response to these losses, according to Jennifer Korn, the RNC's deputy political director and the head of demographic specific outreach, the party has put minority engagement staff in sixteen states. The RNC is especially proud of that - pointing out that 78% of the RNC's political staff is outside of Washington, D.C., -- but not fully satisfied. If they had their way, the RNC would have this demographic specific staff in all 50 states. And Korn believes this plan has already been a success, pointing to the fact that Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey won 50% of the Hispanic vote on the way to his reelection in 2013. Korn, who came to the RNC after running similar outreach programs in the George W. Bush White House, said the results were particularly stark in heavily Hispanic Passaic County, New Jersey, a county Christie turned red in 2013. ""This is a permanent, year round effort,"" Korn said. ""We will be in these communities to not only ask for their vote, but to build relationships and listen to their concerns."" But not all recommendations outlined in the report have been followed. On the top of that list: the report's suggestion that Republicans should ""embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform."" ""If we do not, our party's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only,"" wrote the five Republican authors of the report, which also stated that the RNC believes ""comprehensive immigration reform"" is ""consistent"" with Republican policies to ""promote job growth and opportunity for all."" After passing the Senate, immigration reform has stalled in the Republican controlled House. What's more, Republican's who supported the measure - like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio - have taken a beating with the party's base for that support. Reid: Boehner will compromise on immigration reform . The other much talked about suggestion, that Republicans need to alter their tone when talking about certain issues, has proven hard to change. ""It's not just what we say; it's how we say it,"" Priebus said when the report was published. But a number of high profile comments have undermined the GOP effort. Examples: When Rep. Steve King of Iowa told Newsmax that Mexican immigrants have ""calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert"" or when Rep. Trent Frank of Arizona said ""the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low."" Priebus, who has called out some of the more outlandish comments, seems to just shrug this off with the fact that the RNC has only been at this for less than a year. ""This idea that somehow the committee itself is taking on the entire world upon its shoulders and has to carpet the world"" is not realistic, Preibus told CNN on Wednesday, the first day of the meeting. ""In one year, is the world carpeted? No. But we are making fundamental changes at a historic level that no one can deny."" Democrats have watched this rebranding with amusement. Every time someone like King makes an eye-popping statement or when the RNC, like it is doing this week, considers a resolution that encourages candidates to be more vocal on the anti-abortion stance, Democrats have questioned the validity of the plan. In an e-mail on Tuesday, Marcy Stech, spokeswoman for Emily's List, a liberal woman's group, said the RNC abortion proposal shows the party is ""misfiring on that rebrand"" and ""Republicans are yet again focusing on rhetoric over reason."" ""This is yet another example of the Republican Party being tone-deaf to American voters and trying to solve a policy problem with a fake, PR solution,"" Stech wrote. ""Maybe, in 2014, they should be taking a stronger look at the policies that women and their families actually want, and not how much or how little to talk to them about the ones they don't."" Priebus, quite expectedly, doesn't see it that way. Instead of saying the resolution pushes Republicans to talk about their pro-life stances, the chairman said the idea is that ""the point of the resolution is don't stand there like s sitting duck, like a fool, and get punched in the face"" when Democrats challenge Republican on abortion. While tone and demographic outreach have been the most talked about aspects of the RNC changes, the committee has also tried to shore up other deficiencies that hurt them in 2012. Kirsten Kurkowski, the RNC's spokeswoman, said the party has ""fundamentally reshaped our ground game structure to be community-based and bottom up,"" is ""closing the digital divide with a multi-million dollar investment in technology"" and has ""united behind the need for changes in the debate system."" The debate system as been an important, albeit quiet, focus of the RNC after the 2012 loss. For much of 2013, a handful of party officials pushed batch rules aimed at streamlining a chaotic presidential nominating process that many party insiders viewed as damaging to the their campaign for the White House in 2012. Those rules are to be considered and voted on at this week's RNC meeting. ""I don't think we need a six-month slice and dice festival on our party,"" Priebus said. ""I think we need some compression on both ends to shorten the time period of the primary. And like I said, look I can't always control people's mouths but we can have some control over how long we have to kill each other. "" As for more comments that strike a tone the RNC would rather not take, most GOP committee members in Washington for the winter meeting know they are inevitable. ""We wrote a report and certainly we advocated people being smart about what they say, but we don't have a magic wand,"" said RNC Committeeman Henry Barbour. ""I think that is where we have to keep fighting that fight. We have to keep educating our members, or governors, as well as our candidates, to think about what you say and how you say it."" His advice to members who have a penchant for strong statements: ""Speak in a way that unites people and is not shrill. Shrill doesn't sell.""","After losses in 2012, RNC Chair Reince Priebus ordered a review of the GOP at the national level .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bristol Palin describes being dragged through the grass and called a series of obscenities during a massive brawl last month in recordings of Anchorage police interviews that CNN obtained through a public records request. She said she jumped into a fight after ""some old lady"" pushed her sister, Willow Palin, because ""oh f***in' hell no, no one's gonna touch my sister."" When she tried to find the woman, though, she said a man who others identified as Korey Klingenmeyer, the owner of the house where the party took place, knocked her down. ""A guy comes out of nowhere and pushes me on the ground, takes me by my feet in my dress -- in my thong dress in front of everybody -- [and says] 'Come on you c***, get the f*** out of here. Come on you s***, get the f*** out of here,"" she said. No charges were filed as a result of the September brawl. 6 must-reads from Palin family brawl police report . Other people interviewed by police described the Palins as instigators in a brawl that also reportedly included Track Palin and his father, Todd, fighting several men. They said Bristol Palin punched Klingenmeyer several times before he restrained her. Klingenmeyer said he'd approached Todd Palin to say that ""your daughter's out of line"" and that he should get the situation under control. That didn't happen. ""I told 'em all to get the hell out of here and go home,"" he said. He said the altercation with Bristol Palin started after she insisted she was going to beat another woman up. ""I said 'this is my house, we're not having this,'"" Klingenmeyer said. ""She freakin' goes, 'I'll kick your a**.'"" He said Bristol Palin punched him several times, and then he grabbed her fist, made a motion that isn't described verbally, and then she ""fell down."" Sarah Palin can apparently be heard in the background during some of the interviews. At one point, she complained that her children were being ""made to feel like the bad guys."" She also criticizes Klingenmeyer, saying: ""What would he be doin' pushin' girls around, though?"" Matthew McKenna, whose birthday was the reason for the party, told police that people had gotten ""drunk and stupid"" -- and that he had video of the altercation, but wouldn't share it. ""I know everyone here, and it's just an unfortunate deal,"" he said.","Alaska police released recordings of a brawl that included several members of Sarah Palin's family.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- An Egyptian billionaire was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his part in the murder of Lebanese pop singer Susanne Tamim in 2008, Egypt's Interior Ministry told CNN Tuesday. The man who actually committed the murder got 28 years, the ministry's Alla Mahmoud said. It was the second trial of Egyptian ruling party member Hisham Talaat Moustafa since Tamim's body was found in her apartment in Dubai in July 2008. She had been stabbed and her throat was slit. Prosecutors alleged he paid the other man, Mohsen el Sukkary, $2 million to murder Tamim. In a case that captivated Egypt and the region because of the fame of the victim and defendants, the men were eventually found guilty and given the death penalty under Egyptian law. But nearly eight months after the trial, the country's Supreme Constitutional Court ordered the retrial of the two on procedural grounds. Lawyers for the defendants had claimed the prosecution's evidence could have been fabricated or tampered with by authorities in Dubai and should not be used against them. During the original trial, Moustafa's lawyer told CNN his client loved the singer but could not take Tamim as a second wife because his family objected. Polygamy is legal in Egypt, and it's not unusual for men such as Moustafa, a married father of three, to take on additional wives. Prosecutors argued that Tamim's death was a ""means of taking revenge."" Although Tamim was killed in the United Arab Emirates, the Egyptian judiciary tried the case in Cairo because the accused were arrested in Egypt. After Moustafa's arrest, Egyptian authorities indicted him, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and jailed him pending trial. He also resigned as chairman of Talaat Moustafa Group -- a conglomerate with construction and real estate arms that was founded by his father, Talaat Moustafa. Moustafa's brother, Tarek Talaat Moustafa, now chairs the company. CNN's Housam Ahmed in Cairo and Caroline Faraj in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report.","One of Egypt's richest and most powerful men has now been found guilty twice .

"(CNN) -- We all have our favorites for the big honors at Hollywood's top awards show, but over its 80-year history there have been some classic films, performers and people behind the scenes that have been criminally overlooked by Oscar. Peter Sellers in ""Dr. Strangelove,"" just one of Kubrick's classics beaten to the prize by a glitzy musical . From acting turns that kept us glued to the screen, to directors that were passed over by the Academy time and time again, these are the statues we would have given out if we'd been in charge. Don't agree? Think we've missed one or robbed an actual winner of its top-spot? Share your views by using the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best. 1. Stanley Kubrick's double snub 1968/1964 . In two equally baffling instances, the last true auteur's work was denied the prize. Cold War classic ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" lost out to George Cukor's ""My Fair Lady"" while his genre-defining sci-fi epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was beaten by Carol Reed's threadbare ""Oliver!"" Glossy Hollywood musicals hailed above two of the most influential movies ever made: are you serious? Truly, this is Oscar's greatest travesty. 2. ""Citizen Kane,"" denied best picture 1941 . It has been topping critics' lists since its release over 60 years ago, but this work of cinematic genius left the 1941 Oscars almost empty handed. Nominated for nine, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, ""Citizen Kane"" was beaten to the prize by ""How Green Was My Valley,"" a sentimental epic about Welsh miners. 3. Martin Scorsese, ever the bridesmaid 1976/1980/1990 . Finally recognized last year for his work on ""The Departed,"" for years it looked like Scorsese would always play bridesmaid to some distinctly mediocre brides. The three biggest Oscar crimes against Marty: ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas."" For the latter, he was beaten by Kevin Costner for ""Dances With Wolves."" Fair enough, it's the only Costner-helmed film that isn't utterly abysmal, but better than Scorsese's best? We don't think so. 4. James Dean: Rebel without an Oscar 1955/1956 . The only actor to receive more than one posthumous nomination, Dean still failed to secure the statue, despite turning in three amazing performances in one year. Nominated for his roles in ""East of Eden"" and ""Giant,"" and overlooked for the iconic ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" three performances that put him into Hollywood folklore as an acting great, he lost out second time round to Yul Brynner in ""The King and I."" Is it us or are the sentimental musicals trumping the all-time classics? 5. Alfred Hitchcock's Academy curse 1958 . One of the greatest directors of all time, Hitchcock never won the best director award. Nominated just four times, he was only beaten by the finest directors of the day, including Billy Wilder and Elia Kazan. But how could the nomination committee overlook ""Vertigo""? Today it's considered one of his true masterpieces. No nomination for Hitchcock, and instead the academy hand the award to Vincente Minnelli, the director of ""Gigi"" -- another tooth-gratingly glitzy musical. 6. ""Pulp Fiction"" and Morgan Freeman get Gump-ed 1994 . Whether you like ""Forrest Gump"" or not, it's hard to defend the decision that saw Tom Hanks take his second acting Oscar ahead of the definitive performance of one of Hollywood's elder statesmen, Morgan Freeman, in Frank Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption."" And as for the Academy passing over ""Pulp Fiction"" or its director, Quentin Tarantino in favor of a comfortable family flick? That left us speechless. Where's the Academy's court of appeal? 7. Robert Duvall steals the show, but is robbed of the award 1979 . It's hard to stand out in a cast that has Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper in it, let alone when the project's directed with powerful skill by Francis Ford Coppola, but the wild ravings of Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore stand out as the highlight in the excellent and affecting ""Apocalypse Now."" We hate the smell of Oscar injustice in the morning. 8. ""LA Confidential"" is sunk by a blockbuster 1997 . Ok, it was an impressive venture, and the technical frills were unrivalled at the time, but ""Titanic"" just wasn't the best film of the year. A flimsy script, plus performances far from the actors' best, failed to deter voters: the movie picked up a record 11 awards. Versus ""LA Confidential,"" or even the impressive ""Good Will Hunting,"" it simply doesn't float. 9. Al Pacino's best apparently not good enough 1976 . Pacino may have descended into a constant stream of shouting in his later roles (something that can be seen in abundance in ""Any Given Sunday"" or ""Devil's Advocate""), but his magnetic performance as sensitive Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather"" sees him at his compelling best. Joel Grey's performance in ""Cabaret"" (more musicals! Argh!) is nothing if not annoying, and certainly not a patch on Pacino's finest hour. 10. ""Brokeback Mountain"" wins everything but an Oscar 2005 . In the approach to the Academy Awards it had been winning major prizes, scooping the best picture BAFTA and Golden Globe and earning director Ang Lee a Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, but when it came to the Oscars, the movie mysteriously missed out. ""Crash,"" the actual winner, is not a bad film, but it pales in comparison to the sensitive and highly emotional ""Brokeback Mountain."" .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one? Read others' comments and share your views by using the Sound Off box below. ....................... And the day before the Oscars are given out, the 28th Annual Razzie Awards will be announced for the year's worst film offerings. Here are five of the biggest Razzie winners ... Sly and the family Stallone ""win"" big . With 30 nominations and 10 awards, including worst actor of the century, Sly is the biggest ""winner"" in Razzie history. Most notably, in 1985 he and his family cleaned up, as he took worst actor, director and screenplay awards, his wife Brigitte Nielsen scooped worst supporting actress and worst new star, and Sly's brother Frank received worst original song for ""Peace in Our Time"" from ""Rambo II."" Their parents must be so proud. Madonna fails to get the hint . She's not known for her acting, but Madge just won't let it go. With fewer than 20 full-length feature roles under her belt, the queen of pop has picked up 15 Razzie nominations and nine awards for her weak performances. In 2002 she cleaned up, taking Worst Actress, Worst Supporting Actress and half of the Worst Couple. You really can't fault her consistency. ""Showgirls"" breaks Razzie records . This record-breaking clunker was nominated for 13 awards in 1995: admirable, since there were only 10 categories that year. It also claimed the most wins, taking home a well-deserved seven awards, including Worst Director and Worst Picture, which were collected in person by director Paul Verhoeven, the first winner to attend the show to collect Razzies. Respect. Eddie Murphy: man of 2008 . This year's show sees the comedian who was up for an Oscar last year pick up a record five nominations for one person in a year, for his work in Worst Picture nominee ""Norbit."" Having played multiple characters, Murphy is up for Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, Worst Supporting Actress, Worst Couple (nominated with himself) and Worst Screenplay. A truly impressive haul: good work, Eddie. Battlefield Earth ""succeeds"" in every category . John Travolta's Scientology/sci-fi movie was nominated for a meager eight awards, but brought home the bacon as it took seven of those awards on the night. Only Forrest Whitaker failed to convert his nomination, pipped to the post by co-star Barry Pepper. If it makes them feel any better, we think they deserved all eight. .................................... Don't agree? Think we've missed one?

"(CNN) -- Donald Sterling has filed a new civil lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking damages from his wife, the NBA and NBA commissioner Adam Silver in their attempt to sell the the L.A. Clippers for $2 billion to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Court documents filled Tuesday call the potential sale ""unlawful"" and ""fraudulent,"" and ask for an injunction to block the sale. ""Donald's latest lawsuit is a frivolous, last ditch act of desperation by a delusional, bitter man,"" said Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly. ""This action shows once more how obsessed he is with ruining a record-setting $2 billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers -- a sale that would solve the problems his racist rant started three months ago."" Donald Sterling came under fire for making racist remarks against African-Americans in comments to his companion V. Stiviano. The recorded conversation was published online. In response, the NBA banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5 million and ordered that the team be sold. Sterling, in turn, sued the league for $1 billion for alleged antitrust violations in its handling of the matter. After Shelly Sterling had her 80-year-old husband declared mentally incapacitated by two physicians, she took over the Sterling Family Trust that owns the team. Donald Sterling, an attorney and real estate investor, has early Alzheimer's or another brain disease, the doctors said. But Donald Sterling and his attorneys dispute he's incapacitated. An ongoing court hearing in Los Angeles will determine if Shelly Sterling properly wrested control of the franchise from her husband. Donald Sterling revoked the family trust back in June, and Tuesday's lawsuit contends that the move reverted the Clippers back to his sole ownership and therefore, Shelly Sterling has no power or right to sell the team. All the stock for the franchise was issued in his name. No trial date has been set for the case to be heard, and it's unclear how long Ballmer will be willing to keep his offer on the table as the Sterling saga continues. Donald Sterling has said he believes the team may be worth twice the record $2 billion price his wife negotiated with Ballmer, said Maxwell Blecher, another attorney for Sterling. CNN's Lindy Hall, Carey Bodenheimer and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Donald Sterling sues to prevent sale of L.A. Clippers .

"(CNN) -- I come from a place where the sky is always grey, where flowers are always grey, and where television is still in black and white. I actually come from a world where color doesn't exist; I was born with achromatopsia, I was born completely colorblind. So I've never seen color, and don't know what it looks like. But since the age of 21, I can hear color. In 2003, after studying fine arts and while studying music at Dartington College of Arts in England, I began a project with computer scientist Adam Montandon with the aim of extending my senses. The result, with further collaborations with Peter Kese and Matias Lizana, is an electronic eye: a color sensor between my eyes connected to a chip installed at the back of my head that transforms color frequencies into sound frequencies that I hear through my bone. Watch Neil Harbisson's TED Talk . I've had the electronic eye permanently attached to my head and I've been listening to colors nonstop since 2004. So I find it completely normal now to hear colors all the time. At first, I had to memorize the sound of each color, but after some time this information became subliminal, I didn't have to think about the notes, color became a perception. And after some months, color became a feeling. I started to have favorite colors and I started to dream in color. When I started to hear colors in my dreams, I noticed that my brain and the software had united and given me a new sense. My brain was creating electronic sounds in my dreams, not the device. That was the point when I started to feel no difference between the software and my brain: The cybernetic device had become an extension of my brain -- an extension of my senses. I started to feel like a cyborg: The cybernetic eye was no longer a device but a part of my body. After some time it even became a part of my official image. You are not allowed to appear with any electronic equipment on the UK passport photo, but I insisted that what they were seeing was not a piece of electronic equipment but a new part of my body. Since I started to hear color, my life has changed dramatically. Art galleries have become concert halls; I can hear a Picasso or a Rothko or an Andy Warhol. And supermarkets have become like night clubs. I love how they sound, especially the aisles with cleaning products. TED.com: We are all cyborgs now . The way I dress has also changed. Before, I used to dress in a way that looked good, now I dress in a way that sounds good. If I'm happy I dress in a major chord. If I'm sad I dress in a minor chord. So if I need to go to a funeral, I might dress in B minor (that's turquoise, purple and orange). My sense of beauty has also changed. Someone might look very beautiful but sound terrible, and someone might sound very harmonious but look awful. So I find it really exciting to create sound portraits of people. Instead of drawing the shape of someone's face I write down the different notes I hear when I look at them, and then I send them an mp3 of their face. Each face sounds different. I can even give face concerts now, concerts where I play the audience faces. The good thing about doing this is that if the concert doesn't sound good, it's their fault. I also found out that things I thought were colorless are not colorless at all. Cities are not grey, Madrid is amber terracotta, Lisbon is yellow turquoise, London is very golden red... and humans are not black and white. Human skins range from light shades of orange to very dark shades of orange, we are never white or black. We are all orange. After some time, an unexpected secondary effect appeared. I started to perceive normal sounds as color too. Telephone tones started to sound green, the BBC pips became turquoise, and listening to Mozart became a yellow experience, even people's voices had dominant colors. So I started to paint the colors of music and the colors of voices. TED.com: Ray Kurzweil on the accelerating power of technology . There was a point when I was able to perceive 360 different colors, one for each degree of the color wheel. I was able to perceive colors just as well as people with color vision. Then I realized that the human visual system is not very impressive: you can't actually see many colors; there are many more colors around us that the human eye can't detect. So I just decided to continue extending my color perception and included infrared and ultraviolet into the color-to-sound scale. So now I can also perceive infrared, which means I can hear if there are movement detectors in a room, or if someone is pointing at me with a remote control. The good thing about hearing ultraviolet is that you can hear if it's a good day or a bad day to sunbathe. Ultraviolet is a dangerous color, a color that can kill us, so it would be useful for all of us to be able to perceive it. We should all have the wish to extend our senses. If we compare ourselves with other animals, our senses are very limited. Some birds can see ultraviolet, dogs can hear ultrasounds, rats can smell much better than us, sharks can detect electromagnetic fields, dolphins can hear through their bones, bats can see through sound. TED.com: The rise of human-computer cooperation . By becoming cyborgs we have the chance to extend our perception to the level of other animal species. We focus so much on extending our knowledge and focus so little on extending our senses. No matter how much I knew about color, as long as I couldn't sense color, color made no sense to me. Knowledge comes from our senses: if we extend our senses, we extend our knowledge. We are the first generation that doesn't need to wait for natural evolution to evolve; we can evolve during our lifetime. There's no need to create new superpowers. Nature already has them. So becoming a cyborg is not about becoming like a machine. It's not about becoming less human; it's about bringing us closer to other animals and to nature. It's about awakening our senses, our instincts, our intuition ... qualities that we seem to have lost due to our constant use of technology as an external tool and not as part of our body. Life will be much more exciting when we stop creating apps for our mobile phones and we start creating apps for our own body. Become a cyborg. You won't be alone.

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- The Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery is at the center of combat between preservationists and cemetery officials. Preservationists say a replica would also crack over time and that fixing the monument is the better option. The giant marble sarcophagus marking the location of unknown U.S. service members has been battling the elements since it opened to the public in 1932. More than 70 years later, it is showing the scars, with cracks encircling it. The sarcophagus contains the remains of three unknown service members who were killed in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. The remains of a fourth service member, who died during the Vietnam War, were removed from the tomb and identified in 1998. On its most famous inscription -- ""Here rests in honored glory an American soldier known but to God"" -- a crack cuts diagonally across the words. Those scars are at the center of a debate: Should the memorial be fixed or replaced with a replica?  See photos of Tomb's cracks and its history » . ""The overall appearance of the memorial is not what it should be and we know this is a problem,"" said John C. Metzler Jr., the superintendent of Arlington National Cemetery. As the cracks worsen, cemetery officials say, the threat of a degraded monument will detract from the dignity and respect afforded to those buried at what many consider the nation's most sacred site. They would like an exact replica made with similar marble. Historical preservationists say it should not be replaced and that the cracks should simply be fixed as needed. ""A replica is not the same thing as the original,"" said John Hildreth of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a leading historical preservation organization. Located high on a hill overlooking Washington on the Virginia side of the Potomac River, the Tomb of the Unknowns is diligently looked after by the U.S. military's ceremonial Old Guard 24 hours a day.  Watch Tomb guard: ""Everything we do is for the Unknowns"" » . Cemetery officials estimate more than 4 million people visit the cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknowns every year, making it one of the most popular destinations in the Washington area. Since the early 1960s, the marble walls that make up the main monument at the Tomb have been developing fissures from natural cracking, made worse by Washington's brutal quick freezes and thaws. The cracks have been slowly growing each year, threatening the look and delicate carvings on the front of the structure rarely seen by the public. The monument has undergone two repairs, one in 1975 and the last one in 1989, with grout used as filler. Since then, other significant cracks have appeared. Watch President Bush lay wreath at Tomb of the Unknowns » . ""The cracks continue to grow. And I can't predict what the weather is going to continue to do to the monument,"" Metzler said. For years, Arlington National Cemetery, which falls under the control of the Department of the Army, has been looking to replace the 48-ton monument and its fault lines with one that is virtually identical. Metzler says following the rules of the National Historic Preservation Act and locating unblemished marble that will hold up to the weather has slowed the replacement process. The possibility of replacement -- which the cemetery said would not disturb the actual tombs encasing the remains -- has outraged preservationists. Hildreth's group, the Washington-based National Trust for Historic Preservation, and its allies successfully lobbied Congress to force the cemetery to examine all repair options. ""Cemetery officials heard our concerns and were not very receptive to changing their plans,"" Hildreth said. ""If they were to replace the monument with the same marble material, it would eventually start cracking again."" Metzler and cemetery officials reported back to Congress this month and decided to continue to repair the cracks as needed -- but will still pursue replacing the monument entirely, if requirements to the National Historic Preservation Act can be met. ""For now, we will intermittently repair the monument with grouting process that should hold for several years at a time,"" Metzler told CNN. The report said cemetery officials believe the ""cracks cannot be repaired indefinitely without the monument acquiring a patched, worn and shabby appearance, which is the antithesis of its purpose and contrary to [Arlington National Cemetery's] mission of maintaining a dignified, fitting memorial to our country's fallen soldiers."" Metzler said it is impossible to say when or if the memorial would be replaced because it hinges on whether all of the criteria are met in the Preservation Act. The National Trust  contends that the cost of repairing it far outweighs the cost replacing the structure. The cemetery's report to Congress lists a replacement and related costs could total $2.2 million, while the cost for a one-time repair would be about $65,000. Metzler's concerns are not just out of dignity and respect for those troops buried at the Tomb, but also for the tourists and other visitors that come to the monument. ""I worry that as the cracks worsen it will eventually take away from the visitor's experience,"" Metzler said.","Debate centers on whether to fix cracks on Tomb of Unknowns or replace it .

"(Mental Floss) -- While reading a story on this site about rare video games, Tanner Sandlin of Austin, Texas, recognized one of the games -- Air Raid for the Atari 2600. He found the thirteenth known copy of the game in his garage and put it on eBay. It sold last Sunday for $31,600, the second-highest price ever paid for a video game. Sandlin bought the game when he was 11 or 12 years old at a store called Tuesday Morning in Arlington, Texas. The store bought overstocked or undersold goods from other retailers and sold the items at a discount. 8 very rare and very expensive video games . Sandlin said he paid between $5 and $10 for Air Raid in the mid-1980s. This is important because none of the other twelve people who possess Air Raid cartridges were the original owners -- they bought them at auction, secondhand stores, or through private collectors. Learning a collectible item's ""provenance,"" or owner history, is key to proving its authenticity. Since Sandlin was the original owner, his cartridge had more credibility than one found in a box at the local thrift store. 6 more people who accidentally found a fortune . Oddly enough, Sandlin remembered that this much sought after game wasn't really all that great. In fact, the only reason he still had it was because it was so bad. He and his friends used to borrow games from each other all the time --sometimes you'd get your game back, sometimes you wouldn't, and that was OK. But no one wanted to keep Air Raid, so it kept coming back to him. He's not complaining now. While it's impressive that Sandlin had the thirteenth known copy of Air Raid, he also had the original packaging, which changed everything. Why? Because his was the only known Air Raid box in the world, making it the only known complete copy of the game in existence. But he couldn't start counting his fortune just yet. If you're willing to pay thousands of dollars for a video game, you're going to make sure it's legitimate. Sandlin knew this, so he went straight to an expert, Albert Yarusso of AtariAge.com, a forum for fans of anything Atari, to get his professional opinion on the authenticity of the find. The two both live in Austin, so Yarusso met with Sandlin and examined both the game and the box in person. After some thorough research, Yarusso declared everything was real (or the most impressive forgery he'd ever seen). With expert confirmation behind him, Sandlin pulled his stand-alone cartridge auction on eBay and replaced it with the complete game package. The starting price was $.50. Sandlin's eBay auction ended on April 10, 2010 at about 10:15 p.m. EST. With only 5 minutes to go, the highest bid was $14,600. It sat at this price until the very last few seconds, when it jumped to $17,528, and then made a giant leap to $31,500. The final bid was $31,600. This sets a new record price for the game, blowing away the previous record of $3,000. That also makes it the second-highest price ever paid for a video game cartridge, just behind the $43,300 paid for a factory-sealed copy of Stadium Events for the Nintendo back in February. I asked Sandlin what he intended to do with the money and he wasn't quite sure yet. He did know that he wanted to buy something tangible; something he could point at it and say, ""I bought that with a video game!"" Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go look for something in my garage. Mental Floss: Lost treasures waiting to be found . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (CNN) -- Uruguay became the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children after the Senate voted to approve a bill modifying the country's adoption statute. ""It is a right for the boys and the girls, not a right for the adults,"" Sen. Margarita Percovich said after the vote on Wednesday. ""It streamlines the adoption process and does not discriminate."" The expected Senate approval followed the lower chamber of Congress' passage of the bill last month. The law will pave the way for gays and lesbians to start a family, Daniel Alonso, a resident of the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, told CNN. ""You have plans to form a family, to adopt. When you have a law that protects you, it makes you want to have a child,"" he said. ""You feel part of society."" The adoption measure would be the most recent of progressive laws passed with the backing of President Tabare Vazquez. Last year, lawmakers approved a measure allowing children aged 12 or older to change their names, a measure aimed at transgender or transsexual youths. Uruguay also authorized same-sex civil unions last year, setting the stage for the current adoption law. The measure was not without opponents among conservatives and the clergy. Last month, Archbishop Nicolas Cotugno of Montevideo, released a statement warning of consequences for society should the law pass, the Catholic News Agency reported. ""The adoption of children by homosexual couples is not a question of religion, philosophy or sociology. It has to do with respect for human nature itself,"" he said, according to CNA. ""To accept the adoption of children by homosexual couples is to go against human nature itself, and consequently, it is to go against the fundamental rights of the human being as a person.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Congressional negotiators reached a bipartisan budget compromise on Tuesday that would prevent another government shutdown, if approved by the House and Senate. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said Tuesday the deal with his Senate counterpart, Patty Murray, would set spending levels, reduce the deficit, and relieve some of the arbitrary, forced spending cuts -- known as sequestration. The pair found common ground just days before a Friday deadline to settle the matter. ""We have broken through the partisanship and the gridlock,"" Murray said. Ryan said the deal was ""a clear improvement"" over the status quo. The budget deal in plain English . ""This agreement makes sure that we don't have a government shutdown scenario in January. It makes sure we don't have another government shutdown scenario in October. It makes sure that we don't lurch from crisis to crisis,"" the Wisconsin Republican said. President Barack Obama called the development a good first step. ""This agreement doesn't include everything I'd like -- and I know many Republicans feel the same way. That's the nature of compromise. But it's a good sign that Democrats and Republicans in Congress were able to come together and break the cycle of short-sighted, crisis-driven decision-making to get this done,"" Obama said in a statement. Will Congress approve it? Both the House and Senate must still weigh in, but opponents in both parties immediately raised concerns about the agreement, which, if passed by Congress, would mark a significant departure from repeated budget showdowns in recent years. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, said the proposal ""continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions"" by spending too much. ""In the short run, this budget also cancels earlier spending reductions, instead of making some tough decisions about how to tackle our long-term fiscal challenges caused by runaway Washington spending,"" Rubio said in a statement. Ryan and Murray have spent the past two months working on an agreement that would set government spending levels and replace the next round of deep automatic cuts -- known as sequester. Negotiators were tasked with reaching a deal following October's budget drama in Washington, when inaction by Congress on spending for the current fiscal year led to a 16-day federal shutdown. The temporary federal spending agreement that ended the shutdown this fall expires in mid January. Crossfire: Both sides skeptical . With the Republican-led House leaving town on Friday for the holidays, negotiators worked for a deal this week to give both houses of Congress their best shot at quickly weighing the new proposal. Ryan said they would like to get it before the House leaves town at the end of the work week, and Murray indicated the Senate wanted to consider it before it, too, recessed for the holidays next week. ""I think conservatives should vote for it,"" Ryan said of Republicans, especially tea party members in the House, who have focused most aggressively on spending cuts and who have tangled most fiercely with Obama and Democrats. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she looks forward to discussing the deal with the Democratic caucus. ""Any budget agreement must ensure that we create jobs, grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, and reduce the deficit in a balanced and responsible way,"" she said in a statement. Should Obama get credit for the Obama economy? Details of agreement . ""This deal doesn't solve all of our problems,"" Murray said, noting the compromise both sides made with government spending authority expiring in mid-January. The proposal will raise 2014 spending for the full fiscal year to $1.012 trillion. It would save $85 billion while eliminating $63 billion in forced spending cuts to the military and other programs through sequestration to achieve total deficit reduction of $23 billion, budget leaders said. Specifically, it rolls back sequestration cuts to education, medical research, infrastructure investments, and defense jobs for the next two years, Murray said. She wanted the negotiations to close corporate tax loopholes and Republicans had hoped for a chance to make changes to entitlements. Negotiators also did not include a proposal to extend unemployment benefits, which Democrats were pushing for this week. Paul Ryan: fiscal dealmaker .

"Davenport, Iowa (CNN) -- House Speaker John Boehner is trashing President Obama's foreign policy on the campaign trail by talking up someone Republicans have spent years running from: George W. Bush. ""Does anybody think that Vladimir Putin would have gone into Crimea had George W. Bush been president of the United States? No!"" Boehner asked, and answered, before a group of Republican volunteers here. ""Even Putin is smart enough to know that Bush would have punched him in the nose in about 10 seconds!"" Boehner said to an applauding crowd. Boehner often uses colorful language to slam the President for his leadership, especially on national security. But to invoke Bush is unusual, especially since his foreign policy decisions -- namely the Iraq war -- led to a clean Democratic sweep in 2006. Democrats took control of both the House and Senate in Bush's sixth year in office. Boehner is also engaging in revisionist history of sorts, since Putin did in fact invade another former member of the Soviet Union and key U.S. ally, the Republic of Georgia, in 2008 when Bush was president. Bush did not punch either Putin or then-Russian Prime Minister Dimitri Medvedev in the nose. In fact, Bush was criticized at the time by some for not reacting more forcefully against Russia. As for Boehner -- he reacted in a bipartisan way back then -- releasing a joint statement with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other leaders in both parties ""condemning -- in the strongest possible terms -- the recent invasion of the sovereign state of Georgia.""","Boehner criticizes President Obama's response to Russian takeover of Crimea .

"(CNN) -- A University of Pittsburgh research professor waived extradition Monday during a hearing in West Virginia as authorities seek his return to Pennsylvania, where he's accused of killing his wife with a lethal dose of cyanide. Robert Ferrante was not expected to fight extradition. ""He's anxious to defend himself, have his day in court, prove his innocence,"" said Ferrante's defense attorney William Difenderfer. Pennsylvania police have 10 days to pick him up, said assistant prosecutor Andy Dimlich. According to Mike Manko, spokesman for the Allegheny County district attorney's office, police will transport Ferrante from West Virginia to the Allegheny County Jail on Tuesday. Ferrante is accused of killing Autumn Klein, a 41-year-old accomplished Pittsburgh doctor. She was the former head of women's neurology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Ferrante is a researcher and professor of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh. Houston doctor charged with poisoning fellow doctor and lover . As part of his position there, Ferrante managed a laboratory where he conducts trials of various drugs and chemicals, according to a criminal complaint. Text messages between the couple were found on April 17, the day Klein fell ill, the complaint said. The exchange included Ferrante suggesting creatine to Klein in hopes of stimulating egg production. The complaint also alleges that a day earlier, Ferrante had placed an order for an ""overnight delivery of cyanide."" Investigators allege that Ferrante laced the creatine with cyanide. Cyanide is a naturally occurring toxic substance that can be found in seeds of different plants. It is widely distributed throughout research laboratories as a chemical used in scientific experiments. Cyanide interferes with the ability of the body to use oxygen to produce energy, which can lead to rapid death. On April 17, Allegheny County 911 dispatch received a call from Ferrante requesting medical assistance for his wife, who he said was possibly having a stroke, the complaint read. He described her condition as ""conscious and breathing, but not alert."" Watch: FBI investigates doctor's cyanide death . When paramedics arrived, they found the victim on the floor of the kitchen with a plastic bag containing creatine. She died April 20.

Creatine is a supplement that bodybuilders use to increase body mass, Williams said. ""The amazing amount of subpoenas of investigation that went in to determining in fact that it was a homicide. That's what took so long,"" Williams said. Ferrante's arrest Thursday ended a nationwide manhunt.

"(CNN) -- The gunman shot three people on the second floor of an Oregon mall, then ran. Shoppers hid behind racks as the man, wearing a vest and a mask, ran down a corridor and to a back hallway that led downstairs. By then, he likely heard the sirens as dozens of police vehicles converged on the Clackamas Town Center in Happy Valley. He then took his own life. As details of Tuesday's mall shooting emerged, the question of motive remained unanswered. At a news conference on Wednesday, investigators identified Jacob Tyler Roberts, 22, as the lone suspect in the shootings -- two of which proved fatal -- at the suburban Portland mall. Sheriff's investigators said there was no apparent connection between Roberts and any of his victims. The fatalities were identified as Cindy Ann Yuille, 54, and Steven Mathew Forsyth, 45. Oregon mall shooting victims had 'zest for life' The incident unfolded during the afternoon as the gunman moved quickly through the Macy's at the mall and toward the food court on the second floor, where he opened fire, the sheriff's office said. The arrival of police within a minute of receiving the first calls of the shooting may have influenced the gunman's ultimate course of action, Sheriff Craig Roberts said. The gunman was wearing a load-bearing vest -- a military-style garment designed to carry heavy equipment, which some witnesses confused with a bulletproof vest -- and was carrying a semi-automatic rifle. At one point, the rifle jammed but started working again, the sheriff said. Kristina Shevchenko, 15, was taken to the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital, where she was in serious, stable condition on Wednesday with a bullet wound to her chest, her surgeon told reporters. Shevchenko, who suffered a collapsed right lung and injuries to her liver, underwent an hourlong operation Tuesday night to remove bullet fragments and was in the hospital's intensive care unit, Dr. Laszlo Kiraly said. He said he was optimistic that she would recover fully but added that she was in shock and at risk for complications, including infection. ""She's a very brave young woman,"" he said, adding that she was awake and talking to her family. Further surgeries will focus on closing her wounds ""and getting her to heal properly,"" he said. ""I would anticipate that she would be with us for about a week or so."" Friends of the gunman said they were shocked when they heard who the shooter was. ""This is more than a tragic event, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by it, but I also feel as if the side of Jake that I remember needs to be shared,"" said Erin Philpot, a friend of the shooter, in an e-mail to CNN. ""He was a very loved individual that always seemed as if he had great intentions and a heart of gold. I know that must be hard for people to see/think/understand, but It's the truth. I don't know what caused him to do such a horrendous, terrible thing, but I do hope that somehow answers will be available to us all."" Philpot, who attended middle school and high school with Roberts, said he had recently broken up with a girlfriend and was considering moving to Hawaii. ""I just had drinks with him in November, and he had just moved into a new place and was totally stoked about it,"" she said. ""I can't believe he did this."" Jordan Salazar, who attended Milwaukie High School in the Portland area with Roberts, said in an e-mail, ""He was a really nice guy, and it's completely shocking he did this."" She added, ""He was a popular guy in high school and had a lot of friends,"" she said. ""I was pretty much in shock with all of this."" Oregon mall gunman: 'I have lived one crazy life so far' Roberts attended Milwaukie High School for three years but did not graduate, said Joe Krumm, the director of community relations for North Clackamas County School District. ""Average talent, average grades,"" Krumm said about Roberts, who was in a mainstream program and had no record of discipline issues or extracurricular activities. Roberts then transferred to another district and graduated in 2008 from Oregon City High School, the school said in a statement on its website that also talked about the killings. ""This news is very shocking to those who knew Jacob while at OCHS,"" the statement said. ""He was known as a soft-spoken and polite young man who was often eager to be helpful. The motive for such a horrific act is likely to remain a mystery to us all."" The families of the victims who died -- Yuille and Forsyth -- provided brief comments through authorities but asked for privacy as they mourn. Yuille was remembered as ""everybody's friend"" who put others first. Forsyth had two children, a great sense of humor and a zest for life, his family said. During the shooting, mall patrons said they had no clue where the gunman would fire next. Entire swaths of Clackamas Town Center became silent except for the rifle blasts and screams. Even the mall's Santa dropped to the ground. ""I thought I was going to die,"" mall employee David Moran said. ""The gunshots were so loud, it was very scary. ... Kids were crying. Parents were crying, too."" Kira Rowland was holding her 6-month-old baby in Macy's when the shots rang out. ""I threw my baby into the stroller and just started running, because everybody was screaming and everybody just started to run,"" she said. Inside Clackamas Town Center . The gunman wore a hockey mask and jogged through Macy's wielding a rifle, a woman told CNN affiliate KOIN. As some panicked customers bolted for the exits, others ducked under store counters or hid behind clothing racks. ""I am the shooter,"" he said as he ran through Macy's, said witness and store employee Austin Patty. As the shooting started, Patty ran from the store, warning all in earshot that a shooter was loose and ordering them out of the store. The sheriff's office said a rifle and a mask were recovered from the scene. Investigators were reviewing surveillance footage to get a better picture of what happened. Erin Quackenbush-Baker was with her grandmother and three children at a kiosk in the middle of the mall when she heard the shots. ""My 5-year-old was covering her ears and crying. I was frantic to find a place to run, and I looked back -- my son in my stroller and glass is falling over us,"" she said. ""The shots were getting closer."" She added, ""I felt like sitting ducks where we were.""

As word spread that the shooter was moving from store to store, customers at Sears burst into tears, Christina Fisher told KOIN. ""We were told to stand in a group by the top of the escalators and stay away from the windows out of the aisle. ... We stood there for probably a good 20 minutes,"" she said. ""All of the sudden, somebody came through with a radio, yelling, 'Get down!' "" As the mayhem unfolded, some customers watched television reports about the shooting from inside the Sears entertainment center, Tylor Pedersen told affiliate KGW. Antonio Charro spotted a wounded woman near a cell phone store and tried to help. ""She had apparently been shot in the chest, and I couldn't get her turned over to help her,"" said Charro, who had been shopping at the mall with his daughters. ""There was no one around. She wasn't breathing."" Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts said about 10,000 people were in the mall at the time. No law enforcement officers fired any shots when they arrived, sheriff's Sgt. Adam Phillips said. The 1.4 million-square-foot mall remained closed Wednesday as investigators looked for clues about the attack. Rowland said she's grateful she got distracted while shopping and didn't venture farther into the mall.

"(CNN) -- Does the word ""virginity"" evoke discussions of sexuality or religious belief? That's the question residents in Fayetteville, Arkansas, are asking after a junior high student was asked by school administrators to change out of a T-shirt that read ""Virginity Rocks"" last week. Eighth-grader Chloe Rubiano of Ramay Junior High said she got the tee at a Christian festival last year; on the back, it continues its abstinence message: ""I'm loving my Husband and I haven't even Married Him."" ""I just really liked this shirt because I was always raised that way,"" Rubiano told CNN affiliate KFSM. She said she was pulled out of class and given a gym shirt to change into because the message on her shirt ""opens up too many doors for conversations"" about sexual activity -- or lack thereof. After the incident, Rubiano's mother, Bambi Crozier, took to Facebook to write a lengthy post defending her daughter's wardrobe choice, stating she has always encouraged her children to stand up for what they believe in. She ends the post with: ""Virginity is not a dirty word. Wouldn't it be great if it weren't treated as such?"" Fayetteville School District Superintendent Paul Hewitt said, whatever the message, the school was simply adhering to its rules about writing on clothing. ""If a student wore a shirt that said 'Sex Rocks' or 'Smoke More Pot,' they would also have been asked to remove it for the same reason; it would no doubt be disruptive,"" he wrote in an email to CNN. ""Even positive messages can be disruptive and our schools must be fair and consistent in dealing with all our students."" As for concerns over free speech, Hewitt said Rubiano's message has come through loud and clear. ""Just the attention this incident has been given has certainly given the student and her mother the attention they sought. This is not a major free speech issue,"" according to Hewitt. ""I suspect this is a common issue in junior high and high schools throughout the nation.""","An 8th-grader in Arkansas was asked to change out of a ""Virginity Rocks"" shirt .

Last week Sony changed the terms-of-service document for its PlayStation Network, asking U.S. customers to forfeit their rights to file class-action lawsuits against the company and its partners. Customers can opt out by sending the company a letter in the mail. Sony's PlayStation Network, which allows subscribers to play games and watch movies online, was down for weeks last spring following a security breach that exposed personal details of 77 million users. Users immediately began filing class-action lawsuits. Sony said this week that the new terms-of-service changes were made, as some analysts suspected, in response to a Supreme Court decision in April. In that case, AT&T Mobility was permitted to include and enforce a clause in employment contracts that bars workers from bringing class-action suits. ""The Supreme Court recently ruled in the AT&T case that language like this is enforceable,"" a spokeswoman for Sony's PlayStation unit wrote in an e-mail. ""The updated language in the TOS is designed to benefit both the consumer and the company by ensuring that there is adequate time and procedures to resolve disputes."" Like AT&T, Sony prefers to settle disputes outside of court through a process called arbitration. Arbiters are typically retired judges who fetch an hourly rate of $300 or more, a fee that's generally split between the two parties on top of any costs for hiring lawyers, said Jack Lerner, a director at the University of Southern California's Technology Law Clinic. That would deter anyone looking to correct unfair charges of a few dollars to an individual, which could amount to millions if the problem was widespread and settled as a class action in court, he said. Arbitration also does not involve a jury, which could include people more sympathetic to consumers than to corporations. The AT&T suit was first brought in 2006 by customers who complained of being charged $30 in state taxes for a cell phone that was advertised as free. The 5-4 Supreme Court vote came, ironically, on the same day in April that PlayStation customers began filing class-action lawsuits against Sony for losing their personal data to hackers. Sony added the new clause last week, apparently to protect itself against potential future widespread and costly blunders. Courts haven't been lenient in the past about enforcing software agreements, despite the reality that few people read them, Lerner said. This year's court ruling in the AT&T case likely won't be overturned anytime soon, unless Congress intervenes with changes to the law, he said. ""That was an absolute travesty,"" Lerner said. ""The implications for consumers (are) staggering."" Sony's new user agreement describes how to opt out of the class-action waiver. Future class-action suits against Sony from PlayStation online account-holders would only include people who made the effort to send a written letter, lowering the ultimate costs to Sony. Including an option to dodge the waiver ""was a savvy move by Sony because they didn't necessarily have to do it,"" Lerner said. The move should enable Sony to argue in court that it played fair, he said. Likely less than 1% of PlayStation users, of whom there are more than 77 million worldwide, would go through the process of opting out, he estimated. PlayStation Network users were alerted of the class-action changes in e-mails and in a note near the top of the agreement. Gamers are unable to play online or watch Internet video from services like Netflix until they agree to the contract update on their consoles. It takes 45 seconds, using a game controller, to scroll to the part of the document that describes the legal waiver. It takes a minute and a half to scroll through the entire document, and certainly much longer to actually read it.","Sony changed its terms, asking PlayStation Network users to waive class-action rights .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Three Chinese astronauts have returned safely to Earth after completing their country's longest manned space voyage, with their mission hailed by their bosses as a ""complete success."" Nie Haisheng, commander of the Shenzhou-10 crew, was the first to emerge from the descent module after it touched down by parachute in an expanse of Inner Mongolian grasslands on Wednesday morning after 15 days in space. He was followed by Wang Yaping, the only female astronaut of the mission, and Zhang Xiaoguang. ""We are dreamers, and we have now fulfilled our dream,"" Zhang was quoted as saying by the state media China Daily as saying. ""Our space dream knows no boundary, and our hard work will never cease."" Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli, watching a broadcast of the descent from the Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, congratulated the astronauts on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. During its journey, Shenzhou-10, whose name translates as ""Divine Vessel,"" twice docked with the orbiting space station Tiangong-1 (""Heavenly Palace""), once manually and once through an automated operation. The crew spent 12 days aboard the space station, conducting technical tests and medical experiments, while Wang delivered a physics lesson in zero-gravity via video link to more than 60 million Chinese middle school students. Tiangong-1 was launched in September 2011 with a two-year operational lifespan. The Shenzhou-10's mission was the second and final manned voyage to the space station, following China's first manned docking mission a year ago. It represented China's fifth manned mission to space in a decade, and the first during the presidency of Xi Jinping, who took office in March this year. The mission has been broadly hailed by Chinese leaders and citizens alike as a prestige-building demonstration of China's growing technological expertise, although some netizens have questioned the wisdom of a developing country pursuing an expensive space program. During a June 24 video call to the Shenzhou-10 crew, Xi told them that ""the space dream is part of the dream to make China stronger. With the development of space programs, the Chinese people will take bigger strides to explore further in space,"" he said, according to state media. The Shenzhou-10 mission -- hailed by Zhang Youxia, commander-in-chief of China's manned space program, as a ""complete success"" -- is part of Beijing's ambitious multi-billion dollar program to establish a manned space station by 2020. China only sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, but has made rapid advances in the intervening decade. Despite this, its space program is still yet to achieve capabilities reached by the U.S. and then the Soviet Union decades ago. China does not expect to put a man on the moon until after 2020, but plans to send a more advanced space lab, Tiangong-2, into orbit in 2015.","Three Chinese astronauts return after their country's longest manned space voyage .

"(CNN) -- A Russian fighter jet buzzed dangerously close to a U.S. military plane in April, a U.S. official said Tuesday, describing the fly-by as ""straight out of a movie."" The Russian jet flew within 100 feet of the nose of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane over the Sea of Okhotsk between Russia and Japan, a Defense Department official said. The fly-by ""put the lives of the U.S. crew in jeopardy,"" the U.S. official said, calling it ""one of the most dangerous close passes in decades."" The incident occurred on April 23, the Defense Department official said, when a U.S. Air Force RC-135U aircraft flying on a routine mission over the Sea of Okhotsk was intercepted by a Russian Su-27 Flanker aircraft. The Russian aircraft turned and ""showed its belly"" to the U.S. crew so they could see it was armed with missiles, a U.S. military official said Tuesday. The United States did not originally discuss or reveal the incident publicly because it chose to deal with it privately with Russian officials, the military official said. Earlier in April, U.S. officials said a Russian fighter jet made a dozen low-altitude passes over the USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea. On April 28, a Russian Defense Ministry statement said Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoygu and U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel had discussed both incidents during a phone call that day. In response, the statement said, Shoygu ""offered to instruct the commanders in chief of the armed forces of both countries to discuss possible additional measures to address the interests of both countries to prevent future misperceptions of actions."" A Defense Department readout of that call didn't mention the fly-bys. On Tuesday, the Defense Department official said senior leaders had communicated concerns about the incident directly to the Russian military.

"(CNN) -- When Betty Draper of ""Mad Men"" lit a cigarette on her son's school bus during a class trip, I cracked up. After all, the prospect of a 2014 mom smoking around her child's classmates is about as likely as teens giving up their smartphones. Motherhood has changed a lot since I grew up in the 1960s. Back then, women smoke and drank during pregnancy. (My mom says she even smoked in the hospital after delivering my sisters and me.) Today, expecting women add sushi and lunch meat to their alcohol and smoking bans. Back then, Dr. Spock was the only guide for child-rearing. Today, there are too many manuals to count and Google is just a click away from parental questions answered. Back then, we didn't have playdates. ""You went out in the yard or you went out in the street and played,"" my mom told me with a chuckle. Today, my kids have piano, soccer, basketball, gymnastics and hip-hop dance. How do you spell overscheduled? In conversations with moms raising children today and moms who had kids in the 1960s, '70s and '80s, they all agreed that motherhood is a whole lot different nowadays. The question is, has it changed for the better or worse? 'Less of that judgment' Lyz Lenz, a mom of two in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, says part of her wishes she was raising children in the early '80s, like her mom. ""I feel like in that pre-Internet era we weren't quite as exposed to other people's pet peeves,"" said Lenz, who writes a blog in her own name. ""There was less of that judgment and less of other people making you insecure. You didn't have to hop on Facebook and see a ton of different people telling you why giving your kid a processed cookie is child abuse."" What's different today, says Joanna Mazewski, a mom of two in Coconut Creek, Florida, is the level of paranoia. ""It seems like mothers these days are definitely more paranoid and uptight about every little detail of their children's lives, much more than they were 30, 40 years ago,"" said Mazewski, a Babble.com contributor. ""It just seems that parenthood altogether was much simpler without the education that we have now and the devices ... to be honest with you, I think I prefer the carefree method more than scared-of-everything-we-eat-and-even-our-shadows."" From Dr. Spock to Tiger Mom . Jeannette Kaplun, another Babble.com contributor, said the problem is that parents today suffer from ""information overload."" Dr. Spock was ""the bible for parents,"" when she was born in the 1970s, said the Miami mom of two and host of a bilingual blog called Hispana Global. ""Now you have attachment parenting, then you have 'tiger moms,' and people tell you to co-sleep. Others tell you that you are a terrible parent if you co-sleep ... and pediatricians will tell you one thing and then people will search online and they'll find a blog that says completely the opposite and so it's very confusing."" Google can be a friend for today's parents, but it also can be a foe, said Lenz, the mom from Cedar Rapids, who shared a story about how she went online late one night when she wasn't able to calm her crying daughter. ""I'm like, 'Oh no, maybe she has brain trauma or stomach problems,' and then it's like, 'Oh. No. She's just teething.' "" Ironically, Lenz's mom, Ellen Baranowski, who raised Lyz and her seven siblings starting in the early '80s, thinks the 24/7 access to information is one of the biggest and best parenting differences from when she was a mother. ""I think it's great being able to access the Internet at 2 o'clock in the morning when you are just scared to death,"" Ellen Baranowski said. Janis Brett Elspas, a mom of four in Los Angeles and host of the blog Mommy Blog Expert, said technology can be very powerful for parents today -- when it's used properly. ""It's almost like the Life Magazine of this century in that we're totally learning from each other's experiences through the Internet,"" she said. Less freedom, more schedules . Another difference between parenting then and now, moms say, is a loss of freedom and independence during childhood. When Baranowksi and her family moved to a small town in South Dakota from Dallas, she felt comfortable letting her children roam the neighborhood without her. ""My kids then could walk to the swimming pool by themselves, and do things that I had no idea what they were doing,"" the mom of eight said. Today, there's none of that. ""My grandkids are getting so scheduled and I understand why,"" she said. ""This is not a complaint on their parenting ... they can't have just unattended moments and it's sad."" Shannon Bradley-Colleary, a mom of two in Los Angeles who grew up in the '60s and '70s, remembers playing outside by herself as a kid. ""A lot of my favorite memories were playing 'war' ... until well after dark with no one even calling to see where I was. So do you think it was neglectful parenting?"" the host of the blog The Woman Formerly Known as Beautiful said with a laugh. She concedes there is a definite tradeoff between safety and independence in today's parenting. In her opinion, the tighter control is better, ultimately. ""I just think there's a pendulum swing or backlash from those of us raised in the late '60s, early '70s, which was that we were really left to our own devices, and what was great about that, was there was a feeling of autonomy and self-direction,"" she said. ""But there was a much greater risk."" 'You're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy' During my first-ever interview of my mom, Judy Wallace of Long Island, New York, I asked her to compare parenting back in the '60s and '70s, when she raised my sisters and me, with parenting today. ""The biggest difference is that I feel like you're all so concerned with keeping the kids busy, taking them everyplace and having to take up all their time with activities, where in the '60s, that wasn't the case,"" she said. ""When you were little, you would go out and play with your friends, you kind of entertained yourself more than the parents nowadays, who are constantly trying to entertain the kids."" But why did we move from the carefree, laissez-faire parenting of the '60s and '70s to the more frenetic helicopter approach of today? ""The reality is now we know more about what happens in the world ... so that obviously increases your perception of the world being much less safe,"" said Kaplun, the Miami mom of two. It's harder to parent today, says Brett Elspas, especially with the influence of media on our children. ""It's very, very hard unless you lead a life in a capsule ... Even if you home school your children, they are going to be exposed to stuff. You can't blind them and cover their ears and lead them through and hope they are going to turn out normally as an adult."" It could be hard, but we might reduce our stress and even have more fun if we take some notes from our own moms. We need to let our kids chart their own course and make their own mistakes, said Mazewski, the Coconut Creek mom of two. ""I've seen toddlers that are already on vegan diets. It's like, 'You've got to allow them to make their own decisions.'"" A little wisdom from my own mom: ""Kids have to learn disappointment, that they can't have everything and they can't do everything and they can't be good at everything."" What do you think are the biggest differences between parenting today and back in the '60s, '70s or '80s?

"New York (CNN) -- Security in Times Square will be the priority for New York Police Department this weekend as crowds pack the streets to herald the New Year. NYPD Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN Thursday that he plans to strategically deploy thousands of resources, including 35 mounted horses, explosives-sniffing dogs, and uniformed as well as plainclothes officers on Saturday. Kelly said the precautions are essential to combating the serious terror threat the city continues face in a post-9/11 world. COBRA teams to handle chemical, biological and radiological threats will be pre-deployed to key locations, according to the commissioner. ""We operate under the assumption that we're at the top of the terrorist target list, and we've had 14 attempts at terrorist-type attacks."" Kelly said. To that end, before event-goers enter Times Square they must pass through a comprehensive security checkpoint. These checkpoints will be erected at each of the 16 entrances to Times Square and will include metal and radiation detectors as well as bag searches. Backpacks and alcohol will not be permitted. Past the checkpoints, at least 500 cameras and numerous helicopters with infrared capacity will survey the 65 pens, constantly scanning for security threats and breaches, according Commissioner Kelly. For Kelly, coordination will be crucial, so the Joint Operations Center ""will be activated, where we have representatives from units throughout the department and federal, state and local agencies. So you can get face-to-face coordination, which is very important aspect of what we do."" Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to watch the ball drop, according to Times Square's official website. Kelly said that the department will seek to ensure the security and safety of the public so they can enjoy the festivities. ""I think it's something you have to do at least once,"" he said. ""It's sort of a once-in-a-lifetime experience. It's a happy event. It's an exciting event.""","NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly plans to deploy thousands of resources .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Friday that Ash Carter is his pick to replace outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. ""With a record of service that has spanned more than 30 years, Ash is quietly regarded as one of our nation's foremost national security leaders,"" Obama said Friday from the White House's Roosevelt Room, with Carter standing by his side. Carter himself said that it was an ""honor and a privilege"" to be nominated. ""If confirmed in this job, I pledge to you my most candid, strategic advice. I pledge also that you will receive equally candid military advice,"" Carter said. Hagel was scheduled to attend the ceremony as of Thursday night, but decided he wouldn't attend the ceremony, a Pentagon official told CNN on Friday. ""The Secretary believes strongly that this day belongs to Ash Carter and his nomination to be the next Secretary of Defense,"" the official said. ""As Secretary Hagel knows better than most, today is a day that is to celebrate Ash, his family, and all that he will accomplish. The Secretary is proud of Ash and of their friendship and does not want in any way to detract from or distract the proper focus of the day."" Carter is a well-decorated national security official who also is a former deputy defense secretary. The Philadelphia native has on several occasions been awarded the Department of Defense Distinguished Service Medal -- the department's highest honor -- and has received multiple medals for his contributions to intelligence. In addition to his service in national security, Carter also has a long list of academic accomplishments, ranging from a stint as professor and chair at Harvard's Kennedy School, to a physics instructor at Oxford. Carter was previously unanimously confirmed by the Senate for his deputy defense secretary job. So far, reaction to the potential nomination from Congress has been generally positive, with both Republicans and Democrats vocalizing support for his nomination.","President Obama nominates Ash Carter as defense secretary .

"(CNN) -- Search teams looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 are investigating a number of sounds detected by ships in the southern Indian Ocean, authorities said Sunday, but it's not yet clear if any of them are from the missing plane's so-called black box. A British Royal Navy vessel is on its way to an area where a Chinese ship reported picking up electronic signals twice, once on Friday and again on Saturday, said Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating search operations. And the Australian naval ship Ocean Shield, which has highly sophisticated equipment, is pursuing ""an acoustic noise"" that it detected in a different area, Houston said at a news conference. He said the detections were ""an important and encouraging lead,"" but he cautioned that they be treated ""carefully"" as they haven't been verified as being related to Flight 370. Fevered search . Searchers are desperately seeking any clue about the location of the airliner that disappeared nearly a month ago with 239 people on board. Up to 10 military planes, two civil aircraft and 13 ships will assist in Sunday's search for the airline. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) plans to search three separate areas Sunday about 2,000 kilometers (about 1,240 miles) northwest of Perth. That area totals about 216,000 square kilometers (83,000 square miles). Australian planes are being deployed to the area where the Chinese ship, Haixun 01, picked up signals that would be consistent with those emitted by an aircraft's flight recorders, said Houston, the chief coordinator of Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre. A number of white objects were sighted about 56 miles (90 kilometers) away from where the sound was detected, he said. But he stressed that were was so far no confirmation that the signals and objects are related to Flight 370. ""In the days, weeks and possibly months ahead, there may be leads such as the one I'm reporting to you this morning on a regular basis,"" Houston, a retired air chief marshal, said. Handheld hydrophone . Video on Chinese state-run CCTV shot Saturday shows crew members from the Haixun 01 boarding a small yellow dinghy and using what appears to be a handheld hydrophone. The three men on board lower the device into the water on a pole. The handheld ping-locating technology used by the Chinese ship is not as versatile as a U.S. Navy towed locator, which goes as deep as 20,000 feet, far from surface noise, according to experts. The U.S. Navy hydrophone -- or underwater microphone, is on board the Australian ship Ocean Shield, which recently joined the search for Flight 370. The state-run Chinese news agency, Xinhua, said a detector deployed by the Haixun 01 patrol ship picked up the signal around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude. That puts it about 1,020 miles (1,640 kilometers) west-northwest of Perth, Australia, between current and previous search zones, and about 220 miles (354 kilometers) south of the closest of the three areas searched Saturday, said Judson Jones, a meteorologist with CNN International. Houston said Sunday that the sounds were detected ""in the high probability area."" White objects spotted . Also found Saturday -- spotted by a Chinese air force search plane -- were white objects floating near the search area. Investigators have failed to link any of the many previous sightings of debris to the missing plane. But the proximity of the two finds raised hopes that this time might be different. The ship first detected a signal Friday but couldn't record it because the signal stopped abruptly, a Shanghai-based Communist Party newspaper said. The signal detected Saturday, the Jiefang Daily said, occurred at 3:57 p.m. Beijing time (3:57 a.m. ET) and lasted about a minute and a half. It was not clear whether the signal had anything to do with the missing plane. A China Central Television correspondent aboard the Haixun-01 (pronounced ""high shuen"") reported that the 37.5 kHz signal was detected for a minute and a half. Fleeting acoustic . Houston confirmed the two separate detections and said they showed ""some promise."" But the signals picked up by the Chinese searchers were ""fleeting acoustic events,"" he said. ""It's not a continuous transmission. If you get close to the device, we should be receiving it for a longer period of time."" The signal ""is the standard beacon frequency"" for the plane's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder, said Anish Patel, president of pinger manufacturer Dukane Seacom. ""They're identical."" The frequency was chosen for use in the recorders ""to give that standout quality that does not get interfered with by the background noise that readily occurs in the ocean."" But he said he would like to see more evidence. ""I'd like to see some additional assets on site quickly -- maybe some sonobuoys,"" he said, referring to 5-inch-long sonar systems that are dropped from aircraft or ships. And he said he was puzzled that only one signal had been detected, since each of the recorders was equipped with a pinger, which is also called a beacon. No confirmation . Other experts cautioned that no confirmation had been made that the signal was linked to the missing plane. ""It ought to be easy to rule it in or rule it out, and they ought to go do it,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and a former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. Saturday's leads came as concern was rising that the batteries powering the missing Boeing 777's locator pingers would soon go dead. The plane disappeared on March 8; its batteries were guaranteed to work for 30 days underwater, and are predicted to die slowly over the following days. Monday marks day 30. The batteries on Flight 370's black boxes were due to be replaced in June, the Malaysia Airlines chief executive said Saturday. ""We can confirm there is a maintenance program. Batteries are replaced prior to expiration,"" Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said. Relative reacts . The tentative nature of the first report of an acoustic signal was not lost on one Chinese relative of one of those aboard. ""There is not confirmation, and we are all waiting patiently,"" the relative told CNN Producer Judy Kwon in a text message. Still, Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, was sanguine: ""Another night of hope-praying hard,"" he tweeted in response to the initial detection. ""We've had a lot of red herrings, hyperbole on this whole search,"" said oceanographer Simon Boxall, a lecturer in ocean and earth science at the University of Southampton. ""I'd really like to see this data confirmed."" If this proves to be what investigators have been searching for, ""then the possibility of recovering the plane -- or at least the black boxes -- goes from being one in a million to almost certain,"" he said. But, he added, ""It could be a false signal."" CNN aviation analyst David Soucie was less skeptical. ""This is a pinger,"" the airplane accident investigator said. ""I've been doing this a lot of years, and I can't think of anything else it could be."" CNN's Tom Watkins, Laura Smith-Spark, Tom Cohen, Miles O'Brien, Pam Boykoff, David Molko, Will Ripley, Ingrid Formanek, Kevin Wang, Ben Brumfield, Pam Brown and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.","NEW: A Chinese ship picked up a signal on Friday and Saturday, authorities say .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. investigators are looking into accusations that a company hired by the U.S. military supplied corroded and decades-old Chinese ammunition to the Afghan Army and police. Efraim Diveroli, 22, is president of AEY Inc., an arms dealer suspended by the Defense Department. The U.S. government has suspended AEY Inc. of Miami, Florida, for violating its contract, according to U.S. Army documents obtained by CNN. The Army and House Oversight Committee identified the president of AEY Inc. as Efraim E. Diveroli. He is a 22-year-old whose father started the company as a small printing company, according to WFOR-TV, a CNN affiliate in Miami.  Watch father describe 'boy genius' » . The government is conducting a criminal investigation into allegations that AEY Inc. knowingly misrepresented what the company would provide the Afghan security forces. Under the contract, AEY said it would supply ammunition manufactured in Hungary. But an investigation by the Army found most of the bullets were made in China, a violation of the contract, according to the Army documents. U.S. regulations bar companies from purchasing weapons or ammunition from a Chinese military company directly or indirectly, according to U.S. military officials. U.S. government investigators took numerous photographs of the ammunition showing that it was improperly packaged and corroding, according to the Army documents. The Department of the Army, the contracting authority for the government, sent a letter to Diveroli on Wednesday informing him that he and his company were suspended from contracting with the U.S. government until the investigation is complete. The Army documents show that since 2004 the company entered agreements with the U.S. government that totaled about $10 million. The papers also reveal the company struck it big in 2007 with contracts totaling more than $200 million to supply ammunition, assault rifles and other weapons to the Afghan National Army and Police. When that ammunition arrived in Afghanistan, U.S. officials were contacted because of its unsatisfactory condition. Army criminal investigators were sent to look at the packages in January. They took hundreds of pictures showing ammunition dumped in deteriorated and broken cardboard boxes and wrapped in plastic, according to the Army documents. The documents also reveal ammunition was corroded and made in China from 1962 through 1974. According to U.S. government regulations, the alleged misrepresentation by AEY could bring a fine, five years imprisonment or both. Additionally, if AEY is found in violation of the contract the company will be permanently barred from doing business with the U.S. government. The House Oversight Committee plans to hold a hearing into the matter on April 17. ""The hearing will examine the company's financial history, past performance and compliance with U.S. law and government contracting regulations,"" the committee said in a statement late Thursday. The hearing also will examine ""the federal government's efforts to investigate allegations that AEY may have violated U.S. law and government contracting regulations,"" the committee said.

"(CNN) -- On its face, the now-viral photo of Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt taking a ""selfie"" with President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameronâ€”at a memorial service for anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela, no lessâ€”looks wildly inappropriate. And no question, President Obama has taken a lot of media heat for participating. (It didn't help that the expression on Michelle Obama's face appeared to be disapproving.) In the realm of funeral etiquette, those two factorsâ€”the memorial service, the glowering wife-- taken together, scream ""social faux pas."" But there was more to the story behind the image. Roberto Schmidt, the photographer who captured the photo told the ""Today"" show that he shot the picture during a jovial, celebratory portion of the service. He said people were dancing, singing and laughing as they celebrated the life of Nelson Mandela. Michelle Obama, he said, had been laughing along with the trio seconds before he snapped the image. Understood. But a few questions remain. Is it proper to take a selfie at a funeral? And was President Obama out of line for doing so -- because he is the president, you know. Under the circumstances Schmidt described, I'd say the selfie was not necessarily in poor taste for the President. But was it poor form? As President of the United States, a man watched and scrutinized at every angle, he is no doubt very careful about how his behavior is perceived. He surely knew that picture would wind up pinging around the Internet and on the evening news and cleverly headlined front pages. Perhaps he wanted to send a message to the people, anyway, to say, ""Hey, I'm just like you."" Now if he wanted to avoid the scrutiny altogether and send a more somber message to the public, he might have held off and joined in on the picture in a more private setting. The moment, however, did not seem to call for such discretion. What's my bottom line? President Obama's behavior was appropriate for that particular occasion, for that particular culture at that precise moment. And what is the protocol for behavior at funerals for the rest of us: selfies and beyond? Well, if you, too, happen to attend a funeral or memorial service at a stadium where the people are up dancing and singing and laughing in the aisles, then it's perfectly fine to take a selfie with your seat mates. The key here is that there is a proper time and place for everything, and that's where decorum comes in. That I would need to explain this will seem surprising to some, but this is, after all, a time when websites such as Selfies at a Funeral exist. So bear with me: Firing off a selfie during a solemn moment such as the prayer or scripture reading is highly inappropriate and terribly disrespectful. The same shot during the gathering or meal service afterward is all right. Taking photos within the confines of the church or synagogue or funeral home can be perceived as highly inappropriate. It is important to be aware of this and remain respectful of the family, the culture and the environment you are in. Funerals and memorials take on a different meaning from culture to culture; some are very somber, others quite celebratory. It is our duty to be sensitive to the entire moment and in some cases it might be difficult to tell what that requires. Here's a handy rule of thumb: To avoid offending, err on the side of caution and just hold off on that selfie until the funeral has ended. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Elaine Swann.","Elaine Swann: Obama ""selfie"" with Denmark PM at Mandela memorial looked inappropriate .
But photog said it was during celebratory part of service; first lady had been smiling, too .

"(CNN) -- India's Mars Orbiter Mission successfully entered Mars' orbit Wednesday morning, becoming the first nation to arrive on its first attempt and the first Asian country to reach the Red Planet. ""We have gone beyond the boundaries of human enterprise and human imagination,"" declared India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who watched from the space agency's nerve center in Bangalore. ""We have accurately navigated our spacecraft through a route known to a very few."" The staff at the Indian Space Research Organization erupted into applause and cheers after learning that the Mars Orbiter Mission, also known as Mangalyaan, reached the planet's orbit and made history. Before Wednesday, only the United States, Europe and the Soviets have successfully sent spacecraft to Mars. ""The odds were stacked against us,"" Modi said. ""Of the 51 missions attempted so far, a mere 21 had succeeded. But we have prevailed."" And India reached Mars with significantly less money. With a price tag of $74 million, the Mars Orbiter Mission cost a mere fraction of the $671 million NASA spent on its MAVEN spacecraft, which arrived to Mars earlier this week. Some space observers noted that India's Mars orbiter cost less than the $100 million budget for the space thriller film ""Gravity."" Interactive: Exploring Mars from Viking to MAVEN . ""It shows how optimal is the design, that way we're able to cut cost and we're not compromising quality,"" said S. Satish, a space expert based in Bangalore. The groundbreaking Mars mission wasn't without controversy -- with some critics who said India should spend the money on other issues. The spacecraft launched on November 5, and has traveled over 650 million kilometers to enter Mars orbit. Its mission is to orbit the Red Planet, mapping its surface and studying the atmosphere. The Mars Orbiter kicked off its interplanetary debut with its own Twitter account. The mission has been freighted with patriotic significance for India since its inception and is seen as a symbolic coup over its rival, China, which is also ramping up its space ambitions. China's joint mission with Russia in 2011, which contained the Chinese Mars satellite Yinhuo-1, stalled and eventually fell back to Earth. Japan's 1998 attempt with the spacecraft Nozomi was also unsuccessful due to fuel problems. Once nears Mars' orbit, India's spacecraft had to execute a series of complicated and critical maneuvers. About half of all spacecraft sent on missions to the planet have veered off course, malfunctioned or crashed. India's Mars Orbiter Mission is in the company of NASA's two Mars rovers on the ground, a European orbiter and NASA orbiters including the MAVEN, which has been there since Sunday. The United States has expressed interest in cooperating with India as their spacecraft gather data about the planet. NASA congratulated India via Twitter. As did Curiosity, the Mars rover.","India's Mars Orbiter Mission entered Mars' orbit Wednesday .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A third person died Friday from an explosion at a rocket test pad operated by a private company in California's southern Mojave Desert, according to the nursing supervisor at Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield. A bird's eye view of the scene in Mojave, California, shows charred wreckage and large pieces of debris. The explosion, which occurred Thursday at the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, initially killed two people and critically injured four others. On Friday three people remained hospitalized -- two in critical condition, one in serious condition. The six were employed by Scaled Composites, an aerospace development company founded 25 years ago by Burt Rutan, the aerospace engineer who designed the first plane to fly nonstop around the world without refueling. According to Rutan, the blast occurred during a test involving nitrous oxide flowing through fuel injectors. A source said the workers were testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo, which is a spaceship being built for Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson's space tourism company. ""We were doing a test that we believed was completely safe. ... We don't know why it exploded,"" said Rutan, who was not at the site at the time of the accident.  Watch the aftermath of the explosion » . The explosion happened during a ""cold fire test,"" he said. A spokeswoman for the space port, which is about 80 miles north of Los Angeles, said the blast was on a remote pad and that the area had been contained. Aerial video of the blast aftermath showed a charred and twisted flatbed trailer attached to a truck cab with a large silver tank next to it. Large pieces of debris appeared to be strewn for hundreds of yards from the center. Rutan won the Ansari X-Prize in 2004 for the first repeat sub-orbital space flight with his pioneering SpaceShipOne. SpaceShipTwo is a small carbon fiber craft designed to carry seven passengers up to 65 miles above the earth, traveling at a speed of about 12,000 mph. A ticket for such a ride was expected to cost $200,000. Entering the edge of space those on board will experience weightlessness for about 15 minutes before beginning the journey back to earth. ""What we're trying to do is make space travel affordable and fun. Two years from now we'll be starting to take ordinary people into space,"" Branson told CNN in 2006. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Jessica Ennis is set to cash in after winning heptathlon gold for Olympic hosts Great Britain, but fame and fortune are not the motivation for the poster girl of London 2012. ""If there was no money, I'd still be here doing it. I just want to achieve all I can achieve in sport and win medals and that's the most important thing,"" the 26-year-old told CNN. However, Ennis is aware of some of the commercial opportunities that will come her way in the aftermath of the Games . ""I also want to enjoy some of the things that are going to come up as well as a result of this but more than anything I'm just so happy and relieved I was able to get the gold and that's the most important thing for me,"" she said. Ennis set the capacity crowd in the Olympic Stadium alight last Saturday as she powered to victory in the heptathlon's final event over 800 meters to set the seal on a dominant performance. ""You know people really expected me to win, to do well, it was still a great position to be in though because I'd not experienced anything like that before,"" she said. ""I just tried to use all that pressure and turn it into positiveness and support."" Ennis came up just 45 points shy of the magical 7,000 mark for the seven events, which was the fifth best tally in heptathlon history. The 2009 world champion took a commanding lead from the start and never let up. ""I knew how hard it was going to be, and it's not just one day -- it's two days of really tough competition. I knew that I just had to really keep my eye on the ball and not get distracted by what other people expected of me,"" Ennis said. Her triumph has been met with acclaim across Britain, which is third in the medal table with 22 golds -- three more than at Beijing 2008, with four days to go. Many have rushed to congratulate her, but so far nothing official from British Prime Minister David Cameron. ""I've not had a call from the Prime Minister, no,"" Ennis said. She is reminded that President Barack Obama is regularly on the line to successful American athletes. ""Does he? I'll have to have a word then,"" said Ennis, with a smile on her face.","Jessica Ennis won Olympic gold for hosts Britain in heptathlon .

Whether it's a raised star-bed or a treehouse kitted out for sleeping, each of these six retreats spread across Africa has the elevated experience just right. Kiboko and Koija Star Beds, Loisaba Wilderness, Kenya . These ""star beds"" comprise wooden platforms with thatched roofs, open decks and big beds. They're rolled out under the night sky when it's time to sleep, giving guests great views of the thick star clusters, unclouded by light pollution. The mosquito net draping over the four-poster becomes invisible once you've climbed inside. You can end up at your star bed after a game drive or other wildlife outing, when staff will be lighting the campfire and preparing pre-dinner sundowners.

The Russian has been confirmed as Toro Rosso's new driver for the 2014 season, replacing Red Bull-bound Daniel Ricciardo. Kvyat will partner Jean-Eric Vergne after graduating through the Red Bull Junior Driver Program. 'Fantastic' ""This is fantastic news, a dream come true and I want to thank Red Bull and Toro Rosso for giving me this priceless opportunity,"" Kvyat told the team's website. ""Ever since I began karting, I wanted to get to Formula One and now that wish will become reality next season. ""I had a brief taste of working with the Toro Rosso team when I drove for them at the Silverstone test and I enjoyed the experience very much.

Kvyat, who is based in Rome, has been participating in GP3 and the European Formula Three championship while also testing for Toro Rosso at a young driver session at Silverstone last July. Last year, Kvyatt won the Formula Renault 2.0 title with seven race victories.

"(CNN) -- After 116 years, it seems the Olympic movement has finally embraced equality. For the first time in the history of the quadrennial Summer Games, every one of the 204 competing nations at London 2012 is represented by both male and female athletes. World stars such as heptathlete Jessica Ennis, swimming sensation Missy Franklin and sprinting champion Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce enjoy media profiles which rival those of their male counterparts. Coupled with the historic decision to allow female athletes from Qatar and Saudi Arabia to compete at the Games for the first time, it shows how far the Olympic movement has come since the Amsterdam Games of 1928. Food, glorious food: Olympic athletes' extreme eating habits . That was when women were given the chance to become Olympians for the first time. You would think those ground-breaking first champions would be world-renowned for their pioneering efforts. But you would be wrong. Just take the remarkable case of Betty Robinson -- one of the forgotten female heroes of track and field. ""She's not terribly important anymore,"" past president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, Bill Mallon, told CNN. ""She probably had a little bit of influence back then as the first woman to win a gold medal in track and field, but she was very little-known. ""Women's track and field was not very popular in the U.S. at that time and she didn't get a whole lot of publicity, so she was overshadowed."" Recordbreakers, medals and Phelps: The numbers behind the 2012 Olympics . That she is so forgotten is remarkable given her astonishing life. Imagine Usain Bolt had taken up sprinting just four months before his world-record-smashing run at the 2008 Olympics. Now imagine the Jamaican star was just 16 years old when he wowed the world in Beijing, and you begin to get an idea of what American schoolgirl Robinson achieved 84 years ago. Robinson, of Riverdale, Illinois, dashed to 100 meters gold wearing a skirt and vest, an outfit a million miles from the skintight speed suits worn today, in just her sixth competitive race. Yet that victory was just the start of her most extraordinary story. Can Usain Bolt make Olympic history? In April 1931, three years after that historic win, Robinson was involved in a plane crash over Chicago. Having being discovered on the roadside by a passerby who took her for dead, Robinson was bundled into the trunk of a car and driven to a mortuary. After the error was eventually spotted, she remained unconscious for seven weeks, but her injuries were so severe she was unable to compete for three and a half years. Even when she returned to the track, the damage to Robinson's leg meant she was unable to crouch in the starting blocks. No matter. Robinson still managed to run in the 4 x 100m relay at the 1936 Berlin Games. Eight years after bursting onto the Olympic scene, Robinson ran the third leg of the relay for the U.S team, helping them win gold under the watching eye of Adolf Hitler and Germany's Nazi rulers. The German quartet, which qualified fastest for the final in a world-record time, were disqualified after dropping the baton. For Robinson it was a remarkable rise, fall and rise, made all the more unfathomable when you consider she was only discovered as an athlete when one of her school teachers spotted her running to catch a train. Four track meets and six races later, Robinson was an Olympic champion and a joint world record-holder. ""She ran her first race that we know of in March 1928,"" Mallon said. ""She was a natural talent. She finished second in that race behind U.S. record-holder Helen Filkey. In the second race she ever ran she tied the record for the 100m, which got her to the Olympic trials where she finished second."" Despite her landmark medal, Robinson's low-key profile was at odds with her achievements both during her life and since her death from cancer in 1999. The crash which damaged her leg also robbed her of her peak years. When she should have been cementing her position as the world's fastest woman, Robinson watched other sprinters assume her mantel. ""In 1932 Babe Didrikson (a gold medalist in hurdling and the javelin at the Los Angeles Games of 1932) came in and evolved into the big name and pushed everyone else onto the sidelines,"" said Mallon. Robinson's athletic honors may not have brought her the fame and fortune her modern-day equivalents enjoy, but it did not diminish her passion for the sport she had left such an indelible footprint on. ""She married and raised a family,"" Mallon said. ""She stayed involved in track and field with the Amateur Athletics Union in the U.S. doing timekeeping at meets and she did some public speaking as well."" Perhaps Robinson's relative anonymity is a saddening, if inevitable consequence of the passing of time. ""It's a shame,"" said the American historian. ""In Britain people know about gold medalists like Bradley Wiggins and Steven Redgrave, but I could tell you about athletes from the 1920s or 30s who most of the British public wouldn't know about."" So when the women's 100m champion is crowned at the London Games on Saturday, it is unlikely the champion or the vast majority of the 80,000 crowd in the Olympic Stadium will have the faintest idea who Robinson was. But, by crossing the line first in Amsterdam all those years, ago, she guaranteed her place in the history books, even if it's not on the front page.","Betty Robinson won women's 100m gold at the 1928 Games in Amsterdam .

"(CNN) -- He was an outspoken critic of one war, but a hero in another. He was a leading Democrat who came from Republican roots. He was a politician who cared more about being on the right side of an issue than on the popular side. George Stanley McGovern -- a staunch liberal who served South Dakota in the U.S. Senate and House for more than two decades and who ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic Party nominee for president in 1972 -- died Sunday at the age of 90, his family said. ""Our wonderful father, George McGovern, passed away peacefully at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls, SD, surrounded by our family and life-long friends,"" his family said in a statement. Highlights of George McGovern's life . ""We are blessed to know that our father lived a long, successful and productive life advocating for the hungry, being a progressive voice for millions and fighting for peace."" President Barack Obama praised McGovern as someone who showed a lifelong love of country. ""When the people of South Dakota sent him to Washington, this hero of war became a champion for peace,"" the president said in a written statement. ""And after his career in Congress, he became a leading voice in the fight against hunger. George was a statesman of great conscience and conviction."" Others remembered him for the changes he brought to politics. ""I think he'll be remembered, obviously, for his stance on the war in Vietnam,"" said Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico, ""but also for his contributions on agriculture, on hunger. ""And then the Democratic Party. He transformed the party, the primary system, getting minorities involved. He was a gigantic figure and a classy, good, good guy."" Politicians pay tribute . Funeral services are scheduled to take place in Sioux Falls on Friday, one day after a public viewing in the same city. Bill and Hillary Clinton said they first met McGovern while campaigning for him in 1972. The former president and current secretary of state said McGovern never stopped speaking out for the causes he believed in. ""We must continue to draw inspiration from his example and build the world he fought for,"" the Clintons said in a written statement. ""The world has lost a tireless advocate for human rights and dignity."" The son of a Methodist minister who was a Republican, McGovern was born in Avon, South Dakota, on July 19, 1922. Six years later, his family moved an hour north to Mitchell, where McGovern graduated from Mitchell High School in 1940. His debating skills won him a scholarship to Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, where he met fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg. Three years later, they married. All five of their children were born in Mitchell. McGovern's political skills came to the fore in college, where he was twice elected class president and won the state oratorical contest on the topic ""My Brother's Keeper,"" which laid out his liberal beliefs. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Forces and went on to fly 35 combat missions as a B-24 bomber pilot in Europe. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war, he returned to college, graduating in 1946. McGovern attended Garrett Seminary for a year before entering Northwestern University in Chicago, where he got his master's and doctoral degrees in American history and government. He returned to Dakota Wesleyan University in 1950 as a professor of history and political science, leaving in 1955 to help the South Dakota Democratic Party and launch his political career. In 1956, he won a seat in Congress. He was re-elected two years later. After losing a bid for the U.S. Senate in 1960, McGovern was named special assistant to the president and director of the Food for Peace Program by President John F. Kennedy. Opinion: McGovern, a strong man who overcame defeat . Two years later, he was elected to the Senate. He was re-elected in 1968 and 1974. He served on Senate committees on agriculture, nutrition, forestry and foreign relations, and the Joint Economic Committee. He also served three years on the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, which changed the way states picked their delegates, before leaving it in 1971 to run for president. In 1972, McGovern was selected as the Democratic Party nominee for president on a platform that included ending the war in Vietnam at a time when the country was torn over U.S. involvement there. ""Let us resolve that never again will we send the precious young blood of this country to die trying to prop up a corrupt military dictatorship abroad,"" he said, to applause, at the Democratic convention in Miami Beach, Florida. He called the unemployment of more than 5 million Americans ""the most false and wasteful economics of all"" and said his highest domestic priority would be ""to ensure that every American able to work has a job to do."" He called for an end to a system of economic controls ""in which labor is depressed but prices and corporate profits run sky high,"" and he called for national health insurance and ""a fair and just tax system."" But the campaign started out poorly. He selected as running mate Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, after a background check that did not turn up the fact that Eagleton had been treated for mental illness, which was revealed soon after. Eagleton withdrew and McGovern then tapped Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy and U.S. ambassador to France. The pair ended up losing in a lopsided vote for incumbent Richard Nixon, with the McGovern ticket earning only 17 electoral votes -- from Massachusetts and the District of Columbia -- to Nixon's 520. McGovern reflected on that defeat in a September piece in The Washington Post, calling it ""a significant personal setback"" that left him ""genuinely stunned."" Opinion: McGovern was ahead of his time . ""The loss is there, an old wound never fully healed. My disappointment was certainly personal, made deeper by the awareness that many thousands of young Americans, and far more Vietnamese and other Asian citizens, were going to and did lose their lives with the Nixon administration's continuation of the war,"" he wrote. ""And I was upset that my supporters would carry the burden of the loss, too -- something that has weighed on me all these years."" But he added, ""I am optimistic about the country, and I am convinced that McGovern for President 1972 helped put those ideals within sight and completion today."" Sen. John Kerry said Sunday that McGovern never let the political popularity of a subject determine whether he supported a cause. ""George McGovern was a voice of clarity and conviction at a time when America needed it most,"" Kerry said. ""He spoke to many of us who opposed the war but loved our country, because he was the genuine article, a soft-spoken, decent and gentle man who lived a remarkable life with humility."" After his presidential loss, McGovern returned to the Senate, where he was re-elected in 1974. But he was beaten when he sought a fourth term in 1980, a victim of what became known as the Reagan Revolution that swept conservatives into power and their views into vogue. Four years later, he tried again to win the Democratic presidential nomination, but dropped out. Former Vice President Walter Mondale became the nominee -- only to lose to Reagan in another lopsided race. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said Sunday that McGovern was more than a very down-to-earth man. ""George was actually a very complicated person,"" Gingrich said. ""He was not a pacifist. His argument over Vietnam was about that particular war. He was a citizen."" After leaving the Senate, McGovern taught at a number of schools, including Columbia University, Northwestern University, Cornell University, American University and the University of Berlin. He served as the president of the Middle East Policy Council from 1991 to 1998. President Clinton appointed him ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome and, in 2000, awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In 2001, McGovern was named the first United Nations global ambassador on hunger. In the 2008 presidential campaign, McGovern switched his allegiance from Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama. But in a 2009 commentary in the Post, he lashed out at the Obama administration over its policies in Afghanistan and reflected on one of the hallmarks of his political life. ""As a U.S. senator during the 1960s, I agonized over the badly mistaken war in Vietnam,"" McGovern wrote. ""After doing all I could to save our troops and the Vietnamese people from a senseless conflict, I finally took my case to the public in my presidential campaign in 1972. Speaking across the nation, I told audiences that the only upside of the tragedy in Vietnam was that its enormous cost in lives and dollars would keep any future administration from going down that road again.

"(CNN) -- Daniel Ricciardo is daring to dream -- just not too big yet. Halfway through a sensational first Formula One season with reigning constructors' champion Red Bull, it is easy to see why the Australian is in reflective mood. Ricciardo returns to the track at next week's Belgium Grand Prix with two race wins in his pocket after he followed up a career-first in Canada with victory last time out in Hungary. With eight races left to run, the 25-year-old finds himself in the unusual position of being the only driver apart from dueling Mercedes duo Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton to take the checkered flag this season. ""I definitely don't look too far ahead,"" Ricciardo told CNN's The Circuit at Red Bull Racing's headquarters near Milton Keynes, England. ""I don't get over-excited. I just try and focus on getting all the steps right and then believe that will turn into a good string of results. ""I've just got to keep doing what I'm doing and keep learning as I go along."" With the mighty Mercedes pair out in front of the field, Ricciardo knows he is unlikely to snatch the title from their grasp in the second half of the year. Blog: The steel of F1's bubbly new star . But after such an encouraging start, Ricciardo -- who is 71 points behind championship leader Rosberg -- doesn't want to shackle his ambition. ""Since I entered F1 the second part of the season has always gone better for me,"" he said. ""I seem to learn from the first six months and really put it towards better results in the second half of the year. ""We will see how it's going and try to get a few more wins."" Red Bull's newest recruit is also keen to retain the upper hand over his illustrious teammate Sebastian Vettel, having impressed since making the step up from Red Bull's sister team Toro Rosso. Ricciardo has out-qualified the four-time world champion at six of the 11 grands prix so far this season, and a 9-2 lead in race position (including his Australian GP result before he was later disqualified for a fuel-flow irregularity). ""I won't lie to you -- it feels great,"" Ricciardo said of his performance compared with the German. ""He is an awesome benchmark to judge myself on. ""To have shown really good speed against him, not only in qualifying but in races as well, has been encouraging. I'm enjoying that."" The F1 season resumes next week at the legendary Spa-Francorchamps circuit set amid the Ardennes forest in Belgium. The fast, flowing and undulating track is unlikely to play to the strengths of Red Bull's car, which has lagged behind Mercedes in terms of straight-line speed. ""Spa is a fun track,"" said Ricciardo. ""You feel like, in a way, you get a little bit lost out there. You feel like you're driving in a forest. ""There are some very long straights, which will unfortunately give a bit of lap time away. ""We will see -- it is probably going to be one of those tracks where we're there or thereabouts."" The same can be said of Ricciardo this season -- there or thereabouts, and then some.

"(CNN) -- Mercedes Formula One team is facing a million dollar question -- and it has decided to ask the audience. After another bruising on-track encounter between its drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at the Belgian Grand Prix, Mercedes is considering introducing team orders for the remaining seven races. The team's head of motorsport Toto Wolff described Sunday's lap two clash, which effectively ended Hamilton's race and Rosberg's chance of victory, as ""unacceptable."" ""It has been our clear policy to let the drivers race this year but rule number one is: don't hit each other,"" Wolff told reporters in Spa. ""To see that kind of contact, so early in the race, is an unacceptable level of risk to be taking out on track. ""It cannot -- and will not -- happen again."" To make sure it doesn't, Mercedes asked its half a million Twitter followers for advice on Thursday. ""Team orders or free racing? There has been a lot of debate since Belgium -- this is a chance to have your say,"" it asked via Twitter. It then posted two options, one in favor of team orders and another in favor of free racing. Fans were asked to vote on the issue by either retweeting or marking their preferred option as a favorite. The team then announced the result of the vote after four hours of voting, revealing 92% of the audience wanted the drivers to be allowed to continue to race each other. Proving just how thorny the issue of team orders is in F1, Mercedes then asked: ""To those who would prefer to see team orders implemented, how would you employ them? ""To the 92% in favor of free racing, what sanctions would you impose for breaking the 'no contact' rule? Would you suspend a driver for a race and not maximize constructors' points? Perhaps you'd set the order at qualifying slots?"" Rosberg and Hamilton are locked in an intense rivalry for the 2014 world title. The German is now 29 points -- more than a race win -- ahead of his English rival and former teenage friend. It seems when it comes to solving the problem at Mercedes there are no easy answers, even for the team itself.","Mercedes has asked its Twitter audience for advice on introducing team orders .

"(CNN) -- Red Bull's Max Verstappen will make Formula One history in 2015, as the youngest driver in the history of the sport. The Toro Rosso team, owned by Red Bull, has confirmed the 16-year-old Dutchman will be one of its two drivers next season, replacing Jean-Eric Vergne. That means when Verstappen takes to the grid for the first race of 2015 in Australia at the tender age of 17, he will break new ground in the elite division of motorsport. ""Ever since I was seven years old, Formula One has been my career goal, so this opportunity is truly a dream come true,"" he told Toro Rosso's official website. ""First of all, I would like to thank Dr Helmut Marko and Red Bull for all their trust and giving me the chance to make my Formula One debut in 2015 with Scuderia Toro Rosso. ""With the return of the Verstappen name to Formula One, I hope we can relive old memories and I'm hoping to see many fans at all the grand prix circuits."" Verstappen will be almost two years younger than the previous record holder -- Jaime Alguersuari who was 19 years and 125 days when he drove at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. He is currently in contention to win the FIA Formula 3 European Championship having become karting world champion last year. Verstappen's father Jos has over 100 grand prix starts to his name between 1994 and 2002 and made his F1 debut alongside Michael Schumacher for Benetton. He famously escaped a dramatic pit lane fire that engulfed his car during the 1994 German Grand Prix at Hockenheim with only minor burns. ""We are happy to welcome Max into the Toro Rosso family,"" said Toro Rosso team principal Franz Tost. ""It's great to see how the Red Bull Junior Program continues to find talented young drivers and gives them the opportunity to come into Formula One. ""We consider Max to be as one of the most skilled young drivers of the new generation and we believe he has the necessary maturity and mental strength to take on this challenge successfully."" Verstappen will drive alongside Daniil Kvyat in 2015 but Vergne's future is now in doubt. Daniel Ricciardo was chosen over the Frenchman to make the leap to the full Red Bull team this season. Tost added of Vergne: ""We hope ... that he will be able to end the second half of this season on a high note and thereby show that he still deserves another opportunity in Formula One.""

"(CNN) -- A grand prix in austerity-hit Greece could be on the horizon according to Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone. On May 30, Ecclestone's company Formula One Licensing registered the 'Formula 1 Mediterranean Grand Prix' as a trademark. ""The Greeks are keen,"" Ecclestone told CNN. ""They want me to go and see the Prime Minister or the mayor,"" added Ecclestone, referring to Antonis Samaras and Georgios Kaminis respectively. ""We will have to find out if they have got any money."" Total investment of around $1 billion is required to build a track from scratch and cover the F1 hosting fee, which typically runs for 10 years. Private investors are looking at the construction of a track in the Keratsini-Drapetsona municipality, which is six miles to the west of Athens. It would be hard for Greece to justify a publicly funded investment after receiving more than â‚¬150 billion in bailouts following the recent recession, with unemployment still above 27 percent -- the highest in eurozone. ""Greece has experienced, and still is in the middle of, a massive crisis, but is now on the verge of stabilization and turning things around very slowly,"" said Greece's leading F1 journalist Dimitris Papadopoulos. ""Priorities must be set on where government funding will go and I'm pretty sure that an F1 race is not on the priority list on that level. ""We should, however, point out that private initiatives are looking at the possibility of funding the construction of a street circuit in the area of Drapetsona and the hosting of a race. ""The plans have been laid, financial studies have been completed, and the project has been presented to interested parties for financing. ""The Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras sent a letter to the mayor of Drapetsona, by which he provided his full support to this attempt and that is based on private funding."" Legacy . Athanasios Papatheodorou -- track architect for the prospective race promoter Dielpis -- says that ""the Prime Minister himself has supported fully the initiative for organizing F1 races and is looking forward to the instruction from the relevant international federations to realize the Dielpis Formula 1 project. ""The greatest benefit for our country would be giving to the world the opportunity to see the most historical port of the Mediterranean sea,"" added Papatheodorou. ""And our experience at organizing big events, such as the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, is a big credential for us."" While the Games in Greece were a tremendous success, their legacy has been far from medal-winning and images of the neglected sites recently hit the headlines on the event's 10-year anniversary. Settlement . The bailouts for Greece came from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in which Germany has the largest single stake. Ecclestone himself was recently a big contributor to Germany's economy through paying the largest legal settlement in the country's history. He paid the state of Bavaria $100 million to settle charges, which he denied, that he had paid a $44 million bribe to steer the sale of F1 in 2006 to his preferred bidder, the private equity firm CVC. Ecclestone has remained in F1's driving seat and recently returned to work at the Belgian Grand Prix after the conclusion of the court case. Registering a pan-European trademark for the title 'Formula 1 Mediterranean Grand Prix' is a key step in the process of bringing the race to the F1 calendar. Wherever possible, Formula One Licensing registers trademarks for the names of upcoming races and prior to the Mediterranean Grand Prix it protected the title to the Austrian Grand Prix which returned to the F1 calendar in June. Changing times . A Mediterranean Grand Prix in Greece was first rumored in 2006 by Autosport magazine when it was suggested that the race could be rotated between a number of circuits, starting with Valencia in 2008 and then Paul Ricard in France the year after. Last month F1 announced that the Mexican Grand Prix will return to the calendar next year after a 23-year absence and a new race in Baku, capital of the oil-rich country of Azerbaijan, will take place in 2016. This year's new addition is a Grand Prix in Russia on a track which snakes around the park used for the Winter Olympics in Sochi. It's the product of a partnership between Ecclestone and his personal friend Russian president Vladimir Putin. ""Russia is definitely going ahead,"" said Eccelstone. ""Putin has given it 100% support. He is easy to deal with. A nice guy. Super guy. Trustworthy. ""He is a guy that if he says 'good morning' you can guarantee that it is before Midday. He wants to get the race done and he will get it done,"" added Ecclestone. Support . Putin's resounding show of support comes against a backdrop of calls from UK politicians for the cancellation of the race which is due to take place on October 12. Conservative MP David Davis, recently said that the ""morally proper"" thing for F1 to do is to put the race on hold in light of Moscow's alleged support for pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine who have been accused of shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Britain's Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also questioned whether Russia is fit to host either the Grand Prix or the 2018 World Cup . ""The question marks I'm raising will only increase over the next coming weeks and months, over the summer and up to the Grand Prix,"" said Clegg. The only F1 race to have been canceled in the past 20 years is the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix which was dropped due to a civil uprising in the country.","Formula One could introduce a grand prix race in Greece .

"(CNN) -- The United States does not know where ousted Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi is and does not believe the National Transitional Council has a lock on his whereabouts either, a senior U.S. official told CNN Thursday. That information came after Anees al-Sharif, a spokesman for the new Tripoli Military Council, said anti-Gadhafi fighters had cornered the fallen Libyan leader and that he had no means of escape. Al-Sharif did not divulge a location. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said earlier this week that officials believe Gadhafi is on the run. ""I don't have any information as to exactly where he's located,"" he said. Two Libyan convoys passed through Niger this week, officials in that country said. Initial speculation was that Gadhafi was in one of those groups, but on Thursday a second senior U.S. official said the United States now has a list of officials from Libya who were in both convoys. There were ""no marquee names,"" or anyone who was named in U.N. Security Council resolutions, the second source said. The official would not say who was in the convoys but said Gadhafi's security chief was not among them, refuting reports that said he left in the convoy. The Nigerien government is talking to the NTC about what the new Libyan leadership wants to do with those in the convoy but the NTC hasn't decided whether it's worth it to bring them back, the source said. Libyans are leading the search for Gadhafi. The Central Intelligence Agency has agents in the area, and the United Kingdom, France, Jordan and Qater have special forces in the country as well, NATO and U.S. defense officials tell CNN. However, the mission of those agents is not necessarily focused on hunting for Gadhafi. In Washington, Capt. John Kirby, spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, insisted Thursday that the U.S. mission in Libya is to protect citizens and ""is not about capturing or finding Col. Gadhafi."" Questions about Gadhafi's whereabouts intensified after the fall of Tripoli and reports that his wife, daughter, two sons and other family members fled to neighboring Algeria, which described its acceptance of the family as a humanitarian gesture. Gadhafi's forces in Bani Walid, one of the last loyalist strongholds, fired Grad rockets at opposition fighters Thursday, according to the NTC chief negotiator for the city, Abdallah Kenshill. He said the rockets were fired randomly and no fighters were injured. ""Gadhafi loyalists are just trying to scare rebel ranks with the Grad explosions and booms,"" Kenshil said. Opposition fighers are advancing on Bani Walid from two directions, according to Kenshil. He also said opposition supporters inside the city attacked some of Gadhafi's military installations, capturing and destroying artillery and rocket launchers. Bani Walid is about 150 kilometers (some 90 miles) southeast of Tripoli. Meantime, NTC leader Mahmoud Jibril told reporters that Libyans have a choice between the past and the future. He warned that the ""battle for freedom"" was not over, especially in the southern part of the country. He also said that the ""national confidence which aimed at bringing the regime down has not been achieved yet."" But Jibril was confident the battle would be won if Libyans remained united. ""And when the battle's really finished ... there will be an interim government and also a constitution which has been agreed."" ""My priorities are to finish the freedom, the fight of freedom,"" Jibril continued, ""And to form a civil state and a democratic government -- regardless of the side or color they have to participate equally in all rights and duties. Also Thursday, the International Criminal Court asked Interpol to issue Red Notice arrest warrants for the fallen Libyan leader, wanted for alleged crimes against humanity. ""Arresting Gadhafi is matter of time,"" said Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. A Red Notice allows Interpol, the international police agency, to widely circulate arrest warrants with an intention to extradite suspects to the criminal court. The International Criminal Court also asked for Red Notices on Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, and his brother-in-law, Abdullah Al-Senussi, who served as the regime's intelligence chief. They are also wanted for alleged killings and persecution in the Libyan uprising that erupted in February. Saif al-Islam Gadhafi is believed to be in Sirte, one of the last pro-Gadhafi strongholds in Libya, said the first senior U.S. official. In addition, that official said another son in is believed to be in Bani Walid. A third son, Mutassim, is believed to be in a town whose name is not a familiar one, the official said. The official did not have the town's name and could not immediately remember it. Earlier, Kenshil said two of Gadhafi's sons had been spotted in Bani Walid. ""We know that Saif al-Islam Gadhafi and Mutassim Gadhafi are inside Bani Walid,"" Kenshil said. ""Eyewitnesses we know by name inside Bani Walid told us they saw them."" Saif al-Islam Gadhafi was considered the most influential of Gadhafi's sons. Mutassim Gadhafi served as his father's national security adviser. Two other sons, Khamis and Saif al-Arab, are believed to be dead. CNN could not independently confirm any of the interim council's statements. Anti-Gadhafi fighters have made claims before about the arrests or killings of Gadhafi's sons which later were proved false. Gadhafi has not been seen in public in months. In recent days, a Syrian television station has aired several messages allegedly from Gadhafi. ""Moammar Ghadafi himself incited violence against our peaceful message in a message broadcast on Al-Rai-TV,"" NTC member Kenshil said, referring to an audio message purportedly from Gadhafi aired Wednesday. ""He asked his supporters to destroy the mosque where the negotiations with Bani Walid elders took place,"" Kenshil said. Kirby, the Joint Chiefs spokesman, told journalists at Pentagon briefing that the United States believes Gadhafi forces are still a danger and some troops continue to be loyal to the Libyan leader. Neither Kirby nor George Little, the new Pentagon spokesman who appeared with Kirby at the briefing, would comment on recent reports by CNN and others of shoulder-fired missiles and other weapons being looted from Libyan storage facilities, but Kirby did say the U.S. has told the NTC it needs to get control of the various weapons stashes around the country. Little also said the United States remains confident that chemical weapons material in Libya remains secure and said the material has been under constant watch for months. After the news reports about the looted weapons, the Obama administration again contacted members of the TNC to express their concern about those weapons getting into the hands of U.S. adversaries, according to a senior U.S. official. Two senior State Department officials confirmed that the State Department has intensified outreach to the TNC in the past few days, based on several reports about the missing weapons. ""We don't know who grabbed them or where they are,"" the senior US official said of the missing weapons. ""We are deeply concerned they are all accounted for. We are hoping the TNC will do what needs to be done."" The official pointed out that the United States was concerned about Libyan surface-to-air missiles getting into the wrong hands even during the Gadhafi regime. It's also understood that some rebel forces broke into government warehouses in the early days of the conflict to arms themselves. The concern now is weapons that have been seized by loyalist fighters or that could have been sold to members of terrorists such as al Qaeda operatives in North Africa. A NATO source told CNN that the alliance believes some weapons have ""gotten out"" either to loyalists forces or other adversaries outside Libya. But he emphasized the alliance has ""no idea of the quantity or even whether they're operational."" A key issue is whether any of the missing weapons also have functioning battery power assemblies and firing mechanisms. He emphasized that NATO also has regularly talked to the TNC about the problem. Libya's new leaders, meanwhile, have imposed a Saturday deadline on Gadhafi loyalists to lay down their arms or face military force. The calm that prevailed during negotiations for surrender shattered in Bani Walid Thursday as loyalists fired on advancing opposition fighters. The anti-Gadhafi fighters were on a reconnaissance mission when they came under fire in Wadi Dinar, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) outside Bani Walid, Kenshil said. One opposition fighter was injured in the abdomen, he said. The opposition returned fire and killed a pro-Gadhafi fighter. Meanwhile, trucks armed with anti-aircraft guns and rocket launchers pulled into a base 30 kilometers (nearly 20 miles) southwest of the coastal city of Misrata Wednesday. The fighting force known as the Victory Unit was back from its patrol of the desert landscape separating Bani Walid and Misrata, loyal to the NTC. The 70-kilometer (44-mile) buffer zone had been quiet for the past two weeks amid negotiations between tribal leaders from Bani Walid and representatives from the NTC. ""We don't want more bloodshed,"" said Antar Al Birra, the commander of the Victory Unit. ""Too many people have died, so we hope the negotiations will be successful."" Al Birra's forces are battle-hardened from months of heavy fighting, and with Gadhafi's forces against the ropes, he said the battle to take the city will be short. ""If we are ordered to take the city, it won't take us long, maybe two or three hours,"" Al Birra said. Many soldiers on the front hope for a peaceful solution. But as Saturday's deadline loomed, many were anxious as hope of success began to fade. ""Negotiations have completely failed,"" said Shamsaddin Ben Ali, an NTC spokesman. ""We won't agree to their demands."" These demands include NTC forces entering the city unarmed, refraining from searching houses and -- the most contentious -- a full pardon for the people of Bani Walid. ""We won't grant amnesty because there are people with blood on their hands, and we want them to face a trial,"" Ben Ali said. ""I predict fighting to resume on Saturday."" CNN's Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, Adam Levine, Kareem Khadder and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report.","NEW: Loyalists fire rockets at opposition fighters from Bani Walid .

"(CNN) -- London will at be the center of the sporting universe come Friday but as far as the city's commercial community is concerned, it will be business as usual during the Olympics. The English capital is one of the world's foremost financial and business hubs, but given the expected influx of nearly 550,000 tourists and sports fans every day during the Games, accommodation will be at a premium and getting around will be trickier than usual. Both UK chancellor George Osborne and London mayor Boris Johnson have publicly stated their determination to ensure the city remains ""open for business"" and contingency plans are in place to ensure this remains the case. But if you're visiting London in a professional capacity over the next three weeks, what can you do to avoid the crowds and make the most of your business travel time? CNN has compiled the below guide to help the business traveler sidestep the Olympic hulabaloo. Getting there . Heathrow Airport in west London expects to cater for 80% of all Olympic athletes, officials and media entering the UK during the course of the games, pushing its capacity to the limit. See also: Ultimate guide to London Olympics . But London is also accessible from the sky via a number of other airports both in and around the city. Gatwick, Luton, Stansted and London City international airports all offer alternatives to Heathrow. Smaller airports throughout the south east of England -- such as Southampton, Bournemouth and Southend -- are accessible from international destinations and have connecting bus or train services to the capital. London is also accessible from mainland Europe by the Eurostar train, a favorite of the business traveler for its speed, comfort and disembarkation point right in the heart of the city. Accommodation . According to the latest research by the hotel market intelligence provider Travelclick, 46% of all hotel rooms in London have already been snapped up for the Olympics (a fourfold increase on the same time last year). This may be good news for the city's hoteliers but high demand has inflated prices. Travelclick has recorded a 70% increase in average daily rate in comparison to 2011, with the average hotel room now costing Â£189 ($293) a night. Whilst it may still be possible to secure one of London's 120,000 hotel rooms at short notice, a cheaper option may be to head out to one of the city's nearby commuter towns. Prices at the Holiday Inn, the official hotel partner of the Olympic Games, in the suburban town of Maidenhead on the night of the opening ceremony start at Â£115 ($175). The same stay a little farther from London at the Ramada Inn in Milton Keynes meanwhile starts at Â£55 ($85) per night. See also: Best of London Olympic hotels . A commute into the city will still have to be negotiated, although there will be extra rail services into and out of London for the duration of the Games. Getting around . London has an extensive urban transportation network but even that won't be enough to completely quell the Olympic stampede, with organizers expecting ""delays"" and ""exceptionally busy"" periods. Transport for London has produced a series of interactive guides called Get ahead of the Games, which display how travel on underground and overground trains is expected to be impacted by Olympic events. It is hoped this will enable travelers to plan their journey in advance, avoiding bottlenecks and hotspots as they arise. Extra train, tube and bus services have been arranged, whilst boat transport along the river Thames (including to Canary Wharf, home to many of the city's big financial institutions) will also be ramped up. A Twitter handle, @GAOTG, has been set up to bring the latest transit news to city travelers as quickly as possible. Travel by car is advised against for all but Olympic VIPs -- who have been deigned important enough to be bestowed with their own dedicated lanes on London's roads -- but there are other options for those looking to avoid public transport. See also: Best ways to get around London Olympics . A campaign by previous British Olympic champions Sally Gunnell and Chris Boardman is encouraging those in the city to walk or hop on a ""Boris Bike,"" London's public bike sharing service, to reach their destination. Alternative options . Given the expected strain on the city's infrastructure, businesses have been encouraged to adopt strategies that will minimize the impact on their day to day workings. A document from LOCOG, the 2012 Olympic Games organizing committee, advises businesses to allow employees to work from home to reduce the strain on public transport. If business meetings cannot be avoided for those in the city, plenty of planning and time for travel is recommended. Finding accommodation close to where meetings will take place and staggering meeting times so they don't clash with the start or finish times of Olympic events is also advised.","London's mayor says the city will remain open for business during the Olympic Games .

"(CNN) -- Adrien Niyonshuti is unlikely to win an Olympic medal, and he will do well to even finish his event, but his story is surely one of the most inspirational in the history of the Games. In April 1994, when he was just seven, Niyonshuti's family became victims of the brutal genocide in Rwanda which left nearly 800,000 people slaughtered. He fled the Hutu killers who came to his village, but six of his brothers were murdered and up to 60 of his wider family perished. He miraculously escaped with his mother and father, living off scraps in the countryside, almost starving to death before aid came in the form of the rebel Tutsi army from neighboring Uganda. ""The memory of the genocide is a really hard time for me and for a lot of people in Rwanda,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""Cycling gives me the opportunity to keep my past time away and really focus on what I want to do."" Read more: Rwanda's wooden bike riders . Not only did he survive one of the worst atrocities in modern history, but Niyonshuti has overcome the odds to carry his country's flag at London 2012. He will have to wait until the final day of the Games before he can actually compete, but the fact that the 25-year-old from the small east African country has qualified for the men's mountain bike final is an achievement in itself. A way forward . Black African competitors are few and far between in this highly technical discipline, which is dominated by riders from the traditional powerhouses of cycling in Europe. Lack of specialist equipment and top-class competition are almost insurmountable barriers to even the most physically gifted athlete such as Niyonshuti, but by finishing fourth in last year's African Mountain Bike Championships he booked his place on the starting line at Hadleigh Farm. As he grew up, initially encouraged by his uncle Emmanuel, who lent him an old steel bike, Niyonshuti used cycling as an escape from the realities of his past. But youthful enthusiasm can only take you so far in any sport, particularly from a war-ravaged country with little competitive structure. Niyonshuti's life changed when he was noticed by a trio of top international riders who came to Rwanda to help with a local race: Jonathan ""Jock"" Boyer, the the first U.S. cyclist to compete in the Tour de France in 1981; fellow international competitor Tom Ritchey; and Swiss mountain bike legend Thomas Frischknecht. They all spotted Niyonshuti's raw talent and set about giving him the chance to achieve his potential. See also: From war child to U.S. Olympic star . Team Rwanda . Boyer returned, having secured some funding in the United States and backing from cycling's world governing body, the UCI. His goal was to set up Team Rwanda and, based in Ruhengeri, in the north east of the country, he tested young prospects for their physical capabilities. As Boyer remembers, Niyonshuti stood out from the rest. ""He tested higher than than anyone, but his whole demeanor was different, really dedicated to what he wanted to do,"" Boyer told CNN. The veteran retired pro and young hopeful even raced together in the 2007 Cape Epic -- the Tour de France of mountain bike racing -- and finished a creditable 33rd overall and top Rwandan pair. Yet Niyonshuti and his teammates were concerned that Boyer and other helpers would eventually leave them. "" 'How long is this going to last?' they asked me. In a country like Rwanda they were well used to aid projects which lasted for about six months and then departed."" But Boyer stayed, helping Niyonshuti to achieve his potential in a professional team. Professional contract . He contacted Douglas Ryder, the boss of South Africa's MTN-Qhubeka and after a trial Niyonshuti was signed in 2008. What followed has been the stuff of dreams, and in 2009 Niyonshuti became the first black African to compete in a professional peloton when the team raced in the Tour of Ireland. Not only that, he was introduced to seven-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong, who was also in the stage race that year as he returned from his first retirement. Niyonshuti quickly realized that although Armstrong was a legend, the American was still flesh and blood like everyone else. ""When I saw him on the news, I thought Armstrong was a big, big man!"" he recalled. ""But when I saw him face to face, he was quite small!"" Niyonshuti has excelled in road racing and individual time trialing against the clock, but cross-country mountain biking offered him the best chance of Olympic qualification. After gaining his spot, he has been honing his skills with Frischknecht in Switzerland, staying at the former world champion's home. ""His technical skills were poor but he was very strong,"" said Frischknecht. At the Olympics, seeded riders start in the front rank, giving them a massive advantage on the narrow and highly technical course. Olympic goal . For riders like Niyonshuti, who will be starting towards the back, the aim of the game is to avoid being lapped and therefore eliminated, which is no easy task. ""We have one big goal: to actually finish the race,"" Frischknecht confided. ""He can only afford to be about 10 minutes behind the leader, but I have some hope he can actually do it. He has developed his skills a lot."" So no Olympic glory, just survival, but Niyonshuti's life has been all about just that and his efforts will hopefully inspire a generation of cyclists from his country. Boyer has no doubt of that. ""Each country always has a hero and Adrien for Rwanda is the ignition point, the spark that is going to get kids into cycling,"" he said. Longer term, Boyer believes Niyonshuti can prosper in the professional peloton and one day ride the Tour de France with MTN, which wants to acquire a higher UCI pro continental team status next year. ""They have a two-year plan to achieve it,"" Boyer said. Flag bearer . MTN has signed 20-year-old Ethiopian Tsgabu Grmay, as well as two Eritrean riders, Meron Russom and Jani Tewelde, so it is not inconceivable there could be sizable African representation in the greatest cycling race in the world. Given Niyonshuti's tragic past, it would complete a remarkable journey for him -- and if sheer determination was the only factor, he will surely take his place. ""I will never give up, I will try my best,"" is Niyonshuti's racing philosophy. He will be putting it to the test against the best mountain bikers in the world as the London Olympics come to a climax on Sunday. Having already carried Rwanda's flag at the opening ceremony, Niyonshuti knows that the hopes and dreams of his nation rest on his slim shoulders -- and he will surely not let them down.","Adrien Niyonshuti carried Rwandan flag at opening ceremony of 2012 Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Stolen medical files that may be those of Michael Schumacher are being offered for sale, the injured former F1 racing driver's manager said. Schumacher has been undergoing hospital treatment since a skiing accident last year but is now out of a coma. Manager Sabine Kehm said the documents had been offered for sale for several days. She added, ""We cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported. The authorities are involved."" Medical files are confidential, and it is forbidden to buy or publish such data, Kehm said. ""We will therefore, in every single case, press for criminal charges and damages against any publication of the content or reference to the medical file,"" she said. Schumacher, 45, suffered severe head trauma in a December 29 skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel. The champion driver, from Germany, was transferred last week to Switzerland for rehabilitation from a hospital in Grenoble, France, where he was kept in a medically induced coma for more than three months. The Grenoble hospital's media office said in a statement that Kehm ""told us that a person intended to sell to the press a document allegedly issued from the medical records of Michael Schumacher."" ""Without knowing the precise nature of the document, the Grenoble Hospital decided to sue for 'theft and breach of medical confidentiality' so that an investigation can be initiated."" A spokesman for the German newspaper Bild, Tobias Frolich, told CNN that the tabloid was among a number of media outlets to be offered Schumacher's alleged medical records, but that ""the editorial office decided to reject the offer."" A French prosecutor investigating the accident concluded that speed was not behind the fall suffered by the seven-time world champion, whose F1 career ended in 2012.

"(CNN) -- Mark Webber became an unprecedented sixth different winner in six races this season as he drove his Red Bull to victory at the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix Sunday. Webber made the most of starting from pole position to hold off Nico Rosberg in the Mercedes with Fernando Alonso taking third for Ferrari to take over at the top of the world title standings. Webber's Red Bull teammate and two-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel finished a fine fourth after starting ninth on the grid. Both Alonso and Vettel moved ahead of a disappointed Lewis Hamilton during their pit stops, leaving the McLaren driver in fifth spot. Felipe Massa was sixth in the second Ferrari. Briton Paul di Resta drove a fine race to finish seventh, just ahead of his Force India teammate German Nico Hulkenberg. Finn Kimi Raikkonen of Lotus and Brazilian Bruno Senna in his Williams completed the points scoring. It was the third straight Monaco win for Red Bull, who extended their lead in the constructors' standings over McLaren. Webber, who also won in 2010, was claiming his eighth Formula One career victory and he moved level with Vettel into joint second in the standings, three points adrift of Alonso. ""I feel incredible,"" Webber told the official post-race press conference. ""It was a very interesting race, reasonably straightforward at the start, just managing the gap to Nico (Rosberg). ""I'm really glad to have won here again, a great victory for me."" It was another disappointing race day for seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who had been the fastest in qualifying. A five-place grid penalty left the Mercedes driver starting from sixth and an early tangle with Romain Grosjean (Lotus), who was forced to retire, saw him slip back to eighth. A technical problem later hit Schumacher to leave him pointless again. The race was held against the backdrop of the constant threat of a rain shower, which could have seen a complete change in the finishing order. The rain eventually came with a vengeance after the finish, leaving Webber to breath a sigh of relief. Alonso was also a big winner on the day, with Ferrari making great strides after being off the pace earlier in the season. ""For me, the target was to try to finish in front of Sebastian and Lewis (Hamilton) as they are with us in the championship. If you go race by race, you aim to finish ahead of different drivers.

"(CNN) -- Michael Schumacher might be in a medically induced coma but the Formula One great has shown enough ""small, encouraging signs"" to give his family confidence that he will ""wake up."" The 45-year-old suffered a severe head injury while skiing on December 29 in the French Alps. ""We are and remain confident that Michael will pull through and will wake up,"" said Michael Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehn in a statement Wednesday. ""There sometimes are small, encouraging signs, but we also know that this is the time to be very patient."" Germany's seven-time world champion was placed into a medically-induced coma to help reduce swelling on the brain after the accident. Schumacher has had two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and to remove haematomas at Grenoble Hospital, France. He retired from F1 in 2012 following a record-breaking 19-year career. He had been skiing off-piste when he fell and hit his head against a rock. ""Michael has suffered severe injuries,"" added Kehn. ""It is very hard to comprehend for all of us that Michael, who had overcome a lot of precarious situations in the past, has been hurt so terribly in such a banal situation. Why induced comas help injured brains . ""It was clear from the start that this will be a long and hard fight for Michael. We are taking this fight on together with the team of doctors, whom we fully trust. The length of the process is not the important part for us."" Over the last few months, Kehn has often asked the media to show respect for the privacy of Schumacher's family and she repeated that call in her statement. ""It is heart-warming to see how much sympathy his family is shown and I can say that the family is extremely grateful for it. ""However, it should not be forgotten that Michael's family is dealing with an extremely intimate and fragile situation. ""And I would like to remind all of us that Michael has always actively kept his family out of the public eye and consequently protected their private lives. ""We try to channel all the energies we have toward Michael and we firmly believe that this will help him. And we believe that he will also win this fight."" Schumacher, who won five consecutive titles with Ferrari between 2000-04, also claimed two drivers' championships at Benetton in 1994 and 1995. The 2014 F1 season starts this weekend in Australia.

"(CNN) -- Put simply, there is no other Formula One race to match the glamor and sophistication of the Monaco Grand Prix. It comprises 78 pulsating laps around the principality's tight streets, with the region's wealthy inhabitants taking in the action from expensive yachts moored at the Mediterranean port which provides the circuit with its unique, picturesque backdrop. For one weekend each May, Monte Carlo's customary chic and class is replaced with screeching brakes and the smell of burned rubber as drivers bid to write their names in the history books. ""It's always been a special race,"" F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone told CNN. ""It's a street race.

The Monaco Grand Prix was first held in 1929 when safety was not as prevalent in the minds of organizers as it is today. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher won in Monaco five times between 1994 and 2001. The Mercedes driver explained how Monaco's unique layout sets it apart from other, more spacious, tracks.

""At the same time if you go through these roads and tunnels it is fascinating."" How sponsor's exit aided Lotus . Schumacher's record in Monaco is only bettered by the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna, who won the race six times before his tragic death at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix.

""Enjoyed the time, It was a kind of home race for me and I still feel very passionate about going there."" The large sums of money on offer to Formula One's top drivers means many can afford to base themselves in Monte Carlo, a location with a reputation as a millionaire's playground. ""You can see the big boats arriving and the small fishing boats getting moved out of the way,"" said former McLaren driver David Coulthard. ""It's the race track that the CEOs want to be at and where all the big parties are held."" Britain's Coulthard won in Monaco in 2000 and 2002, and he described how being handed the trophy by Monaco's head of state is one of the biggest honors in F1. ""I am really proud to have a picture with Prince Rainier after winning the grand prix knowing that he had sat next to so many of the better drivers than me, the greats of the sport. That's what makes it so special."" Stirling Moss is widely regarded as one of the finest racers to have never won a world championship. But the Briton, who raced between 1951 and 1961, won at Monaco three times. ""I think amongst the drivers they'd like to say they've won Monaco, that is the pearl,"" said the 82-year-old. And it is a view supported by Moss's modern counterparts. Schumacher's teammate Nico Rosberg enjoyed the first grand prix victory of his career early this season in China, but the German said a win on Sunday would be extra special.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona president Sandro Rosell has quit in the wake of a Spanish judge's decision to investigate the deal that brought Brazilian superstar Neymar to the club. Rosell announced at a press conference Thursday he was tendering his ""irrevocable resignation"" after three-and-a-half years in charge of the current Spanish champions. On Wednesday a judge agreed to hear a case centered on the $78 million transfer of Neymar from Santos in June after a complaint from one of Barcelona's own members. Rosell vigorously asserted his innocence in front a packed media conference and described the allegations as ""unfair and reckless."" He will be replaced by vice-president Josep Maria Bartomeu who said the current board would continue until the end of their mandate in 2016. ""In recent days an unfair and reckless accusation of misappropriation has resulted in a lawsuit against me in the National Court,"" he told reporters -- a statement that was later reproduced on Barcelona's official website. ""From the beginning I have said that the signing of Neymar Junior has been correct and his signing has caused despair and envy in some of our adversaries."" ""The Board of Directors is a team. And this team leads a project that has brought the Club great success. I don't want unfair attacks to negatively affect their management or the image of the club. ""This is why I think my time here has come to an end. ""Now, in accordance with the Club's Statutes, I have presented my irrevocable resignation of the presidency of FC Barcelona to the Board of Directors. ""From this moment, the first vice-president of the club, Josep Maria Bartomeu, will immediately assume the presidency of the club until the end of the term, through 2016, just as the Board unanimously agreed a few moments ago."" Rosell took over as president in 2010 after succeeding Joan Laporta. During his time in charge the club won the La Liga title twice and also secured the 2011 European Champions League crown. He attracted criticism in some quarters for a huge sponsorship deal with the Qatar Foundation that saw the club bear a sponsor's name on their shirts for the first time. After they signed Neymar from Santos, the club announced the deal was worth $78 million, but the breakdown of the agreement was never revealed. A Barcelona member launched a case against Rosell for not disclosing the full details and the club was asked by Spanish authorities to hand over documentation, as well as accounts for the past three years. On Wednesday judge Pablo Ruz decided an investigation should go ahead, leading to Thursday's dramatic press conference. Rosell touched on the success Barca had enjoyed during his reign but said it had brought ""very difficult moments."" ""For some time my family and myself have suffered threats and attacks in silence,"" he said. ""These threats and attacks have made me wonder if being president means having to jeopardize my family. ""In all of these years we have seen that our successes are the result of our victories on the pitch and overcoming innumerable obstacles off the pitch: political, external and, what's worse, at times the pressure has come from our own environment. ""It has been an honor to serve the Barcelonistas. It's been a privilege to be the president of FC Barcelona.

"(CNN) -- Cleared to take part in football-related activities last week by the highest sports court in the world, Luis Suarez was unveiled to Barcelona fans amid chants of ""Suarez, Suarez, Suarez"" on Monday. The talented -- and controversial -- forward took to the pitch at the Camp Nou alongside the rest of his teammates ahead of the Joan Gamper Trophy, an annual friendly that serves as Barcelona's curtain raiser to the new season. This time, Barcelona faced Mexico's Leon. After most of Barcelona's regulars entered the pitch -- including Neymar -- its new signings were rolled out and that included Suarez, who joined from Liverpool for a reported fee of about $130 million in July. Later, four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi made his way onto the field as one of four club captains. Suarez didn't start the game, named on the subs' bench, but he came on with about 15 minutes remaining in Barcelona's 6-0 victory. By that time, Messi and Neymar departed. The Uruguayan was allowed to feature in the festivities by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which partially overturned a ban given to Suarez by FIFA for biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. It was the third time Suarez bit an opponent during a game, the other two coming when he lined up with clubs Liverpool and Ajax. While CAS upheld his four-month suspension from competitive action, it said he could embark on football-related duties, like playing in friendlies, training and getting involved in promotional activities. Suarez is expected to make his competitive debut against fiercest rival Real Madrid in late October. Barcelona is counting on the attacking triumvirate of Messi, Suarez and Neymar to reverse a poor, by its standards, 2013/2014. The club lost the Kings Cup final to Real Madrid, fell in the Champions League quarterfinals to Atletico Madrid and finished second to Atletico in La Liga. Barcelona was also hit with a transfer ban over two transfer windows relating to the ""international transfer of minors,"" although the ban has been lifted while Barcelona appeals. Barcelona has since signed, besides Suarez, two goalkeepers as it seeks to replace Victor Valdes -- Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Claudio Bravo. Midfielder Ivan Rakitic and defenders Thomas Vermaelen and Jeremy Mathieu have also joined.","Uruguay forward Luis Suarez is unveiled in front of Barcelona's fans on Monday .

"(CNN) -- It was honors even when the opening legs of this year's Champions League quarterfinals took place on Tuesday. The games between Manchester United and Bayern Munich, and Barcelona's all-Spanish duel with Atletico Madrid, both ended 1-1. In England, the 2012-13 league winners opened the scoring through Nemanja Vidic only for Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was sent off late on, to draw the defending champions level. In Barcelona, the four-time European champions trailed to a stunning Diego strike before Brazil's Neymar leveled with 19 minutes left to play. Little fancied before the match, Manchester United may well be the happiest of the sides after surviving a first-half onslaught before taking the lead through Vidic's outstanding header after 58 minutes. Despite being on the back foot for much of the first hour, the home side could have taken the lead even earlier only for Danny Welbeck to waste a glorious opening late in the first half. As Manchester United reveled in their unexpected lead, Bayern hit back through Schweinsteiger who lashed home at the end of a sweeping Bayern move. The midfielder will miss the second leg following his second yellow card, while Javi Martinez also picked up a booking that rules him out of next Wednesday's match in Germany. ""We've given ourselves a great chance (to go through)"" said United coach David Moyes. ""There was a real determination tonight to make sure we did well."" Missing the injured Robin van Persie and with Juan Mata cup-tied, United made light of recent disappointments as they delivered one of their most impressive performances of the season. However, they must score next week in Munich -- where the hosts are bidding for a third Champions League final in four years -- to avoid going out on away goals. Bayern enjoyed nearly 75% of possession at Old Trafford, where the visitors felt Antonio Valencia could also have earned a second yellow card following an untidy challenge on Jerome Boateng. ""Manchester United have a very good team,"" said Bayern winger Arjen Robben. ""I didn't like the atmosphere before the game with everybody saying we would win easily - that is not how football works."" ""Missing Schweinsteiger and Martinez is a big blow, but Dante is coming back into the team next week."" In Barcelona, Atletico Madrid showed the qualities that have taken them to the top of La Liga as they ground out their fourth draw of the season against Gerardo Martino's side. An early replacement for star striker Diego Costa, who had been an injury doubt before the game and limped off with a hamstring problem after 30 minutes, namesake Diego opened the scoring with a sensational strike after 56 minutes. But just like Manchester United, Atletico's lead was short llived as Barca hit back from Neymar following an exquisite pass from Andres Iniesta. Barcelona will be without defender Gerard Pique for the second leg, as well as the Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid on 19 April, after suffering a hairline fracture in his right hip, the club said. The Spanish international is expected to be out for four weeks after falling awkwardly in the opening stages of the match, with Pique going off after just 12 minutes. ""I am full of pride in the way in which we played. If we continue like this, there are chances for success,"" Martino told the website of European football body UEFA. ""After [AtlÃ©tico's] goal you saw the best of Barcelona. We played as a team and added a lot of intensity. The tie is finely balanced."" In their four games this season, with Tuesday's clash being their maiden meeting in Europe, Barca and Atletico have registered two goalless and two 1-1 draws. The visitors protected their unbeaten record in this year's competition, even though coach Diego Simeone was taking his side into one of its fiercest tests. ""We have a team with huge heart and it made me so happy to be able to compete against these opponents,"" Atletico boss Simeone told UEFA.com. ""The Vicente CalderÃ³n will be bursting with atmosphere (in the return leg)."" The two teams lead La Liga, with Atletico just a point above their illustrious opponents -- with Real Madrid two further points behind. The return legs of both games take place on April 9. On Wednesday, the remaining quarterfinals begin as Paris Saint-German host Chelsea while Real Madrid entertain Borussia Dortmund.","Manchester United hold defending champions Bayern Munich to a 1-1 draw in England .

"(CNN) -- Wednesday in Paris will see two worlds collide, when Nouveau Riche take on Nouveau Riche-r. Paris Saint-Germain welcome Chelsea to the Parc des Princes for a Champions League quarterfinal first leg, with both teams vying for a spot in the final four of Europe's crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. The Qatari-funded, mega-rich, ultra-trendy club very much on the rise, against the team that made it fashionable to buy-your-way-to-success, backed by Roman Abramovich's rubles. The Russian oligarch arrived in west London in 2003 and within two years, had helped -- or perhaps been solely responsible -- for ending Chelsea's 50-year wait for an English league title. Seven years later, his dream of landing the continent's premier club trophy was finally realized when the Blues lifted the 2012 Champions League. For Chelsea MK II, you need look no further than across the Channel. 2011 saw Qatar Sports Investments take control of PSG, and just like at Stamford Bridge, the national championship arrived two years later after many millions of dollar had been spent. Champions League glory is next on the agenda and it is very possible that it will have turned up in the same nine-year period it took Chelsea to achieve it following massive investment. But perhaps the similarities stop there. Some are inclined to feel that PSG are favorites to progress past Chelsea into the semifinals because of one player: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The striker has been on a one-man scoring rampage, blasting his way past anything that dares try and stop him. Cristiano Ronaldo aside -- you will struggle to find many who have bettered his stunning tally of 39 goals from 42 games for club and country this season. He also has Champions League pedigree coming into Wednesday's game, with the Swede pouncing 10 times in his last seven appearances in the competition. Chelsea's problems up front this season, however, have been well-documented, with coach Jose Mourinho recently admitting that there will be great changes in that department come the summer. Until then, he is stuck with an $80 million player who once would have come close to matching Ibrahimovic's goalscoring feats. Sadly for Mourinho, that player, Fernando Torres, seems to be stuck in a parallel universe -- somewhere on Merseyside, circa 2009, to be precise, when he was in the form of his life for Liverpool. And unfortunately, if Torres' nine goals from 32 appearances this term are insufficient, the Chelsea boss will be unable to call on a Champions League winning-striker in his ranks. Samuel Eto'o is out of the game due to injury, yet questioning his age suggests the Cameroonian does not fill Mourinho with too much confidence anyway. Chelsea do have another Champions League winner to call upon on Wednesday or, better put, a double Champions League winner -- in Mourinho himself. The Portuguese, who won the title with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010, was made for nights like this, and put him in a one-off game, or a two-legged tie in this case, and not too many will come out on top against him. While his opposite number, Laurent Blanc, may have the better manners and does not go around poking opponents in the eye, he cannot match Mourinho's invaluable big-game experience. In fact, he has never made it past this stage in the competition. On the home front, Blanc and PSG may have all but tied up the French Ligue 1 title, boasting a 13-point advantage over second-placed Monaco with seven games left. But that has to be the bare minimum for a club with ambitions of their size playing in a league not renowned for its stature, nor one that can match the English Premier League's uber-competitiveness. Manners were mentioned earlier, and this is perhaps a key theme that runs through the heart of the two clubs' differing identities. While Mourinho spent his weekend lecturing a Crystal Palace ball boy, Blanc could be found lavishing high praise on the Portuguese. Move away from the managers and take a quick glance at their respective captains, and you'll see that pattern continue. Thiago Silva is the sophisticated leader to John Terry's rough diamond; one plays the game in an honest way with an irremovable smile on his face, while the other has often stretched the boundaries of decency over the years. The same can be said of the differing atmospheres inside the clubs' two stadiums, although that is perhaps a comment on British and French football cultures in general. The Parc des Princes is an altogether more sober affair, a place where fans mix with French fashion icons and movie stars. Stamford Bridge, meanwhile, is a setting where supporters like to chuck celery onto the field of play, conjuring up memories of the stadium's infamous ""Shed End"" in the less-than-glorious era of 1980s British football. Stamford Bridge is a little further than a stone's throw away from the River Thames, while the Parc des Princes is a short walk from the Seine. A pasty or pie is likely to be the match snack for many a Chelsea fan, while PSG supporters may prefer to tuck into something a tad more upmarket, given France's long established gastronomic reputation. Differing clubs, but both with money -- lots of it -- at their core. It all adds up to what should be a fascinating encounter.","PSG and Chelsea meet in the Champions League quarterfinal first leg on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Five people were arrested as tensions flared again in Ferguson, Missouri, with people threatening officers, shooting at them, throwing rocks and bottles, and one person tossing a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, police say. Two officers were injured, one struck by a rock below the eye, Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol said. And a business owner said looters tried to make off with his cash register. It was the third time the business had been broken into in the last six weeks, Johnson said. The St. Louis suburb has been in the national spotlight since August, when Officer Darren Wilson shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in the street. Protests carried on for weeks and, in the days just after the shooting, devolved into looting, vandalism and arrests. The tenor of the demonstrations eventually calmed, but on Tuesday, tensions flared again. Protesters said they were angry that one of three makeshift memorials at the site where Brown was shot burned earlier in the day. Across town, about 2 miles from the normal protest route, a museum and custard shop called the Whistle Stop was set on fire, and ""gasoline appears to have been poured around that facility,"" Johnson said. Officers were able to douse the small fire with a garden hose, the trooper said. The St. Louis County Bomb and Arson Squad was called in to investigate, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. Complete coverage on Ferguson . Last month, the Whistle Stop's owner, Charles Stark, 26, spoke to CNN and described Ferguson as a place that bands together in tough times, ""neighbor helping neighbor."" Back on the protest route, police faced threats to their safety as violent people amid the protest made threatening remarks ""about shooting police, about burning down the town,"" Johnson said. When some of the people making threats got too close to officers, ""the decision was made to disperse the crowd,"" he said. One person was arrested for assault, inciting a riot and failure to disperse, Johnson said, adding that he couldn't remember why the other four were arrested, but he believed it was for failure to disperse. The cause of the fire at the memorial remains under investigation. In a statement, Police Chief Thomas Jackson said one of his sergeants responded to the fire and attempted to put it out with a portable fire extinguisher before alerting the Fire Department. ""We're all saddened by the fire that was reported at one of the Michael Brown memorials this morning and are trying to obtain as much information as possible to determine what happened,"" the statement said. Some protesters, however, already had ideas about what happened. ""We know it wasn't an accident. You know how many people live over there that seen it from the beginning? I mean it's just a big ol' flame. You could tell the way it was set,"" a protester told KSDK. Johnson bristled at the suggestion that police were responsible for or ambivalent about the fire, saying numerous residents ""stood there for 11 minutes watching it burn."" Some residents went door-to-door telling people that police were behind the blaze when they ""could've put it out with a cup of water,"" he said. It was in that area, along Canfield Drive, that police in bulletproof vests saw muzzle flashes as people fired at them. ""I was there. I took cover,"" Johnson said. Officers will continue to strive to protect public safety as well as the freedoms of speech and expression, Johnson said, but if certain violent elements among the protesters -- and he stressed that most of the demonstrators were, indeed, peaceful -- authorities will have no choice but to respond. ""If that means officers will respond in riot gear, they will,"" he said. ""We cannot have nights like last night. We can't have actions like last night that can result in injury or death. Those will not be tolerated.""","Five people arrested, two officers injured, one hit in the face with a rock, police say .

"(CNN) -- He was a Formula One driver who transcended his sport and even 20 years after his death, Ayrton Senna commands the adoration of fans across the world. This week marks the anniversary of the crash at the Imola Circuit in Italy which took the life of the Brazilian driver, just 24 hours after Austria's Roland Ratzenberger had suffered the same fate. Tributes have poured in for both drivers, with a memorial service held at the track which claimed the lives of both men on Thursday. A collection of motorsport legends past and present were in attendance, where a minute's silence was observed at 14:17 local time -- the exact time of Senna's accident two decades earlier. Fans paid their own tributes to Senna, with many laying floral tributes at the feet of the bronze statue of the triple world champion which sits near the section of the track where he crashed. Senna's passing was the last time a driver has died as a result of a crash at a grand prix, in a sport which in its formative decades had become infamous for driver fatalities. ""Senna was very important for Formula One, as a driver and a person and his death led to a rapid acceleration in the process of increasing the level of safety in our sport,"" Ferrari driver Kimi Raikkonen told the sport's official website. ""That has avoided other tragedies from occurring. Unfortunately however, one cannot change the past, neither for Ayrton nor for Roland Ratzenberger. ""The only thing we can do is remember this champion, whose exploits defined the history of Formula One for a long time."" The Imola Circuit will be open until Sunday for the public to pay their respects to the drivers. In Brazil, Senna's grave in the city of Sao Paulo was adorned with wreaths and bright bouquets. He was laid to rest in the Morumbi Cemetery. Senna's sister Viviane, unveiled an Azul Brazilian airline aircraft with the colors of Senna's iconic yellow helmet on its nose. Vivianne is the head of the Ayrton Senna Institute, which partners with major corporations to give educational opportunities to millions of children across Brazil. Brazilian football team Corinthians paid tribute to one of the country's most famous sporting icons by walking out onto the pitch in replicas of Senna's brightly-colored helmet ahead of Wednesday's match against National AM.","The 20th anniversary of the death of Ayrton Senna marked across the world .

"(CNN) -- It's been largely a season of gloom for Barcelona, but the Spanish champions received a rare ray of light Wednesday following the suspension of the club's transfer ban. The suspension of the ban -- imposed for breaking rules relating to the ""international transfer of minors"" -- allows Barca to potentially overhaul its squad this summer while appealing its punishment. ""The chairman of the FIFA Appeal Committee considered that the appeal lodged by the club is to be granted suspensive effect,"" said a FIFA statement, a decision welcomed by Barca on its website. The Catalan side have suffered a miserable time of late -- crashing out of the Champions League, losing the Spanish Copa del Rey final to rivals Real Madrid and losing ground in the race for the Spanish La Liga title. And their hopes of signing sign the likes of a new goalkeeper and center-back -- replacing departing and aging stars alike -- looked to have been scuppered by FIFA;s decision earlier this month to ban the club from buying players in the next two transfer windows. The April 2 ruling from football's world governing body came after an investigation found Barcelona had broken regulations regarding the transfer of young players from outside Spain between 2009 and 2013. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. However, following Barcelona's decision to lodge an appeal and the threat of taking its case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, FIFA has given the club something of a reprieve. German goalkeeper Andre Ter Stegen has reportedly been linked with a move to Barca from Borussia Monchengladbach this summer, while highly-rated 17-year-old Alen Halilovic was set to arrive at the Camp Nou from Dinamo Zagreb. Those moves seemed to have been jeopardized by the ban, but the Halilovic deal will now go ahead, while Ter Stegen looks likely to follow given that Victor Valdes has confirmed he will leave the club this summer. There has also been speculation that a new coach could arrive before the start of the next campaign as Gerardo Martino -- appointed last summer -- has failed to completely win over the club's supporters and could finish the season without a major trophy. Barca's mixed form as well as the transfer ban are not the only negative stories that have threatened to derail Barca's season. President Sandro Rosell resigned in January after a judge ordered a hearing to investigate the misappropriation of funds during the signing of Brazil star Neymar in 2013. The next transfer window is set to open on July 1.","FIFA suspends transfer ban preventing Barcelona from signing players .

"(CNN) -- ""The last couple of weeks I've been at home have been murder with the traffic,"" bemoans Monte Carlo resident Jenson Button. Like most Formula One protagonists, the McLaren man loves the thrill of racing in the Monaco Grand Prix -- it's just that he is less keen on Monte Carlo's traffic jams in the build-up to the race. ""It's been a nightmare,"" the English driver, who recently moved back to the principality from the British island of Guernsey, told CNN. ""Putting up the grandstands takes a long time so the city does change quite a bit. ""In the winter it's pretty quiet. You see a lot of people that you know and I train with the same people. Monte Carlo is like a quiet, peaceful village really. There's also a new Irish pub that I like -- there's a good pint of Guinness there!"" Button, Ferrari's Felipe Massa and Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton are just a handful of F1 racers who have mixed business with pleasure by calling Monaco their home. Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg, son of Finland's 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg, can boast that he grew up there. It makes sense for wealthy drivers to live in Monaco -- after all, the independent state on the French Riviera has thrived on its reputation as a playground for the rich and famous since the late 1800s. Just as importantly its tax laws are favorable compared to its European neighbors. But for one weekend in May the streets of Monte Carlo are not just for the well-heeled -- they are for racing on. The precipitous, winding roads have evolved into a thrilling street circuit ready to host this weekend's grand prix. The most famous race in Formula One -- a fixture on the calendar since 1950 -- brings a change of pace to Monaco's Mediterranean idyll. The metamorphosis, overseen by the Automobile Club de Monaco (ACM), takes two months to complete and calls on the expertise of 200 construction workers to build 1,100 tonnes of grandstands, 900 tonnes of pit garages and 21 miles of safety barriers. The street circuit has one of the smallest capacities on F1's calendar, with a total of 200,000 fans expected to watch the cars from the grandstands, hotel balconies and terraces -- not forgetting the yachts moored in the harbor -- over the weekend. A crowd of 200,000 may sound small but when the pocketsize principality is less than two square kilometers -- half the size of New York's Central Park -- that is quite a crowd to pack in. ""The place is a little quieter the rest of the year,"" says Carol Olivié-Etiévant, deputy manager of the Hotel Hermitage, which overlooks the F1 circuit in the heart of Monte Carlo. ""During these four days people are living day and night. There are parties in the harbor, on every terrace, so as Monte Carlo is a tiny place, every place is crowded,"" she told CNN. ""There are other busy weekends in Monaco such as the open tennis tournament, the boat show in September and the Red Cross Ball but for this weekend of the grand prix it is very unusual. ""Thousands of people come for the day to Monaco, all the hotels are full, the restaurants are packed and we have many yachts in the harbor. This is most definitely the busiest one. ""For the month of May, Monaco is completely dedicated to Formula One. We have stands in the streets, paddocks in the harbor, and the configuration of the city is different because we close the roads. Monte Carlo is a completely different place."" The locals, known as Monegasques, are prepared to put up with a month or two of disruption because the grand prix is very good for business -- and, perhaps more importantly, for Monaco's global brand. ""The grand prix is one of the things that helps distinguish Monaco from other Mediterranean destinations and gives it an additional layer of glamor which its rivals lack,"" Christian Sylt of Formula One Money told CNN. ""The race keeps the principality in the public eye, which in turn attracts tourists and business conventions. The race itself directly brings around $120 million into the principality, with the bordering towns, such as Menton in France and Ventimiglia in Italy, taking a total of $12 million annually."" Kissing the barriers . For businesses like Olivié-Etiévant's five-star hotel, the allure of the grand prix adds extra cache for its clients all-year-round -- and the race weekend enables it to raise its prices, with a four-day package starting at $10,400. The Monaco GP -- the brainchild of local Anthony Noghes and first run in 1929 -- is also important to the global money-making juggernaut that is F1. While other countries have spent millions and millions of dollars on new circuits in Abu Dhabi and Austin, Texas, for example, the Monaco race is so intrinsic to the image of F1 that race organizers the ACM have a special arrangement with the sport's promoters. ""Monaco is the only race on the calendar that doesn't pay a race hosting fee to the Formula One Group,"" explained Sylt. ""With some rival circuits paying more than $60 million, it's a big saving. Tech guru Lowe back in the fast lane . ""Monaco's history and glamor make it a very important part of the F1 calendar. The race is well-known around the world and is a magnet to the rich and famous. This is great publicity for F1 and also means that there are many potential sponsors and investors in attendance, making it a once-a-year opportunity for F1 and the teams."" Although money and glamor grease the wheels at the Monaco GP, it does not necessarily follow that the event is a profitable enterprise for Prince Albert II's sovereign city-state. ""The total budget for the race is around $35 million and the state provides a subsidy of $7 million towards this,"" Sylt added. ""However, the cost of preparing the circuit for the grand prix means that even without paying a hosting fee the race rarely makes a profit."" With so much as stake at this weekend's GP -- including the small matter of the 2013 drivers' championship -- it also helps that the quality of racing around the streets of Monte Carlo remains undiminished. Apart from modifications to improve safety, the two-mile loop through the narrow, winding streets, past the majestic Casino, through the tunnel and along the harbor brimming with boats has presented the world's fastest racers with the same rollercoaster challenge for the last 70 years. It is the slowest and shortest race on F1's calendar but for many drivers it is the most thrilling. Brazil's late triple world champion Ayrton Senna -- winner of a record six Monaco grands prix -- said he entered a trance-like state when racing on the limit between Monte Carlo's narrow barriers. ""Monaco is unlike any other racetrack in Formula One,"" said Button, who triumphed there in 2009 on the way to winning the world title. ""A qualifying lap around here is an exhilarating experience for a driver; you turn into corners on the limit and you kiss every barrier at the exit. It's a great challenge."" For the month of May, Monaco hums with the rhythm of F1, and the drivers, fans and Monegasques alike anticipate the high-octane pleasures to come at this race. ""I was born in Monaco and in my life I've missed one grand prix,"" recalled Olivié-Etiévant. ""I was very sad when I missed it. ""We are very proud. Very. This is a legendary event and is really very important. It's an atmosphere that you feel, an incredible excitement. As a Monegasque I also enjoy it very much.""","It takes two months to transform Monte Carlo into a racetrack for the Formula One race .

"(CNN) -- Nestor Kirchner, the former Argentinian president who arguably remained the most potent political force in the country, died unexpectedly Wednesday of an apparent heart attack. Kirchner, 60, was president from 2003-2007 and was the husband of current President Cristina Fernandez. He died shortly before 10 a.m. at a hospital near his summer residence in El Calafate, a small town in southern Argentina, according to the official Telam news agency. ""A patriot has died,"" congressman Juan Carlos Dante Gullo said on the state-run Vision 7 TV network. ""Argentina has lost one of its best men."" His wife was with Kirchner when he died at the hospital, state media reported. Argentinian political leaders and Kirchner family members were on their way Wednesday afternoon to El Calafate to join Cristina Fernandez. TV images showed Kirchner's sister, government minister Alicia Kirchner de Mercado, boarding a small jet airplane in Buenos Aires, the nation's capital. Media reports said Kirchner's body was released from the hospital and taken by ambulance to the family home. Kirchner's presidency is remembered for his tough negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, which included temporarily defaulting on the country's debts, as the country climbed out of a recession. Supporters say that Argentina's economic growth since then proved that Kirchner's strategy was the right one. As president, he also led Argentina away from being an automatic supporter of United States policies. Kirchner demonstrated Argentina's independence by forming close ties with presidents with anti-American views, such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez and Bolivia's Evo Morales. After his presidency, he became secretary general of UNASUR, an international body of Latin American countries aimed at balancing out U.S. influence. Condolences from world leaders started to come within minutes of the announcement. ""Oh, my dear Cristina,"" Venezuelan President Chavez said on his Twitter account. ""How much pain! What a great loss for Argentina and our America to suffer! Long live Kirchner forever!!"" Chavez, who said he will attend Kirchner's funeral, decreed three days of mourning. Brazil also will observe three days of mourning. Several Latin American leaders, including the presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador, also said they would attend the funeral. In Colombia, President Juan Manuel Santos declared a minute of silence Wednesday. ""This is a great loss for Argentina and a great loss for our continent,"" he said in a statement. The Organization of American States also observed a minute of silence during a Wednesday morning meeting in Washington. President Barack Obama expressed his condolences, noting that Kirchner ""played a significant role in the political life of Argentina."" Kirchner's health had been delicate this year. He underwent angioplasty surgery in mid-September after doctors found a blockage near his heart. The surgery was the second this year for the politician, who was widely expected to run for president again in 2011 when his wife's term ended. Kirchner had surgery on his right carotid artery in February. The two carotid arteries -- one on either side of the neck -- carry oxygenated blood to the brain. At the time, doctors said Kirchner's artery was blocked, which could have led to a stroke. Patients who undergo such a procedure have a 30 percent greater chance of having heart problems within five years, physician Elmer Huerta told CNN en Español. Kirchner also had been hospitalized in January 2006 for gastric problems. Some analysts said Kirchner had remained the most influential political figure in the nation and the person who, at least until this year and his health issues, made important policy decisions for his wife's government. In foreign policy, the Kirchners have been among the most vocal critics of Washington in Latin America. Their rule in Argentina has often been controversial. Over the past few years, they have dealt with billions in outstanding debt, ongoing conflicts with farmers and the press, and lingering questions over government statistics. After taking office in 2003, Kirchner focused on consolidating his political strength and alleviating social problems, according to a recent U.S. State Department report on Argentina. He pushed for changes in the Supreme Court and military and undertook popular measures, such as raising government salaries, pensions and the minimum wage. He announced in July 2007 that he would not seek re-election and backed his wife to succeed him. Kirchner, as leader of the Union of South American Nations, played a key role in August to re-establish dialogue between Colombia and Venezuela. The two nations had cut off diplomatic relations over accusations that Venezuela was harboring Marxist guerrillas. Kirchner helped broker a meeting at which the sparring countries announced they were re-establishing ties. Kirchner and Cristina Fernandez were married in 1975 and had two children, Maximo and Florencia. Kirchner had been a relatively unknown politician when he won the presidency by default in 2003. He previously had served since 1991 as governor of Santa Cruz, the same province where he died and will be buried. He garnered about 22 percent of the vote in the first round of the 2003 presidential contest but won the election when incumbent President Carlos Menem withdrew after receiving about 24 percent of the ballots cast. Kirchner continued to wield considerable power after his wife won the presidency. Some Argentinians showed their support for Cristina Fernandez on Wednesday by placing homemade signs on the fence surrounding the presidential palace, where the Argentinian flag was lowered to half-staff. ""Cristina, you are not alone,"" one sign said. Said another, ""Now more than ever, all with Cristina."" And also this: ""Nestor, you are the one who made my dreams come true. Cristina we are with you."" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Nestor Kirchner, 60, has died of a heart attack, the government says .

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez will have to wait until late October to make his debut for Spanish club Barcelona after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) partially upheld the Uruguay star's ban for biting an opponent on Thursday. The striker was suspended from all football-related activity for four months -- preventing him from even training -- after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder during a World Cup group game in Brazil in late June, and banned for nine international matches. Switzerland-based CAS heard the 27-year-old's case last week as he appealed against the punishment imposed by soccer's world governing body FIFA. Suarez and his legal team had spent five hours before a three-man CAS appeal panel in Lausanne in an attempt to reduce the suspension, but the ban on playing was upheld along with a fine of $111,000. However, CAS said he is free to take part in other football-related duties ""such as training, promotional activities and administrative matters"" and confirmed Suarez would be available to play friendly matches for Barcelona and the Uruguay national team during his suspension. ""The CAS Panel found that the sanctions imposed on the player were generally proportionate to the offense committed,"" the ruling stated. ""It has however considered that the stadium ban and the ban from 'any football-related activity' were excessive given that such measures are not appropriate to sanction the offense committed by the player and would still have an impact on his activity after the end of the suspension."" Suarez's ban from competitive matches expires on October 25, and Barcelona's next match is the ""El Clasico"" grudge match with rival Real Madrid the following day. In a statement on its website, the Catalan giants said Suarez would join a training session Friday morning and will be officially unveiled during Monday's Joan Gamper Trophy match at the Nou Camp against Leon. Because he is now free to play in friendly games, Suarez could also make his first appearance for Barca in that match against the Mexican club side. Uruguay also has three friendly internationals scheduled before the end of October so its star striker is available to play against Japan on September 5. But Suarez will still have eight matches of his nine-game ban from competitive internationals to serve and Uruguay FA president Wilmar Valdez said he was disappointed with the CAS ruling. ""It's a cultural matter. The way we live football in South America is different to Europe, for us there are things which are normal and which deserve sanctions, but not such harsh ones,"" he said. But leading Spanish sports lawyer Xavier Canal said the CAS decision was to be expected. ""I find it logical that the player is allowed to train with his colleagues and he can be presented by the club,"" he told CNN. ""The infraction happened while playing for Uruguay, and I think it's logical that the ban on playing for his country (in competitive matches) still stands."" The Chiellini incident was the third time Suarez had bitten a player -- he had previously been banned for similar transgressions while playing for Dutch club Ajax and English side Liverpool. With Suarez sidelined, Uruguay lost its last-16 match to Colombia and was knocked out of the World Cup. Suarez eventually apologized for his actions, but lost his appeal to FIFA over the sanctions before deciding to take the matter to CAS -- an independent ""last resort"" body that deals with sporting disputes. FIFA's punishment did not stop Barcelona signing Suarez from Liverpool in a $127 million deal last month which will give the club a star-studded attack when he finally lines up alongside Lionel Messi and Neymar. Suarez was top scorer in the English Premier League last season, winning the two major player of the year awards for his outstanding performances in helping Liverpool to second place and a return to the European Champions League. He suffered a knee injury at the end of the season which threatened his participation in the World Cup. He missed Uruguay's first game but recovered to score two goals that ended England's hopes of reaching the knockout stages as the South Americans on 2-1. But in the final group game, his bite on Chiellini -- captured by television cameras -- provided the most notorious moment of the World Cup, overshadowing a 1-0 victory by Uruguay that eliminated Italy. In other football news Thursday, UEFA's appeals panel has upheld the decision to expel Legia Warsaw from the Champions League for fielding an ineligible player. Legia won its third qualifying round match against Scottish champions Celtic 6-1 on aggregate, but brought on defender Bartosz Beresynski with four minutes remaining of the second leg. He had been given a three-game ban after being sent off in Legia's final Europa League game last season and duly sat out two matches in the second qualifying round and the first leg of the tie against Celtic. But Legia had failed to officially register Beresynski as a player, leading to the UEFA action. The punishment means it will drop to the Europa League with Celtic reinstated to the final qualifying round of the Champions League, but Legia club officials said they would be making a further appeal to the CAS to overturn the decision.","Luis Suarez's ""biting ban"" is upheld by independent appeals panel .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- When I'm updating my guidebooks, one of my favorite places to visit is rollicking Amsterdam. This Dutch metropolis is ever changing -- and ever crowded with fun-loving sightseers. The Royal Palace in Amsterdam is re-opening after a three-year renovation. Throughout the year, visitors line up to see its three top sights: the Van Gogh Museum, the Rijksmuseum (with Rembrandts, Vermeers and more), and the compelling Anne Frank House. The lines at the sights are generally for buying tickets rather than getting in. To avoid the wait, simply buy your tickets online on the museums' Web sites. The Van Gogh Museum offers the world's finest collection of Vincent's paintings. But from now through June, it's filled with even more. The special ""Van Gogh and the Colors of the Night"" exhibit gathers together the artist's nighttime works from other museums, including the world-famous ""Starry Night."" If you want to complement your Dutch art appreciation with some Dutch alcohol appreciation, gin drinkers can learn the fine points, create their own blend, and then have a bartender mix it on the spot at the new House of Bols: Cocktail & Genever Experience. This modern distillery, designed to give tourists an appreciation of Dutch gin, just opened across the street from the Van Gogh Museum. (And a few blocks away, beer lovers can soak up the recently re-opened Heineken Experience, located at the site of the former Heineken brewery.) On sunny summer days, the Rijksmuseum offers a fun ""lunch-box-with-a-blanket-in-the-park"" deal (about $17 with museum entry or about $6 for just the boxed lunch and a loaner blanket). There are plenty of picnic spots on the pleasant museum grounds between the Rijks and Van Gogh museums. Across town, on the park-like square called the Rembrandtplein, you can now experience Rembrandt's masterpiece, ""The Night Watch,"" in 3-D by checking out a new, kid-friendly statue based on the painting. If inspired by your visit to the Anne Frank House, buy their new pamphlet, ""Persecution and Resistance in Amsterdam"" (75 cents), which leads you on a self-guided walk to the Dutch Resistance Museum and its impressive World War II exhibits. Fans of handbags, and perhaps even their reluctant spouses, will enjoy the hardworking Tassenmuseum Hendrikje (Museum of Bags and Purses), which fills an elegant 1664 canal house with artifacts from 500 fascinating and creative years of bag and purse history. The Royal Palace on Amsterdam's Dam Square re-opens to the public in June after three years of extensive renovations. When constructed in 1648, this sumptuous building was one of Europe's finest. Today, it's the official (though not actual) residence of Queen Beatrix (she lives in The Hague). In Amsterdam's infamous Red Light District, a number of the windows that once displayed prostitutes now showcase the latest fashions -- lit by lights that aren't red. The city government is trying to rein in the sex trade and give the area -- so popular among certain ""window-shopping"" visitors -- a little elegance. It's taken over the window leases from landlords and rented them to local fashion designers instead. Amsterdam's Central Train Station is being renovated and will remain a messy construction project that's expected to inconvenience travelers through 2012. You can save lots of time by getting train tickets and information in a small-town station (such as Haarlem) or at Schiphol Airport's station (where there's wonderful service). Amsterdam's towering yet relaxed Central Library, a short walk from its train station, offers hundreds of fast Internet terminals and welcomes tourists as well as locals to get online for free. While you're there, enjoy the dramatic views from its terrace and a reasonable meal from its slick top-floor cafeteria. Or, perhaps you'd like to check your email in a fog of marijuana smoke at one of the city's many ""coffeeshops."" The Dutch use this English word to describe places that sell cannabis. While indoor tobacco smoke was banned in 2008, pot smoke is no problem in these shops. In a twist that would seem strange to Americans, Dutch coffeeshops can actually lose their license if they allow tobacco smoking inside their premises. South of Amsterdam, idyllic Delft -- dreamy as a painting by hometown artist Johannes Vermeer -- now offers a fine Vermeer Center. While it doesn't have any of the Dutch master's 30-some originals (though Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum has several), the center does a good job tracing the creative mind of Delft's favorite resident, and its shop is the ideal place to buy some ""sou-vermeers."" For about $13, the tourist office offers a two-hour walking tour of the town that includes a canal boat trip -- just right to savor the place that inspired so much fine art. Offering new sights and old masterpieces, the Dutch do a dandy job of making this little country a delight for travelers.

"(CNN) -- The iPad from Apple is the latest member of a new, multi-use generation of technology. It's a book, it's e-mail, it's your social network or your office, it's your music and your photos plus the apps for all of that. And the more ways we can use a device, the more we'll want to take a look at how using it affects those around us. In a nutshell, that's how ""old"" etiquette is applied to new technology. If you have an iPad, here are a few places you might find yourself: . First, be prepared for jealous looks, curious stares and questions from strangers. Don't break it out in public unless you're ready to play show and tell, and possibly share. ""Can I see it? Can I touch it? Can I try it?"" Know your answer, because like a proud momma with a new infant, all the old ladies will want to hold your baby. Have kids? Set the rules for use first thing. Tell them it's only for mommy's or daddy's work, or else be prepared to lose your latest spreadsheet when you walk in the door. Back at the office, think about your work culture. Will the iPad be a handy tool, Mr. Early Adopter, or overkill? Be explicit with colleagues about what you're using it for, such as taking notes or checking a calendar, so they don't think you're playing online Scrabble during your morning meeting. The reading feature is a huge component of iPad use, so feel free to pull it out during your morning commute. The upside: No more awkwardly folding your newspaper into a postage stamp. The downside? People are bound to read over your shoulder; until iPads are ubiquitous, curiosity will draw wandering eyes. When you're with your family, equate iPad reading to the same choices you make with your books and magazines. For example, if your family is watching ""So You Think You Can Dance"" but it isn't your thing, and you'd be reading a magazine during the show regardless, fire up the iPad. Just consider dimming it if the room is dark. But if the idea is to spend quality time interacting with your family, put it away. Even if you think you're paying attention, you won't look like it -- and that's all that's going to matter to your spouse. Without question, turn it off at the dinner table. Reading in bed is another time to think about dimming the iPad. Again, how will it affect others? If their light is out, it's time to dim. What about reading in the car? It's sad to have to spell this out, but never use it if you're the driver! Causing an accident is the ultimate rudeness, to say the least. You know what else is rude? Getting carsick. No matter how excited you are to read the latest updates on Twitter, the laws of physics still apply. Have an iron stomach? While catching up on ""CSI"" may be a good idea, using headphones might be a better one if you'll spoil it for the driver who can't watch. The internet abounds with free recipes, making the iPad handy in the kitchen. Greasy fingerprints on your new gadget aren't so nice, however. If you share your iPad with someone else, wipe it down after kitchen use. As for the bathroom, this debate may continue to rage as it does now for magazines. But since the iPad's resting place in your home isn't likely to be the back of the toilet, this is the one time treating it like a magazine isn't such a hot idea. The iPhone has already created a debate with its access to answers anywhere, anytime. Need to know the capital of Bolivia to win an argument at the dinner table? Pulling out your iPad may win you the debate, but trumping others this way may come off a bit know-it-all. Then again, it could be a huge success. The point of etiquette? Know your audience, and think before you trump. Technology and etiquette have a fascinating intersection. Etiquette lets people know how to act in common -- and sometimes uncommon -- situations, and how to expect others to react. But the pace of technology is blazingly fast and creates new situations daily. So we have to apply a basic tenet of etiquette -- be considerate of those around us -- to constantly adapt to how we, as a society, want to use technology. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anna Post.","When taking out your iPad, be prepared for jealous looks, curious stares and questions .

"(OPRAH.com) -- A few months ago, we had one of those stomach flus familiar to parents of young children everywhere. My son threw up all over his bed, and I wasn't feeling so hot myself. A wiser woman would do her best to forget this nightmare, but in our house, the ups and downs get immortalized on Twitter and Facebook. So when my husband headed off to a gathering of twitterers the next day, I couldn't resist posting an update. And of course my update had to introduce a new hashtag, one of those keywords (preceded by a # sign) that people use to organize conversations on Twitter: . @robcottingham off to #vancouvertweetup while I go home to #pukefest . Rob's response: . @awsamuel Will try to moderate drinking sufficiently to prevent hashtag convergence. #vancouvertweetup #pukefest . But Rob wasn't the only person to respond.

The poor kid was epically sick: She threw up for hours and hours, all night long.

There was enough cause for worry that we decided to switch bottles, and I wrote an extensive blog post on about BPA and the alternative bottles we'd discovered. A year later, the BPA issue got in the headlines once again, and there was suddenly a mass exodus of parents from Avent bottles and the like.

As astonishing as this may sound, we had trouble getting each of our kids to sleep through the night. We read lots of sleep books and even hired a sleep consultant, but each stage of development brought a fresh batch of sleep problems. And each time, we'd find fresh inspiration on the Web. These days, the chief tool in our bedtime arsenal comes from a great idea we found online: Give your kid a ""pass"" at bedtime, good for one glass of water, trip to the bathroom or whatever the latest request might be. With this tip we were able to go from 90 minutes of bedtime drama to just 10 or 15 giving us back our evenings! Get stuff . Another tip we read on lots of parenting sites was to provide an ""attachment object,"" typically a blanket or toy that your baby or child will cling to for comfort and sleep. And many parents emphasized the importance of having a backup in case the favored object goes missing. When our daughter got attached to a green elephant, we purchased a second identical elephant the next week. Little did we know that we'd also need one to keep at daycare and one to pack in her daycare earthquake kit. By that time, the elephant was long gone from our local baby store -- but with some effort, we located a supply online. No matter how obscure your parenting quest, you're likely to find your object of desire somewhere online. Oprah.com: Love your kids with all your might and still raise a good kid . Get help . The Web is a great place to find sitters and other help, if you know where to look. I've generally had great success hiring off Craigslist for both home and business, partly because we make a point of conveying our character: . Do you love to bring order to chaos? We can supply the chaos. We have small kids (both in daycare) and a thriving business, so we really need another person who can help us at home. We may leave our kitchen looking like a disaster area, but we really appreciate the person who restores it to order, and the people who have worked with us at home or in our office have loved working for us. I get lots of responses, and I'm conscientious about checking references. But no system is foolproof: One lovely young woman who came highly recommended looked after our kids several times before we came home early and found our vodka bottle on the kitchen counter...and then hidden away as soon as we turned our back. After that experience, we resorted to a subscription-based website that matches sitters with parents, and found a great sitter among the many responses. And unlike referrals from friends, you're not competing for sitter time with people you know, so you're less likely to come up empty on the night of the big party. Get expertise . We're expertise junkies. I might as well confess that in the past five years, we've had a business coach, a money coach, a sales coach, a doula, a lactation consultant, a sleep coach, a professional organizer and a parenting coach. We've worked with some people by phone and with others in person, but it was our parenting coach -- Barb Desmarais -- who suggested video conferencing via Skype. In just a few conversations, we were transformed from daunted parents of a newly argumentative toddler into a confident, relaxed Dad and a gently authoritative Mom. For five whole minutes. Okay, so the Internet can't turn us into superparents. But what can? As parenting coach Barb once said to us, ""We are all perfect parents -- until we have kids."" What the Internet can do is remind you that you are not the only parent to come up short. And in that recognition comes the self-acceptance and peer camaraderie to get the advice, support and inspiration to be the best imperfect parent you can be.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Reports of Jade Rabbit's demise may have been premature. China's first lunar rover had stopped functioning, state media reported Wednesday, but signs are emerging that Yutu, as it is known in Mandarin, may be up and running again. Following technical malfunctions Xinhua said that the lunar rover had lost communication with mission control but on Thursday the state news agency said that the rover was ""fully awake"" and had returned to its normal signal-receiving status. ""Jade Rabbit has fully resurrected and is able to receive signals, but still suffers a mechanical control abnormality,"" China's lunar program spokesman Pei Zhaoyu told Xinhua. ""The rover entered hibernation while in an abnormal state. We were worried it wouldn't be able to make it through the extreme cold of the lunar night. But it came back alive. The rover stands a chance of being saved as it is still alive."" READ MORE: China's moon landing . Xinhua also posted a screenshot of the Chang'e-3 Moon Probe's Sina Weibo account, which, at 8.49am Thursday morning local time, asked: ""Is anyone out there?"" The rover has over 300,000 followers on the Chinese Twitter-like social media site, some of whom celebrated the lucky robot's resurrection. One Weibo user said that the rabbit was ""waking up for the [Chinese lantern] festival"" which starts on Friday. Another took a cynical view, commenting that some countries would ""be disappointed"" at China's space program's ability to come back from the dead. An amateur website dedicated to monitoring radio signals from space also reported on its Twitter account that it had detected ""pretty good signals"" from the device. The lunar rover's end seemed near when it signed off at the end of January with a poignant message: ""Goodnight humanity."" READ MORE: China's moon rover launched successfully . The device had been out of action for two weeks following a technical malfunction, and media around the world filed its obituary late on Wednesday after a short statement on Chinese state media alerted the world to its apparent terminal failings. ""China's first lunar rover, Yutu, could not be restored to full function on Monday as expected,"" the report stated. However, the robot has given its fans in China and around the world hope that it will resume its planned three-month mission and continue examining the moon's surface for potential resources. The deputy chief designer of the Chang-e probe system told China National Radio the technical team is still trying to determine the source of problem and work on the plan for repair. Should Jade Rabbit make a full recovery, it would cap another success for space exploration, which has seen NASA's Opportunity Mars rover, currently exploring the red planet, far outlast its expected lifespan.

"(CNN) -- The 3-D entertainment craze continues to spread to video games. Nintendo announced Tuesday it will introduce a handheld console that plays games in 3-D without the use of special glasses. The handheld device will be called the 3DS, succeeding Nintendo's DS series of portable gaming consoles. A brief press release issued by Nintendo did not specifically state how the 3-D effect would work on the device. The console won't go on sale until June at the earliest. Nintendo said it will announce more details at the E3 trade show, to be held June 15-17 in Los Angeles, California. Tuesday's announcement marks a new direction for the Japanese-based company, which had previously been dismissive of 3-D gaming. Earlier this year, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata said, ''I have doubts whether people will be wearing glasses to play games at home. How is that going to look to other people?"" The new 3DS device is expected to be backwards compatible, allowing it to play DS and DSi games. The 3DS name itself is a temporary name until the official name is revealed at the E3 convention. Gaming blogs were buzzing Tuesday with speculation about how Nintendo will achieve the 3-D affect without specialized glasses. Kotaku suggests that it may work similarly to a Japan-only game called ""3D Hidden Puzzle,"" which uses the DSi's camera to track the movement of the player and adjust the image accordingly to make it appear 3-D. Nintendo said the 3DS will go on sale before the company's next fiscal year ends, on March 31, 2011. Earlier this year, Sony announced a software improvement that will allow 3-D gaming on its PlayStation 3 console. And some game developers are working on techniques to show their games in 3-D on Microsoft's Xbox 360 device and on PCs. All those systems will require the use of special glasses to achieve the 3-D effect.","Nintendo said Tuesday will introduce a handheld console that plays games in 3-D .

"(CNN) -- Hungry for the comforting food you grew up with? Thanks to some enterprising online retailers, your favorite regional flavors may be just a click away. Cookbook authors Matt and Ted Lee now split their time between New York and their childhood hometown of Charleston, South Carolina. But adjusting to the Big Apple wasn't easy at first for the two brothers. During their first New York winter in 1994, the Lee brothers suffered from serious twinges of homesickness. They sought solace in a childhood favorite --  the unroasted, saltwater-boiled peanuts sold by roadside vendors back home. After procuring 50 pounds of raw peanuts from a Bronx produce market, they set a portion to boiling in a stockpot on the stove. ""Within minutes of our return, the apartment began to fill with steam that smelled like hay, sweet potatoes and tea; about eight hours later, we were cracking the peanut shells, with brine running over our hands, and slurping the nuts down,"" the two wrote in their James Beard Award-winning ""The Lee Bros. Southern Cookbook"" (W.W. Norton & Co.). The heavenly taste of the peanuts transported them home. ""Their earthy, beanlike flavor, in that cramped room overlooking the heroin dealers and hipsters on Ludlow Street, conjured up the creek banks and marshes south of Charleston. The feeling of having cheated geography through food was exhilarating,"" they wrote. A legume-selling obsession began as the brothers sought to share the special treat. The Lees took to the streets -- and then a printed catalog and eventually set up a website, boiledpeanuts.com -- selling the peanuts and other regional staples such as sorghum molasses, pickled artichokes and watermelon rind and stone-ground grits to displaced Southerners all over the country. But the South hardly has a corner on marketing to hometown appetites in other states. A server at the Who's On Third Deli & Grill in Spring Lake, New Jersey, was recently overheard advising a former native about where to buy the region's signature processed ham, known as pork roll. Said she, ""I know there's a website that sells it to people who miss it. Wish I'd thought of that -- I'd make a million dollars."" She'd have to woo customers away from other pork roll online providers such as Jersey Boy Pork Roll, House of Pork Roll and Jersey Pork Roll --  all of which cater to the tastes of transplanted Garden Staters, with the latter offering East Coast favorites such as Tastykake and Drake's snack cakes, Fralinger's Salt Water Taffy and Sabrett's hot dogs. The website hones hunger pangs with a page sharing loyal patrons' memories of Taylor Pork Roll. Grateful customer Lynn Cruse of Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, remembers her family's yearly stop at Atlantic City's Taylor Pork Roll booth. ""Dad, a connoisseur of all delicious foods, felt the experience was worth the expense. We would each get a sandwich and I remember eating it as slowly as I could, savoring each delicious bite, knowing the memory of the sandwich would have to last a whole year. Although my dad passed several years ago, when I savor one of your delicious pork roll sandwiches, I feel him with me."" Soda fans misty for New England's classic Moxie, Kentucky's Ale-8-1 or Michigan favorite Vernors Ginger Ale can get their fix via Virginia Beach-based online retailer, the aptly named The Hard To Find Grocer. The company, founded in 1996, specializes in regional favorites that traditional grocery stores might not sell enough of to justify shelf room. As the physical space is a warehouse not open to the public, there's plenty of room for New Orleans' Zatarain's Creole Mustard and Greenville, South Carolina's Duke's Mayonnaise -- an essential in many Southern recipes -- alongside pickles from Toledo's Tony Packo's and Rhode Island's indigenous coffee syrup Autocrat. Devotees of particular products can either click over to aggregators of regional products, such as cincinnatifavorites, cajungrocer, tastesofchicago, newyorkfirst or themississippigiftcompany or go straight to the source. Classic brands such as North Carolina's Cheerwine soft drink and Chattanooga Bakery's MoonPie, both established in the early 1900s, have embraced online marketing and selling to keep up with the demands of their widespread clientele. And these indulgences come at a price. Often, small producers cannot ship throughout the entire year -- for instance vendors of Buffalo's Sponge Candy cannot subject their delicate, heat-sensitive delicacy to higher temperatures throughout the summer -- or must tack on shipping charges that may be equal or higher than the items being shipped. Still, homesick eaters are more than willing to shell out for their beloved treats. ""Nostalgia is a major ingredient, and then the comforting effect that familiar foods have on the psyche. We tend to take the flavors of our upbringing for granted until we move away -- then they become priceless experiences,"" Ted Lee told CNN. Some favorite dishes don't translate to those who didn't grow up treasuring them. This writer's husband was less than impressed by the the traditional Cincinnati-style, Greek-influenced Skyline Chili she'd ordered online and served as a ""Four Way"" with cheese and onions over spaghetti, while she blanches at the sugar shock of his beloved North Carolina sweet tea. But that's not the end of the world. It just means you won't have to share your favorites.","Some regional treats are a comforting taste of home if you live elsewhere .
These include boiled peanuts from the South, New Jersey's pork rolls, Ohio's chili .
Some online venders will ship regional favorites to your door ."
"(CNN) -- Shin Takemori throws a handful of old brushes onto a fire on a flat stone ""altar,"" where a mound of similar brushes is already ablaze. A dozen people queue behind him, waiting to do the same. Collective garbage disposal? No -- this is a ritual cremation. ""It's to honor the souls of the brushes, for the work they've done,"" explains Takemori, president of Chikuhodo Ltd., one of 80 family run brush-making companies located in Kumano, Japan. Used brushes from all over Japan are brought here to end their days. The brush pyre is a key part of the Fude no Matsuri, or Brush Festival, held annually in Kumano, a mountain town 20 kilometers east of Hiroshima. The festival is held on September 23, the autumn equinox, a national holiday in Japan, when the souls of the dead are believed to return to their earthly homes. Alongside the pyre stands the Fudezuka stone tablet, Kumano's most iconic monument, commemorating the town's first brush makers. Its inscription reads: ""A brush dances to the wind of the heart."" Kumano has long been synonymous with quality brush production, officially recognized by Japan as a traditional industrial art. Of Kumano's 27,000 inhabitants, 1,500 are fude-shi, or brush-making craftsmen. The town turns out a staggering 15 million brushes a year -- 80% of Japan's total brush production. When Japan won the Women's Soccer World Cup in 2011, then prime minister Naoto Kan presented the team's members with a set of Kumano makeup brushes. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said the brushes ""showcase Japan's traditional craftsmanship and global brand power."" How it all started . ""It began about 160 years ago, toward the end of the Edo era (1603-1867),"" explains Takemori. ""This is a mountainous area, with little flat land for farming, so it was hard to survive in winter. Many men used to make ends meet by going away to Nara prefecture, to work in forestry. ""They'd buy calligraphy brushes there and re-sell them on returning to Kumano."" Around 1840, a few enterprising farmers decided to learn to make the brushes themselves. They combined different brush making techniques they'd learned on their travels and developed a method unique to Kumano. In 1877, Japan's introduction of compulsory education, including calligraphy, triggered a surge in demand for calligraphy brushes. Word of Kumano's distinctive brushes began to spread and a brand was born. In recent times, as demand for calligraphy brushes has declined, Chikuhodo (founded in 1952, the company employs more than 100 workers) and other well known Kumano companies began producing high-end makeup brushes and paint brushes, while still using traditional artisan techniques. Now as in times past, most of the brushes are made with animal hair. But what makes Kumano brushes so special? ""Touch them and see!"" Takemori smiles. They're silky soft -- rub one against your face and it's like brushing your cheeks with rose petals. ""Even today, Kumano brushes are all handmade,"" Takemori adds. ""You wouldn't get that softness otherwise."" Baby hair brushes and octopus dumplings . Visitors can watch the time-honored technique in action at Kumano's Fude-no-sato Kobo Brush Museum, where local craftsmen give demonstrations. The museum houses one of the world's largest calligraphy brushes (3.7 meters long, weighing 400 kilos), suspended from the ceiling. In the souvenir shop, you can have your name engraved on the brush. You can also find the Birth Fude -- a special brush for a baby's hair. Better yet, you can have a souvenir brush made from your baby's first hairs. You can also try your hand at making your own brush. During the Brush Festival, tens of thousands of visitors from all over Japan throng tranquil Kumano. The air is alive with the smoky tang of yakisoba noodles, octopus dumplings and skewered squid sizzling on grills at colorful food stalls. At other stalls, local companies sell brushes at discount prices. The heart of the festival is Brush Avenue -- the steep, 99-step path leading to the 10th-century Sakakiyama Shrine. Brush Avenue is festooned with 10,000 brushes of various sizes, hanging down around head-height, ""so everyone can feel them,"" Takemori says. A festival highlight is a demonstration by a master calligrapher. The master paces barefoot around his ""canvas"" (a large vinyl sheet spread on the ground) in a balletic whirl, wielding a heavy brush longer than his arm, while an assistant stands by with an ink pot as big as a barrel. With great, graceful strokes, the master composes a message of gratitude to the Fude no Kokoro (Spirit of the Brush). As the applause fades, an explosion of fireworks heralds the arrival of a boisterous procession, led by a brightly decorated bamboo boat. It carries the kami, or spirit of the local deity. Men in colorful happi coats haul the boat up Brush Avenue (all 99 steps), back to the shrine. There, the kami will rest until next autumn equinox, when Kumano once more falls under the Spirit of the Brush. When to visit . The Fude Matsuri is held on September 23 in Kumano, Hiroshima Prefecture. Kumano is 45 minutes by bus from Hiroshima JR Station and 35 minutes from Kure JR Station. The brush museum is open year-round and sells brushes of all varieties and prices. Kumano brushes are also sold at Japanese department stores, large stationery stores and Hiroshima Station.

"(CNN) -- The Scottish Highlands and Speyside region. The back roads of Kentucky and Tennessee. Suntory's Yamazaki Distillery and Hakushu ""forest distillery."" For seekers of premium malts, these are some of the touchstones of whiskey travel. Now a new whiskey region is laying claim to world-class status. And at some distilleries, the youth movement is right out front and center. At age 26, Jane Overeem has been tasting whiskey since she was 18, primarily as a producer. She and her father, Casey Overeem, distill some of the world's finest single malt whiskey in the garage of their suburban home in Hobart, capital of the Australian island state of Tasmania. In the terms of whiskey bragging rights, the Overeems have already hit the distiller's sweet spot above 94 out of 100 -- the score needed to reach ""liquid gold"" status in the ranking system used by international critic Jim Murray in his annual Whisky Bible. Tasmania has a solid share of the world's single malt whiskeys that carry the ""liquid gold"" tag -- a testament to the island's pristine water, richly flavored brewing barley, highland peat and a favorable climate. Success on the global stage for names such as Overeem, Lark, Nant, Sullivans Cove and Hellyers Road has prompted a trickle of whiskey aficionados to drop into Tasmanian distilleries to taste the product and discuss firsthand with the makers their distinctive characteristics. And where single malt was once the preserve of the over-55 male, these days the buyers of $150-a-bottle premium whiskey are just as likely to be young and female. ""When I first started going to whiskey shows eight years ago, usually I was the only female,"" says Overeem. ""Now it's more like 50-50 men and women."" The world's most southerly distillery . Visitor interest has given rise to a nascent Tasmanian Whisky Trail (with a website that launched just this week) that runs from Burnie on the north coast of the island, through the picturesque central highlands to the lush valleys around Hobart. At the end of the trail visitors find the world's most southerly distillery, William McHenry's operation at Mount Arthur, on the fringe of the Tasman National Park. At 43 degrees south, there's only the vast Southern Ocean between McHenry and the Antarctic. Some of these distilleries -- notably Hellyers Road at Burnie, Nant at Bothwell and Lark in the popular Hobart waterfront precinct -- have well established visitor centers and tasting bars. For the others, it's best to make an appointment. Belgrove Distillery near Kempton is a one-man operation where sheep farmer, sand sculptor and occasional distiller Peter Bignell makes Australia's only rye whiskey at the rate of one 100-liter barrel a month. ""I may be the greenest distiller in the world,"" says Bignell. That's not a reference to a lack of experience, but to the size of his carbon footprint. His rye is grown, malted, fermented, distilled, barreled and bottled on the property. There's no transportation cost, no wasted heat to dry the malt and minimal water usage. This sort of boutique operation is a world away from the blended whiskeys that cater to the mass market, where brands such as Johnnie Walker, Jack Daniel's, Jameson, Suntory and McDowell's No. 1 Reserve dominate respectively for Scotch, American, Irish, Japanese and Indian whiskey. As Tasmania's whiskey godfather Bill Lark describes it, making a single malt is a mixture of science, art and passion. The big oily barley he uses in his Lark Distillers Selection gives it a spicy, aromatic flavor that earned it the title of Australia's best single malt whiskey in 2009 from the Malt Whisky Society of Australia. Growing global demand . Sullivans Cove Distillery, based at Cambridge on the outskirts of Hobart, has won its share of awards and praise, including a 96.5 score from the revered Whisky Bible. But with output of just 20,000 liters a year, chief distiller Patrick Maguire says it's difficult to meet domestic demand, let alone the numerous inquiries he gets from China and India. ""The right attitude for us is quality,"" he says. ""We're growing, but we'll never be a giant distillery."" In the central highlands, where Nant Distillery operates Australia's only water-powered mill to grist its barley, owner Keith Batt aims to make Nant a global brand through a network of whiskey bars. ""We have five whiskey bars now -- two in Brisbane, one each in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, and we'll open a new one in London soon,"" he says. ""My goal in five years is to have 70 bars around the world in cities like New York. ""We scored a gold medal and two silvers in Hong Kong in 2013, so the China market is very attractive for us."" Batt says the highest rating Jim Murray has ever given is a 97.5. ""We got a 95.5 for a three-year-old Nant. Our challenge is to find a 98 among our barrels,"" he says. At Hellyers Road Distillery overlooking Bass Strait, Mark Littler runs Australia's biggest whiskey distillery as a spinoff from the Betta Dairy Company. ""These are exciting times for us,"" he says. ""In a blind tasting at Whisky Live in Paris a few months ago, we were named best New World single malt whiskey."" Hellyers Road hosts 25,000 visitors a year -- as part of the distillery tour, visitors can choose to fill and wax-seal their own bottle. At the other end of Tasmania, William McHenry's X factor is the spring water that bubbles up from Mount Arthur. ""I came here for the pure water, to cool the spirit,"" he says. ""It's a very small operation, so I have to aim high."" Top Tasmanian whiskey distilleries . Hellyers Road Distillery, 153 Old Surrey Road, Burnie; +61 03 6433 0439 .

"(CNN) -- If I were to admit what went on in my house this morning -- how I raised my voice more than once and slammed the kitchen cabinets after my 8-year-old daughter kept talking back to me -- how many people would think I'm a ""bad mother""? Probably more than a few. I bring up the issue after something that took place very publicly involving the new first lady of New York City, Chirlane McCray, wife of Mayor Bill de Blasio. In an in-depth profile in New York magazine on her upbringing, professional experience and relationship with her husband, McCray talks oh-so-briefly (one paragraph in a six-page piece) about how she struggled with the weight of the responsibilities and the loss of some of her independence when her first child, Chiara, was born in 1994. ""I was 40 years old. I had a life. Especially with Chiara -- will we feel guilty forever more? Of course, yes. But the truth is, I could not spend every day with her. I didn't want to do that. I looked for all kinds of reasons not to do it,"" said McCray. ""I love her. I have thousands of photos of her -- every 1-month birthday, 2-month birthday. But I've been working since I was 14, and that part of me is me. It took a long time for me to get into 'I'm taking care of kids,' and what that means."" She never said she was a bad mother, mind you, but that didn't stop one New York City tabloid from using the label. On the front page of the New York Post, along with a picture of McCray, was this nearly full-page headline: ""I Was a Bad Mom!"" The New York Daily News had a slightly more restrained take with a smaller photograph on its front page, along with the headline, ""Didn't want to be a mom."" The coverage prompted an unusual move by the mayor, calling a press conference just to denounce the tabloids and demand an apology to his wife. A features editor at the Daily News, who is a new mom herself and just back from maternity leave, defended the coverage in a post, saying the papers didn't make the story up. It is what McCray said. ""Chirlane, you're probably a good mother. Maybe even a great one. But that doesn't mean you get to fret about your performance â€” then complain at how people discuss it,"" said Raakhee Mirchandani, the Daily News features editor. But is that what happened? Here was a woman speaking candidly and expressing something that a lot of women can probably relate to and then the media jumped in, using the words ""bad mom"" and suggesting she didn't want to be a mom, when that's not the case. Would the media or anyone else, for that matter, do the same if a man admitted he struggled with balancing parenthood and his professional life, or if he realized he didn't want to spend every waking moment with his kids? You know the answer. ""Society has this just general obsession with the dichotomy of motherhood, good versus bad, and we have this failure to see women as whole beings with motherhood only making up one aspect,"" said Avital Norman Nathman, editor of ""The Good Mother Myth: Redefining Motherhood to Fit Reality."" ""Instead, motherhood always gets pushed front and center and then it becomes judged, whether you are excelling or not."" Rebecca Levey, a mom of twins and co-founder of a video sharing site for tweens called KidzVuz, said the whole brouhaha reminds her way too much of a former first lady. ""This sounds so much like when Hillary Clinton said I'm sorry I didn't stay home and make chocolate chip cookies ... and then she had to go freakin' make chocolate chip cookies and put out chocolate chip cookie recipes,"" said Levey, who hosted a parent blogger roundtable earlier this year at City Hall with the mayor and his wife. What these stories do, women say, is make other moms feel less confident to speak out about how motherhood, for them, might not be ""this cookie cutter, sugar coated version,"" said Norman Nathman, who also hosts a blog called The Mamafesto. ""How many people complain about their jobs and nobody questions their ability to do X, Y and Z?"" she said. ""But yet when it comes to motherhood, where we've placed all this pressure on parents and specifically, obviously women to turn out amazing kids, any kind of negative comment and we're blasted."" There has been a trend, Levey said, of female bloggers and authors writing sarcastically about what a bad mother they are, almost making it ""cool"" to be the ""griping mom."" But get serious and the response is not quite the same, she said. ""If you actually admit that maybe on a real level, you think, 'Oh my God, maybe I really messed up (as a mom),' that's not OK,"" said Levey. ""So you can be snarky and sarcastic but you can't be honest."" Katharine Zaleski, mom to a 5-month-old, said as a new mom she totally gets what McCray was saying. ""You work like crazy to get to where you are and then the most wonderful event in your life, the birth of your child, completely rips you from the world you strived to rise in."" ""Frankly, I feel sorry for women who can't express what McCray did,"" said Zaleski, who is co-founder and president of Power to Fly, a new company connecting women and moms with job opportunities. ""To me, that says they don't feel comfortable talking about the lives they built before motherhood and their goals post-baby. Furthermore, when has it been good for children to have mothers who pretend they don't have a life beyond them?"" Jennifer Bosse, a mom of two, ages 1Â½ and 3, went back to work when her firstborn was 7 weeks old.

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- It's the weekend in Cairo and the city's upper crust is letting loose at The Garden, one of the latest night-time spots to open in the Egyptian capital. The city's hip young things strut their stuff on the dance floor while cocktail waiters confidently juggle bottles behind the bar. But behind the whirls, twirls and clinking of glasses is some serious investment. Nearly half a million dollars has poured into this stylish venture since it began. ""We have a lot of support from sponsors, from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable,"" said owner of The Garden, Ismael Kassem. ""There hasn't been a better time to open and attract people to positive experiences than the time we are in now."" The Garden is booked out every night and Kassem and his partners are bullish about the future. ""It's a very profitable and positive business, if you play your cards right and get the right flow of costumers,"" he said. ""It wouldn't take a year, year and a half to get a return on your investment."" Such success is attracting attention of others in the entertainment and nightlife industry. At least five new drinking establishments have recently opened their doors in the city -- a sign the industry maybe slowly shaking off three years of despair. The downturn started with the 2011 revolution that ousted then President Hosni Mubarak. The election of an Islamist President, Mohamed Morsi, in 2012 had the industry fearful for its survival. Morsi would last barely a year in office, however, as a military coup ousted him in 2013. Through that entire time, a shattered economy was kept down by violence and uncertainty. But not everywhere was suffering. Alchemy, a chic establishment known for drinks with a dash of chemistry, opened at the height of the turmoil in 2012. According to Alchemy owner and industry veteran, Alex Rizk, the conditions always existed for smartly run bars and restaurants to prosper. ""A lot of investors are looking at what is running and surviving the revolution, and economic prices and that is mainly food outlets, coffee shops and I would say eventually nightlife,"" Rizk said. It boils down to one simple thing, Rizk believes. ""People do want to party, do want to forget their daily life a bit,"" he said. Building on their initial success, Rizk and his partners plan to open a new club soon. Kassem is also eying three new venues over the next three years, equaling millions of dollars in investment. But this is Egypt, where political and economic chaos persist and neither Kassem nor Rizk take that for granted. ""Of course we are bullish but we aren't foolish,"" Kassem said. ""If we find it unprofitable, we won't go into it."" It's a delicate balancing act like that performed by the skilled cocktail waiters at The Garden. Both Kassem and Rizk hope it will pay out in dividends. See also: Can Hard Rock Cafe get its groove back? See also: Gulf looks to rival Paris as fashion capital .

"Dubai, UAE (CNN) -- Dubai Creek was once the heart the Gulf emirate's business activity, where boats and barges sailed along transporting goods and people to foreign ports. From electronics to sporting goods, the Creek is still a vibrant trading base, but far from the integral shipping hub it once was. For centuries this is where all Dubai's international business happened. Much of the goods bought and sold here went to India, which over time became the United Arab Emirates' largest trading partner. In the 1970s, trade between the two countries amounted to $180 million a year. Today, this figure is closer to $75 billion. With growing business ties, many Indians have moved to Dubai in search of work and opportunity -- but home is never far from their mind. Shekhar Patni is one of almost 2 million Indians working in the UAE. He moved here more than 30 years ago and decided it was a good place to set up his jewelery business. His company has since grown to be valued at more than $20 million. ""It's the culture, the mixed culture of India and the Middle East,"" Patni says on why he decided to settle in Dubai. ""This is the more important for us. And it is very close to India."" As his native country awaits the outcome of parliamentary elections, Patni is watching closely even though he doesn't have a vote. Patni says he sends a huge portion of his earnings home for his family, business and for investments. He's far from alone in this endeavor. Krishnan Ramachandran runs a wealth management group in Dubai that manages $400 million worth of assets belonging to Indians living in the UAE. The majority is re-invested in India. ""We cater to a wide range of clients starting from the person who's at the bottom of the pyramid to somebody at the top of the pyramid,"" said Ramachandran. ""It's always the aspiration of any expat Indian coming to this region to save and send money, as much as possible, back home,"" he added.""On an average the target is between 40% to 50% of their earnings here."" That's because most of his clients intend to go back one day, he says. One such client is construction worker, Mukesh Sharma. ""I'm in Dubai for the last 10 years,"" Sharma said. ""We keep transferring the money, you know to exchanges and all. I plan to go after maybe two, three years. ""That's my plan right now. Then I'll go and settle down (back in India)."" Remittances from overseas Indians like Sharma amounted to $71 billion last year, according to the World Bank, more than any other country in the world. That gives Dubai's Indian ex-pats tremendous economic clout in the Gulf emirate and back home -- even without a vote in the elections. See also: The Middle East's king of hotels .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress and animal rights activist Eva Mendes hopes you'll shun fur as you shop for the holidays. ""Even if you buy a fur glove with the little trim, and you think 'Oh, my God, it's just a little trim,' that animal got clubbed,"" Mendes said. Mendes took her clothes off two years ago for the PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) ""Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur"" campaign, but now she wants you to see something less pleasant. She's narrated a video of PETA's latest undercover footage of animals being killed for their fur. ""These animals are beaten to death, they're skinned alive, their throats are slashed while they're still alive,"" she said. ""They're anally electrocuted, just so the fur won't become tainted."" It's unlikely you'll see the 3-minute video on television because of its gruesome nature. But it shouldn't be hard to find it spreading virally online. ""It's not something you want to see,"" she said. ""But it's something you have to see."" Mendes says she's confident that anyone who watches it will eventually ditch furs as fashion. ""Even if you don't do something today, it'll stay in your consciousness and you'll think about it,"" she said. ""That's why these strong images are so necessary for people to see, because they'll stay in your mind, and maybe in your subconscious. They'll stay there and that will really help you make a more evolved decision in the future."" Mendes said her dog, Hugo, ""changed her world"" and convinced her to campaign against fur. ""I've become so much of a more just sensitive, empathetic person towards animals because of him,"" she said. ""Because he's just so precious and I can't imagine wearing him or eating him, and what's really the difference between him or some little raccoon or some bunny or seal?"" Mendes stopped eating beef, chicken and pork two years ago, but she still consumes animal products such as cheese and milk. But there is a great substitute for animal fur, she said.

"(CNN) -- IN FOCUS: IRAQ'S CHILDREN LIVING IN GARBAGE DUMPS . As Iraq emerges as the world's fourth largest oil reserve in the world, the country's leaders are hoping their wealth can provide a decent living to its citizens, but for many living in Baghdad's Sadr City, the dream of a better life is far from becoming true. Men, women, children pushed by poverty, spend their days scouring the dumps looking for things to sell. From plastic bottles to aluminum cans, one man's trash has become another man's treasure. In Iraq it is a crucial lifeline for a number of families. FACETIME: NAJIB MIKATI, LEBANESE PRIME MINISTER . With the ongoing Syrian civil war, Lebanon is continuing to feel the ripple effect.

"(CNN) -- French baguettes and pastries aren't the traditional bread of choice in the Middle East. But a bakery opened by a one of the region's foremost gourmet food companies is aiming to change that. Saudi Arabian firm, Bateel, hopes that by providing an international flavor to their offerings they will be able to further entice customers to their branded stores and cafes across the Middle East. The group has certainly come a long way from its early days as a humble date producer. Bateel first started manufacturing gourmet dates in 1992, adding nuts and chocolate to the traditionally popular fruit and selling them in upmarket boutique stores. ""At that time dates were being sold in supermarkets and souks,"" said Bateel CEO, Ata Atmar. ""But we decided that we wanted to market dates like Swiss chocolates."" ""We took essentially an agricultural product and turned it into a luxury food item and in the process created an entire new industry."" A little more than 20 years later and Bateel is now operating in 17 countries with Saudi Arabia and the UAE representing its biggest markets. Drinks, oils and jams have also been added to its product repertoire during this time. ""Surprisingly, dates is not as big of a business for us (any more),"" said Atmar. ""We are now a very much integrated premium food company. About 25% to 30% of our business comes from dates."" To help market its food products the company launched the Bateel Cafe in 2007, featuring its ingredients on the menu. It also carried on selling its goods through its shops and other outlets like hotels and airports. This carefully calculated strategy of diversification has paid dividends. ""We just signed with Qatar, the new terminal, so in a way the airport is an extension of our retail business,"" Atmar said. ""In the (Dubai Duty Free) we are the number one food market here ... so there is a major presence."" Atmar says Bateel has seen 20% to 30% growth in the past five years. But he said that this is not enough for what he eventually envisions for the company. ""Outside the Middle East, or outside the Gulf, we are going on a franchise business,"" he said. ""I'd like to see when you go to Beijing, you say it's time to go out and have a cup of coffee and you say 'oh, there's a Bateel here, let's go to Bateel.' Just as you do that in Dubai or Abu Dhabi."" Perhaps this is the next stage of the Bateel story, transforming a homegrown Middle Eastern group into a truly global brand.","Bateel is a Saudi gourmet food company founded in 1992 .

"(CNN) -- The city of Portland, Oregon, has been forced to dump millions of gallons of drinking water. Why? Because someone urinated into a water reservoir. Surprising still, this isn't the first time this has happened. The latest incident took place about 1 a.m. Wednesday. Cameras captured three teens near the Mount Tabor Reservoir No. 5. One of them approached the iron fence and apparently got close enough to relieve himself directly into the reservoir. The three teens were apprehended, and the 50-million-gallon reservoir was taken offline for testing. Thanks to the teens, the Portland Water Bureau will have to dump 38 million gallons of drinking water, said administrator David Shaff. ""Our customers have an expectation that their water is not deliberately contaminated,"" he said. All three teens received citations for trespassing; one was cited for public urination. Shaff told the Oregonian newspaper that the teen knew exactly what he was doing. ""It's stupid,"" Shaff told the newspaper. ""You can see the sign that says: 'This is your drinking water. Don't spit, throw, toss anything in it.' He's four feet away from that sign."" Shaff was also the administrator when a similar incident took place in June 2011.

"(CNN) -- In a tiny car repair shop in the Jordanian capital of Amman, one can encounter the latest efforts to solve the country's sky high youth unemployment rate. It's here that 23-year-old Khaleel Anwar can now fix his sights on a career after a year-long apprenticeship program. ""I learned so many things such as how to monitor a car using an electronic device, also how to fill gas the proper way using this device,"" Anwar said. After years of debate on how to lift up the most vulnerable, training programs are targeting the informal economy and small businesses that need qualified workers. This is a regional challenge. Youth unemployment in the Middle East and North Africa is running above 27%, the highest in the world. Jordan's is slightly above that average and the government has allocated ample resources to try and reverse this trend. According to the World Bank, this equates to some 10% of GDP for the last two decades. But the challenge is to close the gap between what happens here in the classroom and what is needed by industry. This is where Yasser Ali of the International Labour Organization (ILO) comes into the picture. For their auto academy pilot program, the ILO brought together trade unions and private sector companies to see what is needed in the labor market. ""Thinking like this can make a step forward in order to address youth unemployment but it needs involvement of all partners in this process,"" Ali said. And the early results are promising. Trainer and mentor, Youssef Rahal, said he's taught nearly 200 students with a placement rate of 89%. ""There is a drastic change in the students,"" Rahal said. ""They come to us with no skills; they are either drop outs or only have high school degrees, they are 17, 18, 19, 20-year-olds."" Countrywide endeavor . It's not just in the inner cities that are the focus of the training programs. In the rural Bedouin area of Mafraq two hours drive from Amman, there is ground breaking work taking place inside a local community center. Up to 50 women, many who have not held jobs before, are being trained to work in a textile factory that is being built nearby. ""There is strong demand because it's a ladies environment and everything is available for us,"" said Tahani Salama, a worker in the factory. ""The most important is transportation that is guaranteed."" Her colleague Ruwaida Thamri agrees. ""It has helped me to meet new people. I now know how to communicate with my manager and my colleagues."" According to the local tribal leader, Nimer Al Fawwaz, such progress has only been made possible by having a dialogue with parents to get support for women to enter the workforce -- which represents a cultural breakthrough in itself. ""We want more courses and more attention to it and focus on more production companies within this area,"" Al Fawwaz said. Call it a small success story for a big problem plaguing the region.","Training programs are aiming to bring more young Jordanians into workforce .

"(CNN) -- In the port city of Aqaba, southern Jordan, construction works are popping up everywhere. This special economic zone on the Red Sea -- where key container shipping, manufacturing and tourism industries sit side by side -- lies less than half an hour from Israel and Egypt by shuttle boat. It is also favorably positioned as an entry point for seaborne goods heading north through Iraq and central Asia. Now, after the uncertainty of the global economic crisis and Arab Spring, Aqaba is beginning to fulfill its promise. The city's population has doubled since the year 2000 to 140,000 people today. Another 100,000 are expected to move in by 2020. Businesses are also arriving. After $300 million of investment on cranes & equipment, shipping traffic has more than doubled in eight years. According to Jeppe Jensen, CEO of Aqaba Container Terminals, which is nearly a third of the way through a 25-year lease on a one-kilometer area along the waterfront, Aqaba stands out as a place to do business. ""We are at the crossroads of three continents and four countries which makes us a natural hub,"" Jensen said. But with neighboring Iraq paralyzed by conflict and faced with the very real prospect of breakup, regional uncertainty is once again an issue for businesses operating here. Jensen believes, however, that his clients can bank on Jordan's alliances with Washington, Brussels and the Arab Gulf States. ""We now have the political instability which dampens the throughput to Iraq,"" he said. ""(But) we do believe when Iraq is cleared out again there will be a huge potential for Aqaba."" Growth industries . Other companies spy opportunity amidst the uncertainty. Streit armored cars is one of more than 1,300 companies calling Aqaba port home -- no doubt enticed by a 5% corporate tax on net profits despite the nearby chaos. The company recently signed a long term lease to help double factory space and monthly production. After political unrest and war in Syria and Iraq, demand is solid for armored personnel carriers (APCs). ""Six months ago we were 4,000 square meters now we are 8,500 within another six months we will be at 18 thousand square meters,"" said Ziad Al Essa, vice-chair and general manager of Streit . Makers of armored cars aside, companies are here are trying to read the regional headwinds. As well as the increasingly complex conflict in Iraq, Egypt is under new rule after revolution and counter-revolution while the Israeli and Palestinian conflict still persists. The ideal location for doing business, it seems, comes with risk attached.","Aqaba is a port city on the rise in Southern Jordan .

"(CNN) -- As the legend goes, it all started with two Americans living in London in search of a good burger. Bereft of what they considered acceptable options, the pair decided to open their own American-styled diner with the food and attitude to match. They would call this nascent start-up the Hard Rock Cafe. Over the next two decades this famous old joint became a regular haunt for A-list musicians and a museum for rock star memorabilia. Today, it's a global industry with 180 venues in more than 50 countries, including outlets as far afield as Bahrain and Dubai. But building this rock and roll empire hasn't been easy. When current CEO, Hamish Dodds, took over in 2004 many considered the brand old and tired. Like record companies and music stores, the Hard Rock Cafe found itself asking how can a business so synonymous with the vinyl epoch stay relevant in the age of the digital download? ""I think that's part of the challenge for this brand as it does have a history but it's also part of the beauty,"" Dodds told CNN. ""It''s really around being relevant for the younger consumers (as) so many ... are not familiar with (our) history."" Hard Rock Cafe has sought to keep up with the latest trends by adapting and expanding its services. The company now stages 26,000 live gigs every year, Dodds said, and has successfully added hotels and casinos to its portfolio since the turn of the century. Revenues jumped from under $1 billion dollars in 2003 to $3.5 billion in 2013 with the casino business accounting for the largest chunk of this rise. Now the Hard Rock Cafe is aggressively expanding in Asia and the Middle East with plans for hotels in Abu Dhabi and a cafe in Doha. ""We've been here (in the Middle East) a very long time,"" Dodds reflected. ""Our cafes have basically had a very successful run (and our) new cafe in Dubai has really performed extremely well. ""There's something special about our brand, it resonates a lot with our Middle Eastern customers."" But with the lucrative gaming side of the business not permitted in many nations within the region, Dodds sees the more traditional aspects of the cafe's brand coming to the fore. Hard Rock t-shirts and other merchandise still account for between 30% and 50% of sales at each destination after all. ""In markets where gaming is not permitted, we still have growth and consumer opportunities in hotels and cafes,"" Dodds said. He adds that the company will also look to tailor its offers to the diverse markets it now finds itself operating in. ""You used to go to a hard rock cafe and they all looked the same."" ""So we've changed that mechanic again as part of the brand re-invigoration and we want everyone to be different and to reflect the personality of the building and the country and the people in that country,"" he said.

"Mafraq, Jordan (CNN) -- In the Mafraq region of northern Jordan, it's not unusual to witness a shepherd guide his flock along a busy highway. This is Bedouin country after all, roughly two hours drive from the capital Amman and just a stone's throw from the Syrian border. These days, farmers on this land share tales of struggle. The arteries of their work, roads through Syria onto Turkey, have been cut off by the vicious fighting amongst their northern neighbors. ""It is difficult to go on with the business,"" said Muslih Ajal Massaeed, a Jordanian Wool Distributor. ""At the moment we can't do anything. We gather wool and stop until Allah can send us a buyer."" Three years into Syria's civil war, these prayers have yet to be answered. Many tons of sheep's wool remains piled up in Massaeed's distribution yard rotting with no place to go. Without safe passage through Syria the wool cannot make it to market in Turkey. Jordanians say Romanian farmers instead are filling the void in their stead. Eventually, due to the cost of storage, those in Mafraq say their unexportable supply may have to be burned. ""Of course the Syrian border is very important to us,"" Massaed continued. ""It was the source of our income to Turkey and we were pleased and there was business flow."" Refugee crisis . It's not only along the border that frustrations are being felt. Tribal leaders like Nimer Al Fawwaz speak of Syrian refugees now making up nearly one out of every four residents of nearby towns. This creates even more tensions for the work that is available. ""The Syrians took over so many jobs in the commercial sector, tailoring and farming, especially cheap wages, working 10 to 15 hours a day,"" said Al Fawwaz. With little in the way of manufacturing in the rural areas, the government has encouraged vegetable farming. But with no certainty of getting goods through Syria and now Iraq, buyers in the wealthier Gulf states are looking elsewhere. Farmers say they are fetching just one fifth the value of their tomatoes compared to the last two years. ""This year it (the tomato price) changed completely to half a dinar ($0.70) a kilo,"" explained vegetable grower Abdulla Abu Saleh. ""I don't know what it will cover. The labor or insurance or spending on the farm or planting soil. It is expensive and it is (a) major negative impact on all farmers,"" he added. State support . Agriculture is still a nascent industry here and growers complain there is no government help or a farming cooperative to help with distribution. Mohamed Khair, a farm owner complained that ""a farmer cannot be a farmer and a supplier. There should be a market regulator that controls the production with the help of the government."" For Abu Saleh, such concerns lead him to question the wisdom of continuing to grow vegetables if he cannot sell them. ""We already have been affected so hard and we might not produce after this year. (There is) no demand and all the money we consumed is such a waste."" With the government hindered by the rising cost of providing for refugees, the sought after financial relief is likely to remain in short supply.","Farmers in Jordan's Mafraq region impacted heavily by conflict in Syria .

"(CNN) -- The horrific loss of life from the three week conflict in Gaza can never be valued -- but the economic fallout from war is also devastating the local population. In the case of Gaza, a seven year air and sea blockage imposed by Israel since Hamas came to power has isolated its economy. The blockade has limited supplies of concrete and basic construction materials as well as medical supplies and food stuffs. According to the World Bank, half of Gaza's 1.8 million residents live in poverty and one out of every three workers is unemployed. As Gaza's official economy has contracted, the shadow economy -- also known as the tunnel economy -- blossomed. Underground tunnels were built by Gazans to circumvent the blockade allowing goods to be illegally smuggled from Egypt. But the tunnels have also been used by Hamas to bring in weapons and launch attacks on Israel. CNN's John Defterios sat down Middle East strategist David Butter to ask what could reverse the isolation of the Gaza economy. He started by asking how the situation has changed over the last six to 12 months. David Butter (DB): What's changed in the last year is the closure of the tunnels by the Egyptian government . This was handling up to 200 tons of trade every day. Fuel was running through, cars (too). It was a thriving (entryway) for bringing things in and of course Hamas was collecting a lot of revenue from customs and licenses on these tunnels. John Defterios (JD): What are the conditions on the ground for Palestinians today with the tunnels shut and before the strikes? DB: About half of the Gaza population receive humanitarian support from the UN. There's also salaries coming in from the Palestinian Authority to its members of the civil service -- there's about 70,000 of those. But without that trade coming in through the Rafah crossing from Egypt, the situation is becoming increasingly more subdued and desperate for the people on the ground. JD: Grinding poverty and the desire by Hamas to strike at Israel. Would you say there is a direct link? DB: Well, I think the timing of this escalation is linked to a number of things. Obviously we have the breakdown of the peace process. We have the reconciliation if you like, the unity government between Hamas and Fatah. But certainly from the Hamas point of view, the desperation they were in may have driven them to risk getting involved in this escalation on the assumption that a major crisis would result in a major reappraisal of the entire economic situation.","Blockade has brought Gaza economy to its knees .

"(CNN) -- After almost three centuries at the heart of London's busy Piccadilly retail district, Fortnum and Mason is broadening its horizons. The upscale British store, which is a favorite of the Queen Elizabeth, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duchess of Cambridge, opened its first ever standalone store outside of the UK in Dubai last month. Located directly opposite the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, the sparkling new 9,400 square feet outlet aims to offer a slice of the vintage London retail experience in the Gulf. The new site includes all the trademark Fortnum and Mason features such as an English tea salon and ice cream parlor as well as stocking the wicker hampers and luxury food items the company is most famous for. But what's the business thinking behind the move and why was Dubai chosen as the location for Fortnum's first big foray into foreign markets? CNN's John Defterios sat down with Fortnum and Mason CEO, Ewan Venters, to find out. John Defterios (JD): Why has Fortnum and Mason decided to move into the region? Ewan Venters (EV): Fortnum and Mason is 300 years old and over the decades the business has had to change and evolve all the time. So, here we are in downtown Dubai with lots of the traditional aspects of the Fortnum's business but in a more contemporized way of presentation. JD: Would you say it's a risk taking a very traditional brand into a modern setting without wanting to undermine the brand at the same time? EV: One of the key requisites of the strategy is that we said we must have a standalone site. Dubai is an extremely important commercial center for luxury retail but we were never taking Fortnum and Mason into a shopping mall. We're only here because this site is possibly the finest retail site in Dubai. JD: Do you see other safe harbors in the Middle East? EV: I think we'll keep everything under watch and review. Our first priority is establishing ourselves in Dubai in this 9,500 square foot store. But beyond the opening of the store, later in the year we'll launch our website so we'll actively develop our online strategy throughout the region. I don't suppose we'll ever be in multiple sites across the region, maybe one or two additional sites. JD: You have a Gulf base of customers, can you take me through what you can offer them to help you expand?

"(CNN) -- Two late bogeys left Rory McIlroy a frustrated figure in Colorado but the four-time major winner was hoping a spot of gridiron would help lift his spirits. The Northern Irishman is still tied for the BMW Championship lead on three-under despite that slump, but his thoughts immediately turned to the Seahawks' NFL clash with the Packers. McIlroy, who described himself as a ""big time"" football fan, said: ""Even though you guys play with pads on, which ... I don't understand."" The 25-year-old met Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning at Cherry Hills Country Club on Tuesday, who handed over tickets for its opener against the Colts on Sunday. And McIlroy is well placed to head to Mile High Stadium as the leader of the FedEx playoffs after he joined Americans Gary Woodland and Jordan Spieth at the top of the leaderboard. The 2014 British Open and U.S. PGA champion had been out in front on five-under but dropped two shots in his final three holes to sink back into the pack. ""I'm a little frustrated coming off the course, because I feel like it should have been better than what I finished,"" McIlroy told Sky Sports. ""But you can see by the scores, it's pretty tricky out there ... so a 67 is a really good start, even though it could have been a bit better. ""The fairways are firm so even when you're hitting irons and fairway woods off the tees they're running out and through fairways and into the rough and the rough is thick. ""Then the greens are so firm, the greens have got so much firmer over the past 24 hours and it's really made a huge difference."" The course's elevation has suited big hitters like McIlroy, who was launching drives nearly 400 yards in his practice rounds prior to the tournament. But the different air conditions make it more tricky to judge distance and ball flight, with several players overshooting greens on the opening day.","Rory McIlroy shares the lead at the BMW Championship in Colorado .

"(CNN) -- This time last year Jordan Spieth barely registered on golf's radar, now it seems merely a matter of time before he assumes the mantle of major champion. The 20-year-old will tee off at Pinehurst on Thursday as one of the favorites to lift the U.S. Open, a measure of his stellar rise over the past 12 months. Spieth became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour for 82 years when he bagged the 2013 John Deere Classic, underlining the potential encompassed in his swing. He briefly held the lead during the final round of the Masters before tying for second and was in contention at the Players Championship, eventually finishing fourth. So what price a maiden major championship in North Carolina aged 20 years and 10 months, roughly five months before Tiger Woods captured his first? ""I truly believe I can win a major -- right now I think I'm ready to,"" the Texan told CNN. ""Each and every week is about preparing for the next major championship. ""The U.S. Open is a major which is what legacies are defined by. That's what Rory (McIlroy) says all the time, golf is all about winning majors. ""To be able to go into this event with a lot of confidence, I feel like I'm going to embrace the challenge."" Much has been made of the test Pinehurst will present, a markedly different one to 2005 when unfancied New Zealander Michael Campbell triumphed. It has since been reshaped by two-time major champion Ben Crenshaw and his business partner -- famed golf architect Bill Coore -- who have restored many of its original features. The pair have ripped out reams of rough and widened many fairways, but that won't necessarily makes things any easier. Sandy scrub, pine straw and wiregrass now flank the fairways, meaning any errant tee shots could lead to a lottery in terms of lie. The winning scores in three of the last four U.S. Open tournaments have been even par or less, underlining what a biting examination of a player's game it represents. But that doesn't phase Spieth -- it excites him. ""I love the hardest challenge you can get,"" he explained. ""The U.S. Open is the most difficult challenge in all of golf. That is exciting for us, it's awesome. ""It's going to be really interesting at Pinehurst with no rough. Everyone who has been there has raved about the place. ""Any time you can play golf's toughest test and try to test your game, if you can beat the golf course you really feel special after that round."" Spieth has been feeling pretty special for most of the last year. His breakthrough victory at the John Deere proved he possessed the talent and temperament required to prosper on the biggest stage. After memorably holing a bunker shot to force his way into a playoff, Spieth secured victory on the fifth extra hole, defeating David Hearn and Zach Johnson, the 2007 Masters champion. He recorded a pair of top four finishes in the FedEx Cup, including second place in the season-ending Tour Championship, before taking part in the USA's winning Presidents Cup encounter with their International counterparts. At 2014's first major, Spieth muscled his way into the final group at Augusta on Sunday, and at one point assumed the lead from playing partner and eventual winner, Bubba Watson. Spieth finished in a tie for second. Then at golf's unofficial fifth major, the Players Championship, Spieth was again in the final grouping before a late wobble saw him fall to fourth, playing partner Martin Kaymer, from Germany, taking top honors. But for someone whose goal at the start of the season was to thrust himself into contention at a major championship, it was very much mission accomplished. ""I knew I was going to be in all four majors and it was about getting out there and contending because I knew it would be a different feeling than contending in any event I'd been in before,"" he said. ""I wanted to see how I would perform and sure enough at that first one in Augusta I got off to the start I needed. ""I had the right game plan that week. I knew how difficult the golf course was playing -- the weather made it firm and fast -- and I didn't let bogeys bother me. ""I played my way into contention on Sunday, I had the lead. ""I feel like I played some really strong golf with the amount of pressure I felt that week -- a bounce here, a bounce there then I might have been wearing the green jacket on my first try. ""That's really cool looking back at that and knowing I accomplished one of my goals for the year."" Spieth's preparations for Pinehurst have included calls to Crenshaw, to pick his brains as to the redesign, and strength and conditioning work in the gym. As well as repeating his ""stay patient"" mantra, Spieth has also been grooving his swing to make sure it stands up to the fierce examination of the closing holes in a major championship. ""I feel like it's all falling into place,"" Spieth said. ""I know from Augusta when you are in the thick of things and you're feeling that intense pressure the most important thing is making sure the most basic part of your golf swing stays the same. ""It is tough staying patient, I'm not a patient person off the course at all so it's very hard, especially when emotions are so heightened. ""I did a very, very good job of it at Augusta, and a very good job for a little while at the Players. ""I've got a lot of confidence going in that I can put it together a little longer, just having been in the heat twice now in two of the strongest fields in the world that I've ever played against.""","Jordan Spieth tells CNN he is ready to win his first major golf championship .

"(CNN) -- A Tiger prowling the fairways may be a familiar sight, but at a golf club in Switzerland it is a fox that has emerged as a new star of the game. The antics of a red fox cub at the alpine Verbier Golf Club's par three Moulins course have sparked the sort of global media interest golf's big cat Tiger Woods might be proud of. ""The story has gone around the world,"" the club's director Thomas Grech told CNN. ""It's very, very funny. ""The fox comes every day at the end of the afternoon between four and six o'clock. ""He's running around in between holes one and six waiting for the players to hit the ball and then directly he is running after the ball and running away with it in his mouth. ""He has a nice red coat. He's very young and is alone with no other fox."" Nicknamed ""Foxy,"" the young fox has been arriving for its regular late afternoon round for the last month. And, rather than being hunted down, the fox is proving to be good for business. ""People are very interested and many people come in the afternoon to see the animal,"" Grech explained. ""We live in the mountains so it's usual to see animals; we have dogs and cats which sometimes come. ""But it's not very common to see a savage animal coming so close to people who play on the golf course. It's very, very special for us. ""My colleague Muriel Guex who looks after the restaurant tells me she has more people in between four and six o'clock for when the fox comes."" See you later, alligator .

Explore the world's most extreme courses . But the golfers in Switzerland are at ease with the regular appearance of their four-legged friend at Verbier. ""Of course the fox is disturbing the game,"" Grech continued. ""But people are not angry at all. There is no problem. ""He is just trying to play with the golfers."" The only downside seems to be the cost of losing all those golf balls. The club estimates that Foxy has snaffled more than 100 balls. Tricky little fox . ""We do not know where the balls are,"" admitted Grech. ""He has a few holes around the golf course. People have looked for them but no chance. ""It's more a game for the fox. He is tricky -- but we like the little fox."" Nestled in the Swiss Alps, the village of Verbier is expecting its first snow fall in November for its prestigious ski season ahead. The approaching winter will close the golf course at the beginning of the month and that means the club's newest player faces an uncertain future. ""In the winter, he will stay more in his hole in the earth,"" Grech predicted. ""Maybe next spring we will see the fox. We will see...""","A fox who waits to catch golf balls has become an unwitting video star .

"(CNN) -- It's an all too familiar feeling for the high handicap golfer. The total mishit which instead of launching the ball to the heart of the green instead sees it barely leave the ground and end in deep rough. So when the same fate befell world number one Rory McIlroy at least most of the large gallery following him Friday at the World Tour Championship in Dubai could empathize. McIlroy had been in a perfect position in the middle of the seventh fairway with a five-wood in his hand as he attempted to hit the green at the par-five hole with his second shot. But hitting the lush turf before the ball, his lame effort squirted left and into an awkward position. ""He's human after all"" was the verdict of the TV commentary team and McIlroy's followers on social media as the European Tour official website was quick to post the evidence. McIlroy could even afford a wry smile -- ""a fat, low, duck-hook runner that was not intentional,"" was his verdict after the round -- before normal impeccable service was resumed. From the tricky position in deep rough he conjured up a superb recovery shot to within a few feet of the flag. But the Northern Irishman, who has already wrapped up the Race to Dubai, failed with the putt to encapsulate a day of missed opportunities. He was just one-under-par on the four par-five holes on the Earth Course where his incredible power gives him such an advantage. McIlroy also found the water off the tee at the last, but like on the seventh hole, recovered to make his par for a two-under round of 70. It left him in a tie for second with England's Danny Willett and Richie Ramsay of Scotland at eight-under, two shots adrift of defending champion Henrik Stenson of Sweden, who followed a first round 68 with a fine 66. ""I just didn't quite have it,"" he admitted. ""I started to hit some better shots on the back nine and I'm happy where I am two behind with 36 holes to play,"" he added. McIIlroy, playing his first tournament in six weeks, is bidding to end a triumphant season on a high note, having won two majors in 2014 and climbed back to the top of the rankings. A first round 66 had left him in the joint lead with playing partner Shane Lowry of Ireland. Lowry also had an eventful round, acing the par-three 13th but also missing several other birdie opportunities to finish in a five-strong group at seven under. This also included England's Justin Rose, who carded a six-under 66, but like McIlroy could only make par on the final hole after finding the water with his opening drive. The tournament, which brings together the top 60 on the money list, is the final event of the European Tour season with an $8 million prize purse on offer.","Henrik Stenson leads at halfway of the World Tour Championship in Dubai .

"(CNN) -- You would think that fans watching a golf tournament on site would be more susceptible to being hit by an errant ball than a golfer but that wasn't the case at the KLM Open in the Netherlands on Thursday. In a rare occurrence, Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti was struck on the head and was taken to hospital as a ""precaution,"" the European Tour said. He was receiving treatment but was okay, the Tour added. ""The latest report from hospital is that all neurological tests have come back clear,"" the Tour's tournament director, Miguel Vidaor, told the European Tour's website. ""We wish Fabrizio a speedy recovery."" The 31-year-old Zanotti -- who earlier this year became the first Paraguayan to win on the European Tour -- was on the 16th fairway when he was hit by Alexandre Kaleka's shot from the 14th tee. Zanotti was attended to on site by a doctor and paramedic as a concerned Kaleka looked on before an ambulance transported him to hospital. Play had to be suspended but resumed about two hours later. Fellow golfers Felipe Aguilar of Chile and Ricardo Gonzalez of Argentina are staying with Zanotti and have pulled out of the event, the Tour said. Entering Thursday, Zanotti was 27th in the Race to Dubai standings. At No. 94, he is the second highest-ranked South American golfer in the world behind Argentina's Angel Cabrera.","Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti goes to hospital after being hit on head by ball .

"(CNN) -- The contrast could not be greater. As Tiger Woods hooked his tee shot at the first hole way left of the fairway, new world number one Rory McIlroy rolled home a birdie putt on his closing hole to lead the PGA Championship on nine-under-par. Woods, who bravely teed it up in the final major of the season despite a back problem, was eventually finish with a second straight 74 to be five shots outside the halfway cut mark for the weekend. McIlroy, bidding for a hat-trick of victories after winning the British Open and WGC-Bridgestone International, followed his opening 66 with a 67 to set a testing target for the later starters, which nobody was able to match. Jason Day of Australia got closest with a best of the day 65 to trail McIlroy by a stroke and he was joined on eight under by veteran American Jim Furyk. As one of the early starters on the second day, the 25-year-old Northern Irishman had to battle torrential rain, which brought about a near hour delay to play at Valhalla, but carded just a solitary bogey on his card. Starting from the 10th, it came on the 12th to put him back to four-under, but McIlroy rebounded superbly with a birdie at the next and then an eagle on the par-five 18th, rolling home a 30-foot putt. A run of pars came on the first six holes of his back nine before a stunning 242-yard five-wood approach to the par-five seventh had the galleries gasping. McIlroy missed his putt for a second eagle of his round but the tap in birdie took him to eight-under and on his final hole, the ninth, came that final birdie to open up a lead on the field. ""I'm feeling good about my game. I'm confident,"" McIlroy said. ""I didn't hit it quite as well as I did yesterday, but still really in control of my game and my emotions,"" he told the official PGA Tour website. Britain's Lee Westwood and American Kevin Chappell, both leading on six-under after 65s on Thursday, carded respective second rounds of 72 and 74 to drop back into the pack in Kentucky. Woods did save par on the first after his errant tee shot, but left himself with an almost insurmountable task to make the weekend after a three-putt double bogey on the sixth. He appeared to be hampered by his injury, but the 38-year-old did finish with a flourish by birdieing the 18th. Phil Mickelson, who had been paired with Woods, went one better, rolling home a short eagle putt to signal his challenge after a 67 for six-under overall. The 2013 British Open champion has only one top-10 finish all season, but moved to within three shots of leader McIlroy with his late charge.","Rory McIlroy sets halfway pace at PGA Championship .

"Abu Dhabi (CNN) -- For most people working in the United Arab Emirates, the holy month of Ramadan is a restful time. It is a month of fasting, reduced working hours, family time and quiet religious contemplation. But not for Karsten Gottschalk. He's the executive chef at the Armed Forces Officers Club & Hotel in Abu Dhabi, and it's his busiest time of year. Gottschalk's job during Ramadan is to feed at least 20,000 people every day. That means preparing more than 600,000 meals throughout the month. ""It's a lot of food,"" says Gottschalk. First thing he does is ""get my calculator out and start calculating what I need."" During the holy month, followers of the Muslim faith fast by refraining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset. The month of Ramadan starts 10 days earlier every year, based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Ramadan explained . The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque commissions Gottschalk's kitchen to prepare meals for people to break their fast at the mosque. Gottschalk leads a 500-strong team in the kitchen, and cooking starts at 6 a.m. During the working day, 7,000 kilos of vegetables are peeled and diced, 5,000 kilos of rice boiled in vast pots and 10,000 chickens cut in two and roasted. By the end of the month, 800,000 kilos of food will have been prepared in the kitchen. Time matters for Gottschalk. Every slice and dice is done by the clock, until all meals are packaged and date-stamped by 3 p.m. The food is then transported in heated trolleys aboard trucks to the mosque, a short drive away. The meals are given out for free. During the weekend up to 35,000 people join the feast, to which both Muslims and non-Muslims are welcome. Every person receives a box which includes rice topped with half a chicken, a vegetable stew, a portion of salad, an apple, a yoghurt drink, a fruit juice and some water. The meals must be kept warm, distributed and ready to eat the minute the sun goes down, which is marked by a call to prayer. Ramadan acts as 'Super Bowl for adverts' in the Middle East . ""The challenge is that we are doing it over a month,"" says Gottschalk. ""It's not a day or two event. It's consistency over one month of Ramadan."" He adds: ""We have to give our fasting friends a lot of good food. Every day the same standard, the same quality."" The guests sit on the floor across eleven air-conditioned tents outside the mosque to protect against temperatures which can reach up to 45 degrees Celsius during the U.A.E. summer. They then tuck into delicacies prepared over so many hours by Gottschalk's team, continuing a tradition that was begun by the ruling family of the U.A.E. at the mosque nine years ago. Back then, 4,000 meals were given out a day. The numbers are far bigger now -- and Ramadan is unlikely to get any quieter for Gottschalk.","For most people in the United Arab Emirates, the holy month of Ramadan is a restful time .

"(CNN) -- She's just 19 but Hyo Joo Kim is already showing she's ready for the big time after recording the lowest ever round at a major championship. The South Korean star hit an astonishing 61 in the opening round of the Evian Championship on Thursday to break the previous women's record by one-shot and the men's best by two. Kim led Australia's Karrie Webb by four shots going into Friday's action on the course where she finished fourth as an amateur two years ago.

Wie, who only returned to action last week after a month out with a finger injury, suffered a recurrence of the problem.

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has split with his longtime coach Sean Foley after not winning a major during their four-year tenure. The world's most famous golfer has been hindered by injuries recently and cutting ties with Foley adds to his rocky 2014 season. In a statement on his website, the slumping Woods called Foley an ""outstanding"" coach but felt the time was right to part company. Woods, currently nursing a back problem that will keep him out of next month's Ryder Cup, isn't due to compete again until an event in Florida in December and said he wasn't in a rush to appoint a new coach. ""I'd like to thank Sean for his help as my coach and for his friendship,"" Woods said. ""Sean is one of the outstanding coaches in golf today, and I know he will continue to be successful with the players working with him. ""With my next tournament not until my World Challenge event at Isleworth in Orlando, this is the right time to end our professional relationship."" Foley, who coaches 2013 U.S. Open winner Justin Rose and world No. 19 Hunter Mahan -- champion at The Barclays on Sunday -- didn't appear to hold a grudge. ""My time spent with Tiger is one of the highlights of my career so far, and I am appreciative of the many experiences we shared together,"" Foley said. ""It was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all time in our sport. ""I am both grateful for the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another, as well as the enduring friendship we have built. I have nothing but respect and admiration for him.""

"(CNN) -- A $10 million payout is not bad for four days' work. That's the potential prize on offer for one lucky golfer at the East Lake Golf Club course in Atlanta, Georgia in the final leg of the FedEx Cup. After three grueling back-to-back playoff events -- the Barclays, the Deutsche Bank Championship and the BMW Championship -- 125 starters have been whittled down to a select few. Just 29 now remain -- 30th-ranked Dustin Johnson is on a leave of absence -- going into Thursday's Tour Championship, but only one can hit the jackpot. ""Retirement would happen a lot quicker if I win the FedEx Cup,"" Masters champion Bubba Watson told the PGA Tour's official website. Watson is one of just five men -- Chris Kirk, Billy Horschel, Rory McIlroy and Hunter Mahan are the others -- who are in control of their own destiny. That elite quintet have earned their stripes after earning enough points in the earlier stages of the FedEx Cup, as well as over the whole of the 2014 PGA Tour season. Due to the way the competition is structured, victory Sunday for one of the five would secure them the $1.44 million Tour Championship as well as the FedEx Cup, which brings with it that elusive $10 million jackpot, as Henrik Stenson managed to do last year. That victory was made all the more sweeter for the Swede given that he'd reportedly lost several million dollars in Allen Stanford's $7 billion Ponzi scheme, which was uncovered in 2009. A slip-up in Atalanta, meanwhile, will not discount them from golf's biggest prize completely, but they will be relying on their overall points tally for the season to ultimately prove superior to any of their rivals . Earning $3 million for a second-placed finish or $2 million for third would not be the end of the world, either. ""We're trying to challenge ourselves, and this is what we have to play, this is what we have to do if we want to improve on the FedEx Cup or win a golf tournament,"" Watson adds. ""We have to play well."" The rest of the field, however, will be left sweating on the performances of others even if they become the latest name to be inscribed on the Tour Championship trophy. While sixth-ranked Jimmy Walker -- 1,100 points off leader Kirk -- could well come out on top with a win or even a second-place finish, 29th-ranked Gary Woodland -- 2,280 points behind Kirk -- would need something of a minor miracle. Americans Mahan, Kirk and Horschel go into Thursday's opening round with confidence off the back of their respective Barclays, Deutsche Bank Championship and BMW Championship wins. Likewise Rory McIlroy is still basking in his summer of success which brought with it the British Open and U.S. PGA Championship, as well as the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, in the space of four weeks. The world No. 1's best finish in the playoffs was a tie for fifth two weeks ago in Boston. It has been a relentless summer, not just for the Northern Irishman, but for all involved in the world of golf -- 13 weeks have passed since the U.S. Open began on June 12, and in that time three majors, a World Golf Championships event and three of the four FedEx Cup playoffs have all come and gone. Of the field in Atlanta, Patrick Reed has teed up the most often in that period, starting 11 times. This year's Ryder Cup, starting on September 26, has meant the FedEx Cup playoffs have had to take place back-to-back straight after the PGA Championship -- a schedule the U.S. tour's commissioner Tim Finchem admits has been something of a mistake. ""Four in a row doesn't really work,"" Finchem told the PGA Tour's official website. ""So we understand that. We didn't like it this year. We're not going to do it going forward. So that's that."" But Watson, who topped the U.S. Ryder Cup qualification standings, professes to being unconcerned about the lack of a bye week in the playoffs schedule this year. ""It's just something that we have to deal with. Think about it; the money they are putting up, the money we are playing for, the retirement dollars, you make it work,"" he told reporters. ""You'll figure out a way to show up on the tee.""","Twenty-nine competitors will battle it out for the FedEx Cup this week .

"(CNN) -- It would have been unthinkable a matter of months ago, but could Tiger Woods be set to miss out on the 2014 Ryder Cup? The 38-year old failed to make the cut at this weekend's PGA Championship at Valhalla and looked far from content as he struggled with a back injury. Woods cannot now automatically qualify for the bi-annual matchup between Europe and the U.S. which will take place at Gleneagles in September and is relying on a wildcard pick from U.S. captain, Tom Watson, to have any chance of making the roster. ""It was sore. No doubt it was sore,"" Wood's said of the injury when asked by reporters Friday. ""(My body) was telling me on the range it probably wasn't a good idea, but I'm not exactly a nonâ€‘stubborn person."" ""I need to get stronger physically and be back to where I was."" Woods has missed out on much of the 2014 season with a separate back injury and has struggled for form since his return. He only just made the cut at the British Open in July and is currently ranked at No. 69 in the American standings. Only the top nine players automatically qualify for the Ryder Cup team with three captain's picks making up the full squad of 12. Woods won't be eligible for the FedEx Cup playoffs later this month meaning he will likely not play competitive golf before Watson announces his wildcards on September 2. Paul Azinger, who was widely praised for his Ryder Cup captaincy in a five-point win in 2008, said he would not pick Woods for this year's team. ""I don't think I would,"" Azinger told the Golf Channel. ""I don't see how you can take an injured player who is not playing well."" ""And also Tiger has not necessarily been the formula for success either. I just don't see how you can pick him at this point. ""I am guessing he will call Tom and beg out of this and say I am not ready, make Tom's decision easier."" Woods told reporters Friday he had not had any conversations about his participation with Watson. When asked of the 14-time major winner's chances later in the day, Watson said that Woods would only be picked if he is ""free of injury and he is playing well."" The U.S. team has already been weakened by Dustin Johnson's decision to take a break from the sport to seek ""professional help"" to deal with personal challenges. Johnson was ranked fifth in the American standings before his withdrawal and would almost certainly have qualified automatically. There was further worrying news for the U.S. earlier this week as two other likely automatic picks Matt Kuchner and Jason Duffner both withdrew from the PGA event with back and neck injuries respectively. ""We're falling like flies right now, some of the players that are either on the borderline or on the team. That's a concern,"" Watson said. ""(But) there's time for recovery and there's certainly a lot of golf to be played between now and September 2 when I make those three picks,"" he added.","Tiger Woods misses cut at PGA Championship .

"(CNN) -- He has been at his side for all three of Rory McIlroy's major wins, but Sunday's British Open triumph may well have been the sweetest yet for the Northern Irishman's father Gerry. McIlroy's three-stroke victory at Hoylake ensured a wager placed by his dad a decade ago finally came to fruition. While working as a bar steward in Belfast in 2004, McIlroy senior placed a £200 ($340) bet, at odds of 500/1, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes that his 15-year-old son would win the British Open before he turned 26. And on Sunday, in the final edition of the tournament before the bet expired, a 25-year-old Rory rewarded his father's confidence by making him £100,000 ($170,000) richer. The new world No. 2 also cost Ladbrokes a further £80,000 ($136,000) in similar bets placed by Gerry's friends. According to British newspaper The Guardian, they placed £200, at odds of 250/1, that Rory would win the British Open within 10 years. Another £100 ($170) was laid on at 150/1 that he would lift the Claret Jug before turning 50. Rory also secured some cash off the back of a bet placed over the weekend, earning £20 ($34) off Darren Clarke after beating his compatriot during a practice round on Wednesday. He secured his third major -- following the U.S. Open in 2011 and U.S. PGA Championship in 2012 -- with a two-shot victory ahead of Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler. The Northern Irishman is the third player, after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods, to win three majors by the age of 25, while he is just a Masters victory away from completing a career grand slam of golf's top honors. Gerry, a regular at his son's tournaments, is a director of Rory McIlroy Inc -- a company created to run Rory's affairs following his split from the Horizon group. He embraced his son on the 18th green after he landed the 2011 U.S. Open on Father's Day, the first major triumph of his career.","Gerry McIlroy lands £100,000 from a bet after Rory McIlroy wins British Open .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlroy is off to a good start at the Scottish Open. He's hoping for a good finish, too, after missing the cut at the Irish Open. McIlroy shot a course record 7-under-par 64 at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday, and he was actually the second player to better the old mark -- Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg had earlier fired a 65. McIlroy carded eight birdies and one bogey in windy, chilly conditions. ""Going out this morning in these conditions I thought anything in the 60s would be a good score, so to shoot something better than that is pleasing,"" McIlroy was quoted as saying by the European Tour's website. A win Sunday would be the perfect way for former No. 1 McIlroy to prepare for the British Open, which starts next week at Royal Liverpool. He won the last of his two majors in 2012. ""Everything was pretty much on,"" McIlroy said. ""I controlled my ball flight really well, which is the key to me playing well in these conditions and on these courses. ""I've been working the last 10 days on keeping the ball down, hitting easy shots and taking spin off it, and I went out there today and really trusted what I practiced."" Last year Phil Mickelson used the Scottish Open at Castle Stuart as the springboard to his British Open title and his 68 leaves him well within touching distance of McIlroy. Mickelson needs a jolt of confidence given that 'Lefty' has slipped outside the top 10 in the rankings and hasn't finished in the top 10 on the PGA Tour this season. ""I thought it was tough conditions,"" Mickelson said in an audio interview posted on the European Tour's website. ""I was surprised to see some low scores out there because it didn't seem like it was playing easy, and the wind was pretty strong. ""I felt like I played well and had a good putting day. It was a good day."" Last year's U.S. Open champion, Justin Rose, was tied for 13th with a 69 but Jonas Blixt -- who tied for second at the Masters -- was well adrift following a 74.","Rory McIlroy shoots a course record at the Scottish Open with a 64 .

"(CNN) -- When George McNeill went to bed Saturday, he didn't envision the round of his life the next day at The Greenbrier Classic. He had a lot on his mind. But that's exactly what he did at the PGA event, shooting a career-low 61 -- including a hole-in-one on the 8th hole. With the sensational final day of the tournament at White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, McNeill finished second to Angel Cabrera and qualified for golf's next major, The Open Championship later this month in Merseyside, England. A memorable outing for sure. But it's not the full story. The PGA had tweeted Sunday that McNeill was ""dealing with family health issues this week."" That was in reference to his older sister, Michele, 46, who was dying from breast cancer, according to Jason Sobel of the Golf Channel. McNeill had already announced that he had withdrawn from the John Deere Classic, which starts Thursday, to be with his family. Michele died just 20 minutes before McNeill's tee time, and he got the news after he finished his round. Afterward, he emotionally alluded to ""things going on elsewhere"" and got choked up when interviewed by CBS analyst Peter Kostis. ""I know it's really difficult, and I will not press the issue with you, but sometimes perspective comes in different forms, doesn't it?"" Kostis asked. ""It does,"" McNeill answered. ""Yeah, you go out and, you know, golf doesn't really mean a whole lot, so it's hard. I played good today, and I'm glad to finish, and it was a nice middle part of the round.

"(CNN) -- Jeremiah Pauley remembers all too vividly the moment that shrapnel from a roadside bomb in Iraq tore into his body and left his right arm dangling uselessly. Despite being seriously wounded, the Staff Sergeant was still yelling orders to alert others to the danger, but it was already too late and one of his men had died. The shock kicked in. ""There was not a lot of pain, I was drifting in and out of consciousness and someone was tapping me on the forehead to tell me to keep awake,"" he tells CNN. Pauley had been leading an 18-strong patrol of the United States First Armored Division in the city of Tal Afar when he was hit by the blast. ""I was taken to a field hospital in Mosul -- laying there in my hospital bed with this contraption on my arm,"" he recalls. Pauley was presented with his Purple Heart and then shipped out to Germany and eventually home to the U.S. As a result of his injuries, Pauley's army career was over and he was given a medical discharge. 'Helplessness' Coming to terms with that life-changing event was tough enough, but it was the ""survivor's guilt"" that played tricks with his mind and mental state. Private First Class Jody Missildine of Plant City, Florida, just 19 years of age, had died that day, April 8, 2006 and Pauley blamed himself. ""I was just racked with guilt, in the sense that I failed as a leader and take responsibility for what happened."" Pauley was in a bad place. His marriage would eventually break down. ""It's a big challenge for returning veterans to learn how to integrate with their families,"" he admits. Now 38, he has two children, and his youngest -- his daughter -- was born five months after he was injured. ""I battled three or four years of just helplessness, anxiety and depression, until I was introduced to the Wounded Warriors Project,"" Pauley says. Aimed at helping injured service members, and raising awareness in the community, it brought him together with Norbie Lara -- who also joined the army in the mid-1990s and who was also seriously wounded on duty. ""He had such a positive attitude and he really encouraged me to turn my life around,"" Pauley says. Lara's arm had been severed when a rocket-propelled grenade pierced the armor plating of his vehicle. He suffered other life-threatening injuries, and a lacerated liver, spending months in the Walter Read Army Medical Center in Washington where Pauley would be sent two years later. ""I remember I woke up from my coma and essentially thinking this is not really how I want to live,"" Lara tells CNN. ""I didn't want to live, and for the first time in my life I was scared."" The power of golf . Like Pauley, his army days were over and with discharge came the same sense of helplessness and loss. Lara also found support and renewed sense of purpose after being introduced to the Wounded Warrior project. By chance, he was given his first set of golf clubs and the opportunity to have a go at the game, despite his disability. ""I played horribly, but I connected perfectly with just one shot -- just one shot and I was hooked,"" he recalls. ""I've loved the game ever since and used it as a vital tool to aid my recovery."" Pauley had also dabbled with the game before his life-changing incident and, like Lara, has found some inner peace while walking the 18 holes of his local courses in northern California. But like a lot of amateur golfers, he suffers from a common problem. ""I had a terrible slice and now with the injury to my right arm, I still have a slice!"" On Monday, slice or no slice, both will be hoping to take their ""A game"" to a nationwide tournament which has the express purpose of raising money for the Wounded Warriors charity. The World's Largest Golf Outing (WLGO) is the brain child of legendary golfer Billy Casper's organization and its CEO, Peter Hill. This year more than 150 courses in the United States will be used for an event with an expected 15,000 entrants, all playing in teams of four. Unlike conventional tournaments, the prizes are reserved for the participants who raise the most money for the Warriors, not those with the lowest scores. WLGO has raised over $1 million for veterans since starting four years ago, and is rapidly expanding. ""We've hit a chord within the golfing community,"" Hill tells CNN. ""Americans are passionate about assisting these brave individuals."" Finding closure . Pauley will be playing at Lincoln Hills in California, where he will be pressed into speaking duties before the tournament starts. A regular on the dais at veterans' days, he eloquently espouses their cause and the benefits of Wounded Warriors. What happened that fateful day in Iraq changed his life forever, and it was only last year that he was able to exorcise some of the demons and guilt about the death of his colleague PFC Missildine. Missildine's family invited Pauley to visit and pay his respects, something he had been unable to do in 2006 because he was in hospital recovering from his injuries. Pauley recalled in his personal blog the moment he first saw Missildine's grave site, writing: ""I was cold, nearly shivering. I stood and saluted him while tears rolled down my face. ""My first thought was that I wished I was in the ground instead of him ... But at that instant I was overcome with a hot burning sensation and I realized Jody wouldn't want me to think like that ... ""I promised him that it wouldn't be another seven years before I came back. I stood and saluted him one final time and walked away."" Lara, who works full-time for Wounded Warriors, will perform similar speaking duties at 1757 Golf Club in Dulles, Virginia before showing off his golfing skills. ""I usually break a hundred. I've found my own technique,"" he says. ""The furthest I've ever hit a drive is 280 yards, I normally strike it out about 230."" Breaking down barriers . Lara is thankful for his every moment after his near brush with death, and always thankful to Wounded Warriors from rescuing him from the depths of despair. The project was formed in 2003 to give support to wounded U.S. service personnel since the events of September 11, 2001. Nearly 40,000 veterans and their families have benefited from its various programs and fundraising efforts. The WLGO's association has proved the perfect fit, and Hill believes golf is also benefiting from opening up its courses to people who might not normally be attracted to the sport. Competitors pay a standard green fee and $10 donation to Wounded Warriors to play prestigious courses and to get a taste for the game. ""It's broken down the some of the barriers to people who want to play golf, particularly women, who are worried about too many rules and too much protocol,"" Hill says. He has big ambitions for the concept and is even considering an expansion outside of the United States. ""I see no reason why we could not play on thousands of courses, on a Monday each year in August, with hundreds of thousand of golfers coming to support their heroes and to raise millions of dollars in a day."" Having already presented a check for $735,000 in January, Hill hopes this year's fundraising will break through the $1 million mark. ""It's a great way to raise money and awareness for the Warriors, "" Lara says. He plays most weekends, sometimes with other veterans, enjoying the solitude and the chance to talk, share experiences. ""You can't have a bad day on a golf course,"" says the 41-year-old. ""Being a Warrior you want to compete whatever the event, still up for the challenge.""","World's Largest Golf Outing held at 150-plus courses in the United States .

"(CNN) -- Mo Martin produced the performance of her life to secure her first major title with victory at the Women's British Open at Royal Birkdale Sunday. The 31-year-old secured top spot with a stunning eagle on the final hole to finish one shot clear of Norway's Suzann Pettersen and China's Shanshan Feng. Ranked 99th in the world, Martin, from California, was not expected to challenge at the top of the leaderboard. But a second shot at the 472-yard 18th landed just six feet away from the pin -- allowing Martin to putt for glory and secure a famous triumph. ""Is this real life?"" Martin asked in her post-match interview following her victory. ""It was a tough day of golf today. It was very windy and this course is very challenging. ""So I stayed patient and I fortunately played some really good golf today. ""From the first time I saw Royal Birkdale, I fell in love with it. I think the layout is absolutely phenomenal."" Inbee Park, who had led overnight, slumped to a disappointing fourth place finish. Meanwhile Justin Rose warmed up for this week's British Open by winning the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen. The Briton's final round six-under-par 65 gave him victory by two shots, which will move him up to world No. 3. Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg's 14-under par secured him the runner-up spot and a place in the British Open at Hoylake, while Scotland's Marc Warren was third.","Mo Martin wins the Women's British Open at Royal Birkdale .

"(CNN) -- After winning the BMW PGA Championship in England in late May, Rory McIlroy missed the cut at his next European event, the Irish Open, last month. The Scottish Open is mirroring the former No. 1's inconsistent season. McIlroy produced a superb, course-record 64 in chilly, windy conditions at Royal Aberdeen on Thursday -- it included a staggering 430-yard drive -- but then imploded Friday, registering a 7-over-par 78. He is six shots behind leaders Kristoffer Broberg, Marc Warren and Ricardo Gonzalez. It was one of the biggest turnarounds you're bound to see -- but in keeping with his second-round woes. At 13 stroke-play events this season, he has failed to hit under 70 in the second round nine times and his average stands at 72.2, noted the Golf Channel. ""I'd be much happier standing here after a couple of 71s, but that's not the case,'' McIlroy told reporters. ""It hasn't been the case all year. ""I get off to a good start and then I just fall away. But I'm still in the tournament and I can go out in the morning and try and get a few of those shots back that I lost today. ""I need to try and hold it together somewhat. McIlroy's front nine, though not good, wasn't terrible. He mixed three bogeys with one birdie. But on the back nine he didn't hit a birdie and struck a double bogey and three bogeys. From being in an outstanding position Thursday, he wasn't far off missing another cut. It's not the round he would have wanted with the British Open taking place next week. ""It's another Friday out of the way,"" McIlroy said. ""Now I can go onto the weekend."" Phil Mickelson, the other marquee name at the event, dipped, too. Last year's Scottish and British Open winner was five shots worse in the second round, carding a 73. ""I'm a little concerned that it's taking up a little more energy than I would like for next week, but it's also a good opportunity to focus on some of the difficult shots that we'll have next week, so it kind of goes both ways,"" Mickelson said in a TV interview shown by Sky. Mickelson is five shots off the pace. Wie misses cut . It won't be two majors in a row for Michelle Wie. Wie, the much hyped American, missed the cut at the women's British Open at Royal Birkdale in Southport, England less than a month after claiming her first major, the U.S. Open. The 24-year-old followed up her 75 Thursday with a 78 Friday, undone by six birdies and a double bogey. ""I missed a lot of greens,"" Wie, who turned pro aged 15, told reporters. ""I had a lot of hard par putts today, and I didn't make them. I didn't do much on any of the holes. It didn't go quite as well as I wanted it to."" Another American, Mo Martin, leads at the halfway stage by three shots over Spain's Beatriz Recari. Overnight leader Ayako Uehara crashed to a 79 and trails Martin by nine shots.","After his course record 64 Thursday, Rory McIlroy slumps at the Scottish Open .

"(CNN) -- Few places on earth do pride better than Merseyside; pride in the region, pride in its people, and pride in its sport. So when The British Open comes to town it feels like everyone is here to celebrate. After record crowds made the pilgrimage to this corner of the Wirral Peninsula in 2006 to watch Hoylake's first major for 39 years, it was stamped as ""The People's Open."" It's a tag that has stuck. ""You don't want to be lofty here because people will knock you off your perch,"" Royal Liverpool's 2006 captain Andy Cross told CNN of Merseyside. ""You must be who you are and not try to be someone else. ""If there is one thing we want the people who visit us to take away with them it is that they felt they were welcome."" Liverpool's most famous exports The Beatles once sang ""money can't buy me love"" and that certainly isn't an issue at Hoylake -- there's plenty going round for free. Some golf courses can feel stuffy to the point of asphyxiation, but not this one. Not only are spectators pitching up in droves, their enthusiasm is off the charts. Exchanges between marshals and spectators have the jovial air of two mates chatting down the pub. True Tiger Woods complained about fans' use of mobile phones during his first round, but perhaps that could be attributed to thousands of people's enthusiasm to see the man who took the title eight years ago. Even the stony-faced Royal Navy marshals tracking various groups round the course can manage a smile in between admonishing the odd spectator for trying to grab a snap of a star on their phone. Such is the passion for sport in this region that 5,000 hardy souls turned up four days out from the start of The Open, just to watch a clutch of players practice. Bumper galleries . When the Wirral welcomed back golf's oldest major championship for the first time since 1967 eight years ago, 230,000 attended across the four days -- an English record. Just 142,036 were present at Muirfield in Scotland last year, an undoubtedly beautiful golf course but one that elicits a different pitch to Hoylake. Ahead of the Royal and Ancient's September vote on whether to admit female members for the first time, Muirfield is one of only three clubs on The Open rotation to remain male only. That heralded a wave of negative press this time last year. Hoylake, however, isn't having to withstand anything like that. You only need look at 2014's patrons to notice the difference. Walking around the links you are just as likely to encounter the red of Liverpool or the blue of Everton -- the city's two English Premier League soccer teams -- as heavily branded golfing apparel. At 22 this is Mark Budd's third Open championship but his first visit to Hoylake. ""It's such a friendly and welcoming atmosphere here, people can't do enough for you,"" he said. ""Some places can be a bit snooty but there's none of that here."" Pete Squires is one of those locals helping to make visitors feel welcome. ""It's important for us not to just give a good account golf wise, but also as a region,"" the 45-year-old said. ""There an immense sense of pride at having The Open here and that's reflected in the attitude. No one here acts better than anyone else and that's exactly the way it should be."" Home favorite . Merseyside loves nothing better than one of its own, especially someone with a story to tell like John Singleton. The resin factory worker thought his pro career had vanished due to injury but after giving it another crack he qualified for The Open at a course just a stone's throw from his home. During his first round he often diverted towards the gallery to high five one of a small army of friends and family who have come to support him at his first major tournament. Even the 30-year-old's fiancÃ©e Lucy Johnson walked all 18 holes with him despite being eight months pregnant. ""I can't tell you how much I've felt at home already,"" Singleton told CNN before teeing off Thursday. ""It's so close to home. I've got so many friends and family here, you walk on the tee and everyone is cheering. I've been having a good laugh with people and that takes all the nerves away. ""They are so happy I'm here playing it just takes the pressure off you. It's a great feeling to have."" Tough times . Perhaps there is an extra helping of pride because the past has seen bouts of severe hardship. A toxic social and economic climate in the early 1980s saw pitched battles between the public and police. The riots prompted a leading minister in the ruling Conservative government of the time to suggest that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abandon Liverpool to a destiny of ""managed decline."" Instead she dispatched Michael Heseltine northwards, a Tory grandee who would become known as the ""Minister of Merseyside"", and he helped trigger a wave of regeneration that would help transform the city's landscape. ""The Scousers (as people from Liverpool are known) don't actually look at people's background, they look at what they do, so Heseltine is a hero around here,"" explained Cross. ""After the 1981 riots, Heseltine brought businessman round in buses to show them what could be done. He set in store all the good things that have happened to Liverpool. ""When he was given the freedom of the city two years ago politicians from all sides were queuing up to pay homage to him and that indicates the public here look at what people do, not necessarily what they say."" Woods' two-shot win in 2006 also resonated deeply on Merseyside. It was Hoylake's first British Open for 39 years and a lot graft had gone into making this, the second oldest golf course in England, fit to stage it. A glorious return . While infrastructure and space had always been an issue, heritage wasn't. Built in 1869, this was the setting for the first ever Amateur Championship in 1885 and the first ever international match -- between England and Scotland -- in 1902. It hosted one leg of the most feted feat in golf â€” Bobby Jones' ""impregnable quadrilateral"" in 1930 when he clinched all four major titles on offer in the same season. And it was the scene for Roberto Di Vicenzo's only major win in 1967, the first by an Argentinean. Then came those years in the wilderness. By the time Woods and his peers rolled up to Liverpool eight years ago the entire city was fit to burst. Golf's oldest major didn't disappoint, and neither did the weather. While ticketing, stewarding and layout were planned in meticulous detail the skies above were the one thing the club couldn't control. It has always been a factor in these parts. The old saying goes 'If you can't see the Welsh coast across the peninsula it's raining. If you can, then it's about to."" But that week the unfamiliar bedfellows ""heatwave"" and ""Liverpool"" knitted together divinely. Ever browner, scorched earth offered such firm terrain that 14-time major champion Woods used his driver just once all week, preferring instead to shape his irons round Hoylake's contours. As captain that year it was Cross' responsibility to hand the fabled Claret Jug to Tiger, the third he has claimed in an illustrious roll call of victories. ""It was a fairytale Open for us,"" Cross explained. ""A return after 39 years, the event was watched by record crowds under beating sunshine. ""We had the world's greatest golfer at that time -- unarguably -- win the oldest and most revered major championship in golf on our own territory. You can't get more fairytale than that."" ""The other wonderful thing I remember about it was the great sense of community spirit. The Open, while it has its global impact and interest, is actually a great community tournament. ""There's about 10,000 people working here this year in one sense or another, many of them volunteers simply doing it for the love not the money.""","The last time The Open Championship came to Hoylake it was dubbed 'The People's Open""

"(CNN) -- Forty years ago this week golf legend Gary Player scored one of his most memorable victories at the British Open and now he is willing Tiger Woods to do the same in the 2104 edition at Hoylake as the American battles back from injury and loss of form. South African Player was the last player to lead outright for all four rounds of the oldest major when he won at Royal Lytham and St Anne's in 1974, adding to an earlier triumph at that year's Masters at Augusta. ""Woods is definitely the most talented man who ever held a golf club in his hand,"" Player told CNN. But the former world number one has been troubled by injury this season and has only played once since March -- sidelined for the Masters and the U.S. Open -- and missing the cut at Congressional in his comeback event. Player believes golf is the poorer for Woods not being at the top of the leaderboard. ""We need this icon. He improves ratings and brings in more media attention to golf,"" said the 78-year-old South African. ""And back home in South Africa a lot of young black players are aspiring to be a champion like him."" Player, who won nine majors and 165 tournaments in an incredible career spanning over 50 years, does however acknowledge that Woods is at a crossroads in his career. The 38-year-old American has not triumphed in one of golf's big four events since his remarkable 2008 U.S. Open win -- his 14th major -- before a combination of damaging revelations in his private life and injuries sent his fortunes into decline. ""He has got a challenge on his hand and it would not be a surprise if he never wins another major,"" admited Player. ""But if he does, he could go on to win quite a few more because he has what I call 'it.'"" That 'it' the South African legend believes is reserved for the true superstars of golf: ""In my humble opinion you have to win six majors to be classed as a superstar,"" added Player. Ahead of the Open's start Thursday, Player also thinks that Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy has that quality and can build on his two majors -- perhaps with victory at the Lancashire seaside links. ""Rory is a wonderful player, an unbelievable talent,"" said Player, who is also an admirer of current world No. 1 Adam Scott of Australia and fellow South Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel, saying the latter has the ""most fantastic golf swing."" But for a dedicated and driven man such as Player there is no substitute for sheer hard work. ""Talent is one think, to apply it another."" He gives the example of American golfer Tom Weiskopf, who made golf look easy, but had to give best to players like himself and Nicklaus and perhaps never quite fulfilled his talent, with just a British Open win at Royal Troon in 1973 in the majors. This time 40 years ago Player came into the British Open having already won the U.S. Masters for the second time. ""I can remember it like yesterday,"" said the South African. ""I was one shot ahead of Weiskopf and Dave Stockton playing the last and hit a nine-iron, tossed the club to my caddy and knew I was going to make a birdie."" That left him two shots clear of the chasing pair at Augusta, which he won for the third and final time in 1978. Player then went on to win at Royal Lytham by four shots from England's Peter Oosterhuis, but only after surviving a near lost ball on the penultimate hole of the final round and then famously having to play a left handed shot after his approach shot to the 18th rested against the clubhouse wall. It was held to be the archetypal example of Player's tenacity and shot saving skills around the green, which was one of the keys to his prolonged success as a professional.","Tiger Woods plays his major of season in British Open at Hoylake .

"(CNN) -- In the world of golf, the next generation of stars just keeps on getting younger. Ever since Judy Rankin blazed a trail by entering the 1959 U.S. Women's Open at the age of 14, the sport has been a playground for many a young pretender. Lucy Li was the latest child prodigy to rewrite the record books in May when she became the youngest player to ever qualify for the U.S. Women's Open, aged just 11, although she failed to make the cut at last month's event. The men's game is in similar rude health. Guan Tianlang became the youngest player to make the cut in a major championship following his appearance as a 14-year-old at the 2013 Masters, while Jordan Spieth nearly became the youngest player to win that tournament in April at the age of 20. ""We are encountering them more often. They are exceptionally mature guys for their age,"" former teen prodigy Matteo Manassero told CNN of the young players coming through the ranks. ""They are extremely powerful guys that can perform extremely well. They have the confidence and the freedom of being young to perform against their idols."" Manassero, now a seasoned tour pro at the age of just 21, speaks from experience. The Italian was the most successful teenager in European Tour history and remains the youngest player to win one of its events. At the age of 17 years and 188 days -- before he had even learned how to drive a car -- he triumphed at the 2010 Castello Masters, and has since backed that up with three more European Tour wins, including the flagship BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in 2013. Before Tianlang, Manassero was the youngest player to make the cut at the Masters, aged 16 in 2010 -- his 36th-place finish at Augusta ranked as the best performance by a European amateur for 73 years. ""I can certainly speak for Tianglang and he was extremely mature,"" Manassero said. ""You can just see the way he was at Augusta. Aged 14 and he knew what he wanted to do, he knew where he wanted to hit it, he knew how far ... at 14 that's certainly exceptional."" Lexi Thompson, Ye Wocheng, Andy Zhang, Ryo Ishikawa and Lydia Ko are just a few of golf's child prodigies. Each of the quintet made their own piece of history while still on the amateur circuit -- something Manassero views as essential in the process of fast-tracking youngsters to global golfing fame. ""I think amateur golf is one important key aspect of this and I am sure that young guys 15 years ago, they were totally able even at 17 to play with the pros, but they just probably didn't really know that they could,"" he says. After becoming the youngest winner of the British Amateur Championship in 2009, Manassero went on to place 13th at that year's British Open Championship, earning himself the Silver Medal for the leading non-pro in the process. ""Amateur golf, from my point of view, made me believe that I could compete at any level because it was really, really competitive,"" he says. ""You know, we were winning tournaments and seeing golf courses in which they also played European tournaments. ""The standard is really, really high, it is very competitive. I was playing all over Europe, I was playing in America too when I was 15, 16 as an amateur, so it was really almost like being a professional. The only difference was school."" Manassero turned professional in May 2010 -- two weeks after his 17th birthday -- to become the second youngest member in European Tour history after Seve Ballesteros. He had to wait just five months before his first win on the tour, and he credits the likes of Rory McIlroy, who also made a successful transition upon turning professional, with helping him to that maiden triumph in Spain. ""You get a lot of confidence from playing with great players, with tough opponents. Once I turned pro and I started doing well, I saw Rory a little before me, a few years before me,"" he says. ""It inspires you and gives you confidence and makes you think that you can do it too. Professional golf is really tough, but once you're in it you can do it even if you are young."" In golfing terms, Manassero is still a baby with a long career lying ahead of him. And despite his recent frustrations, including a 118th-place finish in his PGA Championship title defense -- won by McIlroy in May -- his enthusiasm for the sport remains the same as when he was teeing up at Augusta for the first time with the eyes of the world upon him. ""It's not been a fantastic period lately but I am still enjoying it, the days that I go out and shoot a big score, I am having a lot of fun,"" Manassero says. ""In general, when I am at a tournament that is the place I want to be. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Until I'm going to feel different, it's going to be fine, it's going to be great.""","Matteo Manassero is encouraged by the number of young golfers coming through .

"(CNN) -- With the British Open just around the corner, Justin Rose is hitting form at exactly the right time. The world No. 8 beat unheralded American Shawn Stefani in a playoff to clinch the Quicken Loans National and win his first title since lifting the U.S. Open in June 2013. Rose will now head into a major on home soil as one of the favorites, boosted by the first playoff win of his PGA Tour career. ""It's a huge boost confidence-wise, yeah, for sure, because I've been semi-in contention this year,"" Rose told the PGA Tour's website after carding a one-under par final round of 70 on Sunday. The 33-year-old led by one heading down the last having reeled in overnight leader Patrick Reed, but a wayward drive led to Rose finding the water on the 18th as he let world No. 246 Stefani back in. Despite losing the playoff on the first extra hole, Stefani can take solace in the knowledge that he has booked his place at the British Open, which starts at Hoylake on July 17. The last time golf's oldest major was at Hoylake was in 2006, when Tiger Woods lifted the Claret Jug while Rose was enduring a miserable run of form which saw him fail to qualify for seven consecutive majors. ""I just remember (the course) being burnt out, really warm, people eating ice cream and Tiger winning,"" joked Rose. With the year's third major on the horizon, Rose was pleased to have come through such a thorough examination at Congressional, host of the 2011 U.S. Open won by Rory McIlroy. ""I like this type of test,"" he said. ""This week you're going to miss greens; you're going to be challenged; you're going to have to grind and you're going to have to do everything at some point this week, and that's the type of golf I like, that tests all your skill sets. ""That's normally what major championships do.""","Justin Rose beats Shawn Stefani to win the Quicken Loans National .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is back -- but it was a bit of a struggle after three months on the sidelines . Woods, who had back surgery to repair a pinched nerve in March, carded a three-over-par 74 in Thursday's opening round of the Quicken Loans National at the Congressional Country Club. Only seven times since turning professional in 1996 has the American golf star opened a PGA Tour event with a worse score. The 38-year-old is attempting to rebuild his game ahead of the third major of the season -- next month's British Open -- after missing the Masters in April and this month's U.S. Open. ""I think the hard part was just getting into the rhythm of playing competitively,"" Woods told reporters. ""You play with your buddies all day for cash and stuff but it's just not the same. It's not the same as tournament golf, different level. Adrenaline is rushing and I hit the ball further out here than I do at home. ""It unfortunately took a while to get the feel for it. My feels were off."" The last of Woods' 14 major titles came at the 2008 U.S. Open, leaving him four behind Jack Nicklaus' overall record. The former world No. 1, now ranked fifth, has now missed six major championships through injury -- his absence at Augusta was the first time he'd not been at the Masters since making his debut there as an amateur in 1995. However, he said his back felt fine in his first round since the World Golf Championships event in Florida in March. ""I had no issues at all,"" he said. ""No twinges, no nothing. It felt fantastic."" Woods has won the British Open three times, and the last of those came in 2006 at the host course of this year's tournament -- Royal Liverpool Golf Club at Hoylake, where the action will tee off on July 17. He bogeyed his first two holes at Congressional and dropped to last place in the field on six over par before three birdies in five holes gave his scorecard a healthier look, though he was eight shots behind first-round leader Greg Chalmers of Australia. ""I made so many little mistakes,"" Woods said. ""So I played a lot better than the score indicated, which is good."" U.S. Open runner-up Erik Compton was tied for fourth in a group including Patrick Reed -- who won the WGC-Cadillac Championship where Woods last lined up.","After three-month layoff, Tiger Woods returns to action .
