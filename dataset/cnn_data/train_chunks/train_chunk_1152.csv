"A newly-wed couple face being separated for the arrival of their first child because of new visa rules that have come into force. Marianne Bailey, 35, may have to give birth on her own because her Japanese husband, Kei Yamamoto, 30, may have to leave the country because they are having troubles getting a spousal visa. The couple married in Chelsea in October last year after meeting while she was working in Japan. Ms Bailey, a product designer from Wandsworth, south London, earns well above the the £18,600 threshold required by law, rents out two properties and has two jobs. Facing difficulties: Marianne Bailey is considering becoming an Irish citizen to enable her husband to stay here . But a bureaucratic loophole means only the rental income is considered valid by the Home Office and a letter from the UK Border Agency said there was 'no flexibility' on the financial criteria. They were shocked to hear Mr Yamamoto could be forced to leave a month before their child is due in July, according to the Evening Standard. 'I’m faced with having my first child on my own because my husband might get kicked out the country,' Mrs Bailey-Yamamoto said. 'I feel like the Government are trying to force me out because I married a foreigner.' Last July, the Home Office instituted new rules forcing British citizens to meet certain financial criteria before they can get a visa for their foreign spouses. Ms Bailey-Yamamoto was advised by five visa specialists to drop her battle, saying she had no chance of complying with the rules because she is self-employed and does not have significant savings. However, she earns money by working as a university lecturer and design consultant, renting out her properties and drawing funds from a pension pot. Mr Yamamoto is currently unable to work in the UK because he does not have a visa. 'I’ve been told citizens of other EU countries do not have to meet any financial requirements at all,' Mrs Bailey-Yamamoto told the Standard. 'They . don’t have to pay the £800 visa fee like we do, they don’t even need a . job and they can come here freely and marry whoever they want. Whereas . I’m a successful entrepreneur trying to support British industry and . I’ve worked really hard in my twenties to get where I am.' She is even considering taking up Irish citizenship to get around the rules - but although her grandmother is Irish, she has only been to the country once. Another option is for Mrs Bailey-Yamamoto to sell off one of her properties to boost her savings, but it would then take another six months for her husband's visa to be granted, which means he would not be by her side when she gives birth. A Home Office spokesman said: . 'European nationals are able to bring family members to the UK. However, . European nationals do not have unrestricted access to the UK, they must . be exercising their treaty rights by working, studying or being . self-sufficient.' Craig Colville and his wife, Crystal, were told that she could not stay in the UK because he was not a British citizen despite the fact he is Welsh . Partners of British citizens who wish to apply to remain in the country on the basis of their relationship must meet an array of criteria set out by the UK Border Agency. They must prove that they and their other half are both over 18, that their relationship is 'genuine and subsisting', that any marriage or civil partnership is valid under UK law, and that they intend to live with their partner permanently in the UK. UKBA also requires proof that would-be British citizens have met their partner in person, that the couple in question are not related in any way that would prevent them marrying under UK law, and that any previous relationship has permanently broken down. Finally the applicant must show that they meet UKBA's list of 'suitability requirements', along with its English language requirement, and - crucially for Crystal Colville - its financial requirement. This states that any non-national hoping to remain in the country on the grounds that their partner is a British citizen must have an income of at least £18,600. If the applicant has a child that is not a citizen or settled in the country that they wish to live with them in the country, the minimum income goes up to £22,400. Each additional child requires an additional income of £2,400. The UKBA states on its website that applicants can meet the financial requirement from the employment or self-employment of their sponsor, as well as through their own employment. Cash savings are also taken into account when applications are being considered, along with any benefits or pension payments the applicant or their sponsor receive in the UK. Last week a Welsh photographer was told he could not bring his Canadian wife into the UK because he was not a British citizen. Craig Colville was born in St Asaph in North Wales to British parents but the UK Border Agency has denied his new wife Crystal Levy permission to stay in the country, claiming that he 'does not hold settled status'. Mr Colville, who even has a twin brother whose citizenship has never been disputed, is now facing leaving Britain over the blunder. Officials admitted that the bizarre claim was a 'clerical error', but insisted that Mr Colville’s new wife would have to leave the country in any case because she does not make enough money to stay. New rules governing the applications of the partners of British citizens came in on July 8 2012. Would-be British citizens who applied before that date were required to prove that they and their sponsor had adequate means to support themselves without relying on state handouts, but no specific minimum income level was set.","Baby is due in July but Kei Yamamoto may have to leave UK in June .

"Rating: . Well-to-do folk from the North used to meet their accountants and financial advisers here. A quick dash to London before the fiscal year ended; tea and biscuits, sign a few documents and then back on the train well before rush-hour. Many years later, the whole King’s Cross area hit the buffers, taking the Great Northern Hotel with it. But now it’s back, albeit in an unrecognisable form. And it appears to be thriving. A phoenix from the flames: The Great Northern Hotel has undergone significant refurbishment . I have trouble finding the entrance. Once inside, the reception is absurdly poky - a corridor with a desk in it. There is no sense of occasion fetching up here. The cheapest rooms are called couchette,s and come in around the £200 mark, without breakfast. That’s a lot of money for a tiny space where you can enter the rock-hard bed from only one side, because it’s rammed against the window and sandwiched between two walls. In fact, the bathroom is about the same size as the bedroom. ‘An evocation of the classic continental railway sleeper,’ is how the hotel’s website describes it. Cramped, in other words. When checking in, I had asked whether the window could open and the receptionist didn’t have a clue but said a colleague would let me know. It never happened. I’ve booked a table in the restaurant - called Plum + Spilt Milk - but they are all full, so I agree to have a drink in the slinky bar (dark-green walls and proper art) as long as I can order from there. But no one comes near me. Eventually, a table opens up. It’s a buzzy dining room and the staff rush around trying to keep everyone happy. Wonderfully fresh dressed crab, with a big Barnsley lamb chop to follow keeps me very happy indeed. There’s something to be said for a smart restaurant attached to a major train station. It gives you a sense of going somewhere, even though you might be taking the bus to Hackney Marshes afterwards. Getting back to my couchette overlooking the glass roof of the concourse isn’t thrilling, but the ‘in-room entertainment package’ sounds exciting, with 72 films on offer for no extra charge. The dining room is especially inviting at breakfast, with its sash windows, comfy banquettes and wooden floors. And I like that one of the healthy options is a spelt bun, poached egg and spinach. There is a traffic jam at reception, with a queue of people waiting to pay. One man gets cross and says he’s about to miss his train. Then some Japanese tourists arrive with an entourage of suitcases. This would never have happened in the lobby of the old Great Northern Hotel.

"The Queen will today grant a posthumous pardon for wartime codebreaker Alan Turing, who was convicted in the 1950s for homosexual activity. The pardon is only the fourth since the Second World War to be granted under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. It was requested by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, who described Turing as a national hero who fell foul of the law because of his sexuality. Scroll down for video . Pardoned: Almost 60 years after he killed himself with cyanide, gay Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing will be given a Royal pardon for the conviction which destroyed his life. Homosexual acts were only legalised in 1967 . Mathematical genius: Mr Turing was seen as the father of modern computing and artifical intelligence . A life destroyed: Alan Turing with friends in his youth. He was 41 when he poisoned himself with cyanide . Ordinary house, extraordinary deeds: Hut 8 Naval Inteligence, where Alan Turing worked to crack German codes at Bletchley Park, Milton Keynes. There has been a long-running campaign to clear his name . Codebreaker: The machine designed by Alan Turing which cracked the German Enigma code, thereby stripping the German U-boats which were blockading Britain of their cover during the Second World War . Icon: The codebreaker was previously honoured with a statue in Manchester's gay village, left, and a cover of the gay magazine Attitude, right. Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said all those convicted should be pardoned . During the Second World War, the mathematician was pivotal in cracking the German Enigma codes, which gave Allied leaders vital information about the movement and intentions of Hitler’s forces. Historians credit the work of Turing and his fellow codebreakers at Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire with shortening the war by up to two years, saving countless lives. Turing is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. But in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity, which was illegal at the time. To avoid prison, Turing agreed to ‘chemical castration’ – hormonal treatment designed to reduce libido. In 1954, aged 41, he died of cyanide poisoning. An inquest recorded a verdict of suicide, although his mother and others maintained that his death was accidental. As well as physical and emotional damage, his conviction had led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for GCHQ, the successor to the Government Code and Cypher School, based at Bletchley Park. Speaking today, Baroness Trumpington - who worked with Turing at Bletchley Park - praised her former colleague, saying we could have lost the war had it not been for his work. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I really am very pleased [about the pardon].We knew the work he was doing at Bletchley Park was great. 'Without him, we could have lost the war. Our submarines were being sunk at the rate of knots. 'We could have lost the war through starvation. That's how bad it was.' Legendary: Mr Turing's story was dramatised several times, including in the 1986 play Breaking the Code, which played at London's Theatre Royal. Alan Turing, right, was played by Sir Derek Jacobi . Drama: Turing will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in the forthcoming drama The Imitation Game, which also features Kiera Knightley. The pair were spotted filming in London's King's Cross station in October . More recently Turing was depicted by Ed Stoppard in the Channel 4 drama Britain's Greatest Codebreaker . Rare: There have only been three Royal pardons since the end of the Second World War . Turing is being granted a pardon after . a long campaign to rehabilitate his reputation. Pardons are usually . given when someone has been found to be innocent after the event, but . government sources said Turing was being pardoned because he was ‘a . truly exceptional man who saved Britain’. That . means the decision to pardon Turing will not lead to pardons for the . other 50,000 men convicted of similar homosexual offences. Mr Grayling told the Mail: ‘In a list of Britain’s war heroes, the names of people like Churchill, Montgomery, Barnes Wallis, stand proud. Alan Turing’s name should sit with them. And yet after the war, far from being feted as a hero, he finished his life in disgrace. He was hauled before the courts and humiliated. His crime was that he was gay. ‘I have always regarded it as one of the great blights on our country’s history that a man who did so much for all of us should have been treated in such a terrible way. ‘And I am proud that the Queen has agreed to my request that he should be granted a full posthumous pardon, and that his memory should now have no stain upon it. ‘Alan Turing is one of the key reasons why Britain remained a free country. It is right that we should remember and celebrate his memory free from the taint of injustice.’ The campaign to pardon Turing was backed by MPs from all parties and by scientists such as the physicist Stephen Hawking. An  e-petition calling for a pardon received 37,404 signatures. In 2009 the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology for his treatment but did not secure a pardon. Yesterday Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘Alan Turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country. ‘His action saved countless lives. He also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements, often being referred to as the father of modern computing.’ Tory MP Iain Stewart, who represents Milton Keynes South, home of Bletchley Park, said he was ‘over the moon that justice has prevailed’. Rare: Only three people have received Royal pardons since 1945: Timothy Evans, executed for the murder of his wife in 1950; Derek Bentley, hanged despite being 'feeble-minded'; and Michael Shields, right . Derek Bentley's grave, left, proclaimed that he was a 'victim of British justice'. Timothy Evans was only pardoned after it emerged serial killer John Christie, right, had murdered his wife. By then he had been hanged . He said: ‘Alan Turing made a huge impact on the world he lived in and left a legacy for the world of today and tomorrow. This royal pardon is a just reward for a man who was stripped of his honour, his work, and the loyalty he showed his nation.’ But gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: ‘Singling out Turing just because he is famous is wrong. ‘An apology and pardon is due to another 50,000-plus men who were also convicted of consenting, victimless homosexual relationships during the 20th century.’ On 8 June 1954, Turing's cleaner found him dead. A post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June. Several scholars, and even his family, have suggested Turing's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy. When his body was discovered, an apple laid half-eaten next to his bed. It was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does. Some more peculiar theories suggest Turing was 'obsessed' with fairytale Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story. The theory was supported in an article in The Guardian written by Turing's friend, the author Alan Garner, in 2011. However, later evidence suggested that Turing habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten. His mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental, cause by her son's storage of chemicals in his home. Speaking on the 100th anniversary of Alan Turing's birth on 23rd June 2012, Professor of Philosophy Jack Copeland, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand, questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954. He said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death. He added that Turing's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself. He pointer out that his friend Robin Gandy stayed with Turing a week before his death and he remarked how happy Turing seemed . Finally, the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that Turing could even have been murdered. Although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him Mr Copeland said his work at Bletchly Park was under strict secrecy until well after his death.","Alan Turing led the way in cracking the Enigma codes at Bletchley Park .

"Samantha Harris today choked back tears as she described how the jailing of her fiancé for causing death by dangerous driving had left her shattered. The 23-year-old model was in an emotional state as she attended a beauty launch for Priceline Pharmacy at Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens just two days after Luke Hunt was sent to prison for four years. Ms Harris, who was in the car at the time of the accident, struggled to discuss the tragedy which left 78-year-old Kenneth Lay dead. Scroll down for video . Struggling to cope: Model Samantha Harris at an event at Sydney's Botanic Gardens just two days after her fiance was jailed for four years . Luke Hunt, 28, had been driving 35 km/h over the speed limit when he ran a red light in Narweena, NSW . ‘It’s been a very tough few days and I really can’t talk about it,’ Ms Harris swallowed. ‘It’s just been really tough.’ ‘She’s still really upset, she just can’t talk about it,’ said her publicist. The model, a Priceline and David Jones ambassador, was more forthcoming about the bullying she experienced growing up, revealing she never felt like she fit in because of her height and her big lips. ‘It’s quite hard for young girls when they stand out and look different and that was me,’ she said. ‘I had big lips when I was little and obviously still do and that was one of the things I didn’t know how to feel about because none of my friends had lips like me and that made me self-conscious and nervous. Glum: The 23-year-old looked downbeat as she attended the event in the Sydney sunshine . Ms Harris did not attend court for the sentencing of her fiance. Hunt defended her lack of appearance, saying she was avoiding the attention of media: 'She is very upset, she can't handle it nowadays,' he said . ‘Kids are kids, some kids aren’t very nice. You get the occasional remark which is hurtful but now that I look back, I think I’ve done quite well with these so-called big lips.’ Ms Harris had not attended court on Wednesday when Hunt, a 28-year-old builder from Queensland, was sentenced after he pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. When asked by the judge why Harris had not been present at his sentencing, The Daily Telegraph reported that Hunt answered: 'She is very upset, she can’t handle it nowadays.' The incident occurred two years ago when Hunt was on his way to the gym in Narweena in Sydney's northern beaches. He had been trying to change lanes at high speed when his Commodore collided into Mr Lay's Hyundai Lantra at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St, Narraweena. Hunt's car then slammed into a tree. Judge Colin Charteris heard Hunt had been doing 95km/h in a 60km/h zone, Mr Lay, a father of seven and grandfather of 16, died in hospital. The 23-year-old still find is too difficult to discuss the event which saw the death of 78-year-old grandfather Kenneth Lay two years ago . The model, who posed alongside X Factor winner Dami Im and Home And Away's Ada Nicodemou, also spoke out about being the victim of bullying, saying she was picked on for her height and lips . Sentencing at Downing Centre District Court, he said: 'There has been no real account from Hunt to explain why he was driving in such a hurry at the time of the accident. It's completely inexcusable.' However, the judge accepted Hunt's remorse and acknowledged the 28-year-old tradesman now suffers from depression. 'He wishes he had passed away in the accident ... but his regret cannot remedy what has occurred,' Mr Charteris said. Harris seems to be trying to move on from the traumatic event, continuing with her work with little mention of her beau . Harris did not seem her perky self at the event which attempted to set a Guinness World Record for the longest selfie chain . Hunt was also heard sobbing an apology to Mr Lay's family, adding: 'I have been in a dark place for a long time.' Hunt has also been disqualified from driving for six-and-a-half years and will be eligible for parole in 2016. Outside court, Mr Lay's daughter Christine Scott said there were no winners. 'We're not cruel people, and I hate to see somebody go to jail like that, but you can't do what he did,' she told AAP. Hunt and Ms Harris, who shot to national fame in a modelling competition held by Girlfriend magazine when she was 14, met in a shopping centre on the Gold Coast when the model was 17. They have been engaged for four years. In prison: Luke Hunt, the model's fiance was sentenced to four years in jail after being convicted of dangerous driving - he never gave an explanation as to why he was speeding, and now suffers from depression after causing the death of pensioner Kenneth Lay . The collision took place at the intersection of Warringah Rd and Alfred St in Narweena, in Sydney's northern suburbs. Mr Lay was taken to hospital where he later died from injuries sustained in the crash .","Luke Hunt, 28, crashed into Kenneth Lay, 78, two years ago .

"With around third of Americans admitting to believing in aliens, and more exoplanets being discovered that could harbour life, it is no longer unusual to believe in the existence of ET. Now an astronomer has claimed that a person's belief in extraterrestrial life varies according to whether they also believe in a God and even specifically which religion they identify with. In the new book he reveals that atheists are the most likely group of people to believe in extra-terrestrials, at 55 per cent, followed by Muslims. Scroll down for video . A new book (pictured left) by astronomy professor David Weintraub (pictured right) reveals that Atheists are the most likely group of people to believe in extra-terrestrials, followed by Muslims and Jews . It summarises what religious leaders and theologians from over 24 major religions say about alien life, including Judaism, Roman Catholicism, the Church of England, Hinduism and Buddhism. Astronomy professor David Weintraub, of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, said: ‘When I did a library search, I found only half a dozen books and they were all written about the question of extraterrestrial life and Christianity, and mostly about Roman Catholicism, so I decided to take a broader look.’ ‘Very few among us have spent much time thinking hard about what actual knowledge about extraterrestrial life, whether viruses or single-celled creatures or bipeds piloting intergalactic spaceships, might mean for our personal beliefs [and] our relationships with the divine.’ His book, Religious and Extraterrestrial Life, includes the results of a poll that found 55 per cent of Atheists believe aliens exist, while 44 per cent of Muslims and 37 per cent of Jews think that life is out there in the universe. Around 36 per cent of Hindus and 32 per cent of Christians believe in aliens as well as divine beings. Of the Christians, the Eastern Orthodox faithful were the most likely to believe in aliens (41 per cent) while Baptists were the most sceptical at 29 per cent. Catholic leaders have been debating about the possibility of life on other worlds for a thousand years.The crux of the debate is whether intelligent aliens would suffer from original sin, because they are not descended from Adam and Eve (illustrated) and if they do, did Christ visit them and was he resurrected on other planets? Professor Weintraub thinks that Asian religions would have the least difficulty in accepting the discovery of extraterrestrial life, because Hindu thinkers have speculated that humans may be reincarnated as aliens, and vice versa, while Buddhist cosmology includes thousands of inhabited worlds. He found passages in the Qur’an that appear to support the idea that spiritual beings exist on other planets, but notes that these beings may not practice Islam as it is practiced on Earth. However, Professor Weintraub found very little in Judaic scriptures or rabbinical writings hinting at the existence of aliens. The few Talmudic and Kabbalistic commentaries on the subject do assert that space is infinite and contains a potentially infinite number of worlds and that nothing can deny the existence of extraterrestrial life. He says that Jews don’t believe the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have much effect on them, quoting a Jewish anthropologist and scholar who concluded that the relationship between Jews and God would not be affected in the slightest by ‘the existence of other life forms, newly discovered scientific realities or pan-human behavioural changes.’ If the rate of discovery keeps up its current pace, astronomers will have identified more than a million exoplanets by the year 2045 and some of them may harbour alien life (a 'traditional' representation of an alien is pictured) leading more religious leaders to question the impact extraterrestrials may have on their beliefs . Professor Weintraub said that Roman Catholics have given the possibility of extraterrestrial life the most thought among Christian religions. Catholic leaders have been having an on-off debate about the possibility of life on other worlds for a thousand years, he said. The crux of the debate is whether intelligent aliens would suffer from original sin, because they are not descended from Adam and Eve, and if they do, did Christ visit them and was he resurrected on other planets? ‘From a Roman Catholic perspective, if sentient extraterrestrials exist some but perhaps not all such species may suffer original sin and will require redemption,’ according to Professor Weintraub. The debate may increasingly come to the fore, because astronomers are detecting exoplanets - some of which could harbour life - at a rate faster than ever before. In 2000, astronomers had detected 50 planets orbiting other stars, while today that number has grown to more than 1,000. Professor Weintraub believes Asian religions would have the least difficulty in accepting the discovery of extraterrestrial life, because Hindu thinkers have speculated that humans may be reincarnated as aliens, while Buddhist cosmology includes thousands of inhabited worlds.  A praying Buddhist monk is pictured . If the rate of discovery keeps up its current pace, astronomers will have identified more than a million exoplanets by the year 2045. While there are many conflicting views in the Protestant faith, he said that Lutheran theologian Paul Tillich’s view are probably largely representative – that the ‘saving power’ of God must be everywhere. However, God’s plan for human life may not be the same as his plan for aliens. Professor Weintraub thinks that Evangelical and fundamental Christians may struggle the most to accept any discovery of alien life, because most of their leaders assert that extraterrestrial life does not exist. However, Mormonism and Seventh-day Adventism are two Christian faiths that embrace aliens. In Mormonism, God helps exalt lesser souls so they can achieve immortality and live as gods on other worlds.","Astronomer David Weintraub at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee has written a book discussing which faiths are likely to embrace aliens .

"A second high school has cancelled its football season after rookie players were allegedly forced to sexually assault each other in humiliating initiation rites, according to officials. The final two football games at Central Bucks High School West, Philadelphia, were cancelled after it emerged that players engaged in pre-season hazing at the school. Superintendent David Weitzel said rookies were required to grab another player's genitals while fully clothed, an initiation that was carried out in front of most team members. This comes just weeks after criminal charges were initiated  against seven players at Sayreville War Memorial High School, New Jersey, over allegations that a freshman was penetrated. Rookie football players were allegedly required to grab another player's genitals while fully clothed, during an initiation at Central Bucks High School West, Philadelphia . In a letter to the school district community, he said: 'Our inquiry determined that students new to the team were expected to participate in several initiations that were both humiliating and inappropriate. 'I want to be clear that these activities did not result in physical harm, but were not harmless.' James Donnelly, chief of the Central Bucks Regional Police Department, said he had been notified about allegations of 'waterboarding' at the school. Principal Jason Bucher alerted police that young players had been placed under the shower with towels over their heads, but Donnelly said it was not 'waterboarding' as he understood it. Waterboarding is a form of torture, in which water is poured over a cloth covering the face and breathing passages of a captive to create a sensation of drowning. 'The letter was pretty damning and contains some pretty scary information,' said Donnelly. 'We don't know if it was just kids horsing around or if it was more serious, but we're going to investigate.' The high school  has cancelled its football season after rookie players were allegedly forced to sexually assault each other in humiliating initiation rites . All varsity and junior varsity coaches at Central Bucks High School West have been suspended pending further investigation, according to Superintendent Weitzel . This comes weeks after the football season at Sayreville War Memorial High School in neighbouring New Jersey ended over a hazing investigation. Five coaches were suspended at that school and criminal charges are pending against seven players. Older team members were said to have held down the younger players on the team in the locker room, anally penetrating them with their fingers and then sticking those fingers in their mouths. All varsity and junior varsity coaches at Central Bucks have been suspended pending further investigation, said Superintendent Weitzel. Police said they would investigate whether any of the activity was criminal and whether staff failed to properly supervise team activities. Players on the Sayreville football team attend a Board of Education meeting to support their team coaches . Five coaches were suspended at Sayreville War Memorial High School and  criminal charges are pending against seven players . For years West had one of the most successful football programs in the country, including a run of four state titles in the 1990s, when it regularly appeared in USA Today's national Top 10 rankings. Its alumni include Cleveland Browns head coach Mike Pettine Jr. and two of his assistants. The school's most famous dropout is Alecia Moore, better known as the singer Pink. Weitzel said hazing allegations were first reported to the district on October 14. He said the majority of players were in violation 'through their offensive and disrespectful actions in what were supposed to be pre-season, team-building activities.' Players who did not participate, but witnessed the activities and failed to report them, also violated the student code, he said. The district code of student conduct has banned hazing and similar activities for the past decade, and Weitzel apologised to those players who were 'subjected to the demeaning actions of fellow players who should have served as role models.'","Rookie players were allegedly forced to grab another player's genitals .

"The NRL will consider a plan that would see brave Forster teen Curtis Landers deliver the ball to halfway on Grand Final day. Landers, 14, is in intensive care at Royal North Shore hospital after a 24 May horror tackle, that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae, left him paralysed. A huge groundswell of support from Landers' local community and the top echelons of Australian media has played out in the days since and thousands of dollars have been raised for the teen's future so far. Daily improvement: Curtis shown here recovering in Royal North Shore hospital . 'Ideally we want to get a block of land, put a house on it, and put it in Curtis' name,' said Warren Blissett, a coach of the rising young star. 'It's the good spirit of country folk.' The Forster Tuncurry Hawks are staging an auction on 31 July in the hope of raising tens of thousands of dollars for their embattled young star. Ray Hadley - who visited Curtis in hospital - has already signed on to host the event. Mr Blissett said Curtis is now able to talk and his mischievous spirit is starting to return. Champ: Curtis is a talented rugby league player who recently took part in a Canberra Raiders camp for country recruits . All round support: The Great Lakes College rugby league team showed their '#RiseForCurtis' wristbands on Facebook . 'He's bossing his dad around, telling him to do this, do that,' Mr Blissett joked. 'That's brought a real smile to (his father's) face. He can see improvement.' Yesterday it was revealed that Curtis had met with NRL hero Alex McKinnon in hospital after a photo of the pair in wheelchairs was posted to the Curtis Landers: Road To Recovery Facebook page. The Knights forward is also in Royal North Shore undergoing treatment for fractured c4 and c5 vertebrae he suffered in a devastating tackle on 24 March. Touching meeting: Knights star Alex McKinnon, also being treated for fractured vertebrae at Royal North Shore hospital, dropped in on Curtis' room to lend some support and advice for the road ahead . Curtis and McKinnon spent hours talking and swapping support and advice. While the fourteen-year-old's father Kevin is 'still feeling raw emotion' and enjoying alone time with his son, Mr Blissett heaped praise on the talented rugby league player who is improving by the day. 'Now that he can communicate, it's a huge lift in his spirits,' said an emotional Mr Blissett. 'He's got quality, he's able to speak...He's so well mannered. He's one of those boys where if you had to have another son you'd be happy to have him.' Cheeky: Since being able to talk again, Curtis has been 'bossing his dad around' and smiling for the camera . Curtis, a 'Canterbury Bulldogs nut', recently played in the Canberra Raiders country recruit camp, where he was coached by rugby league legend Ricky Stuart. An NRL spokeswoman told MailOnline the idea to have Curtis deliver the ball to the middle of the ANZ turf has been submitted to senior events staff and One Community - the NRL's charitable and community relations branch - and that it will be considered. She said the plan was dependent on Curtis' recovery and any grand final day commitments already in place between the NRL, corporate sponsors and other community organisations.

"Witnesses to a tragic motocross crash that left a 14-year-old New Zealand boy dead have said the layout of his last fateful jump was too dangerous. Popular Tauranga teenager Trent Haywood died after coming off his bike on a 30m jump in the Michael Godfrey MX Memorial in Omihi on Sunday, the New Zealand Herald reported. Police were unable to confirm what caused the the incident, but witnesses told the newspaper the size and shape of the jump made it unsafe. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Trent Haywood, 14, died on Sunday after coming off a 30m jump during a motocross event in New Zealand . World at his feet: Trent was posthumously crowned the winner of the event thanks to points he had already accrued . Around 100 people - including Trent's father - witnessed the tragedy. Tributes began inundating the Tauranga Boys' College student's Facebook page, with friends and family expressing their disbelief that the talented young rider had been snatched away from them so soon. 'I had the pleasure of knowing and training Trent. He trained like a Demon, and loved every second of what he did. He had a heart of gold and will be sorely missed,' wrote his former coach. 'I have never met a kid who was so happy, constantly smiling and thankful for everything. It was a privileged to have been able to train him, and see how he improved. He went out on a win, well done.' Friend Mitchell Bond wrote: 'I can't believe this has happened bro! This is so not fair, gone way to early (sic).' In yet another tragic twist, Trent was named champion of the event - which was cancelled following his death - thanks to points he had already accrued on the day. A family friend of the Haywoods told the New Zealand Herald the young rider died doing what he loved. 'He has been riding since he was just a little guy, about 4 or 5,' he said. 'And he is just awesome, he loves it, motocross is his absolute passion. 'He has had a lot of success regionally and was starting to enjoy the rewards of hard work. Talented: Trent in action doing what he loved. Friends said he died engaged in an activity he was passionate about . 'This is just tragic. He was far too young but I can't help thinking he was doing what he loved and that is a lesson for all of us in life. Spend your time doing something you are passionate about.' Police said his death was the first in the event's 35 year history.","Trent Haywood, 14, died after coming off his bike during motocross event .

"Wrestling to rip-off those fiendishly sticky paper airline luggage tags after every flight could soon become a thing of the past. British Airways is trialling personalised reusable electronic bag tags this month that do away with the need for a new paper version for each flight. Each time you fly, the electronic barcode on the tag changes - giving the latest up-to-date personal information, destination and . flight details. British Airways is trialling reusable electronic bag tags, pictured, that do away with the need for a new sticky label each time you fly. The electronic barcode on the tag changes for each journey to show a passenger's latest flight details . A passenger checks in to a flight using the official British Airways smartphone app. The app is then held over the electronic bag tag and the flight details, destination and personal details of the passenger are sent wirelessly using NFC technology. NFC stands for near-field communication and can transfer data from one device to another simply by touching the devices together. A written summary is also shown so passengers can check everything is correct. The electronic screens 'fix' the image . onto the tag for the duration of the trip – allowing it to be scanned . electronically when going through luggage handling at departure, onto . the plane, and through to the luggage collection carousel in the . arrivals. The details stay on the tag until the customer checks onto a new flight. The battery turns off once the image is 'fixed' so it can be used on long haul flights. The tag lasts around five years. The tags can be used by passengers who have their booking details sent to their smartphone using the official British Airways app. Each tag carries a special computer chip and has two small screens on each side. At check-in, passengers can hold the smartphone carrying their booking details over the tag. The phone then transmits these details wirelessly to the tag, which displays them on the screens in the form of a barcode. A written summary is also shown so passengers can check everything is correct. The electronic screens 'fix' the image on the tag for the duration of the trip, allowing it to be scanned electronically when going through luggage handling at departure, onto the plane, and through to the luggage collection carousel in the arrivals. The details stay on the tag until the customer checks onto a new flight. The barcode is then changed and updated for that new service. BA said the tags can be used 'time and time again' with a different barcode generated for each new flight. The tag's battery switches off once the image is ‘fixed’ and BA said a tag will last around five years. A BA spokesman said: 'Once checked in, customers just need to hold their smartphone over the electronic tag, which automatically updates with a unique barcode containing their flight details and an easy-to-see view of their bag’s destination.' At check-in, passengers can hold the smartphone carrying their booking details over the tag. The phone then transmits these details wirelessly to the tag, which displays them on the screens in the form of a barcode. A written summary is also shown so passengers can check everything is correct . Dispensing with the requirement for a traditional paper tag to be printed and attached for every flight will be quicker and more efficient says BA: 'It means customers save precious time by having their electronic tag quickly scanned at the bag drop, going straight through security to relax before catching their flight.’ British Airways’ managing director for customers Frank van der Post said: 'This is a fantastically simple, yet smart device that gives each customer the choice to have their own personalised electronic baggage tag that changes with the swipe of a smartphone – every time they fly. The electronic tags have been specially developed by British Airways in partnership with Densitron Displays and Windsor-based Designworks. Heathrow Airport is providing help with the trials last this month . 'As the saying goes, 'good things come in small packages', and this innovative device is no exception. 'Along with other initiatives we are investing in, we believe it has the potential to revolutionise the way our customers check in and pass through every airport around the world in the future.’ Development of the personalised electronic bag tag is part of wider plans to improve the flow of customers through the airport, making it quicker, smoother and easier. BA has also held major trials on self-service bag drops, automated boarding gates, porter services, auto check-in, and 'meet and greet' hosts. The electronic tags have been specially developed by British Airways in partnership with Densitron Displays and Designworks Windsor. Heathrow Airport is providing help with the trials that are sent to take place later this month. BA said that over the next five years it is investing more than £5billion in new aircraft, smarter cabins, elegant lounges, and new technologies to make life 'more comfortable in the air and on the ground.' Earlier this week BA took delivery of its first new Airbus A380 'superjumbo.' Glenn Morgan, British Airways’ head of service said: 'Our customers are at the heart of everything we do and our drive to innovate with this new electronic bag tag is a brilliant example of how we can help transform their travelling experience.' He added: 'We've harnessed expertise from across the airline to produce a solution for speedier checking-in, which at one swipe shows British Airways can be a game changer when it comes to customer service.' British Airways took delivery of the new double-decker 'superjumbo' Airbus A380 this week. The airline's bosses say the plane will herald 'a new era' for the nation's flagship airline . British Airways' first Airbus A380 superjumbo is shown next to a sister Airbus A320 after arriving on its delivery flight earlier this week. The new plane cost £270million .","Electronic tags connect wirelessly with British Airways smartphone app .

"A Browning machine gun found in a downed Spitfire has been fired for the first time in 70 years. The weapon worked despite being buried in peat since the aeroplane that housed it plummeted to earth in Donegal in 1941. A . team from the BBC went to the site and dug the guns from where the . Spitfire had crashed and could even smell aviation fuel in the air. Six Browning machine guns were found in good nick thanks to the ideal clay, soil and peat condition . Despite being buried for the last 70 years, the Browning machine gun worked perfectly . There were six guns that presenter . Dan Snow reported were in 'great shape, with belts containing hundreds . of gleaming .303 rounds.' They even found pilot Roland 'Bud' Wolfe's leather helmet among the wreckage. The guns were cleaned and a couple of pieces were straightened out after suffering some damage on impact. The . soil, clay and peat had provided the perfect conditions for the . artefacts to be preserved and, when fired, they worked like a treat. Mr Snow continued: 'The gun fired . without a hitch. There can be no greater testament to the machinists and . engineers in UK factories in the 1940s who, despite churning out guns . at the rate of thousands per month, made each one of such high quality . that they could survive a plane crash and 70 years underground and still . fire like the day they were made.' Excavation work at the site on the moors above Donegal uncovered the wreckage of the Spitfire - much of it was still intact . Hundreds of bullets were found with the Browning machine gun . When Wolfe crashed his British . Spitfire into a peat bog in Ireland during World War Two, few thought it . would ever be seen again. The pilot who bailed out immediately wanted to climb into the cockpit of another military aircraft and continue fighting for the allies. Knowing . that his fighter was doomed, the young RAF officer had radioed: 'I'm . going over the side' before parachuting to safety moments before impact. Historian Dan Snow led the project to dig the Spitfire out of the peat bog almost 70 years after the pilot bailed out of the doomed plane . But instead of fighting again the . serviceman was interned in a camp - where captured UK and U.S. troops . mixed freely with the German enemy. Despite . managing to escape from Ireland, neutral during the war, and making his . way back to Britain, the 23-year-old was sent back to the camp. Fearing . a diplomatic row, the British Government returned Wolfe to the most . relaxed of 'prison' camps in Ireland where he was kept for a further two . years. The pilot from . Nebraska had been stripped of his U.S. citizenship after agreeing to . fight for the British because the Americans had not yet joined the war. Now . almost 70 years after the pilot from the 133 'Eagle' Squadron . crash-landed in the north of Ireland in November 1941, his crashed plane . has been recovered. The . Spitfire was the first of 20 made with a donation from a Canadian . millionaire called Willard Garfield Weston who wanted to support the . Allies in the Battle of Britain with a £100,000 donation. Remarkably large parts of the plane have been recovered from the bog. Six . machine guns and about 1,000 rounds of ammunition were also discovered . by archaeologists searching the Inishowen Peninsula in Co Donegal. American Spitfire pilot Roland 'Bud' Wolfe lost his U.S. citizenship in 1941 when he signed up to fight for the RAF . The excavation was carried out as part of a BBC Northern Ireland programme. Historian . Dan Snow said: 'The plane itself is obviously kind of wreckage and the . big pieces survived. We're expecting to find things like the engine and . there still may be personal effects in the cockpit. Wolfe pictured here at the internment camp where he was held . 'It's . just incredible because it's just so wet here that the ground just . sucked it up and the plane was able to burrow into it and it's been . preserved. 'It's in amazing condition,' he told RTE radio. Mr Snow said Mr Wolf was forced to . abandon his Spitfire over the Republic when its engine overheated about . 13 miles from his base at RAF Eglinton, now Derry International Airport, . in Northern Ireland. Aviation archeologist Simon Parry . told the Irish Independent that it was highly significant that the . doomed plane had been recovered. 'The . pilot was lucky to survive that day because if his engine had failed a . few minutes earlier he would have ended up in the sea,' he said. Landing on neutral soil, the 23-year-old pilot was interned at Curragh detention camp in Co Kildare for two years. With . fishing trips, fox hunts and football matches it sounded almost like a . holiday camp - and seemingly the ideal place to be holed up as war raged . across the rest of Europe. The guards were only issued with blank rounds, visitors were permitted and there were frequent excursions to nearby pubs. Around 40 RAF pilots who crashed in Ireland were held in the corrugated iron huts alongside the German enemy. The crew of destroyed U-boats and Luftwaffe planes also ended up at the camp. A team of Irish recruits at the Curragh Camp, just outside Dublin, where Wolfe was held for two years during World War Two . The . warring nations even played football matches against each other - with . the Germans defeating the largely English team 8-3, in a precursor to . their repeated post-war footballing triumphs over their North Atlantic . enemy. Spitfires fly over Britain - the recovered fighter had been remarkably well preserved by the bog . But although servicemen were free to come and go from the camp Wolfe, who died in 1994, was determined to fight on. In December 1941, just two weeks . after his crash, the serviceman made his way into Dublin before hopping . onto a train to Belfast which was British territory. As his doomed plane came down he parachuted out before watching it plunge into the ground half a mile away. Although . he made his way back to RAF Eglinton, he was returned to the Irish camp . where he spent a further two years before it was closed. Belatedly . he got his wish, and in 1943 he was allowed to return to frontline . action as the tide of the war turned in the Allies direction. It is only because of the unusually soft ground that the crashed Spitfire could be recovered in the 70th year after the crash. The . Irish Defence Forces said the six Browning .303 machine guns and . approximately 1,000 rounds of ammunition were discovered by a team of . archaeologists from Queens University buried up to 30 feet in the bog. 'The . six machine guns and ammunition have been removed by the bomb disposal . team to a secure military location where they will be decommissioned and . cleaned before being handed over to the Derry Museum,' a spokesman . added. The plane will now be preserved and go on display at the Tower Museum in Derry.","Recovered Spitfire 'one of the first ever made'

"Do you struggle to climb the stairs or walk up a hill? Now there’s a website that will show if you really are old beyond your years – by calculating your true fitness age. By putting in simple measurements such as how much exercise you do, your waist measurement and resting heart rate, the website calculates how well your body delivers oxygen to the cells – a measurement called VO2 max. By stating how much exercise you do, your waist measurement and resting heart rate, the website calculates how well your body delivers oxygen to the cells – a measurement called VO2 max. The left picture shows the calculation for a sedentary, moderately overweight 40-year-old woman. The right picture shows the result using Bradley Wiggins' vital statistics . The results can be somewhat terrifying - . a sedentary, moderately overweight 40-year-old woman could have a . fitness age of 54, for example. Researchers at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology found that putting just five measurements - waist circumference; resting heart rate; frequency and intensity of exercise; age; and sex - into an programme helped them predict a person’s VO2 max quite accurately. Fitness age is basically how well the body functions physically – compared to how well it should work – given the person’s age. It is also a strong indication of lifespan, and, while not perfect, is a ‘rough estimate of cardiorespiratory fitness’, the researchers wrote in their paper, published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. If you are super fit, it can take years off your life. Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins is said to have a resting heart rate of 35. When the rest of his details are plugged in, he gets a fitness age of 'younger than 20' And a young fitness age is 'the single best predictor of current and future health', the lead study author, Ulrik Wisloff, told The New York Times. He and his team of researchers got 5,000 people aged between 20 and 90 to run on a treadmill to the point of exhaustion. Fitness age is a key predictor of lifespan . Various measurements were taken from them - and these were used to build a picture of what’s normal at certain ages. Obviously, the nearer the fitness age is to your age, the better. If you get a fitness age of 40, for example, then you have the 'typical, desirable' fitness of a 40-year-old, he says. Or, 'A 70-year-old man or woman who has the peak oxygen uptake of a 20-year-old has a fitness age of 20,' says Professor Wisloff. So how do you calculate your fitness age? The two main things you need are your waist circumference in centimetres and your resting heart rate. This can be calculated by taking your pulse for 30 seconds and then doubling it. Add in your age, gender, intensity and frequency of exercise and the calculator will generate your fitness age. The results can provide a stern wake-up call. A 40-year old woman with the average UK woman’s waist circumference of 34inches (86cm) who rarely exercises and has a resting heart rate of 80bpm (the average resting heart rate is between 60 and 80 beats per minute) has a fitness age of 54. On the other hand, if you are super fit, it can take years off your life. Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins is said to have a resting heart rate of 35 – and when the rest of his details are plugged in, he is given a fitness age of ‘younger than 20’.

"Academic Theodora Dallas, 34, had told other jurors what her research had revealed about a defendant . A juror who caused a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant’s past on the internet was jailed for six months yesterday. Lecturer Theodora Dallas, 34, turned to the web while trying a man for grievous bodily harm. She discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at Luton Crown Court. Dallas shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of Barry Medlock, 64, a violent drinker, was halted. Dallas was charged with contempt of court after the case was referred to the Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC, who said prosecution for contempt ‘sent out an important message’. Greek-born Dallas claimed she had not understood internet searches were banned as ‘sometimes my grasp of English is not that good’. But her excuse – as well as pleas by her counsel Charles Parry for a suspended sentence – was rejected by three senior judges who said her actions undermined the system of trial by jury. She will serve three months and be on licence for the remainder of the term. The Lord Chief Justice, Igor Judge sitting with Lady Justice Hallett and Mr Justice Openshaw said Dallas had ‘deliberately disobeyed’ the trial judge’s instructions not to search the internet. Sentencing Dallas, Lord Judge said she was guilty of ‘contempt of the jury and the jury system’. He stressed jurors could not ‘pick and choose which principles governing trial by jury they would obey’. ‘In the long run, any system which allows itself to be treated with contempt faces extinction,’ he said. ‘That is a possibility we cannot countenance.’ Collapse: Defendant Barry Medlock was on trial accused of grievous bodily harm. He faced a re-trial and was jailed . At the time of her jury service, Dallas was lecturing at the University of Bedfordshire in Luton after obtaining a doctorate of philosophy in health psychology. Her long-term academic career is now in jeopardy. Mr Grieve, who prosecuted the case, later told Radio 4:  ‘If a juror goes off and carries out research and obtains information that has never been put before the jury about the defendant then that is perfectly capable of influencing that juror. ‘Nobody in court will have had the ability to deal with that information, explain it, challenge it or do anything about it. It is central to the fairness of our trial process that only what is heard in court should determine the jury’s verdict.’ In June 2011, a 40-year-old woman was . given an eight-month jail term after becoming the first juror to be . prosecuted for contempt of court for using the internet. Joanne Fraill, 40, admitted using . Facebook to exchange messages with Jamie Sewart, 34, a defendant already . acquitted in an ongoing multimillion-pound drug trial in Manchester in . 2010. Fraill, from Blackley, Manchester, . also admitted conducting an internet search into Sewart’s boyfriend, . Gary Knox, a co-defendant, while the jury was deliberating. She was jailed after a hearing at the High Court in London before a panel of judges which included Lord Judge. He added: ‘I take no pleasure in bringing such cases but they send an important message.’ In a statement read to the court, Dallas, whose cousin Elena Votsi designed the 2004 Athens Olympics medal, said she had been checking the meaning of grievous bodily harm on the internet. She had typed the word ‘Luton’ into a search engine and found a newspaper article which mentioned Medlock and the previous rape allegation. Dallas said in a written witness statement given to judges that ‘sometimes my grasp of English is not that good’. ‘I did not understand that I could make no search on the internet,’ she said. ‘I had no intention at all to prejudice the jury in any way. I had no intention to disobey what the judge said. I really apologise. I never thought it would cause such disruption.’ The court heard that Dallas’s actions resulted in a waste of court time and public money and caused ‘obvious’ damage to the administration of justice. Medlock was later jailed for 11 years after a retrial.","Theodora Dallas researched defendant and told other jurors her findings .

"The bubble might not have burst but it's shrunk slightly. Home prices across the five major Australian capital cities dropped nearly two per cent in May, the biggest decline in five years. The softening will come as a welcome relief to home buyers, with a bullish market swelling property prices by 10.87 per cent over the last year. In another good sign for home buyers, the RBA announced on Tuesday that the interest rate would remain at a record low 2.5 per cent. Downhill: The Australian property market has begun a 'gradual easing' with a 1.9 per cent drop recorded in May, the first decline of the year . Figures released by property market research firm RP Data show the average home price across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth dipped 1.9 per cent last month, the first drop in the market all year. Melbourne experienced the biggest declines, dropping 3.59 per cent. Perth boasted the healthiest market of the major capitals - dropping just 0.83 per cent. Around Australia, only the Darwin and Canberra markets managed to grow - swelling 1.05 and 0.08 per cent respectively. CommSec chief economist Craig James told MailOnline the dip was a correction in the market following 'unrealistic' and 'unsustainable' price rises over the past 12 months. 'The housing market isn't booming and neither is it slumping,' he said. 'What we've had is super strong demand and not enough supply and we're seeing a gradual softening of prices as more houses are built and there is more choice' James said trepidation about the federal budget, an unusual smattering of public holidays in April and natural seasonal market forces were to blame for the decline in property prices. 'All the lead up to the budget was negative rather than positive and if you weren't in a particular rush, especially if you were an investor, you'd hold off,' James said. 'The fact this was a new government, their first budget and a possibly harsh budget made people sit back and wait.' Bubble swelling: This graph shows the quarterly percentage change in residential property prices across the Australian capitals. It represents sustained growth for well over a year . Good news for some: The property figures will please home buyers but owners would prefer the rises to continue . He said the fact that the Easter and Anzac Day long weekends were next to each other in April likely encouraged a number of transactions to be brought forward to March, which led to a 2.3 per cent growth nationally. The news isn't all bad for people looking to sell, with a new luxury apartment complex in Sydney's Bondi Junction offloading 129 units in the space of four hours on Saturday.","May recorded the first dip in home prices of 2014 .

"He came within an inch of death in November when a 114kg tiger used him as a teething toy. And just months after the terrifying ordeal that nearly cost Dave Styles his life, the experienced big cat handler has made the brave decision to to step back into the cage. Styles has returned to work at Beerwah's Australia Zoo, set up by Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin's father Bob in 1970, where staff say he is thrilled to be back amongst the animals. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: The moment Charlie the tiger launched at Australia Zoo big cat keeper Dave Styles in November. The mauling nearly killed him but Styles has returned to work . 'He's back at work, he's happy, he's going great,' said an Australia Zoo spokeswoman. He has been back working for 'some months' and is back in the 'exact same role'. In a piece for the zoo's publication Crikey Magazine, Styles wrote that despite the terrifying experience, he still loved his huge stripey felines. 'The day that Charlie bit me, he became a little overexcited during his toy session and played a little too rough,' Styles wrote. Catastrophic: Styles suffered puncture wounds to his neck and shoulders in the attack . Friendly hug: Experts say Charlie wasn't being vicious but 'overly excited' 'Charlie wasn’t intending to injure me and as soon as we had left the enclosure, he was calm and ­interacting with other handlers. Mr Styles also thanked well wishers for their support and hoped tiger conservation would remain a priority among animal lovers. I’d like to acknowledge all of the support and well wishes I received globally while I was in recovery,' he said. 'This went a long way to keep me motivated and assisted in my speedy recovery. That's more like it: Styles has worked with big cats for more than nine years and said he hoped Charlie wasn't euthanised following the mauling . Seriously ill: Styles was flown to hospital with severe injuries . 'Although this situation was an unfortunate incident, my hope is that it doesn’t distract from how these ­tigers are ambassadors to raise awareness towards conserving their wild cousins.' The 30-year-old was dragged into the water and bitten on the neck by Charlie - a Sumatran-Bengal tiger - when he became 'over excited' during a feeding session. Mr Styles had raised the big cat from a cub and was flown to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital following the attack, where he was initially 'seriously ill'. Frenzy: Dozens of horrified zoo visitors watched on as Charlie dragged the trainer into the water . The attack was witnessed by dozens of zoo visitors and captured by news crews who were filming at the time. Shortly after the attack, Mr Styles said he did not want Charlie to be euthanised. In a statement to MailOnline, the zoo confirmed Charlie avoided that fate and that he had been reunited with his human friend. 'Dave is doing well and he’s back at work with Australia Zoo’s tigers including Charlie. We’re all moving forward and focusing on doing what we love, which is tiger & wildlife conservation,' the statement read.

"We all have them somewhere on our phones or cameras – mildly embarrassing snaps that show us relaxing on holiday, perhaps wearing an outfit we wouldn’t be seen in at home. Few of us, though, dress as pirates, sailors and even sharks while on a foreign break. Scroll down for video . He's getting his (four) sealegs: Crusoe poses as a ship's captain on his recent Caribbean holiday . But then, few of us are dogs whose owner likes to squeeze them into a range of strange and unusual costumes. Meet Crusoe, a dachshund who has just returned from the Caribbean – complete with a holiday photo album that has to be seen to be believed. Never mind the skull, give me the crossbones: Crusoe also dressed up as a pirate . Jaws with paws: One quick change into a rubber ring with a fin, and Crusoe is a canine shark . Canadian animal lover Ryan Beauchesne, 26, recently took his beloved pet on a luxury island-hopping tour of the Exuma archipelago, in the Bahamas. While sailing through crystal-clear waters and playing on beaches of bright white sand, Crusoe dressed up as a ship's captain to steer the boat, a pirate while digging on the beach and a shark while swimming in the sea. Thirsty work: After the latest of his many costume changes, Crusoe pauses for a well-earned beer . Well this is a rum do: Even a canine pirate needs to pause for a cocktail when the day is done . Crusoe has a large following on the internet thanks to Mr Beauchesne's blog (www.celebritydachshund.com), where the four-year-old hound can be seen in a variety of amusing guises. Mr Beauchesne said: ‘I've always wanted to take Crusoe on a luxury holiday – this was his first trip sailing around the Bahamas. ‘Next year we are planning on taking him to Italy and Greece. And here's how I normally look: A rare disguise-free shot of Crusoe, as he 'mans' the deck . Land ahoy: Crusoe (and his owners) took a trip to one of the deserted islands in the Exuma archipelago . ‘I called him “Captain Crusoe” when he was acting as coxswain on the boat. 'When he wore the pirate outfit I buried a treasure chest full of squeaky toys for him to find in the sand.’ Mr Beauchesne, of Ottawa, Canada, took Crusoe on a sailing holiday in the Caribbean with his girlfriend Laurence Dionne, 24, and her family. These guys aren't even trying: Crusoe meets some of the island's wild pigs - who were notably disguise free . Strike a pose, there's nothing to it: Crusoe gives the camera his best side in this loveable beach shot . Mr Beauchesne, a web developer, has spent the last two years dressing the black and tan sausage dog in different hand-made costumes and posting the pictures on the internet. He has previously dressed Crusoe up in a scuba diving suit, a chef's outfit, a Batman suit, and a Wile E Coyote costume, complete with a rocket. He said: ‘The holiday was amazing and Crusoe loved it. He was very well behaved. As soon as we hit the beach he would explode with energy.’ One man and his dog (and his girlfriend): Ryan Beauchesne (left), is Crusoe's besotted - and inventive - owner . Mr Beauchesne and Crusoe also visited the famous Pig Beach, on an uninhabited island in the Exuma chain, which is home to several feral pigs. ‘When we arrived on the shore one of the biggest boars came up to us. Crusoe started barking and trying to go towards him, but we held him back and kept him in the dinghy. ‘Once Crusoe saw that the pigs were not a threat he calmed down. He was quite happy watching them and looking at the food they were eating. ‘He is a very curious dog.’","Canadian dog owner Ryan Beauchesne dresses his pet in jaunty outfits .

"Senior police are shocked at the actions of a father who carried his two-year-old son on a drunken nighttime motorbike ride through southwestern Sydney, without a helmet and without the lights on. The 27-year-old Busby man was spotted by officers attached to Operation Talon - the state's gun crime squad -  traveling through the intersection of St Johns Road and South Liverpool Road at Heckenberg around 9:45pm on Saturday. He was not wearing a helmet, his vehicle's lights were off and he appeared to be carrying a bag. He attempted to flee police by riding onto a footpath, dropping the bike and attempting to run down nearby Karoola Street. 'Unbelieveable': A Sydney man was caught riding an unregistered motorbike without a helmet and carrying a 2-year-old . When police finally apprehended the man they discovered he was carrying a two-year-old boy, who has since been placed in the care of his mother. Assistant Police Commissioner John Hartley described the incident as one of of 'the strangest and most dangerous acts of driving and endangering a child's life' he had encountered. 'It's unbelievable to put a two-year-old's life in jeopardy this way,' he told News Corp Australia. The man failed a roadside breath-test and may face various charges including ride while disqualified, riding in a manner dangerous, riding an unregistered vehicle and hinder police. 'The charges have been prepared, they haven't been served on him but we're just about there,' Green Valley inspector Steve Corry told MailOnline. 'It's unbelievable that it's occured.' Insp Corry said he was not aware of any explanations offered by the man for his alarming actions. 'I don't know if he was going on a joyride or if there was a purpose to his trip,' he said, adding that the vehicle was a trail bike. Danger spot: Residents say the area around Karoola Street in Busby is notorious for dangerous motorbike activity . Residents near where the arrest was made have told MailOnline there is an increasing amount of worrying motorbike activity in the area. Anne Carter, of Busby, said she saw a man on a red motorbike 'speeding' along Busby Road who prompted a police chase on Mother's Day. 'He didn't have a helmet on,' she said. 'I could see him out of the corner of my eye, I had to swerve...I've seen a lot of it lately, they're using our street as a thoroughfare.' She said the driver fled through a reserve in south Busby called Bradshaw Park. Margaret Daniels agreed: 'There's that many chases through the area and around Bradshaw Park you don't pay any attention anymore. 'None of (the riders) wear helmets, they're mad, idiots.' Investigations into the incident continue. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Sydney Man, 27, caught riding without helmet or lights on at 9:45pm .

"Police claim to have foiled an attempt by a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family to kidnap her children away from foster care and back to her home in country NSW. Betty Colt, one of the notorious 'Colts', stands accused of hatching the 'runaway plan' to abduct the children removed from her after authorities found them living in squalor and exhibiting telltale signs of incest in the winter of 2012. Police alleged her son was given a secret phone and her mobile phone number to aid his getaway. Betty (a pseudonym prescribed by the Children's Court) has been charged with recruiting her son Bobby, 16, to commit a criminal act. Betty is accused of hatching a plan to kidnap her sons from foster carers . She is alleged to have orchestrated a brazen early morning rendezvous with two of her sons that would have seen them returned to her care, in contravention of strict court orders. In Moss Vale local court on Tuesday, magistrate Mary Ryan heard how Betty smuggled two of her sons a mobile telephone and a charger - concealed inside jacket pockets - by delivering them in secret during fortnightly meetings in the presence of foster carers. She also delivered them her phone number, using sticky tape to secure it to the back of an iPod, at a separate meeting, the court heard. In an interview conducted with 15-year-old Billy Colt (Bobby's brother) late last year and tendered in evidence by police, Billy said his mother Betty secretly opened up a line of communication that allowed her to plan the 'runaway'. 'She hid the charger in my jacket,' Billy told the police in the interview. '(Bobby) had the phone in his jacket, she hid it, she told him what it was...she planned a runaway with Bobby. 'Mum put the phone number on my iPod...under sticky tape. '(She said) this is my number, give it to Bobby.' The court heard allegations she snuck a mobile phone and charger as well as a copy of her telephone number to her sons during monitored visits, with instructions for their 'escape plan' He told police the iPod - a Christmas present - had country music downloaded into it. The explosive evidence took on a chilling note as Billy described to police how his brother told him about the plan behind closed doors and with 'soft voices' to avoid detection. '(Bobby) said don't tell anyone because we might get catched.' The alleged plan - which police claim to have foiled - was for Betty to pick up her children between 2am and 4am one morning in a four wheel drive parked 'halfway down the road' from their foster family. She was then going to take them to another location where they would be whisked away by their cousin. Appearing via audiovisual link after the police interview was played to the court, Billy said he didn't want to be part of the plan because he knew it would land him in trouble with police. '(Betty) said get up in time and come with me, mum was suppose to pick us up. 'I don't want to get in trouble, we wasn't allowed to leave...Mum said she just wants her kid back.' Under cross examination by Betty Colt's lawyer, Billy was asked 'who started the talk about going away.' He replied: 'mum'. The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse . Under the Crimes Act, Betty Colt faces up to 10 years behind bars if she is found guilty of recruiting a child to commit a crime. The prosecution is expected to call Billy's brother Bobby to give evidence tomorrow. In other proceedings last Friday, detectives took DNA swabs from Betty and her daughter Raylene Colt, as police gather evidence they hope will lead to charging a number of the family members with incest and other offences. Warrants to arrest five other Colts were also issued, with most of the clan declining to turn up to court last week. Investigators are yet to execute those warrants as it is understood the Colts are on the run across the country. Detectives believe they have spread to at least South Australia and Western Australia. A strike force made up of members of the NSW child abuse squad - spearheaded by detective inspector Peter Yeomans and detective sergeant Kirsty Hales - is pursuing the case that has been revealed as one of the most shocking acts of abuse in the country's history. Betty Colt's hearing is expected to conclude tomorrow. If she is found guilty, her criminal conviction will be the first to arise from the investigation that has already rescued generations of inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the reclusive family which lived in the picturesque hills of outback NSW. In court Billy was asked why he was removed from the Colts. 'I think because we were living in motor homes,' he replied.

"Sydney Swans AFL star Adam Goodes says he accepts that his stature as Australian of the Year and his desire to be outspoken about indigenous rights makes him a target for personal racist attacks. In the past week Goodes was racially abused by an Essendon fan, booed during the clash despite making no wrong moves, and was the victim of a series of vicious online attacks. However, the 34-year-old has vowed to not back down in his role as an indigenous leader, even if that means he's subjected to further abuse. 'I actually feel I've been in training for this role, to be honest,' Goodes said at a media conference at the SCG on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Adam Goodes said in a press conference on Thursday that he will continue to take his position as an indigenous role model seriously and defend himself against racist attacks . 'When you play at a football club and you don't play well, you do get your head knocked off'It's not the first time I've had to go through something like this. 'Yeah, I'm putting my neck out there and, at times, people want to knock it off. But I'll continue putting my neck out there because there are so many good people out there who are supporting the messages, who want to see some changes.' Despite some criticism about his front-foot-forward approach to dealing with discrimination, the Swans star maintains silence is not the answer. 'Unfortunately, some people don't want to have those conversations - they might not be ready. But I'm definitely ready,' he said. 'It's not a comfortable thing to talk about; definitely it's not a comfortable thing to go through. It's going to cause a stir and it's going to cause people to have conversations, but let's talk about it... Once we talk about it, see what it's like, then we can self-regulate and say that's not right.' In the past week the star Swans player has been racially attacked both at a game and on social media . Goodes was with his mother unveiling the new guernseys for the indigenous round, which the player's mum Lisa designed . Goodes was at the cricket ground with his mother Lisa to unveil the Swans' jersey for indigenous round that's been designed by her. This is the first time the Sydney Swans will wear an indigenous jersey for the round, and the design pays tribute to Goodes' late Auntie, according to Business Insider. Earlier in the week, the star centre half forward was labelled an 'ape', a 'hairy monkey' and a 'black dog' beneath a Facebook poll for AFL's most hated player, reports the Herald Sun. The offending comments have since been removed, however a number of crude anti-Goodes remarks remain on the 'Footy's Most Awkward Moments' Facebook page. The page, which boasts more than 54,000 likes, posted the results of a poll on Monday in which users were asked to vote for the player they hate the most in the AFL, with Goodes ranking second behind Richmond forward Jack Riewoldt. This is the first time the Swans will play in a different jersey for the indigenous round, and the design pays tribute to Goodes' late Auntie . 'These sort of comments are appalling, shocking and a stark reminder that we still have work to do in this area,' Swans chief executive Andrew Ireland told News Corp Australia. 'Racism has no place in society. Not on the football field, not in the stands, not on social media and not anywhere else. 'The positive from the weekend was the willingness of crowds to stand up and not tolerate this sort of behaviour, regardless of their allegiances.' According to the Herald Sun, fellow indigenous footballer Cyril Rioli took a number of screen grabs of the comments and posted them to his Twitter account. 'Goodes is a hairy monkey and deserves his place on this list,' was one of the comments shared by the disgusted Hawthorn forward. Vile: Administrators of the 'Footy's Most Awkward Moments' Facebook page asked users to rank their most hated AFL players . Sydney Swans veteran Adam Goodes earlier revealed his friendship with Eddie McGuire was over following the racial comments he made about the player last year. The dual Brownlow Medalist broke his silence over McGuire's on-air gaffe when he suggested Goodes, 34, be part of the promotion of King Kong the musical. It happened just days after one of the games most loyal servants was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old girl during a match against Collingwood - the club McGuire is president of. Adam Goodes revealed he no longer considers McGuire a friend while speaking at a corporate business breakfast in Sydney. At the time of the incident McGuire, 49, went public with an apology and said he would remain as Collingwood President despite pressure for him to resign. 'Burns me to the core' Eddie McGuire said he felt deeply upset about the comments he made about dual Brownlow Medalist Adam Goodes last year . He said: 'It burns me to the core that I would be associated with vilifying.' AFL boss Andrew Demetriou said McGuire's comments would be investigated, but his position at Collingwood remained in tact. At the time Goodes singled the young fan out in the crowd, McGuire stood united with him in their bid to stamp out racial vilification in the game. He reacted by stepping in to support Goodes and even shook his hand in the dressing room after the final siren went. But all his good work was undone when the Triple M radio presenter made a terrible error in judgement by suggesting Adam Goodes be flown down from Sydney to Melbourne to help promote King Kong the musical. Target: Adam Goodes has suffered numerous racist attacks during his illustrious football career . According to Fairfax Media reports, Goodes said he would still be prepared to shake McGuire's hand, but would not regard the gesture as an act of friendship. 'To have a friend and someone there that night who shook my hand in the dressing room afterwards, to have him say what he did was disappointing and uncomfortable but that’s how friendships end,' he said. Goodes also said he did not regret singling out the young girl who had vilified him. 'It was just a natural part of what I would do on a footy field,' he said. 'It was part of me acting instinctively.' At 34, Goodes has played more than 300 AFL matches for Sydney and was twice named the best player of the year. He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year this year.","Goodes says he will continue to combat racist attacks .

"Innocent: The assault case against Corey Barker was thrown out of court after the magistrate viewed CCTV footage of his arrest . Confronting CCTV footage from inside a police station on the New South Wales far north coast has led to six police officers being charged with assault and perjury offences after the integrity commission found they used excessive force. Aboriginal man Corey Barker, then 23, was arrested on 14 January 2011 following a fight in Ballina. He was arrested and taken to Ballina police station, where six officers were involved in a 'violent' confrontation with Mr Barker. They alleged that he punched one of the officers, David Hill, in the face and he was charged with assault. However Ballina magistrate David Heilpern dismissed the case after the CCTV - originally believed to be damaged - was shown in court. He also referred the case to the NSW Police Integrity Commision after ruling that the police had given false evidence in the hearing. The six police officers will front court next month after being slapped with a slew of assault and perjury charges, laid by the PIC on the recommendation of the Department of Public Prosecutions. The shocking CCTV footage allegedly shows the six officers wrestling Mr Barker to the ground and kneeing him in a violent arrest on 14 January 2011. A total of 25 charges were laid against the cops, following a lengthy report compiled by the PIC, as part of Operation Barmouth. 'In the process (of his arrest) Barker’s body was forced against a bin and a chair in a corner of the (breath analysis system) room. The machine in the BAS room was visibly displaced by the impact of Barker’s body,' the report stated. 'The police treatment of Barker can fairly be described as violent.' Scroll down for video . Brutal: Six police officers were charged with assault and perjury-related offences after this video emerged showing them engaged in the 'violent' arrest of Aboriginal man Corey Barker, then 23 . Constable Lee Walmsley, former constable Luke Mewing, senior constable Mark Woolven, former sergeant Robert McCubben, constable Ryan Eckersley and senior constable David Hill were all subsequently charged under the Crimes Act in relation to the alleged mistreatment of Mr Barker and alleged lies about the events surrounding his arrest. They accused Mr Barker of punching senior constable Hill in the face, but that was not shown in the CCTV footage shown in court. According to the PIC investigation, the officers gave false and misleading statements as part of their evidence in the assault case against Corey Barker, which was dismissed by magistrate David Heilpern after the CCTV was shown to the court. The PIC concluded: 'that Barker did not assault Hill as alleged and, in particular, did not punch, or even attempt to punch, Hill on the nose or face.'

'Barker was dragged to a cell in the police station by police officers holding the handcuffs on Barker’s hands, head first, on his stomach, with his arms forced high above his head against the natural inclination of his arms,' the report stated. 'This method of taking Barker to a cell involved excessive force.' Four of the six police officers were charged with common assault and all were either charged with either perjury or perverting the course of justice. The PIC sent the set of charges to the Department of Public Prosecutions for consideration. The DPP later recommended the charges and will prosecute the cases. 'It took so much to prove that I was innocent, just because they're officers,' Barker earlier told ABC radio. 'You're meant to be confident in going out in the street. 'Some people have been proud of me that I'm fighting it. Other people have been taking it differently ""oh you know it's just another black person mucked up in custody and now they've copped a beating and now they're out crying"" but it wasn't nothing like that.' The six men will appear in Downing Centre local court on 17 July. Police power: The PIC report concluded that police used excessive force during Barker's arrest at Ballina police station .

"He has travelled to some of the most glamorous locations in the world and lives in a palace but Prince Charles looked surprisingly at home as he descended into London's deepest sewer. Wearing a hard hat and a bright orange high-viz jacket over his pinstriped grey suit, Charles was on inquisitive form and peppered his hosts from Thames Water with questions as he went. Luckily for the heir to the throne, the Lee Tunnel is brand new and won't be connected to the capital's pipes until December 2015. Futuristic: The Prince of Wales was 75m below the surface of London today, as he visited the Lee Tunnel . When it is, the tunnel, dubbed a 'super sewer' by London mayor Boris Johnson, will have the capacity to carry up to 16 million tonnes of waste at any one time. Charles was joined for his visit by a group of engineers, all of whom were among the team that helped to construct it. He also met apprentices Liam Kelleher, 19, and Tony Brown, 23, during his tour and spent several minutes chatting to them. A supporter of apprenticeship schemes, the Prince has spoken in the past of the importance of giving young people hands-on experience and the chance of a career in engineering. 'Apprentices and young people have a key part to play in our future,' said Thames Water CEO Martin Baggs after the visit. Enjoying himself: Charles toured the  'super-sewer' with apprentices Liam Kelleher, 19, and Tony Brown, 23 . Impressive: The enormous tunnel is 7km long, seven metres wide and cost £635m to complete . Fascinated: The Prince peppered the engineers accompanying him on the tour with questions . 'Bringing in new talent now is crucial as we need an army of operational staff ready to take over from those who will inevitably retire in years to come.' The vast tunnel, which was commissioned to put an end to leakage from London's creaking Victorian sewer system, sits 75m below ground, runs for seven kilometres and cost £635m to build. Although not currently on-line, the Abbey Mills Pumping Station, which sits next to the Lee Tunnel, is and was processing thousands of tonnes of waste as the Prince was shown around. Despite the thousands of tonnes of sewage travelling through its pipes, the building was surprisingly free from bad smells, leaving Charles free to admire its ornate interior. Built as part of London's original sewerage system, the building was designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and played a key role in helping to rid the capital of diseases such as cholera. The Victorian system, which was opened by Charles' great-great-grandfather Edward VII while he was still Prince of Wales, is celebrating its 150th birthday this year. Not his usual look: Charles donned a hard hat, high-viz jacket and a pair of goggles during the tour . Overflow: Currently, 39m tonnes of waste are leaking into the Thames from London's overworked sewers . Visit: Charles was shown around the Abbey Mills Pumping Station by Thames Water's Martin Baggs (right) Still going strong: Abbey Mills was built in 1865 by Sir Joseph Bazalgette but is still in use . Opened in 1865, it replaced the old habit of dumping rubbish and faeces directly into the Thames - behaviour that famously resulted in the Great Stink of 1858. So revolting was the smell emanating from the Thames, even Parliament was affected, with Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli describing the river as 'a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors'. The disgusting stench that summer did prove to have some benefits, however; the main one being the speedy agreement of MPs to Sir Joseph Bazalgette's sewer plans. Part of them was Abbey Mills, where Prince Charles, watched by Thames Water workers and staff from sanitation charity, Water Aid, unveiled a plaque. Stench: The pumping station was built in the wake of the Great Stink which blighted London in 1858 . All smiles: Charles was following in the footsteps of Edward VII who opened Abbey Mills in 1865 . Beautiful: The pumping station is famous for its beautiful architecture and ornate interior . Reception: At the end of the tour, Charles attended a reception, during which he unveiled a plaque . 'We can often take our own access to safe water and sanitation for granted,' added Mr Baggs. 'The focus on our history really reminds us that a time when we too didn’t have the basic human requirements our taps and toilets provide isn’t that long ago. 'Anyone living in London today owes Sir Joseph Bazalgette a great debt of gratitude.' Prince Charles has been the president of Water Aid since 1991. Speaking after the Prince's visit, Rosemary Carr, deputy chairman of WaterAid said: . 'Despite our joint achievements, today - astonishingly – 748 million people still don't have access to safe water and 2.5 million still live without access to somewhere safe and private to go to the toilet. 'Tragically, this causes the easily preventable death of a young child every single minute.'","The Prince of Wales toured the Lee Tunnel, London's deepest sewer .

He was crowned the Brownlow Medalist in 2003 and 2006 and was this year given the country's top honour when named Australian Of The Year. On receiving his award he said he was a 'very proud indigenous man' who was keen to fight racism in Australia. He said it was a different accolade altogether to the one's he was used to receiving in AFL. 'I’m a little bit overwhelmed, to be honest. It’s not like winning a premiership or winning a Brownlow medal for the skills that you show on the football field, it’s quite amazing.'

"The second son of Betty Colt, a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family, said his mother gave him a phone to hide in the back garden of his foster home in an attempt to kidnap him and his brother, a court heard today. Bobby Colt (a pseudonym prescribed by the Children's Court), 16, appeared via audiovisual link in Moss Vale local court on Wednesday on the second day of a hearing into allegations that Betty  tried to recruit him to conspire in the kidnapping. The pair were removed from her care after authorities found them living in squalor and exhibiting telltale signs of incest in the winter of 2012. Betty Colt, a member of the infamous 'Colt' incest family, arrives at Moss Vale local court with her lawyer . The court heard that Betty had given him her number by scrawling it in magazines that she passed over as gifts. 'It was in the books, in car magazines,' he said. He also reaffirmed his 15-year-old brother Billy Colt's testimony that Betty, who had five of her 13 children removed from her, smuggled them a mobile phone and a charger at a contact meeting to arrange for an early morning abduction. Bobby described how he concealed the phone in the back garden so he could continue planning the runaway with his mother. He said he hid it 'out in the back in the bush...in a waterproof bag. So it doesn't get taken. 'I knew I had to stay (in care) until I was 18.' He also said he discussed the 'plan', as it is being referred to in court, with his brother behind a closed door 'so nobody can hear us...I didn't want to get catched.' Asked if the plan was his mother's, Bobby said: 'yes'. According to Children's Court documents tendered in Moss Vale Local Court on Wednesday, Bobby Colt's parents are 'closely related'. When he was found by authorities, 'his speech was not understandable...he had fungal infections...he needed urgent dental work.' He was seen leaving the court this morning with his carer and puffing on a cigarette before being reunited with his brother Billy. Betty Colt did not give evidence in the hearing and her LegalAid lawyer Phil Carey told court the defence case would be put forward by way of written submissions. Betty is accused of hatching a plan to kidnap her sons from foster carers . Final submissions must be filed by the police by 5 August and the defence will have a further week to prepare their case. An urgent transcript of this week's proceedings was ordered by Magistrate Mary Ryan. Bail for Betty Colt was continued, meaning she has to report to a NSW police station three times a week. She was also ordered to notify, in writing, detective sergeant Kirsty Hales and detective inspector Peter Yeomans of the state's child abuse squad of any plans to relocate her address. The case was adjourned to 18 August for Magistrate Ryan to hand down her decision. In Moss Vale local court on Tuesday, magistrate Mary Ryan heard that Billy said his mother Betty secretly opened up a line of communication that allowed her to plan the 'runaway', in an interview conducted with Billy Colt late last year and tendered in evidence by police. 'She hid the charger in my jacket,' Billy told the police in the interview. '(Bobby) had the phone in his jacket, she hid it, she told him what it was...she planned a runaway with Bobby. 'Mum put the phone number on my iPod...under sticky tape. '(She said) this is my number, give it to Bobby.' The court heard allegations she snuck a mobile phone and charger as well as a copy of her telephone number to her sons during monitored visits, with instructions for their 'escape plan' He told police the iPod - a Christmas present - had country music downloaded into it. The evidence took on a chilling note as Billy described to police how his brother told him about the plan behind closed doors and with 'soft voices' to avoid detection. '(Bobby) said don't tell anyone because we might get catched.' The alleged plan - which police claim to have foiled - was for Betty to pick up her children between 2am and 4am one morning in a four wheel drive parked 'halfway down the road' from their foster family. She was then going to take them to another location where they would be whisked away by their cousin. Appearing via audiovisual link on Tuesday after the police interview was played to the court, Billy said he didn't want to be part of the plan because he knew it would land him in trouble with police. '(Betty) said get up in time and come with me, mum was suppose to pick us up. 'I don't want to get in trouble, we wasn't allowed to leave...Mum said she just wants her kid back.' Under cross examination by Betty Colt's lawyer, Billy was asked 'who started the talk about going away.' He replied: 'mum'. The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse . Under the Crimes Act, Betty Colt faces up to 10 years behind bars if she is found guilty of recruiting a child to commit a crime. In other proceedings last Friday, detectives took DNA swabs from Betty and her daughter Raylene Colt, as police gather evidence they hope will lead to charging a number of the family members with incest and other offences. Warrants to arrest five other Colts were also issued, with most of the clan declining to turn up to court last week. Investigators are yet to execute those warrants as it is understood the Colts are on the run across the country. Detectives believe they have spread to at least South Australia and Western Australia. A strike force made up of members of the NSW child abuse squad - spearheaded by detective inspector Peter Yeomans and detective sergeant Kirsty Hales - is pursuing the case that has been revealed as one of the most shocking acts of abuse in the country's history. If Betty Colt is found guilty, her criminal conviction will be the first to arise from the investigation that has already rescued generations of inbred, illiterate and malnourished children from the reclusive family which lived in the picturesque hills of outback NSW. In court Billy was asked why he was removed from the Colts. 'I think because we were living in motor homes,' he replied.

"The distraught wife of an ANZ banker who was involved in a road accident in Papua New Guinea earlier this month has revealed she wanted to stop after 'clipping' a seven-year-old girl on the Poreporena Freeway but couldn't as she was fearful for her own life. Belinda Coleman - whose husband Gareth was the ANZ Head of Supply and Chain in Port Moresby - was driving along the busy road on May 7 when Serah Kevin ran out in front of her vehicle and collided with her side mirror. The seven-year-old, who was fleeing from an 'attacker', was knocked down and then run over by a second car, suffering two broken legs. The Coleman family was flown back to Australia immediately over fears of a 'targeted revenge attack' by locals. Agony: Serah Kevin was knocked to the ground and then run over by another vehicle after she collided with Belinda Coleman's side mirror on May 7. She suffered two broken legs as a result . Horror: Serah's mother Belsy was seen wailing with grief as her daughter lay severely injured on the Poreporena Freeway in Port Moresby . Distressed: ANZ executive banker Gareth Coleman said his family had suffered a traumatic ordeal after they were forced to flee PNG . 'I'm traumatised, I'm sickened at what's happened,' she told MailOnline. 'There was a road accident that I had no control over...she was running from an attacker, she was frightened, she was scared. It could have been your wife, it could have been your daughter, it could have been you in the car.' Mrs Coleman said the girl dropped a thong in the middle of the road and turned back to retrieve it when she was accidentally clipped by her vehicle. 'I'm saddened that I lived in a country that I loved where it was too dangerous to stop,' Mrs Coleman said. 'As a mother, my heart breaks...I did everything I was told to do.' Carnage: AFP officers, on patrol with local cops, were among the first to respond to the accident and were forced to use sticks as makeshift braces . Revenge: ANZ bank flew the Colemans home immediately over fears of a 'targeted revenge attack' by an angry Papua New Guinean community . In PNG, Australian expatriates are instructed by security experts never to stop on the side of the road after a traffic incident due to the threat posed by locals. Mrs Coleman followed protocol by driving to ANZ headquarters and informing her husband, who passed on details of the crash to officials. 'This is standard practice in PNG in terms of leaving the country after being involved in anything. To be frank, it wasn't a pleasant experience but it's par for the course,' said Gareth Coleman. 'You leave for your own safety.' Crime scene: AFP officers only provide 'advice' to the local police force and are not involved in the official investigation into the crash . Medical emergency: Serah Kevin has since undergone surgery, paid for by ANZ, and has corroborated Mrs Coleman's version of events . Mr Coleman said it is made 'explicitly clear' not to stop after road accidents and instead to go to the nearest point of safety. 'My wife is very, very upset...distraught,' he added. '(Over) the fact that she was unable to stop. 'What happened was incredibly unfortunate and both parties have suffered as a result. The young girl has physical injuries and my wife has gone through an ordeal of her own. Powerless: Belinda Coleman said she had 'no control' over the May 7 incident that left Serah Kevin with horrific injuries . 'It's deeply distressing and we are encouraged by the progress of the young girl.' Young Serah's medical bills have been paid for by the ANZ bank and it is understood she has corroborated Mrs Coleman's version of events. An ANZ spokesman told MailOnline Mr Coleman would remain as an employee of the bank. PNG traffic inspector Philip Koliadi told MailOnline police were talking to 'two very close eyewitnesses' as their investigation into the crash continues. The driver of the vehicle which ran over Serah has not yet been found. Danger zone: The stretch of road where Belinda Coleman collided with a young PNG girl who was fleeing an attacker .

"Just two months after it took aim at the McDonald's breakfast menu by offering menu items like the 'Waffle Taco,' Taco Bell is trying its hand at semi-fast food geared towards diners with palettes a bit more sophisticated than those of the chain's typical 'Open Late' crowd. Taco Bell is planning to test the waters of the fancier, fast-casual restaurant scene with a new restaurant called U.S. Taco Co. and Urban Tap Room. In addition to fancier food, the new restaurants will also have booze. Fancy: U.S. Taco Co. will feature fancier menu items than Taco Bell, like fusion-inspired tacos and booze-infused milkshakes . Fast-casual: U.S. Taco Co. is gearing its menu towards foodies, with fresher, more-sophisticated tacos than Taco Bell . The menu features fancier tacos than the typical Taco Bell patron might be used to - fancier, fusion tacos replace re-heated ground beef and shredded cheddar cheese. According to the Los Angeles Times, the new restaurant will feature a take on a Philly favorite, with its 'Brotherly Love' cheesesteak taco made with a flour tortilla, carne asada steak, grilled peppers and onions, roasted poblano queso, cotija cheese and cilantro. Then there's the Southern-inspired taco, the 'Winner Winner taco with a flour tortilla, home-style crispy chicken, 'SOB' Southern gravy, roasted corn pico de gallo, jalapeno and cilantro. 'A year ago, we conducted an extensive study on our consumer . segmentation and identified a separate consumer group that simply was . not going to visit quick service restaurants, at all,' Jeff Jenkins, . Taco Bell senior brand manager, said in a statement. 'The result is U.S. Taco, a new concept sit-down restaurant that offers the best fusion of . American-inspired flavors in tacos, fries and shakes for that emerging . demographic of edgy foodies looking for a unique dining experience.' Trial: Taco Bell will launch its first fast-casual restaurant, U.S. Taco Co. (pictured) in California's Huntington Beach, and depending on its reception, could expand to other locations . Think outside the bun: The new restaurant concept comes just months after Taco Bell introduced a breakfast menu to compete with McDonald's . The U.S. Taco Co. menu also has fancy fries with habanero dust, ghost chile ketchup and roasted poblano crema, as well as carne . asada fries, made with an order of 'Papas Fritas' topped with carne . asada, a four-cheese blend, queso, avocado, salsa, roasted poblano . queso, pico de gallo, cotija cheese and cilantro. Then there's the booze - in addition to beer and wine, there's also a booze-infused milkshake called the 'Mexican Car Bomb,' which is made with vanilla ice cream, tequila caramel sauce, chocolate flakes and Guinness stout. The first U.S. Taco Co. will be in Huntington Beach, California, and is slated to open in the next few months. However, Taco Bell Chief Executive Greg Creed tells the OC Register, 'I would love one day to see 1,000 of these. But let’s not get that far ahead of ourselves. We’re opening a restaurant and seeing what happens.'","The first U.S. taco Co. will open in Huntington Beach, California, in the next few months .

"Detectives on the New South Wales far north coast have identified a woman found dead in dunes on Tallow Beach this morning and are currently notifying next-of-kin. A member of the public came across the gruesome find on sand dunes at Tallow Beach around 11.20am and told police immediately.

At this stage her identity and exact age have not been disclosed by police. Forensics officers examined the scene early this afternoon, however details about the woman's death remain sketchy. 'We just can't say one way or another,' a NSW police spokesman said. 'There's nothing obvious either way.' A post mortem will be performed and a crime scene has been set up at the beach. A senior Tweed Heads police officer told MailOnline the woman's body was clothed when it was discovered. Gruesome: A woman's body was found by a member of the public on Monday morning.

"Australia's richest MP turned heads this morning, rolling up to Parliament House in Canberra in a sparkling vintage-style grey Rolls Royce. The eccentric member for Fairfax, who made his billions in the mining industry, chose the passenger seat for his dramatic entrance to Capital Hill, delivered by a private chauffeur. AAP reports Mr Palmer was listening to Van Morrison as he stepped out of the extravagant vehicle and into a press pack interviewing Labor's Brendan O'Connor about employment figures. Maverick Palmer quickly stole the show, with the assembled media more interested in his penchant for luxury travel than the political lines being peddled by the member for Gorton. 'Members of parliament really don't need comm (Commonwealth) cars that cost the taxpayer a lot of money,' he told reporters when asked about his choice of transport. 'That money could be better spent giving it to pensioners.' He added that members without a Rolls Royce in their garage should catch a taxi to work. Causing a stir: Palmer's grand entrance to parliament in a Rolls Royce on Tuesday morning turned heads . Mr Palmer was pressed on whether his snazzy ride was an inappropriate look when arriving for a sitting of the House of Representatives. He remained defiant, telling reporters that any Australians - regardless of race, colour, wealth or creed - had the opportunity to become parliamentarians. 'I would say only two per cent of Australians have lobbyists in Canberra, the other 98 per cent are unrepresented,' he said. 'I am here to represent them.' Billionaire: Palmer said MPs without Rolls Royces should catch taxis to parliament . Summing up the bizarre interruption, Brendan O'Connor - the shadow minister for employment and workplace relations - remained philosophical. 'Clive's Clive,' he said. 'If he wants to present that way, of course, that's entirely up to him.' Clive Palmer's Palmer United Party recently earned official registration in the Northern Territory. He is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion and has plans in place to build a full-length replica of the RMS Titanic.

"Single mother Sanaa Derbas will face court next month for allegedly conning a string of elderly men out of $2 million in a lonely hearts scam - and then using the cash to fund her lavish lifestyle. The 39-year-old was arrested on Thursday at her Miller home in Sydney's west and charged with offences which are more commonly committed by Nigerian fraudsters. She is accused of trawling lonely hearts messages online and in newspapers to find her alleged victims, who were all in their 60s and 70s. She is believed to have formerly owned a cosmetics business called 'Provocative Nails'. Scroll down for video . The woman, who is being led away by police, was arrested on Thursday charged with a crime usually committed by Nigerian fraudsters . This is the profile picture the mother-of-four used to allegedly lure elderly men to hand over their money . Derbas, whose children are aged two to 16, will appear in court on June 25 to face several counts of fraud and money laundering. She is the first person in Australia to be charged with these offences in relation to a lonely hearts scam. The mother-of-four, who receives $1,500 a fortnight in welfare payments, is accused of using sites like Lavalife and Meeting Point to target older men. She used the proceeds of her alleged crimes to fund a lifestyle of flashy cars, exotic getaways, designer handbags and plastic surgery, the Daily Telegraph reported. She used the money she allegedly scammed to fund a luxurious lifestyle of designer bags, holidays and flash cars . It is also alleged she purchased a home in Miller, knocked it down and built a brand-new one. On Friday, one man, a woman and a teenage boy arrived next door to the woman's Miller home, where Ms Derbas's mother is believed to live. Relatives of the woman also occupy a third house next door, neighbours said. After arriving at the mother's house the man, named Gus, who was dressed in grey cargo pants, a hoodie and sunglasses turned the garden hose on reporters in the street. Another neighbour, Lyn, yelled out her support and said when asked about the alleged fraud of the elderly men, 'good on her, if they're that stupid'. Emanuel, who lives across the road from the woman said she had built her current brick house in the last few years,  replacing  an older house. 'She is a lovely woman with lovely kids,' he said. A woman in the street told MailOnline the woman's family were of Lebanese background and had lived in the street for many years. She said the alleged con woman 'fancies herself'  and had had plastic surgery.One man in the street said people joked about the woman's botox injections and her 'butt lift'. Police allege one man handed over $1.9million to Ms Derbas while others gave her $190,000, $58,000 and $12,000. Police say that there may be more victims. Three of the men she allegedly duped had not even met her. One of them was an interstate businessman and had a sexual relationship with her at his north shore apartment. NSW Fraud and and Cybercrime Squad's Detective Superintendent Arthur Katsogiannis said the woman was a master at manipulating the older men. 'This woman was very good convincing men that she was in love with them and that they were in a relationship,' he told the Daily Telegraph. NSW Police will allege the woman had five bank accounts and invented sob stories to convince her victims to deposit the money in her account. Detective Katsogiannis said she would tell men a relative in Egypt had died and she needed money to get the funds released from the state or her child needed an operation in Melbourne. The single mother, 39, hugged one of her children as the police led her away from her Miller home in Sydney's west . Police will also allege she laundered money by buying cars and selling them off at a loss . 'We will allege she used a number of these stories to play on the men's good nature and emotions,' he said. It is also alleged the woman laundered money by buying expensive cars and then selling them at a loss. Detective Katsogiannis said this type of scam was often performed overseas and police believed this was the first time anyone in Australia had been charged with doing it. He commended the men for having the courage to come forward and report something that was 'potentially very embarrassing'. More than $1 million and assets have been frozen by police, and the woman's cars were seized on Thursday. She is currently on bail and is due to appear at Liverpool Local Court on June 25. It is also alleged the woman bought a home in Miller, knocked it down and rebuilt a new one . At the home on Thursday, police seized her cars as well as freezing $1 million and assets .

"The East Winsdor gun store which sourced at least one of the guns used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting was raided  by federal firearms agents last night. Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) swooped on Riverside Gun Sales at 5pm yesterday evening, as officers from East Police Department cordoned off the plaza. The raid was a result of security worries at the store after it was revealed the premises had been robbed of a rifle similar to the one used in the Newtown shooting, just four days before the tragedy. Jordan Marsh, 26, is reported to be suffering from serious mental health problems and was off medication when he was arrested . Police say that Riverside Gun Sales have failed to account for over 30 missing guns since 2007 . A news website showed video footage of 26 year old Jordan Marsh removing the 50 calibre long gun from the store. Marsh was caught by local police and the AR15 was recovered in a duffel bag at the Hartford Hilton on Saturday. The girlfriend of Marsh's father, Sarah Hodge, spoke of her shock on seeing the reports and footage of the theft. CCTV footage shows Marsh handling the AR15 sports rifle . Federal agents are now concerned about the store's security after Marsh was able to walk out with the gun . Store management said they didn't notice the gun was missing until police contacted them after the gun was found in a nearby hotel . Marsh is seen here leaving the store, gun in hand, without being noticed by store workers . 'It's unbelievable,' Ms Hodge said. Marsh had been staying with ms Hodge for the previous two years, and she said the 26 year old had suffered from Schizophrenia, and other mental issues. Marsh had been off his medication at the time of Saturday's arrest. She added that she was happy the young man had been caught: 'I'm sorry Jordan but you need help.' Police said Riverview Gun Sales had no idea the AR-15 Marsh stole was missing. Management at the store didn't know about 11 guns that Marsh had allegedly stolen last year until they were notified by detectives. Inventory control issues at Riverview Gun Sales have occurred before. In 2007, state police raided a Somers home and found a bunch of stolen guns from the store. 'It was found that the same Riverview gun store was missing upwards of 30-plus guns,' said East Windsor police Detective Matthew Carl.","Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives swoop on the store .

"The British backpacker who was viciously beaten up in Bundaberg, Queensland, on Saturday night has spoken for the first time about the ordeal and admitted only now does he realise how serious the attack was. Speaking to MailOnline from his hospital bed, the talented young footballer, who has been traveling around Australia since February, said he suffered a fractured skull and was put in an induced coma after he was allegedly set upon by a 22-year-old local on the Burnett traffic bridge - the same spot where British backpacker Caroline Stuttle was pushed to her death more than 12 years ago. North Bundaberg man Braydon Adams has been charged over the alleged attack on Mr Luxton. Thumbs up: Chris Luxton is in happy spirits since recovering from a 48 hour coma in Royal Brisbane hospital, as seen in this photo snapped by his father Shane for MailOnline. Police have charged a 22-year-old Bundaberg local in relation to the bashing attack which left Luxton fighting for life . Shocking: British amateur footballer Chris Luxton was left fighting for his life after he was allegedly attacked and robbed in Bundaberg on Saturday night . 'It was actually my first night in Bundaberg,' Mr Luxton, from Cornwall, southwest England, said. 'I'd turned up to town looking for farm work. I remember getting out of the club, waking up and there were tubes coming out of me. 'It was horrible, there were tubes down the back of my throat and I couldn't breathe...I don't think I realised how serious it was.' Mr Luxton, who has been working as a bricklayer while in Australia, was unaware he was on the same bridge where fellow British tourist Caroline Stuttle was killed in 2002. Chris Luxton was also allegedly robbed of his mobile phone, wallet and other items on the Burnett Traffic Bridge in Bundaberg, a city 385km north of Brisbane . On Tuesday, Queensland police arrested 22-year-old Adams and charged him with grievous bodily harm. He appeared in Bundaberg Magistrates Court that same day and was remanded in custody after bail was denied. He will next appear on July 24. Adams is also accused of stealing Mr Luxton's mobile phone and wallet during the attack. Major headache: Luxton required 34 stitches to the back of his head following the attack on Saturday night . Mr Luxton was first taken to the local hospital and then flown to Royal Brisbane Hospital for emergency surgery. 'I was in intensive care,' he said. 'For all I know I could have been a cabbage, all mangled up. I can't fly for six weeks, which was kind of a relief because I'm going to stay as long as I can. 'I've never met so many nice people, there's definitely a few twits everywhere though.' Mr Luxton's parents Shane and Lin were told of the incident by police when UK officers knocked on their door in the middle of the night. 'My wife just started crying straight away,' said Shane Luxton, who flew to Brisbane on the first available flight. 'One of the police officers said ""you ought to sit down, Chris has sustained a serious injury and has been flown to Brisbane hospital"".' Mr Luxton said he 'picked up a credit card, threw some things in a bag' and made his way to the airport for what would be a horrific flight. Fighting for life: Luxton was put in an induced coma while his father Shane raced to Bundaberg from England . Chris Luxton on an earlier holiday (above left) and (right) scuba diving off the Australian coast . Bridge of horror: The bridge Luxton was allegedly attacked on is the same span that British backpacker Caroline Stuttle was pushed to her death from in 2002 . 'It was unbelievable - the longest 20 hours of my life,' he said. 'Not knowing what state Chris was going to be in when I arrived, or if he would still be around.' His son was left with 34 stitches in the back of his head after emergency surgery. 'I still feel a bit groggy,' he said. 'I've got a massive headache but I'm starting to feel a lot better.' Chris Luxton has fallen in love with Australia during his time in the country and said he has seen most of the east coast, gone sky-diving and scuba diving. He insisted Saturday night's incident would not stop him getting the most out of his 12-month working visa. Mr Luxton was on UK football team Plymouth Argyle's books as a youngster and later played at Newquay and Bodmin Town. Newquay manager Jim Hilton said: 'He's got such a strong personality, a love for life and cheeky with it, and he's an absolutely superb footballer.' The 21-year-old still needs to go through a number of medical tests and doctors have not said when he will be discharged from hospital. Tragedy: Stuttle was also holidaying in Bundaberg when she fell to her death in 2002 . The incident happened 12 years after  English backpacker Caroline Stuttle was thrown to her death in 2002 from the very same bridge. Police described her death as a robbery that went wrong. The 19-year-old Yorkshire backpacker was on her way to the Great Barrier Reef when she was robbed and thrown from the bridge by Ian Douglas Previte. Mr Previte was sentenced to life in prison in 2004. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Chris Luxton, 21, was allegedly beaten and robbed on Saturday night .

"A Los Angeles marketing firm is calling Alex from Target a fake. And they say they're responsible. Breakr, a company dedicated to 'connecting fans to their fandom' announced Tuesday that they'd orchestrated the meme's massive viral popularity. The news was a sharp blow to many teenage Alex from Target lovers, but do they truly have a reason to be upset? Scroll down for video . Is this man responsible for Alex from Target? Dil-Domine Jacobe Leonares (right) is CEO of marketing startup Breakr and says his firm is behind the viral meme . Breakr CEO Dil-Domine Jacobe Leonares wrote in a LinkedIn post about his company's involvement: . 'Yesterday, we had fun on Twitter with the hashtag #AlexFromTarget which ended up to be one of the most amazing social media experiments ever,' he wrote Monday. 'We wanted to see how powerful the fangirl demographic was.' The result was one of the most popular, overnight viral memes ever. On Monday alone, Alex from Target was tweeted about some 1 million times. Alex turned out to be a random, handsome Texas teenage Target employee named Alex Laboeuf. By Tuesday, Laboeuf's Twitter followers numbered around 500,000 and his good fortune continues to pour forth. Ellen Degeneres tweeted a photo of herself along with Alex and the hashtag #AlexFromTargetAtTargetWithEllen. In addition to internet stardom, it appears Alex may have won himself a spot on a holiday Target commercial. But was it Breakr who got him there, or are they just looking to profit from the Alex phenomenon? From the start of the Alex from Target craze, everyone appears to agree it was a British Twitter user named Abbie who first tweeted Alex's photo. Not so fast: The undisputed first person to tweet the photo was this British girl -- she says she's never heard of Breakr . First saw Alex? Texas teen Alanna Page (left) first tweeted about Alex after seeing him at Target in late October. Her friend Brooklyn then responded with the now-infamous pic of Alex after seeing him for herself and a meme was born . So how did a girl in England hook up with a California marketing startup with a handful of employees and an app on the iTunes store boasting all of 30 reviews? She didn't. Abbie herself says she has no idea who they are. 'i dont work for breakr wtf i dont even know what it is,' she tweeted. She also shared on Tuesday evening some of her not-so-positive feelings about the craze. 'whatever im so done with this alex s***' she tweeted. What's more, as the Daily Dot reports, Abbie wasn't the photographer--it was more likely a girl named Brooklyn Reiff, who recognized Alex while in line at Target from a tweet her friend had sent previously. 'Alanna tweeted about a checkout guy at target being attractive & I soon found myself in his checkout line.. remembering Alanna's tweet,' Reiff told the Daily Dot. 'I quickly snapped a pic of 'Alex from Target' and tweeted Alanna.' Neither Reiff nor Alanna Page have had any connections to -- or even heard of Breakr -- either. 'I have never heard of Breakr but a few of my friends are sending me links to the post but I don't really know what it is,' Reiff added. Viral craze: Alex from Target is Alex Laboeuf (right). His skyrocketing popularity appears to have gotten him onto a commercial beside Ellen Degeneres, who tweeted this photo . Popular: Celebrities and fangirl teens alike have jumped on the Alex from Target bandwagon . Target also tweeted their take on Alex from Target, though they appear to have had nothing to do with creating the meme .","A company called Breakr says they orchestrated the Alex phenomenon .

"From Beach Haus to the beach. Mitchell Pearce has used a rare day off from Roosters training to dive beneath the waves - and away from the controversy surrounding his infamous Kings Cross nightclub incident - on Sydney's northern beaches. And while the halfback enjoyed the sand and surf at Dee Why, MailOnline can reveal the woman he allegedly approached on the nightclub dance floor was holed up at work at a phone shop in the inner west. Scroll down for video . Yellow fever: The woman at the centre of the Mitchell Pearce nightclub controversy Melissa Arroja used a brief work break on Thursday to go shopping. True to form, she was wearing lots of bright yellow . And Melissa Arroja, who made a complaint to uniformed police patrolling the Beach Haus club after Mitchell Pearce appeared to grab her in the early morning hours of May 11, really likes her yellow. As these exclusive photographs reveal, the woman famous for boasting about her bright yellow dress and its ability to attract footballers can't get enough of the colour. She was spotted wearing an incredibly bright yellow necklace and yellow nail polish during a brief trip to the shops on Thursday. She declined to talk to MailOnline, however her boss said she has been 'in tears' in the days since the incident. Welcome break: Mitch Pearce used his day off to splash about in the surf off Dee Why . Sliding doors: While Ms Arroja worked, Pearce soaked up the rays . Feeling the heat: Arroja was in no mood to talk to MailOnline on Thursday . Happier times: Arroja chose to out herself as the mystery woman on social media . 'I was looking after her all last week when she was in tears,' he said. 'She's been really good about it...she wants it all to go away. She's been advised not to talk about it.' Her identity was first revealed when she posted photos of herself from her 'melzbubblebutt' Instagram account along with the caption '#girlintheyellowdress'. Taking a dive: Mitchell Pearce was stood down by the Roosters and fined $20,000 for his behaviour . Breather: A relaxed looking Pearce, who will not feature in next week's State Of Origin due to his indiscretions, was seen talking to fans on Thursday . Well heeled: The inner west nightclub fan rocked high heel boots during her day at work for a phone company . She also wrote on Facebook 'Who would have thought a Sat night at Beach Haus in the cross wearing a yellow dress would cause such a drama!! Never thought I would make the headlines WTF'. Soon after her name went public she went to ground and deleted her social media accounts, which were sprawling with revealing photos of Ms Arroja in racy outfits. Her bright yellow dress featured in a number of snaps. Charges were never laid against Mitchell Pearce after Ms Arroja decided not to pursue the matter with police. Bold and beautiful: Arroja shared a number of racy photos of herself clad in the infamous yellow dress at the centre of the Beach Haus incident .

However the drunken incident cost the NRL star his likely spot in the NSW Origin side and $20,000 by way of a fine from the Sydney Roosters. He was also stood down for one game by the club. On the morning of the incident he was led away in handcuffs and fined $500 for refusing to leave a licensed premises. CCTV footage from inside the club was featured on news bulletins across the country. Melissa Arroja's father Antonio told MailOnline he was proud of his daughter and that she acted as any young woman should. 'She's not a child. She's done nothing wrong...if she was in trouble with police then I'd be worried,' he said. Repentant Rooster: Pearce has since apologised for his behaviour and vowed to give up the booze . Between the flags: Pearce flexed his muscles at Dee Why on Thursday afternoon and enjoyed a brief swim . Ms Arroja remains visibly stressed about the incident and has refused all media requests. Mitchell Pearce spent his Thursday afternoon at the beach mingling with fans, sun baking and talking on his phone. Another beach-goer said the Roosters play maker enjoyed a brief swim and was seen flexing his muscles. Last week the star play maker vowed to give up alcohol for the rest of the season and apologised to Ms Arroja, his parents and his girlfriend Phoebe Carpenter for his actions. 'Firstly I want to say sorry for my parents, who are my biggest supporters. I let them down, embarrassed them and they’ve had to wear the brunt the last couple of days, which has been hard for them,' he told reporters. Write caption here .

"A chef who skewered a customer complaining about his slow service avoided jail time in Burwood local court today, after the magistrate was told he had been provoked. Mati Rahman, 45, was found guilty of recklessly wounding Jamil Hossain, 47, at the Red Chilli Pakistani and Indian restaurant in Lakemba last March. A fight broke out in the restaurant's kitchen after Mr Hossain - celebrating Bangladeshi Independence Day at the time - inquired about the progress of his order. Skewered: Mati Rahman was found guilty of stabbing a customer with a tandoori skewer last March . Mr Hossain was part of a group of customers at the Lakemba restaurant who had waited two hours for their food, AAP reports. Rahman was sentenced on Thursday to a five month good behaviour bond. Magistrate Margaret Quinn told the accused that jail time would have been a last resort. Police prosecutor Adam Wilczek told Burwood local court that Mr Rahman continued to deny the attack. 'The accused appears to have shown no remorse,' he said. The victim earlier claimed the angry chef had shouted 'Get out or I’ll kill you’. Mr Rahman said he told the group of frustrated diners: 'If you come in the kitchen you'll confuse me and I won't cook for you.' He also claimed he was pushed up against a 200c oven when he stabbed one of the men. 'I was next to the oven, where we cook the breads. I'm holding the skewer that we cook the chicken with. I had the skewer in my hands when he pushed me, I said you are not allowed to touch me. 'I was nearly going to fall on the oven,' The Daily Telegraph reported him as telling court.","Mati Rahman, 45, handed five month good behaviour bond after magistrate heard he was provoked .

"A Sydney 'jihadist' has bragged about fighting on the frontline in Syria by posting a video of himself firing a machine gun out of a bombed out building in the war torn country. The short clip of the former Bankstown local - who calls himself Ahmed Shaheed III - is believed to have been filmed by Ismail Jabbar - a Muslim extremist recently dubbed the 'British Bin Laden'. In the video, which is accompanied by the caption 'Shooting at the Kuffar messing around with @jabz_26', laughter can be heard as he fires multiple rounds out of a sandbagged bunker. It is understood @jabz_26 refers to Ismail Jabbar, who is being monitored by MI5 and UK police. Jabbar has been using a Twitter account with the handle @jabz_26. Elsewhere on Facebook, Shaheed refers to the radical as 'my friend'. Scroll down for video . Fire in the hole: In a recent video, 'Ahmed Shaheed III' can be seen firing off rounds at his enemy and laughing with his mate - believed to be a man dubbed the 'British Bin Laden' Radicalised: 'Ahmed Shaheed III' is a Sydney man waging jihad in Syria who 'admires' September 11 and boasts about having tonnes of TNT at his fingertips . The video is one of many alarming posts on the Facebook account of the former student of Bond University in Queensland. Do you know who Ahmed Shaheed III is? Email this reporter on Taylor.Auerbach@MailOnline.com . However he is still not game to reveal his true identity by blurring his face in photos, wearing obscure masks and using the alias 'Ahmed Shaheed III', meaning 'martyr'. Contacted by MailOnline, he claimed Ahmed Shaheed III was his real name, however Muslim leaders believe it is an alias. 'It was either I come to Syria or ASIO takes my passport and I (hijack) a gas tanker and blow up Kings Cross,' he said. 'If you want to continue living in peace I would suggest you tell ASIO taking passports off Muslims who wanna come here is stupid and putting you Australians at risk.' Australian government authorities have been alerted to the man's worrying social media diatribes, in which he also reveals he 'admires' the Al Qaeda terrorist attacks on America on September 11 2001. Despite hiding behind a cloak of anonymity, 'Ahmed Shaheed III', who traveled to Syria to join a vicious civil war that has so far claimed nearly 250,000 lives, likes to keep his friends in the loop. Dangerous path: Shaheed has seemingly become more extreme during his time on the war front and has joined up with a man dubbed the 'British Bin Laden' Frightening arsenal: One of the weapons Shaheed has been using furing his 'freelance' work as a holy fighter in Syria . In a series of sickening posts, Shaheed is providing a running commentary on the war front - backed up by vision of him laughing as he fires machine guns at his 'infidel' enemies. Late on Sunday night he wrote to his large following back home in Australia and abroad that the war had made him truly appreciate 'how good' the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11 2001 were. 'I always admired September 11, but it was only until after i came to jihad I fully realized how good of an ameliyah istishadiah (martyrdom operation) it was,' he wrote. Shaheed's first post - a blurred out photo of himself holding a bazooka in the Syrian desert - was made on February 22. The content of his feed has become increasingly more alarming in the months since. Commenting on his 'martyrdom operation' on May 23, he gloated about the massive amounts of explosives he has at his fingertips during the complex conflict waged between government and rebel forces. 'I am not doing anything less than 15 tonne TNT and 5 tonnes of shrapnel,' he wrote. Fun and games: Alongside this photo of a devastating handheld weapon, Shaheed wrote 'say hello to my little friend' View to a kill: In this video, a British voice can be heard telling Facebook followers to get off their computers and join the fight . Shaheed has shared a number of confronting photos of his weapons including a rocket launcher and four huge shells, alongside which he wrote 'Say hello to my little friend'. The former Bond university student posted a bizarre video earlier this year, as revealed by MailOnline, in which he shot a round of tracers into the distance while wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. But he appears to have become even more radicalised since. War broke out March 2011 . Overall deaths 240,000 . Foreign civilian deaths 900-1900 . Main government forces Syrian Armed Forces, National Defence Force, Ba'ath Brigades . Main rebel forces Islamic Front, Free Syrian Army, Syria Revolutionaries Front . In another video he is seen shooting through a tiny hole in a Syrian building while a man with a British accent speaks from behind the camera. 'We're here in Syria, while you're at home on Facebook talking about this and that, seriously need to make a move instead of keep talking,' the man can be heard saying. 'The enemy is right in front of us. We're going to be popping while you're sitting at home Facebook typing.' It is unclear if the British man holding the camera is 22-year-old Ismail Jabbar, a London-born former shop assistant at department store House of Fraser who has also shared shocking content from the Syrian war front, including photos of beheaded victims. Shaheed describes himself as a 'freelancer' - not tied to any specific warring group but on a sustained mission against the secular forces in the Syrian conflict. In a post on Monday morning he wrote: 'I love the fact I never have to worry about working again, plenty of TOW missiles here for the taking'. Next to a photo of one of his many guns he wrote: 'learned all the theory of sniping with the draganov(PSO1 scope). time to practice blasting kuffar to the next world.' Australian Muslim leader Keysar Trad said: 'Shaheed means martyr, very likely to be an adopted title. 'His comments about September 11 fly in the face of all moderate Muslims and all the experts who have denounced this terror attack.' In a statement to MailOnline, a spokeswoman for the Attorney-General's department reaffirmed the government's concerns about Australians joining the bloody conflict. 'The Australian Government and Australian law enforcement and intelligence agencies don’t comment on intelligence matters or confirm who they are or are not investigating,' she said. 'The Australian Government is concerned about the radicalisation of Australians as a result of the Syrian conflict, particularly those who return to Australia with the capabilities acquired through fighting or training with extremist groups. 'It is illegal under Australian law for any Australian, including dual citizens, to fight, provide funding, provide training, or supply weapons to either side of the conflict—instead, Australians can support civilians by donating funds to a legitimate UN humanitarian organisation. Masked assassin: Shaheed hid behind a Guy Fawkes mask as he shot a round of tracers into the Syrian wilderness . 'The Australian Government strongly advises Australians not to travel to Syria because of the extremely dangerous security situation, marked by ongoing military conflict, kidnappings and terrorist attacks.' Earlier this year Australian Attorney-General George Brandis reaffirmed his commitment to stemming the tide of Australians traveling to Syria to join the fighting and reminded extremists that the federal government has the power to revoke existing passports. 'One of the most pressing issues for Australia at the moment is the problem of Syria,' he told ABC Radio. 'The Syrian civil war has become as it were a theatre for a massive escalation of activity by people who are not friends of the west. There is training going on there is facilitation.' It is estimated that between 150 and 200 Australians have flocked to the war torn country.","Ahmed Shaheed III is a Sydney man who has joined the fighting in Syria .

"Synthia Nath thought she was a winner at the Face Of Beauty International awards. That was until organisers told her there had been an 'honest mistake' and that 'another Indian girl' had actually won the pageant category for most photogenic. In an embarrassing series of events, the New Zealand Herald reports that the 19-year-old Fijian native was first told to raise $3000 to travel to Turkey for the Miss Globe International pageant after winning her local crown at the Face Of Beauty International event in Papakura on May 10.

Ms Nath had already spent $1000 on her dress and entry fee and told Face Of Beauty executive Milagros Manuel she couldn't afford the $3000 for flights. She was reportedly told to 'give the crown and sash back' if she couldn't raise the cash. Shortfall: Ms Nath was originally told she had to raise $3000 to attend the next round of competition in Turkey .

"Two brothers and their father accused of stabbing a teenage boy and his sister with a screwdriver will remain behind bars after magistrate Elaine Truscott denied them bail in Bankstown local court today. The trio is alleged to have used knives and a screwdriver in a 'barbaric' daylight stabbing attack on Sunday afternoon. Brothers Husein Al-Moosawy, 21, Sajjad Al-Moosawy, 23, and their father Haider Al-Moosawy, 47, fronted court on Monday charged with wounding with intent to murder. Grissly scene: Two brothers and their father are alleged to have stabbed a 16-year-old boy and his sister with knives and a screwdriver in a residential street in Yagoona . The court heard the trio's alleged attack occurred on Sunday afternoon outside their neighbour's home in Yagoona, in Sydney's southwest. Magistrate Truscott told the court the 16-year-old alleged victim, who can't be identified, and his 24-year-old sister were visiting the house next door to the Al-Moosawy family, AAP reports. According to police facts heard in court, the Al-Moosawy's mother began abusing the 24-year-old after she pulled up at the home. The 16-year-old stood between the two arguing woman before Husein, Sajjad and Haider came out of their home. Police allege Husein and Sajjad held knives and Haider wielded a screwdriver. The 24-year-old was pushed to the ground and Haider allegedly stabbed her in the eye with a screwdriver. Violent frenzy: One of the men involved in the stabbing that led to four people being injured is transported to hospital . Crime scene: A crime scene was maintained into the night outside this Yagoona house, where the stabbing is alleged to have taken place . The father is also charged with stabbing the woman's 16-year-old brother with a knife three times. Sajjad and Husein allegedly pushed the 16-year-old on the ground and repeatedly stabbed him in the back and legs. This morning, police said in a statement the 16-year-old suffered 'seven stab wounds to his stomach, left forearm, left thigh, chest and back. 'The boy’s 24-year-old sister was also transported to Liverpool Hospital after sustaining a seven-centimetre cut to the left side of the head, a stab wound to the left armpit, a stab wound above right knee, and small cut to her left eyelid.' Brutal: Burwood magistrate Elaine Truscott described the alleged attack as 'barbaric' Both the 24-year-old woman and her younger brother remain in hospital with serious injuries. Husein made an application for bail but Ms Truscott ordered he stay behind bars after labeling the alleged assault barbaric. 'There is no court order that can prevent such barbary being committed again...' AAP reported Ms Truscott as telling court. Haider and Sajjad did not not apply for bail.

"The sister of murdered Lone Wolf bikie Neal Todorovski has confronted her brother’s killer in a dramatic courtroom scene. At a sentencing hearing for convicted killer Tarek Abdallah in the NSW Supreme court on Thursday, the slain bikie’s sister Elizabeth Dimoski said his death in Sans Souci rips her heart to pieces every day. She stared at Abdallah as she told him his ‘heartless and dangerous actions’ destroyed the lives of those who loved her brother. Slain: Bikie Neal Todorovski (pictured) was shot dead in Sans Souci in January 2012. On Thursday his sister confronted the culprit in a tense courtroom stare down . ‘(They) left me feeling like I too was there lying on that cold, hard ground alongside my brother, with both our brains and our blood pouring out of our heads and our bodies,’ she told the NSW Supreme Court. In March, Tarek Abdallah, 27, was found guilty of shooting Todorovski dead in broad daylight in January 2012. He had pleaded not guilty to both the murder of Neal Todorovski and to the charge of shooting with intent to murder the bikie’s associate John Leger, arguing that he had acted in self-defence. He was convicted of the Lone Wolf’s murder but found not guilty of the second charge. Callous: The Lone Wolf (left with girlfriend) was murdered by Tarek Abdallah (right) ‘The only difference is my brother's pain died with him that day. But me? I still feel that pain like brain-shattering bullets going through my head and my heart, ripping it to pieces every day,' Ms Dimoski said. ‘All because you were angry.’ She reportedly clenched and unclenched her fists as she delivered the harrowing statement, stopping on multiple occasions to compose herself. She could be heard crying outside as Abdallah's barrister David Dalton SC argued his client had acted in self-defence. Mr Dalton told the court Abdallah unleashed a ‘volley of shots’ in fear for his life. Sorely missed: The bikie's sister told court his death had devastated those who loved him . The court had previously heard Mr Todorovski and Mr Leger went to Sans Souci with knuckle-dusters and a gun and had been out to get Abdallah after the 27-year-old's attempts to patch up a misunderstanding failed. The murder victim and the gunman were earlier involved in an intense street fight in which Abdallah smashed Todorovski's head on the pavement, causing him a broken eye socket. Police later intercepted a call between Todorovski and his friend in which he described the fight in graphic detail. '(Abdallah) bashed my head against the concrete,' he told friend Michael Why. 'It was game over for me'. In the murder trial, Crown prosecutor Paul Leask said Mr Todorovski was first shot twice in the back by Abdallah and fell to the ground. Abdallah then put a bullet through his skull, he said. He said the victim was still alive when ambulances arrived. Mr Leask ask Justice Stephen Campbell to take into account the ‘callousness’ of Abdallah's crime when considering his sentence, due to be handed down next month. Ongoing pain: Blood spatters at the scene of Neal Todorvski's murder, which still haunts his grieving family .","Tarek Abdallah shot the Lone Wolf bikie dead outside his Sans Souci home .

"The Australian man who drowned at the weekend off a luxurious resort in Fiji has been identified as 37-year-old Melbourne tourist Benjamin John Busbridge. A Fijian police source told MailOnline Mr Busbridge died of 'asphyxiation due to drowning' and that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding the man's death. He added that the investigation into the drowning had concluded. Trouble in paradise: Benjamin John Busbridge, 37, drowned on Saturday night while snorkeling near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji . It is believed Mr Busbridge drowned on Saturday night after venturing out for a lone snorkeling trip near the Outrigger on the Lagoon resort in Fiji's Viti Levu island. He was last seen walking along the beach on Saturday afternoon. The alarm was raised when he failed to return his snorkeling gear to the resort that night. His body washed up on a coral reef about 1.5km from the resort at 9.50am on Sunday. The resort's general manager Peter Hopgood told MailOnline Mr Busbridge had been staying with a female guest - named by police as Melbourne-based Taiwanese national Hsu Yen Chun  - and that she had since checked out. Mystery drowning: How Mr Busbridge drowned remained unclear. He had only booked one night's accommodation at the Outrigger resort . He said he was waiting on the coroner's report before making further comment. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware of the incident and was working with local consular officials to have the man's body returned to Australia. The Outrigger on the Lagoon resort offers some of Fiji's finest and most exclusive accommodation, with weekend rooms starting at $240 per night. Mr Busbridge and his female acquaintance had only booked one night at the resort - a popular destination for Australian tourists roughly 80km from Nadi. His death comes just days after Sydney father-of-three Mark Hardaker died in a collision between two boats while holidaying with his family in Fiji on May 15.

"It's the chum of all fears. One of the most notorious spots for shark attacks on the Australian coast just got a whole lot more dangerous. Beaches along the tourist mecca strip of the Sunshine Coast have been targeted by people removing baited hooks from drum lines and the activity is 'putting lives at risk'. Scroll down for video . Men in grey suits: Queensland's chief shark ranger warns lives are at risk after baited hooks were vandalised . Jeff Krause, boss of the Queensland government's shark control program, said 18 drum lines - designed to snare sharks and keep them away from swimmers - have been targeted off Yaroomba and Currumundi over recent weeks. 'It appears that someone, or a number of people, have purposely gone out to the drum lines with the intention of removing the hooks,' Mr Krause said. 'This is very dangerous and illegal, and compromises the effectiveness of the shark control program putting lives at risk.' Asked if conservationists were the likely suspects, Mr Krause said: 'We are unsure of who is taking the hooks so will continue to monitor the equipment.' A spokeswoman for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry said it is the first time shark control devices had been tampered with in this way. Trouble in paradise: Yaroomba Beach was one of the surf spots targeted by bait snatchers . The offence carries with it an on the spot fine of $1100 and a maximum fine of $55,000. 'We have shark nets and drum lines positioned approximately 300–400 metres offshore at 85 popular beaches at 10 regional centres in Queensland. Installed off popular swimming beaches, drum lines consist of a floating drum (or buoy) with two lines attached. One line is anchored to the sea floor and another is fitted with a baited hook used to snare predatory sharks. They are controversial devices and many conservationists have campaigned against their use. 'While the shark control program does not provide a permanent barrier between swimmers and sharks, it is effective in reducing the overall number of sharks in the area, making it a safer place to swim.' The most recent fatal shark attack in Australia lead to the death of 63-year-old Tathra woman Christine Armstrong, who was killed by a shark off her home beach in April. However, Queensland remains by far the most attack-prone state in the country with 67 fatalities and 126 injuries in the last 100 years. New South Wales is second with 47 deaths. Australia trails only America in number of fatal unprovoked shark attacks and Great White Sharks are the species responsible for most deaths by far. People who see vandals attempting to remove bait from drum lines are encouraged to call the 24 hour 'Fishwatch Hotline' on 1800 017 116.","State's chief shark ranger warns lives are at risk .

"Justice: Tanilla Warrick-Deaves was brutally bashed to death in 2011 by her stepfather Warren Ross. Today the cowardly killer was sentenced to 40 years in jail. Murdered toddler Tanilla Warrick-Deaves was forced to run laps until she dropped, hit, whipped and thrust under a cold shower before she was beaten to death by her stepfather Warren Ross. And in heartbreaking detail, courts heard how Ross abused the cute and cheerful little girl because he thought she was taking too long to learn toilet manners. Ross will spend at least 30 years behind bars after he was sentenced on Friday for the brutal murder of the two-year-old. Ross, 31, was sentenced to a maximum 40-year term and will not be eligible for parole until September 2041, due to time already served. Few would disagree with the severity of the sentence, with startling details about Tanilla's tragic and short life revolting many in the community as the case unfolded. Warren James Ross killed his stepdaughter at their Watanobbi home on the NSW Central Coast in August 2011 after beating and torturing the defenceless toddler. His inexplicable and callous motive was apparently over Tanilla's tardiness with toilet training. The 31-year-old whipped her with various implements including an electric cord and a belt, and deliberately dropped a heavy tool box on her tiny hand. Tanilla's mother Donna Deaves watched as Ross inflicted the fatal injuries on her daughter. Ross and Deaves had been in a relationship for about two months when he began hurting Tanilla. Deaves was last year sentenced for at least nine years over Tanilla's manslaughter. Ross was found guilty of the shocking murder last year, in a case that shocked Australians around the country. During Friday's sentencing, Ross reportedly rolled his eyes and waved at family members while terrifying details of his late stepdaughter's final days were read out. A packed court had to be controlled by public order and riot police as Justice Stephen Rothman handed down the lengthy sentence. Neighbours reported hearing her screams as she was repeatedly punished inside her Central Coast home. Scroll down for video . Disgraceful: Court heard that child killer Warren Ross (pictured leaving court today) showed no remorse for his shocking actions . Slammer: Warren Ross (pictured) will remain behind bars for at least 30 years over the brutal murder of his two-year-old stepdaughter Tanilla . Judge Rothman said that Ross, high on marijuana, held Tanilla under a cold shower and told her 'You don't s*** in my house - you are an animal', before banging her head into the shower screen twice, ABC reported. Justice Rothman said the toddler's death came as a result of 'severe corporal punishment' and that her killer had shown no remorse. Despite the brutality and callousness of the murder, Ross was not handed a life sentence. Heartbroken: Adrian Warrick (left) told the court how his daughter's death had left him devastated . Tanilla's heartbroken father - who has his daughter's name tattooed on the inside of his right arm - earlier told the trial how her death had devastated him. He said: 'There is not enough words to express this heartache and pain I feel every day since that morning,' according to the ABC. 'I can only imagine her final two days and the fear she had being hit, smacked, whipped, made to run laps till she couldn't stand no more, being held over the toilet and having the final blow with her head being hit in the shower. 'I have nightmares, sleepless nights, things will never be the same.' When today's sentence was read out, the mother of Warren Ross exclaimed: 'I'll be dead. What about the kids?'. Never forgotten: A friend of Tanilla's father shows a customised support t-shirt outside court on Friday . Earlier, Ross mouthed and gestured at Tanilla's father Adrian Warrick as the court heard the child killer had been bashed inside jail because of the cowardly murder. Ross shouted 'see ya later Adrian' as he was led out of the dock to begin his four decades behind bars. The judge ruled that the murder was not premeditated and therefore not in the most serious category of killings. He added: 'No person with a modicum of humanity could fail to be moved by this murder.' Devil in green: Ross has reportedly been targeted by fellow inmates in jail due to his cowardly crime .

"Every man and his dog loves a nighttime stroll - but you're out of luck if you're blind in Brisbane. Visually impaired people in the Queensland capital have effectively been placed under a curfew, with the city's audible traffic crossing signals switched off overnight to appease residents who say the pings are too loud. Graeme Innes, the legally blind Australian Disability Discrimination Commissioner, says he felt restricted during a recent trip to the city. Unfair: Legally blind Australian Disability Discrimination Commissioner said he felt like he was under 'curfew' in Brisbane with audible traffic signals switched off overnight . The Brisbane City Council, the country's largest, has angered Innes, after they switched off pings at intersections between 9.30pm and 6.30am to satisfy CBD residents unhappy about the noise. Mr Innes was in Brisbane at the weekend for a meeting about information services for the blind and vision impaired. 'Effectively we were on a curfew because at 9.30 at night the audible traffic signals are turned off and they don't go back on until 6.30 in the morning,' he told ABC radio. 'If we were out later than that at night, or up and about before 6.30, which I often am because I take my guide dog for a walk, we didn't have the benefit of signals to cross roads.' Curfew: The pings go silent in the Brisbane CBD between 9.30pm and 6.30am . Mr Innes says he's never come across the situation in other capital cities, and residents must know there's an element of noise associated with living in CBDs. He also noted traffic signals contained sensors which reduced the level of sound at quiet times, such as at night. Deputy Mayor Adrian Schrinner said signals generally were switched off in the CBD between 9.30pm and 6.30am, as part of an effort to balance the views of residents with the needs of pedestrians. But he said the council was happy to modify the hours of operation based on requests and demand. Noise pollution: Residents complained the sounds made by pedestrian crossing signals were too loud . 'Whenever we receive a request we'll do a review. In February we received a request for extended hours at about four or five CBD intersections and as a result those intersections are now operating 24-hours a day,' Mr Schrinner told the ABC. Asked why the council shouldn't have signals running around the clock, Mr Schrinner said: 'It comes down to balancing the demands of use of those intersections with the concerns of residents as well.' 'Where there's a need for it, where there's facilities operating late into the night, absolutely you can see the rationale for it,' he said. Compromise: The deputy mayor of Brisbane, Australia's largest council, said 'four or five' CBD intersections now boast 24-hour audible signals .","Road crossing pings switched off between 9.30pm and 6.30am in Brisbane .

"Ground breaking: Male model Andrej Pejic lands his first Elle cover . He is the wildly successful male model that even Kate Moss has described as ‘beautiful.’ Now Andrej Pejic can add Elle cover ‘girl’ to his vast list of achievements as he graces the cover of Serbian Elle’s January issue. The controversial model, who has hit the catwalk dressed as both sexes, is the first transgender model ever to be on the cover of Elle. Dressed entirely in Jean Paul Gautier, the shoot features Andrej as both a man and a woman. Perhaps in a symbolic representation of his real life gender struggle, ‘female’ Andrej, dressed in black lacy lingerie and suspenders, wrestles with ‘male’ Andrej who wears a variety of dark suits. Andrej, who has appeared in other high fashion magazines including French Vogue, is a muse of Jean Paul Gautier who provided all the clothing for the ground-breaking shoot. Significantly the magazine is for Andrej’s home country of Serbia. Pejic fled to Australia as a political refugee when he was eight following the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia. Responding to controversy over his feminine looks in the past he told New York magazine: ‘My gender is open to artistic interpretation. 'I don’t really have that sort of strong gender identity - I identify as what I am. The fact that people are using it for creative or marketing purposes, it’s just kind of like having a skill and using it to earn money.' Andrej Pejic admits keeping up with his female colleagues is tough in terms of physique, but he manages to maintain his 25 inch waist through strict diet . The constant controversy surrounding him has done nothing to slow down his career. The 21-year-old is in high demand and was even chosen to model for a lingerie campaign last year. Andrej's lack of cleavage did nothing to hinder his appeal: in the poster, for Dutch department store Hema, the model advertised a push-up bra. Andrej's lack of cleavage did nothing to hinder his appeal: in the poster, for Dutch department store Hema, the model advertised a push-up bra . He has also hit the catwalk to model wedding dresses for Rosa Clara, looking every inch the feminine bride. An 'industry term' has even been invented after him: The 'Andrej Pejic effect' refers to male models who use make-up or have androgynous appeal. Andrej Pejic has graced other magazine covers previously and was crowned 'model of the moment'' by Canadian 'Fashion' magazine last year . But it's not all fun and games for Pejic, who admits he has to work hard to maintain a woman's figure. He told Grazia magazine: 'To do womenswear I have to be disciplined. My waist has gone from 29 to 25 inches, my hips are 35 inches.' Behind the scenes at the Elle photo shoot: .","Andrej Pejic, 21, has taken the model world by storm with his androgynous look .

"Rugby league legend Mal Meninga said his family will do everything they can to put his brother Bevan on the right track after he served out his sentence for the murder of Cheree Richardson. Bevan Meninga walked free from jail this morning after serving almost 23 years behind bars for the murder of the Sunshine Coast teenager. The 42-year-old was eligible for parole in 2005 but was kept in custody on a low-security prison farm, Palen Creek Correctional Centre, at Rathdowney. 'We're very pleased this day's come,' Mal Meninga told reporters. Scroll down for video . Murderer Bevan Meninga was released from Palen Creek Correctional Centre in Rathdowney . 'Obviously we don't condone his actions but we understand that he's very remorseful towards the family of the victim. 'As a family, all we can do is support him. All we can do is be around and make sure he's well looked after and make sure he's doing all the right things. We'll stick by him. 'He's very disorientated at the moment. It's a surreal experience for him.' Bevan Meninga, who was released just after 5am on Wednesday, was 20 when he was sentenced to life in prison for attacking 19-year-old Cheree Richardson in 1991. He was locked up on May 24, 1991. Brother's joy: Mal Meninga said he is 'very pleased' his brother was released from jail . Authorities approved his parole application after his mother moved to Brisbane from the Sunshine Coast to provide him with a place to live, reported the Courier Mail. Mal Meninga said his mother was excited to have her son back at home. 'She's also very mindful of the fact that he has committed an awful crime, mindful of the fact that he's under strict guidelines from a parole point of view and mindful of the fact that we've got to make sure that Bevan's in a position to make a worthwhile contribution to society,' Mal Meninga said. 'It's a difficult time for everybody. Not only us but the victim's family as well. 'I know that there's an element out there in society probably wishes Bevan would stay in jail for the rest of his life.' The condition of his parole states that he cannot live on the Sunshine Coast where Cheree's family still resides . He will also undergo regular drug and alcohol tests after booze was found to be a factor in his brutal attack on 19-year-old Cheree, who was repeatedly hit with a tree branch. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said he hoped Bevan Meninga's family and friends would support him in his rehabilitation. 'He certainly has done the crime and done the time,' he said.

"This won't fly with patriotic bird watchers. Emus once farmed for their meat, oil and eggs have been left stranded in desperate conditions in India after local demand for the birds plummeted. In a sad state of affairs, the Indian emu industry has collapsed, leaving thousands of Australia's most iconic birds to roam the subcontinental wilderness without homes or purpose. Businessweek reports the local emu population in India has shrunk from 2 million in 2012 to just 800,000 after the market for the flightless avian species took a swan dive. Homeless and flightless: Shelters are being set up across India to care for thousands of emus abandoned after the local industry collapsed . By the end of the year, experts predict only 350,000 emus will remain in India. Many emus are now living in squalid conditions in shelters around India, the less lucky have been destroyed. Farmed for their meat, leather, eggs, and oil, emus became a popular commodity in India around five years ago but the industry never managed to soar to great heights. Hundreds of emu ranches were set up around India but too many birds and not enough room led many farmers to abandon their stock in the wild, Businessweek reports. The report cited ballooning feed costs and smaller returns for emu meat as the main reason behind the shrinking industry. Epidemic: Vets across India have been forced to treat hundreds of birds abandoned by farmers after the economic downturn . Beaks and troughs: The emu industry collapsed due to skyrocketing feed costs and falling meat prices .

"Socialite Tina McPhee, cofounder of drink company Juice revolution, will remain behind bars until at least 2023 after Adelaide judge Simon Stretton sentenced her this morning over 181 counts of 'callous', 'appalling' and 'extreme' fraud. Ms McPhee, 40, plead guilty to thieving from a number of vulnerable victims - including four children - and bagging nearly $3.9 million in the process. The former AMP financial adviser stole from a number of clients, including brain damaged car accident victims, while working as their trustee. 'Extreme' fraud: Juice entrepreneur Tina McPhee (left) was jailed for 13 years after defrauding her clients of nearly $3.9 million during her time as a financial adviser . Instead of using the money for the benefit of the people she was supposed to be working for, McPhee spent it on 'shopping sprees ', holidays to America and Europe, and 'massive amounts' of fashion and jewellery. She told court she experienced 'sexual difficulties' as a child, which the judge took into account in sentencing, but was slapped with at least a decade in jail (including time served since last July) for her slew of jaw-dropping crimes. 'It is difficult to conceive of a worse or more serious breach of trust than you’ve committed,' judge Stretton said in the Adelaide district court on Friday morning. 'You are a callous, dishonest, morally bankrupt woman whose behaviour is an affront to the principles of the trust you undertook to fulfill. Your actions are an affront to the victims themselves and to the community at large.' Earlier in the trial prosecutor Simon LePoidevin told court: 'She lived the life of Walter Mitty funded by the suffering of her vulnerable victims.' McPhee's sentence was reduced from 16 years to 13 years (10 years non-parole) due to her early pleas of guilty. Lavish lifestyle: McPhee squandered her clients' cash on trips to America and Europe and 'massive amounts' of jewellery . Pulped: The co-founder of Juice revolution is not eligible for parole until July 2023 . 'Your breaches of trust in the particular circumstances of this case were extreme,' said judge Stretton. 'The victims and the community expect that the law will do all it can to deter this kind of outrageously dishonest and amoral conduct, particularly where the victims are injured and defenceless people left without resources as a result.' Four of McPhee's youngest victims were awarded nearly $500,000 after their parents died in a car crash. 'Rather than act honestly as trustee, almost from the outset you embarked on a relentless calculated campaign to steal, misuse and dissipate the victims’ compensation moneys,' judge Stretton said of the theft of the children. McPhee has stared in a number of racy ads for her juice company, featuring the South Australian nude and covered only by apples and leafy vegetables.

"Fracking firms will be allowed to access vast reserves of underground gas without the permission of landowners under controversial laws being drawn up by the Government. Ministers are preparing an overhaul of trespass legislation to make it easier for firms to ignore objections. One source said the reform, which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners, was likely to be included in the Queen’s Speech setting out the Government’s plans for its final year. Anger: Police tackle protesters at Balcombe, West Sussex, who were objecting to a test-drilling site there . Chancellor George Osborne is offering generous tax breaks to kickstart the technology. He believes fracking for shale gas could herald an energy revolution that will boost the economy, make Britain more self-sufficient and put an end to sky-high bills from greedy energy firms. Scientists say the UK is sitting on deposits of enough shale gas to supply the whole country for at least 40 years, mirroring the North Sea oil boom of the Seventies. Shale gas development has taken off in the US, using the controversial process of fracking – or hydraulic fracturing. Underground gas deposits are extracted by fracturing shale rock with high-pressure blasts of water, sand and chemicals. Opponents warn that the process risks causing earthquakes, polluting water, blighting the countryside and affecting house prices. Shale gas exploration involves sinking . a vertical well and exploring out from it horizontally, often for more . than a mile. Environmental campaigners and residents have demonstrated . against fracking, clashing with police at well sites such as Balcombe, . West Sussex. Under current . law, firms need permission from owners of land over fracking tunnels. If . the owners object, a developer has to take them to court to overturn . their objections and agree compensation. Resistance: Police get to grips with another group of protesters at Balcombe last summer. The reform, which will infuriate anti-fracking campaigners, will make it easier to ignore local objections to drilling . Landowners in the US own any shale gas beneath their land, but in Britain it belongs to the Crown – or, in practice, the Government. Ministers are issuing licences for developers applying to sink exploratory wells. Typically, fracking involves horizontal exploration a mile or more from the central vertical well, meaning many different landowners could be involved. However, laws dating back to the mid-Sixties mean landowners must not withhold permission if drilling under their land is to go ahead. Developers are able to try to overturn any such objection in court, but judges would consider why permission was withheld and whether reasonable efforts have been made to reach an accommodation. They could order compensation be paid even if they overturn an objection and cases can take years to resolve, creating an obstacle to development. Greenpeace has started a campaign to get people in potential fracking sites to register objections to exploration under their land. Landowners in the Sussex Downs National Park, including City fund manager Marcus Adams, plan to use the existing law to block development. Mr Adams said: ‘People across the country have legitimate concerns about the impact of fracking, from water contamination to air and noise pollution. 'But all this happening in a national park just doesn’t bear thinking about.’ The reform of the law would extend the existing rights of water, gas and coal mining firms, set out in the Coal Act 1998, to go under people’s land without permission. Compensation of around £100 is likely to be offered to landowners. The revamp would also apply to the geothermal wells that harness heat from deep in the earth. Developers need to drill on land in urban areas, with one proposed project in Manchester likely to involve exploration under 5,000 homes. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said: ‘Operators prefer to agree through negotiation with the landowner, but there is an existing legal route by which they can apply for access where this can’t be negotiated. We’re considering whether this is fit for purpose.’","Scientists say UK is sitting on enough shale gas for 40 years' supply .

"Britain is rushing vital technical equipment to Australia after a major breakdown in the specialised vessels being used to search for the missing flight MH370. The under-sea search vehicle known as Bluefin-21 and the high-tech ship Ocean Shield have suffered the same fate as the missing Malaysian Airlines jet - a failure by their transponders to communicate with one another. The transponders on the Bluefin and the Ocean Shield have to be able to communicate as they respectively search the bed of the Indian Ocean and the surface. It came as Malaysia, China and Australia all agreed to re-examine all data related to missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 to better pinpoint the search area. Scroll down for video . Shooting blanks: The US navy's Bluefin-21 has been searching for MH370 with faulty hardware, it was revealed on Thursday . Malaysia's . acting transport minister said the three countries also agreed at a . meeting in Canberra last week to undertake a survey to map the ocean . floor and procure more deep-sea search vehicles and other equipment to . scour it. Minister . Hishammuddin Hussein told reporters in Kuala Lumpur: 'I have briefed . the Malaysia cabinet yesterday on the outcome of the meeting and it has . been deliberated. 'I now . have the mandate to announce that the details of the transition phase . have been approved by the Malaysian government,' he said. The Australian government has already been forced into an embarrassing admission that . equipment used in the mammoth hunt for the wreckage of flight MH370 has . been plagued by technical defects. The Boeing 777 disappeared from tracking systems 68 days ago, costing authorities around the world hundreds of millions of dollars. In . a statement released on Thursday by the Joint Agency Coordination . Centre, a federal government initiative set up specifically for the . MH370 search, it was announced that some of the tracking gear on defence . ship ADV Ocean Shield was flawed. Frustrating delay: ADV Ocean Shield can't redeploy its submersible until spare parts arrive from the UK . Location: The Australian Transport Safety Bureau had been scrutinising photos of the object, which washed ashore six miles east of Augusta in Western Australia state . It . comes as the Australian government dedicated $89.9 million in the 2014 . budget to continue the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean. The Government estimates that it will have spent $10million already by . June 30 this year, according to Australian Aviation. 'Examination . of the communications problem has established that a hardware defect . exists in the transponder mounted on the Ocean Shield and that a defect . may also exist in the transponder mounted on the Bluefin-21. This . inhibits the ability of the two devices to communicate with each other,' the statement read. Bluefin-21 . is a submersible vessel scouring the seabed off Western Australia for . any sign of the aircraft at the centre of one of aviation's most . perplexing mysteries. Faulty: The Bluefin-21 was damaged after colliding with a transponder on its mother ship . The . realisation at this point in the search process will add further . frustration and delay to the plights of the familes of 239 people on . board the flight who remain totally unaccounted for. 'Spare . parts for both defects will be dispatched from the United Kingdom. The . parts are expected to arrive in Western Australia on Sunday. 'Ocean . Shield is currently en route to Dampier, Western Australia, to receive . the transponder parts. The journey is anticipated to take a number of . days. At this stage, Ocean Shield is expected go alongside so engineers . can make a full assessment of the transponder repairs,' the statement . read. Bluefin-21 . was recently damaged while being hoisted back aboard the ADV Ocean . Shield. It is believed 20-knot winds caused the equipment to crash into . the side of the ship and collide with the transponder. As a result the acoustic communication links between the two pieces of hardware malfunctioned. The . seemingly cursed search for MH370 now includes personnel from . Australia, the People's Republic of China, Malaysia and the United . States. Operation headquarters recently relocated from Perth to Canberra. A sample image of how Bluefin-21 'sees' when it is deployed. This example shows what the site of two wrecked ships looks like . The 21-foot-long autonomous . underwater vehicle is designed for deep-sea surveying and is capable of . staying submerged for 25 hours at a time without refueling, scanning regions at a speed of two to three knots. Shaped like a torpedo, it can operate . almost up to three miles underneath the waves and is equipped with a . variety of sonar and cameras that can search and map 40 square miles of sea floor per day. It has only being deployed because it can not be used until a search . area is narrowed down. Bluefin 21 has a depth rating of 4,500m, meaning . it will be at its limit in the Indian Ocean search zone. Searchers . usually programme the propeller-driven vehicle with the coordinates for . a back-and-forth search that has been compared to mowing a lawn. First, the vehicle will survey the area with side-scan sonar. The sonar readings are stored in the robot's removable memory, and retrieved once the sub comes back up to the surface. If . the sonar scan turns up objects of interest, the Bluefin 21 would be . refitted with high-resolution cameras for a visual survey. The robot would have to dive closer to the seafloor for a concentrated survey of the target area. When the imagery is brought back up, it would be analysed to see if there is any sign of the blackbox. One . of the Bluefin 21's most recent claims to fame was its role in the . search for wreckage from Amelia Earhart's airplane, which disappeared in . the Pacific in 1937. Bluefin Robotics says its AUV can also be used for archaeology, oceanography, mine countermeasures, and unexploded ordinance.","Britain is rushing vital technical equipment to Australia for the search .

"Kenneth Bae arrived home after years of imprisonment in North Korea, expressing his gratitude to the US government for securing his release and revealing that his time there offered lessons. And his sister said he had one stipulation for his first meal back home: No Korean food. 'He said, ""I don't want Korean food, that's all I've been eating for the last two years,""' Terri Chung said Sunday outside her Seattle church. 'We had a late night eating pizza.' Scroll down for video . Homecoming: Kenneth Bae, center, who had been held in North Korea since 2012, is hugged after arriving Saturday at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington . Reunited: Bae, right, who had been held in North Korea since 2012, talks to reporters on Saturday. Looking on from left are Bae's brother-in-law Andrew Chung, his mother, Myunghee Bae, and his sister, Terri Chung . Bae and Matthew Miller, another American who had been held captive in North Korea, landed Saturday night at a Washington state military base after a top U.S. intelligence official secured their release. 'It's been an amazing two years, I learned a lot, I grew a lot, I lost a lot of weight,' Bae, a Korean-American missionary with health problems, said at Joint Base-Lewis-McChord Saturday night. Asked how he was feeling, he said, 'I'm recovering at this time.' Bae, surrounded by family members, spoke briefly to the media after the plane carrying him and Miller landed. He thanked President Barack Obama and the people who supported him and his family. He also thanked the North Korean government for releasing him. 'I just want to say thank you all for supporting me and standing by me,' Bae said. His family has said he suffers from diabetes, an enlarged heart, liver problems and back pain. Chung said Bae was in better shape when he arrived than his family expected. She said he had spent about six weeks in a North Korean hospital before he returned. 'That helped. As you know, he had gone back and forth between the labor camp and hospital,' she said. She said he was checked out by a doctor on the flight back to the United States. His plans for the near future include rest and food and reconnecting with friends and family. Neither his wife nor his children could make it back to Seattle in time for Bae's homecoming, his sister said. They plan to gather the whole family together for Thanksgiving, she said. Prisoner: Bae was serving a 15-year sentence for alleged anti-government activities. He was detained in 2012 while leading a tour group to a North Korea economic zone . Back in the US: Matthew Miller, center, seen Saturday, was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage after he allegedly ripped up his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum . Members of Bae's family, who live near the sprawling military base south of Seattle, had met him when he landed. His mother hugged him after he got off the plane. Miller stepped off the U.S. government aircraft a short time later and also was greeted with hugs. US officials said Miller of Bakersfield, California, and Bae of Lynnwood, Washington, flew back with James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. Clapper was the highest-ranking American to visit Pyongyang in more than a decade. Their release was the latest twist in the fitful relationship between the Obama administration and the young North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, whose approach to the U.S. has shifted back and forth from defiance to occasional conciliation. Bae was serving a 15-year sentence for alleged anti-government activities. He was detained in 2012 while leading a tour group to a North Korea economic zone. Miller was serving a six-year jail term on charges of espionage after he allegedly ripped up his tourist visa at Pyongyang's airport in April and demanded asylum. North Korea said Miller had wanted to experience prison life so he could secretly investigate the country's human rights situation. Bae and Miller were the last two Americans held captive by the reclusive Communist country. Last month, North Korea released Jeffrey Fowle of Miamisburg, Ohio, who was held for nearly six months. He had left a Bible in a nightclub in the hope that it would reach North Korea's underground Christian community. Speaking Sunday, Chung said her brother was staying with family members, and enjoyed visiting with his loved ones upon his return. Relief: Kenneth Bae greets his mother Myunghee Bae after arriving, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington . Family: Matthew Miller, left, is hugged by his loved ones upon his return . 'He was cut off from all of that for two years,' she said. 'His only contacts were his guard, and maybe doctors and a handful of times the Swedish embassy.' Chung said she was thrilled to have her brother home, and that 'he bears no ill will' over his ordeal. Although he still has warm feelings for the North Korean people, Chung doubted her brother would want to return to that country any time soon. He hasn't told them many details about his ordeal and Chung said she remains worried about her brother. The State Department called the family at about 2 a.m. Saturday to give them the news that Bae was coming home. They also received a call a few days earlier saying something might be happening, but Chung was reluctant to believe that message. 'There's been a lot of heartbreak and disappointment,' she said of the years of waiting for her brother's release. She thanked people around the world for their prayers and government officials and others for advocating for Bae's release. She also said former detainees and their families have been a source of comfort and support for her family. 'First and foremost we thank God,' Chung said, adding soon afterward, 'I have to thank President Obama.' President Barack Obama commented on the prisoner release Saturday, saying he is 'very grateful' that North Korea has released the last two Americans in its custody .","Kenneth Bae arrived home after two years of imprisonment in North Korea .

"Big-oil backed Arctic researchers are advertising for a hardy soul to work for them as a polar bear spotter in Siberia, in a move panned by environmental campaigners as an attempt at 'greenwash'. The Arctic Research and Design Center for Offshore Developments wants somebody to count the numbers of polar bears in the 20 to 25 different groups living around the ice-bound Kara Sea. The project is a joint venture between Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and ExxonMobil, the American multinational oil and gas corporation, to exploit fossil fuels locked beneath the Arctic ice. Count me out... Arctic researchers backed by big-oil firms ExxonMobil and Rosneft are advertising for an individual or team to count polar bears in the Kara Sea, in a move green campaigners have panned as 'ironic' For now, their research is concentrating around the sea off Siberia's frozen north-west coast. Well north of the Arctic Circle, it is covered by more than a metre of ice for most of the year. The job advertised by Rosneft and ExxonMobil is part of a $3.2billion exploration programme to work out how best to exploit the Arctic's natural resources. Surveys carried out by energy giants have shown that 6.2billion tons of oil and 14.6billion cubic metres of natural gas lie locked beneath the floor of the Kara Sea alone. As well as counting bears, the person who wins the post will also be expected to place electronic monitoring collars on up to 20 adult females. They also need to take blood samples from the bears so that laboratory tests can be carried out later. But only the brave and resilient need apply. Polar bears are one of the few mammals that will deliberately hunt humans for food. Good eyesight is a must to spot the white bears against the icy background. Winter temperatures in the area plunge to minus 46˚С. But although it includes working with animals for a species officially classified as 'vulnerable', the work may not suit conservationists. Ben Ayliffe, the head of Greenpeace's Arctic campaign, called ExxonMobil and Rosneft's Arctic research project 'obvious greenwash'. He said that their plan to hire a polar bear counter was 'ironic' given that the companies plan to drill in areas recognised as protected sites for the species. 'If you look at the deal struck by Rosneft and ExxonMobil the drilling blocks actually impinge on protected areas,' said Mr Ayliffe. 'In the Kara Sea the blocks that they will be drilling impinge on a supposedly protected Russian national park, an area that's supposed to be sacrosanct. 'In other regions they hope to drill later, one of the places - Wrangel Island - is actually a Unesco World Heritage site where polar bears breed. 'So it's ironic that they are advertising for polar bear spotters when they are actually planning to drill in the nursery for polar bears in the Arctic.' Mr Ayliffe added: 'The clear motive is a very thin veneer of green respectability on probably the most reckless drilling operation anywhere in the world. '[ExxonMobil] is the company responsible for the Exxon Valdez disaster, which it was the 25th anniversary of just yesterday.' The aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster 25 years ago: If a similar incident was to happen in the remote and inaccessible waters of the Kara Sea, it would make that spill 'look like a picnic', said a Greenpeace spokesman . In that incident an Exxon-owned oil tanker bound for Long Beach, California, struck a reef off Prince William Sound, Alaska, and bled as much as 750,000 barrels of crude oil into the northern Pacific in just a few days. Due to the inaccessibility of the region hampering clean-up efforts, the oil eventually covered 1,300 miles of coastline, and 11,000 square miles of ocean, blighting a crucial habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds. 'If a spill happened up in the Kara Sea it would make the Exxon Valdez look like a picnic,' Mr Ayliffe said. So remote is the Kara Sea that its ecosystem is still relatively clean compared to oceans in lower latitudes, but the World Wide Fund identifies overfishing and oil and gas development as severe threats. In the Soviet era, it was also long a dumping ground for military and civilian nuclear waste. The successful applicant will be chosen at the end of March, so the applications need to be sent soon. MailOnline contacted ExxonMobil for comment, but had received no reply at the time of publication.","Project is joint venture between oil companies Rosneft and ExxonMobil .

"Media mogul Rupert Murdoch grinned broadly as he reached an 'amicable' divorce deal with his wife of 14 years Wendi Deng after only six minutes of negotiations, in which she they decided she will reportedly receive their New York home and he will get their California mansion. Mr Murdoch, 82, and a stoney-faced Wendi Deng Murdoch, 44, shook hands and briefly hugged after a brief proceeding in a New York  court. The couple said they were parting with 'mutual respect' after telling a judge they had reached a divorce deal. Scroll down for video . 'Amicable': Smiling media mogul Rupert Murdoch and wife of 14 years Wendi Deng, who was positively stoney-faced, are pictured outside court in New York today where they said they were parting with 'mutual respect' According to a report in the LA Times, Mr Murdoch will keep his Beverly Hills estate and his $28 million 16-acre Moraga Vineyards in the hills above Bel-Air. Meanwhile Wendi Deng will keep the three-floor penthouse apartment on Manhattan's fifth avenue which Mr Murdoch reportedly paid $44million for in 2004. The stunning property occupies the 14th 15th and 16th floors and is roughly 8,000 square feet with 20 rooms. The Murdochs reportedly spent a further $50million refurbishing the home which was once owned by Laurance Rockefeller.

The post claims 13 clubs have closed 'in the past couple of years', because of violence. The owner of Fridge Bar in Brixton has blamed violence in south London on black young people. She wrote in a post on Facebook, that 13 clubs in the capital have been forced to close as a result of the violence . The author of the post, who warned it was a 'controversial' message, said: 'The absolute majority of people who have disrupted theses venues are black men and increasingly some black women. 'There, I said it. It is true, I have witnessed it and there is both anecdotal and empirical evidence that what I say is true. 'I know some will say that it is a ""minority"" doing the damage but I disagree. 'The minority know that they have the support of the majority who fail to call them out when their behaviour becomes awful.'

"Obsessing over climate change is distracting politicians from dealing with floods and storms, experts warned yesterday. Trying to link all extreme weather to man-made global warming ‘has been a social and policy disaster’, they said. Instead, the focus should shift towards dealing with the impact of fierce weather, which will  happen regardless of climate change, argued David Schultz and Vladimir Jankovic. Scroll down for video . Scientists from the University of Manchester said climate change is distracting politicians from dealing with storms, when they should be trying to bolster flood defenses after seeing the effects of an incredibly wet winter. A man canoeing along the flood water in Timsway in Staines, London this February is pictured . The academics from the University of Manchester said flood defences must be given greater priority to avoid a repeat of the impact of this winter’s storms. In a paper published last night, they said the Government was too focused on cutting  greenhouse gases, which was crucial but would never eliminate devastating floods or powerful tidal surges. Senior politicians have been eager to link Britain’s severe floods to global warming. The Prime Minister said man-made climate change was ‘one of the most serious threats’ the country faced and that he ‘very much suspected’ it caused the floods in Somerset and along the Thames Valley. Labour leader Ed Miliband has described global warming as  ‘an issue of national security’ which would bring ‘more flooding, more storms’. And UN executive Christiana Figueres prompted fury when she said the floods had a ‘silver lining’ as they forced climate change on to the political agenda. But Professor Schultz, an expert in meteorology, and Dr Jankovic, a climate historian, said that it was almost impossible to link any one weather event to global warming. David Cameron (pictured left) told Parliament that man-made climate change is ‘one of the most serious threats’ the country faces, and that he ‘very much suspects’ it caused the recent flooding, while Ed Miliband (right) called global warming ‘an issue of national security’ that would bring ‘more flooding, more storms’ Senior politicians have clamoured in recent months to link Britain’s devastating floods to global warming. David Cameron told Parliament that man-made climate change is ‘one of the most serious threats’ the country faces, and that he ‘very much suspects’ it caused the recent disaster. Labour leader Ed Miliband called global warming ‘an issue of national security’ that would bring ‘more flooding, more storms’. UN climate chief Christiana Figueres sparked fury when she said the floods had a ‘silver lining’ because they forced the issue of climate change onto the political agenda. Trying to do so was ‘a distraction’, they wrote in the journal Weather, Climate and Society. Linking ‘climate change and high-impact weather events, although an interesting scientific question, has been a social and policy disaster’, they added. ‘The over-emphasis on “was this associated with climate change?” distracts from the issue that weather happens whether or not climate change  is occurring. ‘For most purposes, any change due to climate change is a less immediate concern than the impact of the weather itself. 'Society ought to do its best to protect the planet but society should also protect itself against weather disasters.’ Politicians wrongly thought cutting greenhouse gas emissions should be the main response, the authors said. They said this was important but governments should also focus on measures such as building flood defences. But Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics Grantham Institute said talking about climate change was vital. ‘Frankly it is dangerous to suggest that all we need to do is make ourselves resilient to weather extremes,’ he added. It was important ‘the public understands climate change is already occurring and the scale of the risk is huge’, he said. David Schulz and Vladimir Jankovi, climate experts from the University of Manchester, argue that flood defences must be given priority if the huge impact of this winter's storms are not to be repeated. Flood defences being built in Cockermouth, Cumbria are pictured in 2009 after water inundated parts of the town . Dr Saleemul Huq, of the International Institute for Environment and Development, agreed extreme weather was likely with or without climate change. ‘But I also think there is a strong case that such events may become more extreme due to climate change,’ he added. The Manchester paper comes a week before the latest report from the UN on climate change. Leaked drafts predict that the changing climate will cause severe flooding globally. Chancellor George Osborne announced an extra £140million for flood schemes in his Budget but this was dismissed as grossly insufficient by engineers. Professor Schultz said: ‘Reducing humanity’s impact on our planet should be pursued as a matter of urgency, but more emphasis must also be placed on being resilient to individual weather events, as this year’s storms in Britain have so devastatingly shown. ‘Linking high-impact weather events with climate change can be distracting; perpetuating the idea that reducing greenhouse gases would be enough to reduce increasingly vulnerable world populations, in our view, only confuses the public and policy-makers as to the socio-economic susceptibility to extreme weather. ‘With or without mitigation, there is no quick-fix, single-cause solution for the problem of human vulnerability to socio-environmental change, nor is there a reasonable prospect of attenuating high-impact weather. Addressing such issues would give the world an opportunity to develop a two-pronged policy in climate security, reducing longer-term climate risks in conjunction with preventing shorter-term weather disasters.’ Dr Janković said: ‘Avoiding construction in floodplains, implementing strong building codes, and in-creasing preparedness can make society more resilient to extreme weather events. But compounding the problem is that finding money for recovery is easier than spending on prevention, even if the costs of recovery are much higher.’ Experts disagree about whether climate change - which is often symbolised by a polar bear on melting ice (pictured) - or immediate mitigation measures to stop devastating floods are more important . Bob Ward, policy director at the London School of Economics Grantham Institute disagreed, and said talking about climate change is vital. ‘Frankly it is dangerous to suggest that all we need to do is make ourselves resilient to weather extremes without reducing greenhouse gas emissions,’ he said. ‘A sea level rise of a couple of centimetres will make storm surges much more devastating. ‘The important thing is that the public understands that climate change is already occurring and the scale of the risk is huge.’ The Manchester academics’ paper comes a week before the United Nations delivers its latest report on climate change. Leaked drafts of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report predict that the changing climate will cause flooding around the world, displacing hundreds of millions of people and destroying vast tracts of cropland. Dr Saleemul Huq, senior fellow of the International Institute for Environment and Development, said: ‘I agree that bad weather events are likely to occur with or without climate change but I also think there is strong case that such events may become more extreme in future due to climate change. ‘There is no real evidence that simply pointing out the links between possible future extreme weather events and climate change is the reason why investments in protection against such events have been reduced.’","Climate experts from the University of Manchester argue that flood defences must be given greater priority .

"The largest solar-panel plant in the world, built near the Mojave desert, has been blamed for blinding pilots flying over the California facility. The Ivanpah plant, in San Bernardino, uses 173,500 mirrors to reflect sunlight on to boilers, but despite its green credentials it has been criticized as a flying hazard. Two anonymous complaints were made to the Federal Aviation Administration in August last year, complaining of a 'blinding glare' coming off the plant. Bright: Pilots have complained about glare from the Ivanpah solar facility . The complaints came from a pilot who had taken off from Boulder City, and an air traffic controller working at a Los Angeles airport. Every day, dozens of flights pass . over the sprawling desert plant, which is under a flight path between . Las Vegas and southern California. A spokesman for the FAA told Daily Caller: 'The FAA is aware of potential glare from solar plants and is exploring how to best alert pilots to the issue.' In one of the complaints, the pilot . of a small transport plane described the glare from the mirrors, which . are the size of garage doors, as 'like looking into the sun'. The pilot and air traffic controller are not the only ones to have concerns about the plant. Environmental . groups are concerned about the impact of species such as the desert . tortoise, which lost habitat during the building of the 3,500-acre . facility, and birds injured by the intense heat given off by the . mirrors. The world's . largest solar plant however, is able to provide clean, green power to . 140,000 homes - the equivalent of taking 72,000 cars off the road. The plant's 173,500 mirrors, known as heliostats, reflect sunlight onto huge water towers, which are 459ft high - 100ft taller than the Statue of Liberty. Steam is produced which can power a turbine. As well as using a renewable power supply - the sun - the plant uses 95 percent less water than other thermal facilities. The pilot and co-pilot were 'distracted and momentarily blinded by the sun reflecting off of mirrors' the written complaint stated. 'In my opinion the reflection from these . mirrors was a hazard to flight because for a brief time I could not . scan the sky in that direction to look for other aircraft,' the pilot added. The air traffic controller also . warned of the dangers of glare, saying the tower received daily . complaints as pilots passed over the facility in the late morning and . early afternoon. 'On this particular morning, an air . carrier complained about the brightness and reiterated that it was ""nearly blinding"",' the controller said. 'I have no idea what can . be done about this situation, but being a passenger on an aircraft that . flew through this airspace and saw it for myself, I would say that . something needs to be done. It is extremely bright and distracting.' At . the time of the complaints, the facility was still being built. The . developer, BrightSource Energy was also in the process of 'testing and . calibrating' the mirrors. The $2.2 billion plant covers 3,500 acres near the Mojave desert and can be seen from the International Space Station, according to the SB Sun. It started generating power in December last year, and is capable of providing clean power to 140,000 homes. Massive: The plant, built in the Mojave desert, uses 173,500 garage-door sized mirrors to generate power . Intense: Mirrors at the world's largest solar facility are adjusted to track the sun . NRG Energy, which co-owns and runs . the plants, has been notified of the complaints and is due to release a . statement about it soon. An . impact study was carried out before work started at the plant, during . which pilots and air crew had raised concerns about glare. The . study was reported to have found that the plant could cause temporary . blindness to pilots withing 3,300ft of the mirrors, but the layout was . reconfigured to minimize the risk.","Air traffic controller tells FAA of daily complaints from those traveling over desert facility .

"Matthew Ames, who conned people out of their life savings and pensions using a fake conservation company, has been jailed for 40 months . A ‘green finance’ boss who hired the brother of the Duchess of Cambridge to promote a bogus rainforest protection scheme was jailed today. Matthew Ames, 38, cheated ethical investors out of £1.6m through fake green projects to fund his luxury lifestyle, including buying a Lamborghini sports car, Isleworth Crown Court heard. His business Forestry For Life, which netted over £400,000 by claiming to protect the Amazon rainforest, was represented by Kate Middleton’s brother James at a trade fair in London in 2010. Ames also hired England World Cup winner Jack Charlton and sport supremo Sir Rodney Walker to promote Forestry for Life and his other firm, the Investor Club, at events. The company director used glossy brochures including quotes from Prince Charles and Tony Blair to promote teak plantation schemes in Sri Lanka and investment in the protection of the Brazilian rainforest. But no land was ever purchased by Ames’ two companies and not a single tree was ever planted. He even swindled an elderly investor out of £75,000 for a fake tree scheme after claiming the teak market was outstripping that of gold and oil. Ames blew the cash on sports cars, flying first class around the world and staying in luxury villas in the Caribbean. A jury of six men and six women at Isleworth Crown Court found Ames guilty of two counts of fraudulent trading by majority verdict. Today, Judge Paul Dugdale sentenced the con-artist to 40 months imprisonment, saying: ‘You raised money from a number of members of the public, generally speaking those who had savings to invest. ‘They tended to be older but by definition people who have a lump sum to invest tend to be older. ‘What you did was put their savings at risk for your ends, when you had told them what you were going to do with their money. ‘You defrauded them. You told them they would get an immediate 12 per cent return when this was never achievable. ‘I find, from all of the evidence, that you knew it was never achievable and that the representation was simply not true. ‘Some of the money you received was also misused. It was used by you to borrow from the company to purchase an expensive Lamborghini sports car. Life of luxury: While investors were promised instant returns for their money, Ames was actually spending the funds on flashy items such as a Lamborghini sports car . ‘Many investors lost all of their life savings, many of the investors lost all the money they had invested in their pensions. ‘It is noteworthy that you did visit all of the investors that lost their money. ‘It is something that is to your credit but it remains the fact that the reason they lost the money was due to your fraud. ‘The sentence I would have passed was in the region of five years. I reduce that sentence to 40 months, that is concurrent on both counts.’ Ames, wearing a blue suit and carrying two large overnight bags in preparation for prison, remained emotionless as the sentence was passed. His mother and other family members watched on from the public gallery. Prosecutor Antony Swift pressed for a longer sentence, of four to five years, revealing the defendant is already the subject of a 13-year company directorship ban, imposed in 2013. But defence counsel Adam Budworth argued: ‘This was not a case when the defendant set out with a ‘boiler room’ as it were, with high-pressure sales techniques. ‘2009 to 2010 were desperate times for investors. I hope your honour won’t make Mr Ames a scapegoat of failings in the regulatory system that existed at the time. Mathew Ames (left) used celebrities, including footballer Jack Charlton (right) to lend himself credibility . ‘In short, my submission to your honour is that Mr Ames is not a bad man. He is a good man. ‘The sentence I am seeking from your honour is an exceptional sentence and - I know I have a high and vertiginous slope to climb - that is that your honour suspend this sentence [and] give him a very significant period of unpaid work. ‘He has four children and he is in the process of getting divorced.’ The barrister argued that his client should be allowed to continue work so he could repay his investors quickly. ‘He is able to return to work and earn £10,000 a month. ‘My submission is that the impact of sending this man to prison is to let him off lightly.’ Ames secured a total of over £1.1m in investments into the Investor Club following its launch in August 2008. Forestry For Life, set up in July 2009, took £400,000 from green investors by purporting to protect the Amazon Rainforest. James Middleton was photographed representing the green firm at a carbon trading exhibition in London in October 2010 - while Ames was under investigation by the Financial Services Authority. Mr Middleton had briefly worked with Ames for work experience after becoming involved in the development of Forestry For Life in June 2010. The company would offer investors carbon credits that would be used to plant trees and offset their carbon footprint, the court heard. But Forestry For Life was offering credits for rainforest it did not own and the firm rarely gave investors certificates or proof of purchase. Ames also offered punters high return rates of 15 percent a year on their original investment but returns were often late and not paid in full. Ames, who lived in this gated house in Thundersley, Essex, convinced one donor to hand over £75,000 of their savings after convincing them that the teak wood market was outperforming gold and oil . The jury heard that Ames used a Ponzi scheme to cover up the fraud by repaying first investors with new investors’ money. The company director was finally caught out following an undercover sting by the Basildon Echo in August 2010 in which a reporter was mis-sold carbon credits. The article led to the FSA investigating Ames’ firms - both run from a converted barn in Laindon, Essex. Both Forestry For Life and Investor Club were placed into liquidation in March 2011 with combined debts of more than £1.6m. Ames, the son of David Ames, 62, the boss of Caribbean property developer Harlequin Ames, was arrested in September 2011 following a referral from the FSA to City of London Police’s specialist fraud unit. Ames attempted to cover his tracks using a Ponzi scheme, repaying initial backers with money from new investors . Giving evidence Matthew Ames claimed he was ‘this close’ to selling his business to Barclays Bank before he was shut down by the authorities. The green finance boss told jurors that he was not able to plant 5,000 tree saplings in Sri Lanka because he could not secure the ‘right’ land. He also claimed that every penny of the tens of thousands of pounds that he invoiced his firms for on business expenses were ‘perfectly legitimate’. Ames spent investors’ cash on meals at the exclusive Ivy in the West End and at the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas, alongside stays at the Savoy, the Hilton, and the Mandarin Oriental - a five-star hotel in Hong Kong. He also invoiced Forestry For Life and the Investor Club for a stay at the Upper House in Hong Kong and tickets to a Manchester United game at Old Trafford. Jurors also heard of Ames’ boasts to potential ethical investors. In one April 2010 email he wrote: ‘You just caught me coming out of a Lamborghini after ordering my new one. ‘Had a meeting with you the other day and had much to discuss. ‘I’m opening a new office in Dubai alongside ones in Singapore, Dublin, and London and have travelled between India, Singapore, and London’. Harlequin has allegedly taken an estimated £300m from investors for 6,000 off plan hotel rooms and villas since 2005, but so far built just 300. The UK sales section of Harlequin went bust in April last year after several investors requested their money back. Ames, of Thundersley, Essex, denied but was convicted of two counts of fraudulent trading. A confiscation hearing will be held on 21 October at Isleworth Crown Court.","Matthew Ames, 38, cheated investors out of a total of £1.6million .

"The man, who called himself Abu Osama and spoke with a Northern English accent, claimed he had been training with militants in Syria. File photo . A British Jihadi who claims he is fighting alongside militants in Syria has said he will return to the UK when he sees 'the black flag of Islam' hanging over Buckingham Palace. The man, who called himself Abu Osama, said he had been taking part in military training, making bombs and . fighting with the extremist Al-Nusra Front, which is linked to al Qaida, . for the past year. Osuma, whose accent suggested he comes from . the north of England, claimed to have been fighting for the . establishment of a caliphate - which he referred to by the Arabic term . Khilafah - across the Islamic world. He told BBC 5 Live's Nicky Campbell: 'There is nothing in . Britain - it is just pure evil. 'If . and when I come back to Britain it will be when this Khilafah - this . Islamic state - comes to conquer Britain and I come to raise the black . flag of Islam over Downing Street, over Buckingham Palace, over Tower . Bridge and over Big Ben.' But he added: 'I have no intention of coming . back to Britain, because I have come to revive the Islamic Khilafah. I . don't want to come back to what I have left behind. Osuma said he initially faced opposition from his family over his . decision to go to Syria,saying: 'At first it was hard for them to accept, . because no mother wants to lose her son. 'But I send them photos and I . speak to them about the situation, and now they can understand that this . is a good cause I am in. 'They are a bit scared but I tell them we will meet in the afterlife. This is just a temporary separation. 'They said, ""We understand now what you are doing"", and my mother said, ""I have sold you to Allah. I don't want to see you again in this world"".' The comments were broadcast as religious leaders called on British Muslims not to travel to Syria and Iraq, amid fears of jihadis fleeing the country to take part in terrorism. An open letter signed by more than 100 imams from across major theological backgrounds has urged British Muslim communities 'to continue the generous and tireless effort to support all of those affected by the crisis in Syria and unfolding events in Iraq', but to do so 'from the UK in a safe and responsible way'. The comments come after Britons Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana appeared in this Isis recruitment video earlier this month encouraging others to fight . The . imams' open letter read: 'As the crisis in Syria and Iraq deepens, we . the under-signed have come together as a unified voice to urge the . British Muslim communities not to fall prey to any form of sectarian . divisions or social discord. 'Ramadan, . the month of mercy, teaches us the value of unity and perseverance and . we urge the British Muslim communities to continue the generous and . tireless efforts to support all of those affected by the crisis in Syria . and unfolding events in Iraq, but to do so from the UK in a safe and . responsible way.' Another British jihadist fighting for Isis in Syria sent his friends this chilling picture of home-made bombs - and warned that the UK government should be 'afraid' about him returning home . The letter comes during the Islamic festival of Ramadan, but against a troubling backdrop of tensions between the Middle East and the west. The situation has been underlined by US officials who have stepped up security precautions amid reports that two terror networks are working together on a bomb that could evade existing measures. Concerns have also been raised about homegrown involvement in terrorism after Britons appeared in a propaganda video for insurgent group Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (Isis). Among them was aspiring jihadi Aseel Muthana, who told the BBC he was fighting in Syria and had no intention of returning to the UK. His brother Nasser appeared with two other British men - 20-year-old Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Abdul Raqib Amin, who grew up in Aberdeen. In April, the Metropolitan Police issued a plea for people to come forward with information about their family members if they were concerned about them joining terrorist training camps in Syria. Qari Mohammed Asim, imam at Leeds Makka Mosque, who played a key role in organising the new letter, said: 'The scale of the humanitarian disaster in Syria and the escalating violence in Iraq calls for an unprecedented response. 'As we near the end of the first week of Ramadan our message is simple - we have come together to urge British Muslim communities not to fall prey to any form of sectarian divisions or social discord. 'Here in the UK we are Sunnis and Shias, brothers in Islam - and brothers in Britain too. The conflict in Syria and Iraq can never change that, no matter how bitter the fighting. 'We urge members of the community to echo this sentiment by adding their signature to this letter, joining the many others that have done so already.'","'Abu Osama' says he has been fighting with the radical Al-Nusra Front .

A Connecticut woman, one of thousands of terrified passengers trying to flee a sinking cruise ship off the coast of Italy survived the horror with only the clothes on her back. And she says she was one of the lucky ones. Melissa Goduti, 28, of Wallingford, Connecticut had boarded the ship only three hours before with her 55-year-old mother Maria Goduti when they said they felt a massive jolt. ‘All of a sudden, the boat leaned over on a 70-degree angle and everything just started falling, dishes were falling, trash cans were falling, everything was falling,’ Ms Goduti told the Hartford Courant by telephone. ‘Then the lights went out and everything was blacked out and then the lights back on.’ She said the short, traumatic voyage on the Costa Concordia was meant to celebrate her birthday. 'Everything I have is in that ship,' said Ms Goduti, listing her cell phone, passport and camera memory cards.

Solving the mystery: Italian Coast Guard personnel recover the black box from the ship, which should contain recordings of conversations between the crew members which may help in establishing the cause of the disaster . Meanwhile, their worried father and ex-husband watched helplessly from their home in Wallingford. David Goduti told the Courant that he felt helpless throughout the whole ordeal as he saw reports of the sinking ship. ‘It just rips your heart out is what it does,’ Mr Goduti said. ‘You don’t know what to think when they’re in another country and there’s nothing you can do to help.’ Once Ms Goduti and her mother found a lifeboat, they waited on deck for more than an hour as the ship continued to tilt at a more extreme angle. Ms Goduti said she felt lucky to be on the side of the ship closest to the water. Ms Goduti said the situation on the ship’s other side was a completely different story. ‘I could hear people jumping off the boat and into the water,’ she said. ‘I’m kind of like numb to it because I think I don’t even realise it actually really happened yet.’ Sinking fast: The Costa Concordia continues to sink lower as the search continues for dozens of missing passengers . Lucky: Ms Goduti and her mother were on the port side of the ship, which leaned in toward the water as it sank, allowing their lifeboat to be launched safely . The terrifying, chaotic escape from the luxury liner was straight out of a scene from ‘Titanic’ for many of the 4,000-plus passengers and crew. At least six people are confirmed dead and 16 are still missing. But late on Saturday, nearly 24 hours after the accident, a South Korean couple on their honeymoon were rescued. Also on the vessel was retired accountant Brian Page, 63, who had paid $1,300 for a seven-day cruise. He was enjoying a seven-course silver service dinner when disaster struck. He said: 'Soon everything was going everywhere – glasses, plates and cutlery. I was having to grip the table to stop it sliding away. The whole ship was rocking violently from side to side.' Speaking of the panic on board, he said: 'People were screaming. Women and children were not getting priority at all.' He added: 'I have lost everything including my passport. I only have the clothes I am wearing.' Where was the chivalry? Describing the panic on board, one passenger said there were people screaming and women and children weren't given priority .","Melissa Goduti, 28, was celebrating birthday with her mother Maria, 55 .

"At first glance, the web may appear to be an almost random mass of information. However, researchers say that in fact,there is a 'Kevin Bacon' effect - meaning any web page is connected to any other by just 19 clicks. The statistic echoes the famous 'Six degrees of Kevin Bacon' game, which claims anyone on Earth can be linked to the actor through just six people. The Opte project is one of several aiming to show the web graphically. In this image, based on 2005 data, red lines represent links between web pages in Asia, green for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, blue for North America, yellow for Latin America and white for unknown IP addresses. Estimates of exactly how big the web is vary dramatically because many pages are 'hidden' in services such as Facebook or in other private sites. However, according to the often quoted site worldwidewebsize.com, the most recent figure, as of Monday, 18 February, is 14.81billion pages. 'As the Web began to grow in the 1990s, it was thought that it most probably had the properties of a random network,' says Hungarian physicist Albert-László Barabási. The researchers originally determined this by constructing algorithms that collected all the links on a Web page and then followed them to their destinations, and repeating the process over and over again. His research, first published in Nature in 1999, has now been expanded and published in the prestigious Philosophical Transactions Of The Royal Society. His team found that in fact, any page on the web can be linked to any other via a surprisingly small number of clicks, known as the 'small world property'. It say 'that two nodes are likely to be connected, even in such a very large and sparse scale-free network as the Web, by a relatively short path of nodes—in the case of the Web, the path length is about 19,' said Professor Barabási. He claims the key to the web's fast expansion yet small 'Kevin Bacon . number' is the emergence of massive 'hubs' such as Facebook and Google. 'Such networks are in effect held together by a small number of highly connected hubs,' he writes. 'This scale-free property is an important organizing principle for the Web. 'Rather than virtually all nodes having more or less the same degree, . we should expect a few nodes to be very highly connected, and the vast . majority to have smaller degree than the average.' However, he warns that the system may cause problems should the 'superhubs' such as Facebook and Google be attacked by hackers. 'The flip side of this is that, in the event of a targeted attack, . where the most connected nodes are deliberately removed first, then the . network will be destroyed very quickly. 'This is the Achilles’ heel of a scale-free network,' he said. The first full Internet map created by the Opte Project in 2003 . Several projects have attempted to show the web as a single image, to give users an idea of what the connection actually looks like. One of the most impressive is the Opte Project, started by Barrett Lyon in 2003 to create publicly available visualizations of the web. 'This project was created to make a visual representation of a space that is very much one-dimensional, a metaphysical universe,' said Lyon. 'The data represented and collected here serves a multitude of purposes: Modeling the Internet, analyzing wasted IP space, IP space distribution, detecting the result of natural disasters, weather, war, and aesthetics/art. 'Today the image has been used free of charge across the globe and is part of the permanent collection at The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Boston Museum of Science.' In the map (pictured right), for example, red lines represent links between web pages in Asia, green for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, blue for North America, yellow for Latin America and white for unknown IP addresses. Although the most recent visualization is several years old, Lyon reports that he’s currently working on a new version of the project that will be released soon. 'When the time is right, I will release the new version of the project that I have slowly been building over the past five years,' he says on his web site.","Hungarian physicist claims that because of huge 'superhubs' like Google and Facebook, web pages are more connected to each other than expected .

"I am covered top-to-toe in a gloopy mess of tomato juice and mud. Pieces of tomato and tomato skin are stuck to my skin. There are infinite pips in my hair, ears, and various other crevices. I have just taken part in a La Tomatina-style fight in the far corner of the Glastonbury Festival site. This is where only the bravest of the brave venture, knowing that they will come out smothered - to face either ridiculous queues for a shower, or a day-long baby wipe session, afterwards. Yet I am laughing joyously like a child in a sandpit, safe in the knowledge that I will be heading back to my very own bathroom and incredibly comfortable double bed. Mayhem: Deni enjoyed a session of mud and mess in La Tomatina-style tomato battle . In the red: The tomato fight took no prisoners - everyone was left splattered and battered by fruit . In fact, in an ultimate act of smug rebellion, on arrival back at Snoozebox, the newest and closest pop-up hotel to the famous festival site, I decide to do a mud slide and get as dirty as possible. Because I can. The luxury of a fully-functioning private bathroom and plush bed is just one awesome perk that comes with staying in a Snoozebox at Glastonbury. The pop-up consists of around 30 adjoining compact rooms. They each feature everything you might need for a stress-free stay, including wifi, LCD TV, air conditioning and heating, en-suite wet-room with hot shower, personal safe, power sockets, fresh towels and sheets daily (thanks to a turn-down service), and complimentary toiletries. Outside, a paved pathway leads to a greenhouse-marquee structure that they call the 'social area' - basically a reception/breakfast room with tables, chairs and sofas perfect for catching up with everyone. There, you will find at least one or two chirpy and helpful staff, seemingly at any hour. A shelter from the storm: Snoozebox offers comfy accommodation for non-camping festival-goers . Comfy: Snoozebox suites have wet-rooms with hot showers, and come with fresh towels and sheets every day . Aside from providing great company, the Snoozebox team serve a hot breakfast each morning, ferry guests to and from the festival site in a swanky BMW at a phone call's notice, and are always on hand with any hot or cold snacks, booze or soft drinks that anyone requires – including prosecco and delicious Rebel Kitchen coconut mylks (perfect for a hangover). It is all included in the package. It should be, too. Those staying at Snoozebox for the full five days of the festival will be investing almost £2,000 for the privilege - but will save a considerable amount on food and drink (especially alcohol). The festival ticket is not included. I embrace the haven fully. Each day, I get up for breakfast, head out to the festival at around midday, head back to Snoozebox for a rest, snack and pre-drinks at around 5 or 6 - and dash back out to see some awesome music and creative arts at about 8 or 9. Even if you miss the 1.30am shuttle curfew, a cab back to the hotel is around £6, or a 15-20 minute walk up the road. It is worth bearing in mind that the site for the pop-up is based just outside the north-east corner of the (absolutely massive) festival site. So allow yourself a good hour to get from A to B. The distance strikes a fine balance between not-too-far-to-get-to and far-enough-away-for-some-genuine-privacy-and-peace. This makes it ideal for festival fans, artists and music professionals alike. Every now and again, somewhat surreally, I spot a face at breakfast who I will be watching on the Pyramid stage later that day. Hop in: Snoozebox staff ferry clients to and from the festival site in a swanky BMW at a phone call's notice . Furthermore, it seems that extensive walking is, in general, a done-thing at Glastonbury, wherever you may be residing. The size of the site is immense - and it needs to be to cater for the prolific and diverse stalls and entertainment on offer. There is an abundance of experiences, . aside from some of the finest music acts in the world. You . can easily ignore the bands entirely, but still have an awesome time. But in five days, it is impossible to explore the whole place, or see and enjoy everything fully - which is bittersweet. There is a circus, plus comedy and cabaret tents - where you find acrobats, jokers and dancers. Children's tents provide fun and games for the little ones, and you find hippies strumming guitars and embracing environmental issues at the Stone Circle and Greenpeace areas. A festival for all: Alternative entertainment includes circus, comedy, cabaret and children's tents . Suitably refreshed: Deni heads off to the festival site after another rest at Snoozebox . While Kasabian totally outdo themselves with a faultless headline set of back-to-back anthems, complete with a Noel Fielding cameo, I end up falling equally head-over-heels for an altogether more surreal area - the dark and very adult south-east corner. Shangri-La - or, more specifically, its sub-section Shangri Hell - is an installation staffed entirely by method actors. Mullet-haired bouncers at a metal club called 66Sick will only let you in if you know the best guitar amp to buy. Elsewhere, there are inked-up goths manning a dive called No Tattoo No Entry - who will only allow you access if, you guessed it, you flash them a tattoo. The best club is a . place called the HR Department, where a woman at front desk will ask . if you have an appointment, before letting you in. The DJ is dressed . like Richard Ayoade from the IT crowd doing paperwork between tracks. 'Staff' and ravers alike pass files and folders back and forth, and . every now and again the 'fire alarm' will go off, and everyone will be . 'evacuated'. Tat's magic: Festival-goers have to flash ink for access to certain areas of Shangri Hell . Club classic: At the HR Department, staff and ravers pass around files and folders as the fire alarm goes off . Great fun - but is is lovely to come home to cosy comfort after such a mad night. Despite the genuine pilgrimage of the walk it takes to get there, I end up making the journey three or four times, happy that I am burning off all those calories from the insanely delicious (though pricey - £7 for a chicken wrap, for example) festival food on offer. In letting you take time out from the festival site in the morning and evening, Snoozebox allows you to experience more, not less, of Glastonbury. The combination of hot food, comfortable rest, companionship and camaraderie recharges batteries to the point that you can keep going till 6 or 7am each night - all the way to Sunday. If you can stomach the price, there is no longer any reason to camp. Snoozebox (0845 092 0174; www.mysnoozebox.com) accommodation is now on sale for Glastonbury 2015, with a five-night bed and . breakfast package (24-28 June) costing from £1995 per room, based on two . sharing.

"Detained: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, was held last night along with his first mate over allegations of manslaughter and abandoning his ship . The captain of a cruise liner that ran aground with 4,000 passengers on board has been detained along with his first mate on allegations of manslaughter and abandoning his ship. Francesco Schettino was at least four miles off course when the Costa Concordia struck rocks off the island of Giglio, Tuscany, despite Italy's well-mapped sea lanes. One passenger has accused the captain of drinking in one of the ship's bars on the night the vessel ran aground, before taking control after the crash. Monique Maurek, 41, from the Netherlands, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'What scandalised me most was when I saw the captain spending much of the evening before we hit the rocks drinking in the bar with a beautiful woman on his arm. 'Most people didn't even have any idea of what the evacuation warning sound would be. 'It was only because some of us had already been on a cruise that we recognised that seven blasts of the horn was a signal to abandon ship.' Phil Metcalf, whose daughter Rose was one of the last people off the ship, said she had revealed the captain allegedly abandoned ship in the early stages of the evacuation, leaving his staff onboard. He told BBC Breakfast: 'Since the captain had left there was nobody, so everybody was left to their own devices hence some of the chaos, so obviously the crew took it upon themselves and decided in the absence of the captain to organise and try and help people.' Schettino told maritime investigators that charts showed he was in water deep enough to navigate and that he had struck an unidentified rocky outcrop of the island. Once the 52-year-old realised the extent of the damage he immediately tried to change route and head for the safety of Giglio harbour. But within minutes the vessel, owned by Costa Cruises, began to list dramatically reaching an angle of 20 degrees in just two hours. Off course: Investigators said the cruise ship was four miles from the normal shipping lanes when it struck a rocky outcrop off Giglio, Tuscany . The captain and his first office Ciro Ambrosio were detained last night at the police station in Porto Santo Stefano. Prosecutors . are investigating possible charges of multiple manslaughter and . abandoning the ship while passengers were still in danger. Schettino . was quoted by Italian news sources as saying: 'The area was safe, the . water was deep enough. We struck a stretch of rock that was not marked . on the charts. 'As far as I am concerned we were in perfectly navigable waters.' Francesco . Verusio, chief prosecutor in the Tuscan city of Grosseto, told ANSA . news agency the captain 'very ineptly got close to Giglio'. 'The . ship struck a reef that got stuck inside the left side, making it (the . ship) lean over and take on a lot of water in the space of two, three . minutes,' he said. Sources have said the captain, from Naples, had abandoned the ship at around 11.30pm local time - an hour after it struck a rocky outcrop and started taking on water - while the last passengers were not taken to safety until 3am yesterday morning. Schettino's lawyer, Bruno Leporatti, said: 'I'd like to say that several hundred people owed their life to the expertise that the commander of the Costa Concordia showed during the emergency.' He was taken to Grosseto's jail, where he will be held until next week when a judge will decide whether he should be released or formally put under arrest. In Italy, suspects can be held without charge for a few days for investigation. A judge must either validate the jailing, putting the suspect under arrest, or declare him free to go. Stricken: The Costa Concordia lists virtually over on its side after a massive hole was torn into its side when it struck rocks . Investigation: Sources have claimed the captain abandoned his ship hours before the last passengers were recovered from the vessel . Experts have said the captain may have been correct in his belief that his ship met its fate because of a power failure. Passengers . rescued from the stricken liner reported there had been a power . blackout and a large booming noise, which indicated the vessel may have . suffered an engine room explosion. Last . night Malcolm Latarche, editor of the global shipping magazine IHS . Fairplay Solutions, said the problem may have been caused by a . phenomenon known as 'harmonic interference'. Mr Latarche said it was possible the cruise liner experienced the same problem that saw the Queen Mary 2 lose power in September 2010 as she was approaching Barcelona. On that occasion, the QM2 was able to carry on into open sea. The expert said the harmonic interference – a type of power surge – could have caused a malfunction in the generators feeding the ship's six diesel electric engines with which the back-up systems could not cope. This would have caused the ship to lose navigational power and steering control and veer off course, he said. Asked for his assessment of the incident, Mr Latarche said: 'I would say power failure caused by harmonic interference and then it can't propel straight or navigate and it hit rocks.' He added that once a ship experienced problems with the electrical supply to its main propulsion motors, it could lead to a problem with steering. Run aground: The luxury cruise liner lies on its side just metres from the island of Giglio . Survivor: A South Korean passenger is covered in a space blanket by Italian firefighter after being rescued from the ship . Mr Latarche said: 'It seems that this may have happened quite close to land, in shallow water. When you can't steer you are going to run aground and hit rocks at some point.' The Costa Concordia, built in 2005, was designed to standards comparable with ocean liners. Even though it had a rounded hull compared to the stronger V-shaped hull fitted to the Cunard flagship QM2, experts say it was capable of crossing the rough seas of the Atlantic. Mr Latarche added: 'Although the damage caused to the ship was severe, there are many safeguards in the design of a state-of-the-art cruise ship to prevent it turning over. 'There is a second hull within the outer hull. Inside the inner hull there is a steel structure like an ice tray to contain the water and prevent it spreading through the ship. 'In this case, the Master rightly attempted to return it to the shore, but it seems to have keeled over because it hit shallow water on the coast. 'An ocean cruise ship is not designed to float in 20ft of water. It needs much more than that to remain upright.' Investigations: Italian Coast Guard personnel recover the black box from the Costa Concordia cruise ship . Disaster: Experts have said the cruise liner may have suffered power failure - caused by a power surge - causing it to veer off course . According to Mr Latarche, the fact that the average tonnage of cruise ships has doubled in the past decade makes a full-scale evacuation while at sea almost impossible. Under regulations introduced by the International Maritime Organisation in 2010, the very latest ships are now designed to be able to return to port even in the event of a major fire or loss of power on board, in order to make evacuation unnecessary. The Concordia was commissioned five years prior to the new rules but Mr Latarche said: 'Even if the most sophisticated ship in the world went into shallow water, the likelihood is it would turn on its side. 'This was a unique situation in which a number of circumstances all came together.' Last night, Italian investigators trying to establish the cause of the accident arrested the Captain, Francesco Schettino, and were considering bringing manslaughter charges. The investigators will study repair log books and fault reports for the vessel dating back several years. They will also examine the experience of the officers and crew and examine the roles played by everyone on the day that the liner came to grief. Since the Eighties the cruise industry has experienced a boom. More than 19 million passengers took a cruise last year and nine or more cruise ships of 100,000 tons or more have been built every year for the past decade. Although cruise ships appear to be top-heavy, most of their weight is at the bottom, while the structure towards the top is designed to be comparatively light. Traditionally, the vast majority of cruises have been taken by Americans to the Caribbean islands, but the Mediterranean market is rapidly expanding, with Italy the prime destination. Cruise liners are designed for pleasure voyages, in which the surroundings and the luxurious amenities are the major focus of the experience, rather than the transportation itself. As an industry, cruising has a safety record generally regarded as excellent. Over the past two decades, an estimated 90 million passengers have enjoyed a cruise without major incident. The overwhelming majority of deaths on cruise ships are from natural causes or suicides. Passenger ships – defined as any ship carrying more than 12 passengers – must comply with International Maritime Organisation regulations, which cover every aspect of the construction and operation.","Passenger claims captain was drinking in the bar on the night ship ran aground .

"It's been a long road back to English football for Yakubu, via China and Qatar, but the old questions haven’t gone away. After the veteran Nigerian striker turned back the clock to score his first goal for Reading and fire Steve Clarke’s side into the quarter-finals of the FA Cup, the age issue was inevitably raised again. The official figure is 32 but Derby boss Steve McClaren reckoned that Yakubu told him he was 25 when he joined him at Middlesbrough in a £7.5million deal a decade ago.

And as long as he’s doing what he does best, he is happy to let the debate continue. ‘You can see the way I play, so I am not talking about my age,’ he said. ‘It is normal. People can choose if they don’t believe it so it’s up to them. But for me I am just enjoying my football. ‘The hunger is always there. When you play in England you always have the desire to play.

"An American couple have disappeared in Peru in an area where a criminal gang were believed to have been plotting to kidnap tourists, authorities said today. Jamie Neal, 27, and her boyfriend 25-year-old Garrett Hand, have been missing since January during a biking vacation in Peru.

They have not posted any pictures of their trip on Facebook in more than four weeks and Mr Hand's cellphone has gone unanswered. Up until then, the couple had been regularly updating friends and family with news of their adventurous travels. The couple are biking enthusiasts who both work in cycle stores in the Bay Area of San Francisco. They had customized their bikes especially for the trip which began in December. They had also traveled to Chile and Argentina before deciding to go to the Amazon instead of Machu Picchu in Peru. Friends told KTVU that they had hoped the couple simply had mechanical issues with their bikes but after they were spotted in the Peruvian capital, it seemed unlikely.

"Slain: Dan 'Selina' Lin was killed by her mother-in-law Huajiao Zhuang who bashed her 33 times with a hammer. Zhuang was found guilty of the murder on Thursday in the Victorian Supreme Court . A Melbourne grandmother has been found guilty of bashing her daughter-in-law to death with a hammer – so her son could marry someone else. The Victorian Supreme Court heard how Huajiao Zhuang, 50, travelled to her daughter-in-law Dan 'Selina' Lin’s Bundoora home on the afternoon of 3 May 2012 and beat her an astonishing 33 times with a hammer. Ms Lin's death was the culmination of a long-running feud with her mother-in-law, who claimed the 21-year-old didn't pay her enough respect. It is understood Zhuang felt she did not have enough contact with or influence on her son and expected to live under the same roof, which Lin did not allow. After the killing she wrapped Ms Lin's body in a nylon bag, put it in a wheelie bin and returned to dump the body in the Darebin creek later that night, court heard. Zhuang’s lawyers argued that their client had acted in self-defence and that the victim Lin was the person who first wielded the hammer. Defence barrister Shane Gardner earlier told the trial 'You can hear the sincerity in her voice ... you can hear she's genuine, you can hear the anguish in her when she gives those answers (in a police interview),' The Age reported. However the Victorian Supreme Court jury found her guilty of murdering the 21-year-old on Thursday, delivering their verdict as Zhuang sobbed and wailed. During the trial, the court heard the pair were locked in a continuing feud over the respect Ms Lin paid to her mother-in-law. Guilty: Huajiao Zhuang, 50, had to be physically assisted from court after the jury handed down their verdict . Prosecutor Peter Kidd said Zhuang wanted her son Peter to divorce Ms Lin and marry a woman from China so he could earn ‘hundreds of thousands of dollars’ from the woman's family, thanks to his permanent Australian residency. A school friend of Ms Lin once heard Zhuang ask her grandson ‘how would you like to change your mother?,’ Kidd told court. Zhuang had earlier told police the fatal fight broke out after a dispute over her grandson's bath water, something rubbished by the prosecutor. The killer wailed loudly after the verdict was delivered, and had to be physically assisted as she left the courtroom. According to The Age, forensic evidence suggested Ms Lin remained conscious for some time after her mother-in-law began the repeated hammer attack. She was found to have died of repeated blunt force trauma to the head. Justice Stephen Kaye will hear sentencing submissions next Thursday.

However . experts believe the sinister black and white design, . which is based on the black jihadist flag flown by ISIS terrorists and . warns of a 'deployment of armies' if the holder comes to harm while . travelling abroad, proved the passports are little more than a symbolic . gesture. Authentic? ISIS militants have reportedly issued these Islamic State passports in the hope they will give the unrecognised state an air of legitimacy. The documents are said to have been issued to 11,000 people . While ISIS has expressed a . desire to expand its territory to include stretches of Europe, including .

Issuing . state documents is both a clear indication that ISIS considers its . declared caliphate to be the world's newest state, and also to shrug off . the threat posed to its existence by U.S. airstrikes. So far at least two versions of the alleged passport have emerged online.

"When it comes down to football brass tacks, Vincent Kompany is conclusive, unambiguous and to the point. Off the pitch as much as on it, the towering Manchester City and Belgium captain's calculated demeanor demands respect. And the 6ft 4in defender's mind is made up when it comes to his future, too. In the wake of the release of Luis Figo's FIFA presidential campaign manifesto, the 28-year-old appeared informed in his response regarding the prospect of a future role at the international association football federation. Vincent Kompany gave a frank interview outlining his thoughts on the FIFA presidential election . The commanding Manchester City captain (right) spoke out about the running of football's governing body . Talking with The Times and De Volkskrant, Kompany opened up about the idea of working his way onto the ladder of football's governing body. 'I don't want to enter that world of old crocodiles. If you see all the things that are going wrong at FIFA it really makes me wonder. 'We're talking about the largest sports association in the world and yet nobody buries its head deeper in the sand than FIFA. There is simply no transparency. I don't know why the football world continues to accept it.' 'Whenever there's a vote or there's a decision it's not transparent. It's a very powerful, wealthy organisation but from my point of view so much of it seems to be about protecting this very old bureaucracy that keeps it within its own little world.' Damning as they may be, Kompany's assertions were followed by a hint of apprehension for former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan star Figo, who will be challenging Sepp Blatter for his seat at the head of the FIFA boardroom table. The Belgium skipper said he would not choose to get involved with the 'world of old crocodiles' at FIFA . 'My only concern is how much legs this [Figo's candidacy] has. It's one thing to present yourself, but my concern is about the system. How do you actually get the votes? 'I have my doubts about how an outsider can change [FIFA]. You know the people who vote? Change is threatening to them. They can pretend as much as they want that they're going to implement change because that's what people outside FIFA want to hear. But real change? I'm not convinced the people who vote want that. Former footballer Luis Figo launched his FIFA presidential manifesto at Wembley Stadium earlier this week . Despite his doubts about the FIFA hierarchy, Kompany was on board with the concept of a World Cup in Qatar. 'It's the world game so it's right the World Cup should be held around the world. If it's summer or winter that's less important. I just want to see FIFA show things happened in the correct manner.' Asked his opinion on footballers' wages, the Belgian raised a valid point for debate: . 'Of course it's absurd but it's a nuanced discussion. Manchester City's matches are seen worldwide by millions of people. Football is an enormous economy. Millions of kids are inspired by people like [Cristiano] Ronaldo or [Sergio] Aguero. Millions of people make money because Ronaldo is Ronaldo. 'Also, one thing I've noticed is what a giving culture there is among footballers. If you look around footballers they are very giving to friends, to family, to charities even though they only have a short career. Manchester City could be without James Milner (centre) for their Champions League clash with Barcelona . 'If you compare that with someone who works in the City of London, earning a similar amount for a longer period of their life, are all of them so giving?' At the business end of things, City face a tough week of fixtures heading towards March with a Champions League last 16 first leg showdown with Barcelona separating Premier League clashes with Newcastle and Liverpool. The Sky Blues sit seven points adrift of league leaders Chelsea before hosting John Carver's men on Saturday and their skipper knows his side's work is cut out for them. 'I would love to be able to win the league by ten or 15 points, just for the sake of having a smooth end of the season, but we always have to do it the hard way - every single time.' 'It's going to have to be the same again, but that's what shows we're still a club that needs to make so much more progress.'","Vincent Kompany said that he would avoid working within with FIFA .

"Face screwed up in agony, her broken legs bandaged as she lay in the road, this is the little girl who was knocked over by the wife of an Australian banker in Papua New Guinea. The woman and her family have now fled home on the advice of her husband's employer ANZ, who warned of a 'targeted revenge attack' after the accident on the Poreporena Freeway, in the country's south. An ANZ spokesman said the woman and her family - who all flew home from Port Moresby on the bank's money - are still 'in a state of shock' over the incident. Excruciating: Serah Kevin, seven, is treated in the road after colliding with a car being driven by the wife of an ANZ banker in Papua New Guinea on May 7. She suffered two broken legs and is still in hospital . Distraught: Serah's mother Belsy Kevin collapses in the road and wails after she realises how seriously her daughter is injured . The bank confirmed in a statement the woman and her husband, who worked for ANZ in the Port Moresby Harbour City headquarters, would continue to cooperate with police from Australia following the incident. They left Papua New Guinea earlier this month after security experts warned they faced a 'significant risk of a targeted revenge attack'. The bank confirmed the wife of an ANZ banker was involved in a road accident and 'clipped a young girl' on the Poreporena Freeway on May 7. The girl was subsequently run over by another vehicle traveling in the same direction and suffered two broken legs, ANZ said in a statement on Tuesday. 'We understand the girl ran in front of the traffic without warning because she was being chased by an attacker,' the bank said. According to Papua New Guinean publication the Post-Courier, the girl is seven and named Serah Kevin. She is due to undergo a leg operation at the Port Moresby General Hospital. 'She needs steel plates inserted into her right leg which was crushed in the accident, without any delay,' her mother Belsy Kevin told the Post-Courier. 'The (ANZ) staff have been very helpful to us since last Monday and they have told us that (ANZ) will meet all the hospital expenses. 'We have not yet found out who the driver of the vehicle is.' Carnage: Emergency services officials, including officers from the Australian Federal Police, were quick to respond to Sarah, 7, who broke both legs . 'Clipped': In a statement, ANZ said the girl was clipped by the banker's wife before another vehicle ran her over . Medical emergency: There were initial fears that Serah had suffered a broken neck, however scans reveal her horrific injuries were contained to her legs . The Australian woman went to ANZ HQ immediately after the incident and the accident was reported to police the same day. 'The staff member's family sought professional advice which was they should leave the country due to significant risk of a targeted revenge attack,' the bank said. 'Our staff member and his wife are available at any time to provide any further assistance required to the PNG police, and ANZ is providing continued assistance to the girl and to her family.' The bank said it had been in contact with the injured girl's family to express its deep concern about her welfare and to offer support. There are fears in the PNG media that the girl may remain paralysed. An ANZ employee who works in Papua New Guinea told MailOnline the community was shocked the Australian woman didn't stop to help the young girl. 'Of course they are angry at what she did,' she said. 'Running away after putting a kid's life in a critical condition. What if it was her kid?' Hit and run: The stretch of road where an Australian woman ran over a young PNG girl who was fleeing an attacker . Great escape: The woman returned home to Australia after colliding with the girl on the Poreporena Freeway on May 7 . An ANZ spokesman told MailOnline 'I can confirm that ANZ is continuing to assist the (injured girl's) family, including with any medical bills...The whole family left (Papua New Guinea). 'They're still in a state of shock.' In a statement dated 15 May, ANZ said: 'Clearly this was a terrible situation and our staff member’s wife reacted in exactly the way she was taught by PNG security experts. 'All companies operating in PNG instruct their staff and dependents not to stop when involved in road accidents due to the significant risk of violence and to report the matter as soon as practical to police. 'This is common practice for both locals and expats living in PNG.' The Australian government's official advice to travelers to PNG is to 'exercise a high degree of caution.' Australian Federal Police were among the first to respond to the accident and provided assistance to local detectives. 'It just happened that our guys happened to be with the Papua New Guinean police doing patrols,' said an AFP spokesman. 'We just provide advice, we don't carry guns, we have no powers of investigation.' ANZ public relations staff who refused to confirm or deny further details of the crash.

"Two members of a family accused of mass incest dating back four generations have been DNA swabbed after a court ruled they had to provide evidence to detectives. In one of the most shocking cases of child abuse in Australian history, Raylene and Betty Colt - legal names given to them by the court to protect their identity - were ordered by a magistrate to report to a Sydney police station on Friday and provide samples as detectives continued their efforts to lay charges. An application to obtain DNA from a third family member - Rhonda - was withdrawn by police, pending further evidence from tests performed on five of her children. Three children will also be tested. Betty and Raylene Colt, whose identities are protected for legal reasons, outside court on Friday where they were ordered to give DNA samples . Betty (left) and Rhonda Colt (right) outside a Sydney court on Friday, where a request to obtain DNA from Rhonda was withdrawn . Betty and Rhonda Colt (left) and Rhonda Colt (right) are under investigation in one of the most shocking cases of child abuse in Australian history . Five arrest warrants have been issued for a number of other family members who didn't appear in court. A senior police source told MailOnline many Colts had fled to other parts of the country and a nationwide hunt is now on. The case shocked Australia when about 40 people, ranging in age from toddlers to men and women in their late forties, were discovered living in scrubland in a NSW country town in July 2012. The name of the town has been suppressed for legal reasons. Social workers and police were shocked to find the community living in squalid conditions. Several of the children were undernourished and most were unable to speak properly and had rarely attended school. They had been deprived of dental and medical care and some suffered from sight issues and cognitive impairment or were severely developmentally delayed. The adults of family discovered living in squalor in regional NSW in July 2012, are now under investigation for child abuse . Others had never used a toothbrush, washed their hair, used toilet paper or bathed themselves. At least 12 children have since been removed from their relatives' care. The children were living in filthy sheds and broken down caravans and had numerous disabilities from their inbred births, including a boy with a walking impairment and severe psoriasis, another with hearing and sight problems and yet another boy whose eyes were misaligned. The depravity was a throwback to a pair of great-great grandparents who were a brother and sister who encouraged their children to have sex with each other as soon as they were capable. By 2012, the five family groups comprised sisters Rhonda, then 47; Martha, 33; and Betty Colt, 46, who slept every night with her brother, Charlie. There were also two of Betty's daughters who each had children who proved to be from unions of related parents. Betty's son Bobby, then 15, needed urgent dental work, could not talk properly, he wet and soiled his bed and his learning ability was at kindergarten level. Police have been building a case against the adults ever since and yesterday was a major step in their efforts to lay charges. Raylene (light jacket) and Betty Colt (dark jacket) outside a Sydney court on Friday . (Left to right) Raylene, Rhonda and Betty Colt outside a Sydney police station, where two of them were ordered to give DNA samples . In Parramatta Local Court on Friday the lawyer for Raylene said that access to the Colts' DNA should not be granted without her clients' consent. 'I'm arguing...that the application is not adequate and it should be dismissed,' said the lawyer, who also can't be named. 'The procedure is not one that can confirm or disprove that my client committed an offence under section 78A (of the Crimes Act).' She added her client denied the allegations of incest, however accepted that they were listed as a 'suspect' in the police case. Magistrate Joan Baptie quoted a psychologist's report on one of the Colt children, which cited: 'Her perception that her father is the same father as her mother and her grandmother.' She also referenced 'homozygotic' testing, previously carried out for Children's Court proceedings, that indicated a high level of genetic similarities in the Colt family. Betty Colt was ordered to give DNA on Friday as part of an investigation into a potentially incestuous family in NSW . Sisters Betty (left) and Rhonda (right), tweo members of the Colt family, have parents who are blood relatives . 'It might occur in a place like Tonga where there's a small gene pool,' she said. 'Homozygosity, as I understand, it is very unusual.' Ms Baptie later granted police permission to take DNA evidence from Betty, who is in her late 40s, and her daughter, Raylene, who is in her 30s. She said she was satisfied that previous testing indicated that Raylene's teenage daughter Kimberly was the product of incest and that further forensic analysis was needed. Betty had earlier objected to a DNA swab, saying: 'Everything else has been taken, the only thing I've got left is my privacy.' She was ordered to report to Parramatta Police Station by 4.30pm. Children's Court documents reveal the complex and alarming family tree that evolved over generations as the Colts moved around Australia. Sisters Rhonda, Martha and Betty - along with two of Betty's children - were found to have parents who were blood relatives. Many other members of the Colt family are thought to have died young. Detective Inspector Peter Yeomans, head of the NSW Police child abuse squad, said: 'It's a very difficult, complex investigation where police are conducting inquires in relation to allegations of a multitude of offences.'

"Emotional: Nazir Akbari, 27, wept in the dock and cried 'sorry mum' during a sentencing hearing at Downing Centre District Court on Thursday . A former bikie associate wept in court today as he stood accused of attempting to extort a smash repairman to the value of $10,000. Ex ‘Brothers 4 Life’ associate Nazir Akbari, 27, took the stand at Downing Centre District Court on Thursday, crying ‘I'm sorry mum’ while holding his head in his hands. Akbari and his co-accused Mohammed Nasiri, 23, have pleaded guilty to several charges stemming from an extortion attempt by the Brothers 4 Life which targeted a smash repair business last year. At their sentence hearing, the Downing Centre District Court heard the businessman, who does not wish to be identified, received two calls in July from gang members demanding $40,000. ‘We have 4000 foot soldiers, nothing can save you,’ he was told. They told the man that unless he coughed up the cash ‘We will hurt you and blow up your shop’.Akbari and Nasiri did not make those specific calls but police say the pair went to the shop a month later and demanded $10,000. Akbari and his family cried as he described his sense of shame over what he had done. He said the Brothers 4 Life gang ‘filled him with drugs’ after became involved with the Bankstown chapter of the gang. The court heard the western Sydney chapter has since 'disbanded' and Akbari wanted nothing more to do with them, but is forced to see members every day in jail. ‘They have us all together, so I just say “Hi” and “Goodbye”,’ he said. ‘I want to change, I want to become a better person’. Nasiri, meanwhile, said he was ‘foolish’ for getting involved in the gang, whose members face charges over several Sydney shootings. ‘I'm very remorseful, I'm very sorry... Looking back at it I could have said, “No”,’ he said. Nasiri said he wants to finish his Higher School Certificate and spend time with his mother and father after being released from prison. Both men have pleaded guilty to several charges, including demanding property with menace and participating in a criminal group. Akbari has posted photos of himself online posing in Brothers 4 Life gear and portraying strength with a tightly clenched fist. Following strenuous work by NSW police, the Brothers 4 Life gang chapters in Blacktown and Bankstown have largely been quashed, having enjoyed a peak of power in 2011.

"Heroic Bali bombing survivor Patrick Byrne - who ran back into a the burning Sari nightclub minutes after terrorists had unleashed hell - was found dead on Wednesday. As news of his death, which police described as not suspicious, spread among his close network of friends at the Coogee Dolphins, he was remembered as a joker, a party animal and a selfless mate who hid a world of pain. Recognised with a bravery award in 2008, Pat's actions on the night of the bombings saved countless lives. But it was the horror he faced in a makeshift morgue in the days after the attack that would haunt him to his early grave. Life of the party: Patrick Byrne died on Wednesday after 12 years of emotional torment since surviving the Bali terrorist bombings. He was remembered by friends as a selfless man with two very different sides . Nightmare: Pat ran back into the carnage repeatedly on the night, dragging survivors to safety . The former Coogee Dolphins football club president, 41, did not sleep for two days after explosives tore through the Sari nightclub, killing 88 Australians including six of his closest mates. His name will now sit alongside theirs at an official memorial to the victims in Coogee. Pat had popped out of the club to buy a packet of cigarettes, a chance decision that saved his life. But he was about to engage in a harrowing and heroic rescue mission that would change him forever. Following the blasts, Pat ran in and out of the nightclub repeatedly – carrying severely injured tourists to safety and putting his own life on the line. Patrick Richard Byrne'Late on the night of 12 October 2002, Mr Byrne went to the aid of victims following two explosions in the vicinity ofthe Sari Club, Denpasar, Bali...'Early in the evening Mr Byrne and friends attended dinner before visiting the Sari Club to meet up with other football mates. 'After leaving the club to walk back to his hotel, Mr Byrne heard a huge explosion. He saw a large fireball, and theglass and fittings of nearby shops began to shatter around him. 'Mr Byrne raced back to the club which was engulfed in flames. 'Confronted by the devastation and confusion, Mr Byrne anxiously searched the site for his friends.'He remained at the scene helping to assist injured victims and searching for bodies. 'He later attended a nearby temporary casualty station to look for his team mates and remained there for several hours helping distressed victims.'For his actions, Mr Byrne is commended for brave conduct.' ‘Everyone who went into the Sari club that night was a hero, it was a warzone, and Pat did it over and over again,’ close friend and fellow survivor Erik de Haart told MailOnline. ‘There were people staggering in and out, there was dust everywhere and body bits all over the floor but Patty was charged. He was on a mission. We went over as a team and we wanted to come back as a team.’ Less than 48 hours after the act of terrorism that killed 202 people, Pat, Erik and Daniel 'Shorty' Mortenson, another Coogee Dolphins teammate, faced the gut-wrenching task of identifying their friends at a makeshift morgue. ‘There was four inches of bloody water on the floor of the triage room,’ Mr de Haart said. ‘A pile of rags, sheets hanging off beds and shards of skin everywhere…we went through that and eventually came to what was the morgue. Mate's mate: Josh Illife (left), Dean Johnson (middle) and Patrick Byrne (right) enjoying a laugh and a drink. Illife died in the terrorist attack that haunted Byrne for the rest of his life . Carnage: The blast (left) and aftermath (right) of the night that would 'destroy' a piece of Pat Byrne forever . Tragic: Pat Byrne (left) with Dean Johnson on a separate Dolphins' trip to Thailiand. Johnson said Byrne always went out of his way to make others enjoy themselves . War zone: Pat could never shake the images of the aftermath of the bombings from his memory . ‘There was a collection of arms and legs. Patty walked in and he saw that and fell to pieces. It shocked him so hard, he couldn’t handle it…we took him back to the hotel and he’s never been the same since.’ The horror of what he went through 12 years ago would haunt him for the rest of his tortured days. Pat, or 'Patty' as he was known to his mates, was found dead on Wednesday at his parents’ Central Coast home. No note has yet been found. Never forgotten: A friend of Pat's posted this touching photo of a ray of sunlight on the Coogee headland on Friday morning . Brothers: In a heartbreaking post on Facebook on Thursday, Dolphins president Brock Thompson said of Pat 'I will always be proud to call you my brother' ‘He had the worst case of survivor’s guilt of all of us,’ said Mr de Haart. ‘It destroyed a vital part of him, a little bit of him died that day.’ Despite the anguish, Byrne continued to assist the Coogee Dolphins and his community both financially and with his time. He was a lover of rugby league and a talented player. He once won an U21 competition with the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Heart of gold: Friends of Pat will gather on Friday night to laugh and remember a heroic mate . Devastation: The Bali bombings killed 202 people, including 88 Australians . Friends remember two sides of Patty in the years since that cowardly act of murder by Islamist extremists. ‘He had some very, very dark days. He hit the bottle hard and he overindulged in drugs from time to time. ‘There was Patty the party animal who liked to laugh and then there was a darker side. We really couldn’t pass on our nightmares to those back at home.’ Pat's marriage broke down a number of years ago and he leaves behind two boys, both aged under nine. When he died he was living with his parents in Bateau Bay. Terror: All the perpetrators behind the bombings who were not sentenced to death have since been released from prison . Clint Thompson, 29, was one of Pat's friends killed in the Bali bombings . Shane Foley, 34, was one of Pat's friends killed in the Bali bombings . Dave Mavroudis, 28, was one of Pat's friends killed in the Bali bombings . Survivor's guilt: Pat was one of a number of Aussie survivors who suffered from post traumatic stress following the terror attack . ‘What he did over in Bali was heroic,’ said best friend and former flat mate Dean Johnson. ‘His mates meant everything to him. He was very outgoing, the life of the party and if people weren’t enjoying themselves he would go out of his way to crack a joke at your expense or his.’ Tonight the Coogee Dolphins will be reuniting at a pub in the eastern suburbs to remember a selfless survivor of the Bali bombings who would eventually become a victim. Inner pain: Friends said Pat's outgoing nature and cheerful demeanour masked severe sadness . There are already plans in place at the club to ensure he is never forgotten. ‘He’d be loving the fact that we’re all getting together for a few beers to remember how much he annoyed us,’ said Mr Johnson. Pat, who became a successful businessman back in Australia, was given a bravery award in 2008 for his actions. In the 12 years since his mates Clint Thompson, 29, Adam Howard, 27, Dave Mavroudis, 28, Shane Foley, 34, Gerard Yeo, 20 and Joshua Iliffe, 28 were murdered he fought a daily struggle. As is true of all heroes, the one life he couldn’t save was his own. A public funeral will be held for Pat next Wednesday at 11am at St Mary's Church in North Sydney. If you or someone you know needs help, call Lifeline on 13 11 14. Fallen mates: The six Coogee Dolphins who lost their lives on October 12 2002 . Ground zero: The debris pile in Kuta, Bali where the bombings took place was smouldering for days after the attack .","Patrick Byrne, 41, found dead on Wednesday after 12 years of torment .

"A White House official said Friday that the resignation of Veterans Affairs Undersecretary Robert Petzl was not voluntary, despite previous reports that he resigned out of anger with the Obama Administration. 'There is no question that this is a termination of his job there before he was planning to go,' White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett for an interview to air on Face the Nation this Sunday. Petzel, the undersecretary for health care at the VA, resigned abruptly on Friday, just a day after telling a U.S. Senate committee that he knew in 2010 about a memo describing 'inappropriate scheduling practices' now blamed for as many as 40 deaths at VA medical centers. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Complaints about long wait lists and falsified patient appointment reports have dogged VA hospitals and clinics nationwide.

House Press Secretary Jay Carney released an approving statement late . in the afternoon about the resignation, which was announced just an hour . after his final daily press briefing of the week concluded. 'The president supports Secretary Shinseki’s decision,' Carney said, adding that President Obama 'has asked Secretary Shinseki to conduct a review of Veterans Health Administration practices and procedures at its facilities nationwide to ensure better access to care, and that review is ongoing.' 'The president and Secretary Shinseki take the allegations around misconduct very seriously,' he added. Shinseki said in a statement that 'most veterans are satisfied with the quality of their VA health care, but we must do more to improve timely access to that care.' On Thursday, both Shinseki and Petzel men testified in a Senate Veterans Committee hearing. Shinseki said then that he was 'mad as hell' about the growing scandal but wouldn't terminate any underlings until an inspector general report was completed. That report's conclusions are expected in early June. Petzel acknowledged to lawmakers that he had seen a 2010 memo titled 'Inappropriate Scheduling Practices,' which described failures in several of the VA's 21 service regions. Shinseki, seated next to him, insisted that 'I was not, I am not' aware of it. Recent revelations blame shoddy management for the deaths of dozens of former soldiers, airmen, sailors and Marines, as administrators in Phoenix – and possibly elsewhere – maintained a secret off-the-books waiting list for veterans in need of critical care. Official lists were kept short so the agency could appear to be doing its job despite some waits being more than a year long. In one case, a Phoenix official was awarded bonuses based on fraudulent statistics as veterans died waiting for medical care. 'We have been working continuously to try and identify where those sites are and what we need to do to prevent that from happening. It's absolutely inexcusable,' Petzel told lawmakers Thursday. 'The individuals are ... held accountable,' he insisted, while admitting that  'I can't give you an example specifically.' 'But if someone were found to be manipulating inappropriately the scheduling system, they would be disciplined.' 'I don't know whether anybody was specifically disciplined around that issue,' he later conceded. Next to go? Petzel (R) is out, but VA Secretary Gen. Eric Shinseki (C) is refusing to resign . Standing guard: Members of the American Legion have attended hearings and applied pressure throughout the VA scandal, demanding Shinseki's resignation at every turn . Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal grilled Shinseki about the allegations of wrongdoing and demanded to know if he would ask the FBI to investigae. 'We have more than allegations at this point,' Blumenthal said Thursday. 'We have evidence, solid evidence, of wrongdoing within the VA system, and it is more than an isolated instance of wrongdoing – it’s a pattern and practice.' Shinseki would say only that he would 'make that [option] available to the VA inspector general 'if that’s his request.' Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki's future is a delicate subject: He's a decorated veteran, twice wounded in the Vietnam War, a former Army Chief of Staff, and a Hawaiian-American who retired as a four-star general . In addition to the Phoenix scandal, VA offices have reportedly destroyed more than 1.5 million medical orders in recent years without confirming that patients received the treatment they were supposed to get. Similar reporting has shown that backlogs of medical appointments in Los Angeles and Dallas VA facilities were wiped off the books to make appointment backlogs appear far shorter than they were. The White House has expressed continued confidence in Shinseki, a wounded warrior who rose to the rank of four-star general before taking on the thankless job of managing the VA. Key to the Obama administration's defense of its leading veteran advocate is the ongoing inspector general investigation. But members of Congress are still smelling blood and want Shinseki to resign next. House Veterans’ Affairs Chairman Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican, said in a statement Friday that 'Petzel's ""resignation"" is the pinnacle of disingenuous political doublespeak. Petzel was already scheduled to retire in 2014 and President Obama has already announced his intention to nominate Petzel’s replacement, so characterizing this as a ""resignation"" just doesn’t pass the smell test.' “Desperate to get ahead of a delays in care crisis that is growing by the day, yet apparently unwilling to take substantive actions to hold any of its leaders accountable for negligence that harms veterans, VA has resorted to what it does best: splitting semantic hairs to create the illusion of accountability and progress,' Miller added.

"The daughter of convicted killer Bevan Meninga helped free her father from jail with a heartfelt letter that pleads: 'I know he is a good man', it has been reported. The murderer brother of rugby league legend Mal Meninga was released on Wednesday morning after serving almost 23 years behind bars for the death of Sunshine Coast teenager Cheree Richardson in 1991. His 15-year-old daughter, who was conceived during an affair he had with a prison guard, was instrumental in securing his release from his life sentence, The Sunday Mail reports. Scroll down for video . Touching: This heartfelt letter from convicted killer Bevan Errol Meninga's daughter reportedly helped secure his release from jail . 'My Daddy is Bevan Errol Meninga and I believe in him,' it says. She explains how 'all of his family love him dearly, especially me' and claims the pair have a strong relationship. The touching note reads: 'He is my dad and I love him so so much. He is my life. My life without him is harder than ever, he loves us with all his heart.' She asks for the authorities to 'think really hard' about how happy their family will be to have him released. She also promises that his family will look after him, a sentence that was echoed by rugby league legend Mal Meninga on Wednesday. Murderer Bevan Meninga was released from Palen Creek Correctional Centre in Rathdowney . He said his family will do everything they can to put his brother Bevan on the right track after he served out his sentence for the murder of Ms Richardson. The 42-year-old killer was eligible for parole in 2005 but was kept in custody on a low-security prison farm, Palen Creek Correctional Centre, at Rathdowney. 'We're very pleased this day's come,' Mal Meninga told reporters. 'Obviously we don't condone his actions but we understand that he's very remorseful towards the family of the victim. 'As a family, all we can do is support him. All we can do is be around and make sure he's well looked after and make sure he's doing all the right things. We'll stick by him. 'He's very disorientated at the moment. It's a surreal experience for him.' Bevan Meninga, who was released just after 5am on Wednesday, was 20 when he was sentenced to life in prison for attacking 19-year-old Cheree Richardson in 1991. He was locked up on May 24, 1991. Brother's joy: Mal Meninga said he is 'very pleased' his brother was released from jail . Authorities approved his parole application after his mother moved to Brisbane from the Sunshine Coast to provide him with a place to live, reported the Courier Mail. Mal Meninga said his mother was excited to have her son back at home. 'She's also very mindful of the fact that he has committed an awful crime, mindful of the fact that he's under strict guidelines from a parole point of view and mindful of the fact that we've got to make sure that Bevan's in a position to make a worthwhile contribution to society,' Mal Meninga said. 'It's a difficult time for everybody. Not only us but the victim's family as well. 'I know that there's an element out there in society probably wishes Bevan would stay in jail for the rest of his life.' The condition of his parole states that he cannot live on the Sunshine Coast where Cheree's family still resides . He will also undergo regular drug and alcohol tests after booze was found to be a factor in his brutal attack on 19-year-old Cheree, who was repeatedly hit with a tree branch. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said he hoped Bevan Meninga's family and friends would support him in his rehabilitation. 'He certainly has done the crime and done the time,' he said.

NRL legend: Bevan Meninga is the brother of Mal Meninga who has supported his previous parole applications . The murder left the Sunshine Coast community in shock and despair when the teenager's lacerated body was discovered in an Alexandra Headland park. Meninga was arrested days later, after being found hiding in the ceiling cavity of a flat. At the time, he was also on parole for bashing a woman with a stake in her home. Meninga was sentenced to life in jail in August 1992 for the murder and in 2000 he fathered a child with a prison guard. A friend of Cheree's parents said John and Helen Richardson had left town for a while to escape the coverage on Meninga's release. Mal Meninga previously supported Bevan's parole application and even offered to take him in at his Brisbane abode. Bevan Meninga was released from prison just after 5 o'clock this morning. It is expected that he will live with his mother in Brisbane .

"This is the private jet you'll never want to fly. The Gulfstream air ambulance may look like the luxury pleasure liner used by celebrities and moguls to travel the world in style ... but inside it is anything but. For this is the plane used to bring U.S. Ebola victims home to America. Most of its cabin space is taken up by the sealed-tight isolation chamber - or aeromedical biological containment system where patients are monitored around the clock. Scroll down for video . Sealed: The collapsible plastic tent is designed to house a single patient and stop any infectious germs from escaping . Disease control: It was built to transfer employees of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) exposed to all manner of contagious diseases for treatment. Beside it is an antechamber where medics put on their protective 'moon suits' before entering the tent to treat their ailing passenger. Next to the isolation chamber is a specialist toilet for the patient to use. 'As you know from a variety of reports, Ebola causes a lot of bodily reactions, and we have to be able to take care of that,' Dent Thompson, vice president of owner Phoenix Air, told ABC. The  jet, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has already been used to ferry two American missionaries — Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol — infected with the disease in August. And yesterday at was used again to transfer nurse Nina Pham, 26, from Texas to Maryland after she was infected while caring for U.S 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who tragically died on October 10 from the deadly disease. It is one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people who may have been exposed to very dangerous viruses, said Dr. Eileen Farnon, a Temple University doctor who formerly worked at the CDC and led teams investigating past Ebola outbreaks in Africa. Sole purpose: But for now it has only one purpose: to bring U.S. doctors and nurses home when their protective suits are compromised while treating Ebola victims in West Africa . Dangerous: It is one of about four such units around the country for testing and treating people who may have been exposed to very dangerous viruses . State-of-the-art: The cabin is fitted out with a range of state-of-the-art equipment . Few seats: There are some seats for doctors to sit in on the journey . Brantly, who works for Samaritan's Purse, was treating Ebola patients at a Liberia hospital. Writebol also worked there for another U.S. mission group called SIM. The government is working to ensure that any Ebola-related evacuations 'are carried out safely, thereby protecting the patient and the American public,' the State Department's Harf said. Ebola is not spread in the air, but only through direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids from an infected person. It comes as Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital released a video which shows the bittersweet moment Ebola-patient Ms Pham said goodbye to her doctor before leaving Dallas for further treatment in Maryland. Patients: The jet, based in Atlanta, Georgia, has already been used to ferry a number of infected Americans including Dr. Kent Brantly (right) and nurse Nina Pham (left) Key role: Yesterday it was used to transfer nurse Nina Pham, 26, from Texas to Maryland after she was infected while caring for U.S 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan, who tragically died on October 10 from the deadly disease . In the video released last night, at Ms Pham's request, her treating physician gets emotional as he sees her off on her trip to the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda. 'Thanks for getting well. Thanks for being part of the volunteer team to take care of our first patient,' Dr Weinstein is heard saying, as he focuses the camera on Ms Pham, reclining in her hospital bed. 'It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you,' he adds, before tearing up. Ms Pham then smiles and tells her doctor not to cry. 'We're really proud of you,' Dr Weinstein says. Ms Pham was discharged from the Dallas hospital on Thursday evening to fanfare as her coworkers gathered outside the building to see her off, holding up signs like 'Get well' and 'You're a rock star'. She landed in Bethesda at around 10.40pm Eastern Time, and was admitted to NIH hospital shortly before midnight.","The Gulfstream jet contains a sealed-tight isolation chamber for patients .

"Most middle-class parents can no longer afford to take their children abroad because of the soaring cost of going away in the school holidays, a survey has found. Three-quarters of those paid up to £24,000 – close to the average income – said they had difficulty saving up, and half of families with a combined income of between £44,000 and £54,000 said they had to make sacrifices to spend on a holiday. Even those earning £74,000 to £84,000 are feeling the pinch, with more than a third complaining about prices. Scroll down for video . Money worries? Even couples earning £50,000 worry about the cost of a holiday outside school term time . It is only when household income . reaches £84,000 or more that the vast majority - 93 per cent - say they . are not concerned about the cost. Holiday prices can soar by as much as 200 per cent during school breaks. More than two-fifths of parents said they had got around this by going away in term time, with one in seven admitting to lying to keep their children off school including making up stories about illnesses or deaths in the family, the survey by holiday firm Hogan's Irish Cottages found. Seven in ten of the 1,000 parents who . took part in the survey agreed a policy on term-time absences should be . in place - but complained it shouldn’t be as strict. It comes after a Facebook rant about the cost of breaks at Center Parcs by father Paul Cookson went viral and led to more than 100,000 signing an online petition calling for a cap on price increases in school holidays. What a rip-off! Paul Cookson was angered by the cost of holidays outside term time at Center Parcs . It means the issue could now be debated in Parliament. Studies have shown that travel firms, airlines, hotels and other businesses inflate prices when schools close. Others parents were granted authorised absences of up to ten days by sympathetic headteachers but this has been banned except in ‘exceptional circumstances’ since September. Breaches are dealt with by fines of up to £2,500 or three months in jail. The Department for Education took action to improve academic standards by preventing children from missing classes - but it is also increasing the affordability crisis. Last month it emerged a couple had been fined a total of almost £1,000 by magistrates after taking their three children away. Defying the law: Stewart and Natasha Sutherland were fined £1,000 for taking their three children abroad during term time . Stewart and Natasha Sutherland remained defiant afterwards, saying the penalty, on top of the cost of the holiday, was still cheaper than going away during the school break. The Department for Education said children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs than those who are regularly absent. A spokeswoman added: ‘We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates. Academies and free schools already have this freedom. ‘This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September. We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families.’","Poll by a holiday firm claimed even those earning £50,000 felt the pinch .

"An entire shoal of fish has been frozen mid-swim off the coast of Norway. Thanks to a sharp eastern wind, part of the ocean froze near Lovund, a small island just a few miles from the northern shores of the Norway mainland. It was only -7.8 degrees, but the wind made wind chill cold enough to freeze the large amount of fish in place. The fish frozen in their shoal off of the coast of Lovund, a small island on the Northern coast of Norway, in ice so thick walkers have been able to safely take their dog out for a walk on it . Aril Slotte of the Norwegian marine research institute Havforskningsinstituttet told the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) that he thinks the fish were being chased by a predator, which have made them group up in such big numbers. Ingolf Kristiansen said that because the ice was so frozen, no birds were able to fish in the seas. This is not the first instance of an animal being caught frozen in a Norweigian body of water. An elk was found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a Norwegian lake, found half visible above the ice. It appears as though it was trying to cross the ice, when it cracked, trapping the elk in the freezing water. Frozen: The animal was found frozen solid in the middle of the water near Bodo in northern Norway with just its antlers and back visible above the ice . Inger Sjøberg, 47, found the animal as she was skating across the lake, reported The Local. 'I was out skating with my boyfriend, and we saw something dark on the ice,' she told the Norway edition of the English language website. 'I thought it was some wood or some grass or something, and when we looked at it, we saw that it was an elk. I have never seen it before, a frozen animal in the ice.' 'We had to go out a bit from land, so the ice was strong enough when he started to walk, but then further out it was not strong enough. It's part of nature that animals die in this way.' A frog frozen to a lake. A frog in search of a mate froze to death while trying to cross a frosty lake . Photographer Svein Nordrum, 54, took this shot of a frog frozen on the surface of Lake Bindingsvann, just outside of Oslo, Norway . But it's not just large animals that have trouble with the frigid Norwegian winters, as smaller animals like frogs have been stopped in their tracks by freezing temperatures. It was thought that this frog was crossing lake ice near Oslo to try and seek out a mate, but was frozen solid in the process. The winter weather in Norway is some of the coldest in the world, with temperatures in inland areas sometimes reaching -40 degrees. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Norway was around -52 degrees in 1886 in one of the northernmost towns in the country.

"Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said on Thursday he is 'mad as hell' about allegations that VA hospitals put patients on secret waiting lists. 'I could use stronger language here, but in deference to the committee, I won't,' Shinseki said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs on Thursday. Shinseki - who is a veteran himself - called the allegations 'completely unacceptable' if true and promised that the VA would take corrective action if necessary. Scroll down for video . Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki told members of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee that he was 'mad as hell' about allegations that up to 40 patients may have died because of delayed treatment at an agency hospital in Phoenix, Arizona . Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki (left) and Veterans Affairs Under secretary for Health Robert Petzel (right) are sworn in before testyfing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee . CNN recently reported that 40 veterans died after being put on secret waiting lists for care by a Veterans Affairs hospital in Phoenix, Arizona. 'I would say that 40, there's more than that that I know of, but 40's probably a good number,' a former doctor at the facility told CNN. VA rules require hospitals to see veterans within two weeks to a month of their request for an appointment. In order to skirt the rules, employees of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System created an alternative system of scheduling that made it look like veterans were being seen in a timely manner when they weren't. Wait times for appointments often took more than six months, and in one case took 21 months, the doctor said. At another hospital in Cheyenne, Wyoming, employees were also instructed to 'game the system' by listing veterans' request for an appointment on a day where appointments were available instead of the day they first made the request, CBS reported last week. Shinseki told the Senators on Thursday to his knowledge, the secret waiting lists were not used at VA hospitals across the country. 'I'm not aware other than a number of isolated cases, where there is evidence of that,' the retired four-star general said, but he noted it 'behooves' the VA to take a look into its hospitals to make sure. Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs for Health Robert Petzel told Senators the VA is 'working continuously' to find out what VA sites are using the secret lists. VA acting Inspector General Richard Griffin said on Thursday that the IG's office was looking into multiple lists provided to them, including some provided via hotlines after the Phoenix deaths became national news. 'The number 40 that's been wildly reported in the press, does not represent the total number of veterans we're looking at,' he said. The list it is currently looking at has only 17 individuals, he said, and their investigation has shown so far that while all of the veterans on the list died, it was not because they were denied care in a timely manner by the VA. There was a delay in care, the VA's standards were not met, and there was 'some patient harm,' but to draw the conclusion between that and death, has been 'tenuous,' John Daigh, VA assistant Inspector General, said. In addition to the investigation underway by the VA Inspector General, Shinseki said his department would also be doing its own review of its practices. On Wednesday, President Obama announced that White House Deputy Chief of Staff Rob Nabors would oversee the VA's internal audit. 'While we get to the bottom of what happened in . Phoenix, it's clear the VA needs to do more to ensure quality care for . our veterans,' President Obama said in a statement. 'I'm grateful that Rob, one of my most trusted advisors, . has agreed to work with Secretary Shinseki to help the team at this . important moment.' Shinseki said he welcomed Nabor's participation on Thursday, saying he has known Rob and his family for a long time. He said the VA would let the IG finish his review of the department's . practices before jumping to conclusions about the level of care other VA . hospitals provide. The embattled VA Secretary said he would not leave his position until he'd completed his personal mission to improve health care for veterans or the President of the United States asks him to resign. Veterans look on as U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki testifies before a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on VA health care, on Capitol Hill . Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called for an independent investigation into the VA on Thursday morning. 'Our veterans are our heroes and they deserve better than a White House insider-led investigation,' he said. 'Yet again the White House is trying to pass off a scandal as an isolated incident when in fact it continues to grow every day.' Disabled American Veterans Legislative Director Joseph Violante also called on an outside investigation in his testimony to Congress on Thursday, while noting his organization stands behind Secretary Shinseki. During Thursday's hearing, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran questioned whether the VA's internal audit was anything more than 'damage control.' How long will it be before there is a different approach or attitude at the VA to solve the problem, Moran asked. 'What is is this really going to accomplish?' Moran, who chaired the VA subcommittee on health in the House before being elected to the Senate in 2010, said a two-week investigation by the VA that doesn't look at every one of the its facilities cannot be considered a thorough review. Sen. Mark Blumenthal asked Shinseki why he hadn't gotten the FBI involved in the investigation yet, as the manipulation of health records is a crime and the VA is clearly understaffed. 'I will work with the IG to make that available to him if that is his request,' Shinseki told Blumenthal. That's something that is your job to do as VA Secretary, Blumenthal told him, especially in light of the of 'false statements to the government.' Several senators asked Shinseki and Petzel what would happen to the VA employees involved in the cover up if the allegations turned out to be true. Shinseki again said he wanted to wait for the IG to finish his report before deciding if employees of the Phoenix hospital and other hospitals allegedly behaving in inappropriate behavior would be fired. 'There is a process here, Senator,' Shinseki told Alaska Sen. Mark Begich. 'Let me not get ahead of it.' 'I don't know whether that's the appropriate level' of discipline or not, Petzel said of terminating employees involved. Shinseki said that other employees who have engaged in inappropriate behavior have either retired, been let go or reassigned in the past. American Legion National Commander Dan Dellinger (center) has called for Shinseki's resignation over the scandal . The American Legion has called for Shinseki's resignation over a long list of grievances against the VA. The veterans organization has created a map of all the VA facilities that contributed to veterans' deaths by withholding necessary care. 'I accept that there are places that are . listed here where we have had adverse events,' Shinseki said when confronted with the  American . Legion's map. The American Legion says that a number of veterans have died of serious diseases after being put on a wait list for simple procedures like a colonoscopy. 'When are things going to get better?' Dan Dellinger, American Legion National Commander, told the committee. Carl Blake, national legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America said his organization wants to give Shinseki the 'opportunity to get it right' before it calls for his resignation. 'If that means people have to be fired, so be it,' he said. The Phoenix facility's director, associate director and another director have been put on leave, VA acting Inspector General Richard Griffin said on Thursday. He said the investigation, which a group of 185 health inspectors have been working on for three weeks, could take until August to complete. 'Remember part of this review could result in criminal charges being brought,' he told Senators who wanted to know why his office expected it to take so long.","At least 40 veterans died after a VA  facility in Phoenix, Arizona, placed them on secret waiting lists that left them without care for as many as 21 months .

Shinseki said the allegations are 'completely unacceptable' if true .

"A streaker standing naked on a highway central reservation in Kazakhstan got a bizarre comeuppance when an airgun-toting gang shot him in the backside. Oddball footage posted online records the drive-by shooting with an air rifle as the 27-year-old victim - later identified as Yuri Baiseitov - stands in the buff on a road's grass central reservation in Shymkent.

After first spotting him, the car makes a U-turn to get a better shot at their target. The gunman says to the driver: 'He's driving me crazy. Turn right here. Wait, go on a little bit.' Then, as he opens fire at hapless, naked Baiseitov, the gunman launches into a vile tirade, screaming: 'Get the f*** out of here, f*** your mum. Get out of here quickly. Quicker f*** it you faggot.'

Police spokesman Volt Beralin said later: 'While is is against the law to discharge firearms in this way, he [Baiseitov] should not have been where he was doing what he was doing.'

"Cheap fizz and Christmas puddings have beaten luxury rivals that can cost double the price in blind taste tests. Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs champagne costs just £15 beating the far more posh Moët & Chandon, which is far more expensive at £31.99. Meanwhile, an Aldi Christmas pudding at £6.99 was named a ‘best buy’, beating £15 offerings from the likes of Waitrose and Marks & Spencer. Sainsbury's own label champagne, pictured, came top, beating Moët & Chandon . The findings are reported today by Which? and suggest cash-strapped families can still enjoy a luxury Christmas without busting the household budget. The consumer champion also advises shoppers buying festive food to wait until the last minute if they want to make a saving on crackers and mince pies. However, Sainsbury’s has already cut the price of the Christmas products awarded ‘best buy’ status in the Which? tests. The Christmas pudding is down to £6.99, while the Blanc de Noirs champagne is £5.99 off at £15. An expert panel, including chef Vera Ashpool, and Patrick Moore of the award winning bakery More? The Artisan Baker based in the Lake District, tested puddings nominated by nine major retailers. Waitrose may be regretting putting forward its £14.99 Cherry and Almond Topped Christmas Pudding with Edible Glitter rather than its Heston Blumenthal Orange Christmas pudding. The Heston pud, which has become a . phenomenon and quickly sells out in the UK with the result a market has . developed on the eBay auction site, is now sold as far away as . Australia. However, the offering nominated by Waitrose for the blind taste tests came bottom with a score of just 51 per cent. The expert panel complained: ‘Syrup . seeped from it when served, and our experts felt this made the texture . sticky, while the sweetness overpowered the other flavours from spices . and nuts.’ Top . spot went to the Sainsbury’s Taste the Difference Cognac Laced . Christmas pudding at £12.90 for 900g, which came in with a score of 74 . per cent. The judges praised its ‘great aroma and light texture’. The best mix of value and flavour was . offered by Aldi’s Specially Selected Luxury 12 month matured pudding at . £6.99 for 750g, which was applauded as ‘attractive, warming and with . good of alcohol’. The third best buy was the Tesco Finest pudding with Courvoisier VS cognac at £7.99 for 907g. Judges praised the lighter flavour, mellow alcohol taste and good spread of fruit and nuts in what is a  good value large pud. A separate panel of wine experts, including Charles Metcalfe and Susy Atkins, assessed the best champagnes and sparkling wines. The Sainsbury’s Blanc de Noirs . champagne came top with a score of 86 per cent after judges praised its . ‘creamy texture, nutty and toasty flavours’. By contrast the famous Moët & Chandon . managed just eight place in the league with a score of 73 per cent. Aldi's Christmas pudding, pictured, at £6.99 was named a 'best buy', according to Which? survey . Aldi's Christmas pudding beat those by more upmarket rivals including Marks & Spencer, pictured . Patrick Moore, the owner of 'More? The Artisan Bakery', pictured left with Prince Charles, was on the panel . The ‘best buy’ accolade also went to a Marks & Spencer own label champagne, the De Saint Gall Blanc de Blancs Premier Cru at £28 a bottle. In terms of cheaper sparkling wine, top place went to Morrisons with its Pongracz Brut from South Africa at £13.99 with judges praising its fresh fruity aroma. There were two other best buys, including the M&S Single Estate Chadonnay Cava 2009 at £13.99 and the cheaper Sainsbury’s  Taste the Difference Vintage Cava Brut 2009 at £10.49. Which? experts also survey festive food price changes to identify the cheapest time to buy. Its researchers found crackers and mince pies were cheapest in the 10 days before December 25, while November was the best option for Yule logs. Across all Christmas food, Asda and Morrisons prices tended to stay the same more often, while Tesco and Sainsbury’s were more prone to changing prices and introducing offers during the Christmas period. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd said: ‘At the end of a really tough year for household finances, our research shows that people can still enjoy the best food and drink at Christmas without breaking the bank. ‘This will be welcome news for hard pressed families and confirms that it’s always better to shop around for the best deal.’","Sainsbury's £15 champagne came top beating luxury rival Moët & Chandon .

"In this modern world of luxury travel and money-no-object holidays, the more fortunate among us are able to demand all manner of high end accoutrements from the places where we stay: infinity pools, splendid spas, rooms with glorious views, butler service. It's certainly solid: The hotel, in Henan province, is made from a recycled section of concrete pipe . But for a few tourists in rural China, travel can be about more simple pleasures. Specifically, travel can involve accommodation crammed into an old concrete pipe. And the walls are pretty sturdy: Guests can be assured that their rooms are sound-proofed . An enterprising hotelier in Henan – a province in east-central China – has created an unusual retreat where guests go to sleep in a reused slice of industrial tubing. This sturdy piece of circular masonry has been chopped up into some 15 separate mini-structures – each designed to host two people, and equipped with a double bed. Some might say that such accommodation could be considered a little on the rudimentary side. Room, although not much of a view: The hotel is proving popular with Chinese tourists . Not many creature comforts: Although a little on the spartan side, rooms do come with air-conditioning . But anyone opting to stay can also expect such little ‘extra’ touches as air-conditioning, as well as bright bursts of street art painted onto the outside walls. For all its no-frills approach, this unusual outpost is proving popular with holidaymakers keen to sample the countryside in what is one of China’s largest and heavily populated provinces. A break from the city: The hotel hopes to attract guests from the likes of Zhengzhou, Henan's capital . Were Henan an independent country, it would be the 12th most populous on the planet, ranking just behind Mexico in terms of sheer weight of numbers. The owner hopes that his idiosyncratic idyll will attract urbanites from the province’s busy cities. Zhengzhou, the provincial capital, is one of China’s fastest growing cities – a metropolis of almost nine million people with a burgeoning technology sector. Plenty to see here: Attractions in Henan including the ruins of the ancient citadel of Yin . But tourists wanting to see more of the region will be relieved to hear that Henan does not confine itself to concrete bunkers and smog. It also contains some of China’s most historic sites, including Yin, the ruined capital of the country’s ancient Shang Dynasty.","Chinese hotelier makes intriguing use of recycled industrial tubing .

"A U.S. firefighter has battled osteoarthritis and four hip replacements to break the world paddleboarding record. Robyn Benincasa, 47, paddled non-stop for 90 miles around California's Huntington Beach Harbour. The athlete, from Cardiff by the Sea, California, spent 24 hours standing on a surf board while struggling against the pain of her artificial hip. Robyn Benincasa has battled osteoarthritis and four hip replacements to break the world paddleboarding record . Robyn, 47, was a champion adventure racer, but had to give this up when she developed osteoarthritis . Robyn Benincasa, 47, (second from left) with fellow San Diego Firefighters . 'I did this for all of the amazing women I know who are recovering from medical setbacks. I want to show what's possible when you choose not to focus on what you've lost, but on being the best of what you are today,' Mrs Benincasa said. Cheered on by husband Jeff, 49, the firefighter has been officially recognized by Guinness World Records for completing the greatest distance on a stand up paddleboard in 24 hours. A lifelong triathlon competitor and adventure racer, Mrs Benincasa suffered a devastating setback when she was diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis in 2007. The degenerative joint disease, which usually affects women over 50, forced Mrs Benincasa to give up on racing altogether. But after four hip replacements in just five years, the record-breaker took on paddleboarding as a new test of her endurance. 'I find the best thing to do is look at what you still can do, instead of what you can't. I can't run very far anymore because of my condition, but that lead to me to something I love even more - the sport of paddling,' Mrs Benincasa said.

She spent eight weeks training for her attempt, completing 10-hour non-stop paddles around the California harbour. But even the best training couldn't prepare Mrs Benincasa for her artificial hips giving out. Mrs Benincasa said: 'In the middle of the night I did have a moment of crisis. I couldn't keep my balance on the board and worried the muscles supporting my hip replacements weren't up for the job.' Luckily, after a brief inspection, the firefighter found the rudder on her paddleboard had broken. Her artificial hips were holding strong and after a quick fix she was on her way. Husband Jeff said: 'I've never known anyone as mentally tough as Robyn, when she decides to do something, no matter how difficult; you know it's going to happen!' The firefighter hopes to break more paddleboard records and has also created Project Athena, a non-profit foundation helping women with serious health issues take on physical challenges.

"A head coach and assistant high school soccer coach have resigned after it was discovered one of their players insulted a West African player on an opposing team with jokes about his race and Ebola. At least two fans wrote in complaining about hearing people at the Thursday night game in Pennsylvania taunting the player and saying they 'hoped [he] contracted Ebola.' Both Northampton's head soccer Craig Carvin and assistant coach Jason Melniszyn left their positions soon after. Both Northampton's head soccer Craig Carvin and assistant coach Jason Melniszyn left their positions soon after their team mocked an opposing player for his race and suggested he get ebola . The Morning Call reports that Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said an investigation into the incident was completed Tuesday. Neither of the coaches who resigned is a district teacher. The coaches did not respond to interview requests. 'The administration has conducted a thorough investigation throughout the entire day and appropriate discipline will be dispensed to any students who violated the code of conduct,' he said. He declined to say exactly what discipline might be implemented, the investigation's findings, or how many students could be disciplined, citing student confidentiality. The teen who was insulted is from Guinea and came to the U.S. three years ago. He was so angered by the insults he charged one of the players taunting him, and was thrown out of the game for his reaction. The teen's custodian Edward Bachert told reporters the boy 'cried at the kitchen table when he got home.' Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said an investigation into the incident was completed Tuesday but would not reveal the findings or what disciplinary action might be taken . He remained so upset he even sat out the league playoff game this weekend. His teammates at least have been supportive, wearing wristbands with the slogan #ENDRACISM. Sadly, many callous people have found the Ebola outbreak is a reason for sick humor. People living in a gated community in Scottsdale, Arizona, woke up Tuesday morning to discover the ominous words 'Ebola Quarantine Zone' spray-painted on one of the outside entrance walls. Those living in the neighbhrood were not amused to see the writing suggesting that their quiet community has been touched by the deadly virus, which claimed its first victim on US soil as recently as last week. And earlier this week, the typically progressive Village Voice was lambasted on Twitter when an article on a Nigerian Independence Day parade in New York was subtitled: 'Cloudy With a Chance of Ebola.'","Both Northampton's head soccer Craig Carvin and assistant coach Jason Melniszyn left their positions shortly after the incident .

"Chris Eubank Jnr battered Dmitry Chudinov from pillar to post before the referee belatedly stepped in to end the Russian's brutal punishment with less than a minute of the final round remaining. Fighting for the first time since losing to Billy Joe Saunders last November, Eubank delivered the perfect response and is also winning over the British crowd. He dominated from the first bell and it was a miracle that Chudinov remained standing for as long as he did - but only the official will know why he didn't spare him earlier. Chris Eubank Jnr fought against Dmitry Chudinov at London's O2 Arena on Saturday night . Eubank looked to exert himself from the off on an impressive evening . Chudinov was left battered and bruised after almost 12 rounds of punishment from Eubank . Ironically, the fight was almost scrapped an hour before the fighters were due to make their entrance when Chudinov's camp complained about the appointment of British referee Terry O'Connor. The issue was resolved at the death when Sweden's Mikael Hook stepped in but one imagines Mr O'Connor would have been less hesitant. A fast start by Eubank left his opponent, who held the WBA interim middleweight world title, with a cut over his right eye by the start of the second round. Eubank switched comfortably from boxing at range to working on the inside but was also guilty of excessive holding. The Russian had shown in the early stages that he was prepared to fight fire with fire but he was unable to string his punches together in response to Eubank's bludgeoning blows.

Chudinov was something of a sitting duck by the seventh round as Eubank picked him off with ease, forcing the doctor to check on the injured eye before the start of the eighth. And by the ninth, blood was coming from cuts on either side of his face, yet still he stood defiant. Only he will know how he survived the next two stanzas but finally, with 49 seconds left on the clock, Eubank delivered one final, bruising barrage before Chudinov was rescued from his plight.

"The trial of two men accused of strangling the daughter of Tyrone gaelic football manager Mickey Harte as she honeymooned in Mauritius is set to begin today. Michaela McAreavey, 27, was found dead in the bathtub of her and her husband John's luxury hotel room in the Indian Ocean island paradise last January - just two weeks after their wedding. The teacher had momentarily left her husband at the pool of the five star Legends Hotel to fetch some biscuits for a cup of tea. Death: John McAreavey and wife Michaela on their wedding day. Just two weeks later Michaela was found dead in a bath at their Mauritius hotel . Accused: Avinash Treebhoowoon (left) and Sandip Moneea (right) are standing trial this week for the murder . Nightmare in paradise: The couple's room at Legends Hotel in Grand Gaube, Mauritius . The case against hotel room attendant Avinash Treebhoowoon, 30, and floor supervisor Sandip Moneea, 42, will be heard in the country's Supreme Court in the capital city Port Louis. Treebhoowoon, from Plaine des Roches, and Moneea, from Petit Raffray, deny premeditated murder. Security has been ramped up around the old French colonial court building for what is one the most high-profile criminal cases ever held on the island. A jury was this morning sworn in for the trial, with six men and three women making up the panel that will hear the case. The jury selection process in the packed Court 5 of the Mauritian Supreme Court took just over an hour. Jurors then retired to select a foreman. Earlier, there were chaotic scenes outside as the two accused arrived. Mrs McAreavey's widower, John, also had to battle through an unruly crowd to get to court. High alert: Security has been ramped up around the Supreme Court in Port Louis, Mauritius . Accused: Avinash Treebhoowoon pictured as he arrived at the Supreme Court in Port Louis today . Happier times: Michaela and John with her father Mickey Harte, left, Bishop John McAreavey and the groom's father Brendan McAreavey at their  wedding at St Malachy's . Defendants Avinash Treebhoowoon and Sandip Moneea were led into the dock of court as almost 200 people crammed into every available space inside. Scores stood at the back. Relatives of the accused were also jostled as police struggled to control the flow of people into court. Mr McAreavey was accompanied by his sister Claire, father Brendan and a brother of his late wife, Mark Harte. Mr McAreavey sat in court for a short period but was then was asked to leave because he is a witness in the case.

Mrs McAreavey, from Ballygawley, Co Tyrone, was the only daughter of Mr Harte, the GAA boss who has steered his native county to three All Ireland championships. Mr McAreavey, a talented Gaelic footballer from Co Down, has returned to Mauritius with members of his and the Harte family. Mr Harte is not attending. Judge Mr Justice Prithviraj Fecknah will preside over the trial, which is expected to last two weeks. Thirty witnesses are listed to give evidence. The Legends Hotel, which has since been renamed the Lux Hotel, is in the fishing village of Grand Gaube, close to Mauritius's Grand Bay.

"Two NHS nurses and a healthcare worker have been sacked for Tweeting about patients and posting embarrassing photographs of themselves while on duty. In expletive-ridden rants, the nurses and healthcare worker joked on Twitter about patients’ anatomies and toilet habits, and one nurse uploaded an image of herself wearing hospital incontinence pads over her uniform when she was supposed to be working. Nurse Julie Dyde and healthcare worker Rachel Keys have both been sacked by Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, West Yorkshire, and nurse Caroline Luxford-Noyes, has been fired by Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, in Kent. Posing: Caroline Luxford-Noyes posted numerous pictures of herself in her uniform at work, one biting her lip . Luxford-Noyes also took a picture of herself wearing an incontinence pad and posted it on Twitter . The three women joked about being too hungover to work after they had been drinking heavily the night before. Mrs Keys, 36, who works for Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Trust, said she was ‘trying not to vomit’ and her colleague Miss Dyde, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, described nearly vomiting while performing CPR on a patient. Mrs Keys complained about being at a ‘higher risk of dying’ than her patients, to which Miss Dyde replied: ‘It was a toss up between you and bed 6.’ Julie Dyde posted a picture with the comment, 'We're a bit drunk' Luxford-Noyes posted a posing picture of herself at work last December and one of her chest in October . Miss Luxford-Noyes, from Aylesford, Kent, recommended taking a cocktail of painkillers to overcome the symptoms of a hangover and Miss Dyde boasted about having access to the hospital drugs supply, but added: ‘Harold Shipman ruined it for everyone.’ Mrs Keys and Miss Dyde made a series of insensitive jokes about patients which would have been visible to Mrs Keys’s 7,000 followers. Miss Dyde, going by the name of . Wardminion, complained about having to go to work and said: ‘If you live . in the Halifax/Huddersfield area please try not to have a stroke. Much . appreciated.’ When . mother-of-four Mrs Keys had a day off Miss Dyde said: ‘I will be at work . trying not to strangle people with suction tubing.’ In . another tweet Miss Dyde, who admits she ‘should have spent longer . “learning” compassion’, complained about patients using the nurse call . buzzer, and said: ‘97yo or not, use it again and I will hurt you.’ Miss Dyde . described one patient as looking like a corpse while Mrs Keys described another . as ‘sheet white, bog eyed [and] p****d’. On . another occasion Miss Dyde and Mrs Keys made light of being unable to . direct a woman in labour to the maternity ward because they were ‘beyond . stupid and tripping on NHS coffee and redbull.’ Miss . Dyde said: ‘Meanwhile very pregnant lady leaks amniotic fluid all over . the corridor and contemplates giving birth in the car.’ Miss Luxford-Noyes, 42, posted a picture bearing the statement: ‘Nurses...here to save your ass, not kiss it.’ A series of pictures were also posted to Twitter by Miss Luxford-Noyes when she was on duty. Miss Luxford-Noyes, who described herself as ‘winning at the NHS’, took 15 pictures of herself including one where she appeared to be trying on incontinence pads over her nurse’s uniform. Miss Luxford-Noyes posted a picture of herself using the toilet and a photograph of her own chest while wearing a protective apron with two holes pierced in it. A fourth picture uploaded by Miss Luxford-Noyes shows an NHS document entitled ‘Acutely Ill Patients in Hospital’ with the comment: ‘Can someone please read, digest and the explain this to me ASAP.’ Miss Luxford-Noyes, who claims to have worked at Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust for 20 years, also posted images of herself posing at work, despite acknowledging her ward was ‘busy’. After receiving an explicit image from a stranger on the Snapchat app, where users share pictures which delete themselves within seconds, Miss Luxford-Noyes tweeted: ‘Yeah, because as a Nurse I don’t see enough c***! *rolls eyes*’ The three Twitter accounts have since been deleted. A spokesman for Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust, where Miss Luxford-Noyes works, said the trust was 'shocked' to see these tweets, which were described as 'clearly inappropriate, misguided and in breach of our social media policy'. 'We were extremely disappointed with this . member of staff’s conduct, which fell way below the professional . standards we expect from our staff.' Julie Dyde, who admits she 'should have spent longer ""learning"" compassion', complained about patients using the nurse call buzzer, and said: '97yo or not, use it again and I will hurt you' Luxford-Noyes said in this picture, left, she was 'rocking the visor look' and posted others of her in uniform . After carrying out it an investigation into her Tweets, the trust fired Miss Luxford-Noyes from her nursing position. When approached for comment Mrs Keys said: ‘Nothing was inappropriate, I’m disgusted with this. I’m not saying anything.’ Luxford-Noyes posted various photos to her Twitter account, taken at work, including this one, inviting someone to 'lick it' Owen Williams, chief executive of Calderdale and Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust,  described the Tweets of Julie Dyde and Rachel Keys as 'deeply unprofessional'. 'Two members of staff were excluded pending a thorough investigation as soon as the content of the tweets was brought to our notice,' he said. 'Following the investigations there were disciplinary hearings within the Trust’s disciplinary procedure and both employees were dismissed.' He underlined the high quality of care being provided by a team of 50 doctors, nurses and therapists on the stroke unit. Miss Luxford-Noyes and Miss Dyde could not be contacted for comment.","The women joked publicly online about being too hungover to work .

"Amanda Knox, pictured after she was freed from prison in 2011, is being tried for a third time for the murder of Meredith Kercher in Florence, Italy . A lawyer urged an Italian appeals court on Monday to convict Amanda Knox of murdering British student Meredith Kercher and denounced how the American was soliciting donations in Kercher's memory. Francesco Maresca, in his closing arguments in the third trial of Knox and co-defendant Raffaele Sollecito, urged the panel of two professional judges and eight lay jurors to disregard Knox's claims of innocence and her criticism of Italy's judicial system as 'failed, or fallible'. 'She has become a well-known person. You know she signed contracts for millions of dollars for her book. She has someone who takes care of her public relations. 'She has a personal website where she invites people to collect donations in the memory of the victim, Meredith Kercher, which is an unbearable contradiction for the family,' Maresca said. He said the world's attention has focused . on Knox, while 'the victim has fallen into total oblivion, to the . immense pain of the Kercher family'. Knox is soliciting donations on her website for her defense as well as a separate, as yet-unspecified project in Miss Kercher's memory. She has remained in the United States, while Sollecito has attended some hearings and addressed the court in Florence. Amanda Knox's divorced parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, have made incredible sacrifices, taking out second mortgages and draining their retirement funds as they have paid out over $1 million in legal fees for their daughter. Maresca also urged the court to disregard Sollecito's statement to the court last month professing his innocence, noting that he had 'just returned from a vacation in Santo Domingo, where he is again in these days, as we are here hearing such an important trial against him'. Kercher, 21, was brutally murdered in November 2007 in the apartment she shared with Knox in the picturesque university town of Perugia. She had been raped and her throat slashed, her body left beneath a blanket in her bedroom. Prosecutors claim Knox and Sollecito carried out the murder with a third man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, who is serving a 16-year sentence. Meredith Kercher, 21, was brutally murdered in the university town of Perugia, Italy while studying abroad . The case was being tried for a third time after Italy's highest court vacated a 2011 appellate court ruling throwing out their initial murder convictions. The high court's scathing opinion tore apart the appellate court's decision to free the pair as full of errors and contradictions. Knox, now 26, spent four years in prison until she was freed in 2011 and returned to the United States, where she remains. Sollecito, 29, has attended several hearings of the current appeal. Defendants in Italy are not required to attend trials. Maresca urged the Florence appeals court to find Knox and Sollecito guilty of Kercher's murder, backing the state prosecutor's demands for sentences of 26 years for the murder and a four-year sentence for Knox for slander - up from the three years already confirmed by Italy's highest court. He called the ruling overturning the convictions 'science fiction', particularly when it came to undermining DNA evidence that was critical to the initial convictions. He said the first court's finding that Kercher's DNA was on the presumed murder weapon stands, that that there was no contamination of DNA attributed to Sollecito on Kercher's bra clip.

Amandaknox.com raises money for her defense fund as she is tried for a third time in the Italian courts . Maresca identified two pivotal arguments in the case against Knox and Sollecito: Knox's false accusation against a Congo-born bar owner and a staged robbery, both of which Maresca said were aimed at sidetracking the investigation. The Kercher family's legal team argued that the killing could not have been carried out only by Guede, reminding the court that Italy's highest court ruled that he had not acted alone. Maresca also argued that it would not have been possible for one person to inflict the kind of wounds that Kercher suffered: 43 in all, including 'three devastating' cuts to the neck. The other wounds were aimed at threatening the British student, and were found on her face, eyes, mouth, gums and teeth. He argued that two knives were used, the kitchen knife found at Sollecito's apartment that is the presumed to be the murder weapon, and a smaller knife. At the same time, Kercher had no defensive wounds, said Kercher family lawyer Serena Perna, indicating that someone held her back. No one from Kercher's family traveled to Italy for the closing arguments, but Maresca said her sister and maybe a brother would come for the verdict, expected in January.","Knox is soliciting donations on her .

"After eight laborious rounds, Tyson Fury belted out his own unique rendition of Walking in Memphis, a performance that proved more entertaining than the preceding action in the same ring. Fury was far from his best during a stoppage victory over Germany-based Romanian Christian Hammer who was pulled out by his corner two thirds of the way through the scheduled 12 rounds. As workman-like a performance as it was, Fury remains on course for a shot at the world’s finest heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko later this year. Tyson Fury gave a rendition of Walking in Memphis after labouring to victory over Christian Hammer . Fury's singing provided more entertainment than the eight rounds he spent fighting Hammer . The 6ft 9in giant risked his mandatory challenger status by taking on Hammer at London’s O2 Arena but never looked troubled by the smaller man. Having boxed beautifully for 10 rounds against Dereck Chisora last November, Fury delivered only in spells on Saturday night. When he kept Hammer at range, the visitor was left bewildered and with only a looping, inaccurate overhand right in response. Fury controlled the fight against Hammer as he made sure he kept his mandatory position . Fury is next in line to challenge the best heavyweight in the world, champion Wladimir Klitschko . Tyson made reasonably light work of Hammer, but adopted a cautious approach throughout . With so much on the line, Fury was not going to be caught with a lucky punch and his cautious style hardly made this a barnstormer. He did have Hammer on the canvas in the fifth session but the visitor managed to see out another three sessions before his corner took mercy. Fury must now wait to see if Klitschko can overcome Bryant Jennings in New York next month before the fight he craves can be made.","Tyson Fury needed eight rounds to beat Christian Hammer at the O2 .

"A new five-day break in Scotland is being launched which invites participants on 'an inner journey of discovery and remembering' with the goal of learning how to cope with loss. The retreat is aimed at those who have lost a loved one, or who are grieving for some other reason, such as relationship breakdown, 'empty nest' syndrome or simply a lost opportunity. Led by qualified counsellors, the holiday will be based in Ardoch House, in Scotland’s picturesque Loch Lomond National Park. The retreat is aimed at those who are newly separated or divorced and even empty nesters . Up to 20 people at a time can book on the retreat, and the cost of the five day break is £2,750 per person, not including travel. The plan is to hold the retreat four times a year at Ardoch House, offering a combination of 'cutting edge therapeutic interventions and ancient African ritual practices' for people grieving about a loss in their lives. The 133 acre Ardoch House estate has 17 bedrooms, a large dining room, numerous meeting rooms and a number of 'break-out spaces' for time out. The five day retreat will run in three stages, past, present and future, explains course leader Donna Lancaster, who is a registered member of the Health and Care Professions Council. The bonny shores of Loch Lomond, near Ardoch House which will host the new 'grief retreat' Lancaster has a degree in social work and has been coaching and counselling people for more than ten years. The  retreat will  implement meditation, visualisation, dance, breath and body work and other practices. Co-facilitator and qualified counsellor Gabi Krueger says losses can include bereavement, separation and divorce, but also a 'loss of innocence, betrayal of trust...lost opportunities.' 'The focus is on supporting people to grieve and let go of their losses and in so doing so allowing them to return to their natural state of well-being,' she says. Kruger has trained in various therapies, including Non Violent Communication (NVC), the Hoffman Process, Trauma Training and Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP). The retreat helps those who have suffered a loss or a relationship break-up, with counsellors on hand . The pair believe the course will be useful for people who recognise they have unprocessed emotions holding them back, or 'who feel blocked or hijacked by their life experiences and conditioning'. The pilot retreat is booked to run between April 7-12 with a second planned for June. Ardoch House is around 20 miles from Glasgow airport and has views over nearby Loch Lomond. Ardoch sits on the edge of Gartocharn, a village in Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park. The property stands alone on high ground in the middle of the 133 acre private estate. Hill walking, water sports and numerous golf courses are all close by.","Qualified counsellors will run the five-day grief retreat .

"Finland's largest airport will be the first in the world to track passengers' movements in real-time - from the car park to the departure gate. Dozens of sensors throughout Helsinki Airport will automatically pinpoint the location of mobile phones with wifi setting turned on  - as part of a plan that is drawing criticism from privacy advocates. The system, which aims to monitor crowds and eliminate bottlenecks at security checkpoints or shopping areas, will send alerts to passengers if their departure times or gates change. Passengers at Helsinki Airport will soon be monitored by mobile phone if they leave their WiFi turned on . The international airport, which is operated by state-owned Finavia and accommodates 15 million fliers a year, estimates 60 to 70 per cent of all visitors will leave their wifi turned on once the system is up and running by the end of the year. Finavia and Walkbase, a Finnish company that developed the technology, insist the system is secure and doesn't store or reveal any personal data belonging to the user or owner of the mobile device. Tuomas Wuoti, CEO and co-founder of Walkbase, told Bloomberg passengers' details will not be put at risk. However, privacy watchdogs are not entirely convinced. Antti Tikkanen, director of security response at software maker F-Secure, told Bloomberg: 'The fact that my movements are tracked is a scarier thought than someone knowing which websites I visit.' Airport officials insist the system does not store or reveal the personal information of mobile phone users . He added: 'I have a hard time believing location tracking is only left at statistics when the same technology makes so many other things possible.' Finavia says its system has clear benefits for travellers and will transform Helsinki Airport into a technologically-advanced 'smart airport' thanks to the ability to manage crowds. The system . uses nearly 300 small devices, including iBeacons and wifi routers, . which will discreetly monitor smartphone signals either passively or . with an app-based opt-in. About 150 white boxes will collect the unique identifier number, or MAC address, from devices searching for wifi networks. Retailers inside the airport can use the technology to notify travellers about special offers in their shops . The boxes are designed to scramble the information and forward it to servers. In addition to detecting crowding and congestion, the technology can be used by the airport's retailers to market their products to visitors.

"Humans have marvelled at the majesty of Stonehenge for thousands of years, but the famous landmark’s original purpose has remained a mystery. Now, a new technique has revealed 15 previously unknown Neolithic monuments around the mysterious monument in Wiltshire. And one archaeologist thinks they could provide evidence that the stone circle was at the heart of a busy heathen processional route over 4,000 years ago. Scroll down for video . A new technique has revealed 15 previously unknown Neolithic monuments around Stone Henge - and could provide clues about its original purpose . Archaeologist Vince Gaffney, of the University of Birmingham, is involved in the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project – a four-year collaboration with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Austria. The team has conducted the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding Stonehenge, covering around four square miles (6km), journalist Ed Caesar reported for Smithsonian. They discovered evidence of 15 unknown and poorly-understood late Neolithic monuments, including other henges, barrows, pits and ditches, which could all harbour valuable information about the prehistoric site. In the summer of 2009, geophysicists used magnetic sensors and ground-penetrating radar to scan the area around Stonehenge, detecting unknown structures. The sensors let experts detect evidence of ancient digging and buildings by mapping variations in the Earth’s magnetic field. Historians are not sure what purpose the Curcus served and Professor Gaffney describes it as a 'bloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge' ‘This is among the most important landscapes, and probably the most studied landscape, in the world,’ Professor Gaffney told the magazine. ‘And the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey. It won’t be the same again.’ Professor Gaffney believes these sites suggest Stonehenge was not an isolated monument in an unspoilt landscape, but that there was lots of human activity nearby. As long ago as 1620, diggers discovered cattle skulls and burnt coals buried in the centre of the stone circle and around 60 years ago, carbon dating of a piece of charcoal in a pit led scientists to believe that Stonehenge was erected in 2,600BC. In 2003, Mike Parker Pearson of University College London claimed that the workers who built Stonehenge lived in a nearby settlement of Durrington Walls, after unearthing evidence of huts, tools, and animal bones. He also said that the stone circle was a cemetery, as well as a religious monument. No-one is exactly sure why – and how- Stonehenge was built. Experts have suggested it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard. Some people think the stones have healing powers, while others think they have musical properties when struck with a stone. They could have acted as a giant musical instrument to call ancient people to the monument. What is clear, is that the stones were aligned with phases of the sun. People were buried there and skeletal evidence shows that people travelled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge – for whatever reason. Now, experts think that the route was a busy one and that Stonehenge could be viewed differently from different positions. It seems that instead of being a complete barrier, the Curcus acted as a gateway to guide visitors to the stone circle. In the latest study, which took 120 days spread over four years, the experts created a new map of the Stonehenge landscape. They included what we think of as Stonehenge, as well as a long strip of land called the Curcus, which ran east to west for around two miles (3km). It is thought the ditch barrier predates the stone circle by several hundred years. The Curcus barrows – mass graves – to the south of the Curcus were marked as well as the 15 new finds. It is hoped their contents will become clear with future excavation. Historians are not sure what purpose the Curcus served and Professor Gaffney as a ‘bloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge.’ Some experts think it was linked to the passage of the sun and this was supported by new clues. The team discovered gaps in the ditch including a large break in the northern side to allow people to enter and exit the Curcus. Professor Gaffney thinks the gaps served as ‘channels though the landscape’ to enable people to move north and south. He also found a huge pit at the eastern end of the Curcus, which is today 3ft (1metre) underground. No-one is exactly sure why - and how- Stonehenge was built. Experts have suggested it was a temple, parliament and a graveyard . Because it was large – 14.7ft (4.5metres) in diameter – the team thinks it was used for rituals as a ‘marker of some kind’. It is also located on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice. ‘We thought, that’s a bit of a coincidence!’ Professor Gaffney said. ‘That was the point at which we thought, What’s at the other end? And there’s another pit. ‘Two pits, marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice, set within a monument that’s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun.’ Professor Gaffney told Mr Caeser that on the longest day of the year, the pits form a triangle with Stonehenge, marking sunrise and sunset. He thinks they may have had fires burning in them and that the site was designed to be seen in the day and night, especially at sunrise and sunset. ‘Increasingly we can see the area around Stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement - which we can now understand, largely because we know where things are,’ he said. He also believes the building of Stonehenge was a ‘monumentalising’ of a procession.

"Today our methods of pinpointing locations on Earth are reliant on space-based satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). But scientists in the UK claim to have found a way to mimic the functions of GPS without sending anything into space. Known as a ‘quantum compass’, this revolutionary method would use the subatomic effects on Earth’s magnetic field and could one day be employed in smartphones. Modern satellite navigation systems like Europe's Galileo (artist's illustration shown) rely on space-based technologies, but a breakthrough by the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory could lead to Earth based 'quantum compass' navigation systems . GPS, although one of the great inventions of the modern age, has a number of limitations. Most notably, it relies on satellites being launched into space. Ultra cold atoms are cooled with lasers to temperatures a billion times colder than outer space. At their lowest energies the atoms become the coldest known bodies in the universe. These slow moving, low energy atoms are extremely sensitive to changes in the Earth’s magnetic and gravitational field. If trapped on a small device, like a trip, their tiny fluctuations can then be tracked from great distances away and their locations pinpointed with a huge degree of accuracy. Their lack of movement also makes them ideal for atomic clocks which utilise the ultra-regular absorption and release of radiation by their electrons during energy shifts as a highly accurate pendulum. Current atomic clocks are reliable to one second every billion years, with this limit created by the occasional collision of atoms within the clock. However laser cooling the atoms until they are near stationary significantly reduces this effect. And the US has previously warned that the system is at capacity and could be vulnerable to attack. But GPS is also limited with regards to submarines – when they dive underwater it no longer works. This means that when a submarine eventually resurfaces, efforts to locate it can be out by more than half a mile (one kilometre). A quantum compass would, apparently, reduce that inaccuracy down to just three feet (one metre). That’s according to the scientists behind the project at the UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in Porton Down, UK. And the breakthrough is all the more impressive for being impregnable, unlike GPS, ensuring that no outside interference can disrupt it. ‘There is nothing in physics that could be used - given the knowledge we have now - to disrupt one of these [new] devices,” Bob Cockshott at the National Physics Laboratory, who are also involved in the research, said in the Financial Times. But it’s not just militaristic applications that make this technology so appealing. The scientists say saw quantum compass devices could eventually be used in smartphones. Currently GPS does not work underwater, so when submarines dive and eventually resurface their location can have an error of about 0.62 miles (one kilometre). A quantum compass could improve this accuracy by a factor of 1,000, according to the scientists . Could Google Maps one day be powered by a quantum compass chip and not GPS satellites? According to the scientists, a true quantum compass can be built by 2019 . •  An ion microchip for more compact atomic clocks at the National Physical Laboratory. •  A portable atomic clock that could be used as a sensor to measure gravitational potential, from the University of Birmingham. •  A portable atom interferometer for greatly improved inertial navigation at Imperial College London. •  Hollow core fibre for a compact, low-power atomic clock at the National Physical Laboratory. • . Graphene atomic chips by the University of Nottingham for more energy . efficient electromagnetic sensors and highly accurate gyroscopes. •  A cheaper, more efficient source of laser cooled atoms that can fit on a postage stamp from the University of Southampton. 'The defence industry often acts as a pioneer in the development of new technologies and the potential benefits of a future in which we can navigate by inner space rather than outer space will impact both the military and civilian world,' says Neil Stansfield, Head of Knowledge, Innovation, and Futures Enterprise at DSTL, in a release . 'Quantum TNS [Time, Navigation and Sensing] technologies could bring game-changing advantages to the UK defence sector and support markets measured in billions of pounds, here in the UK and around the world. 'Whilst there are some significant obstacles, it's exciting to see how well-placed the UK is on the global stage to address the significant technical and systematic challenges that remain in commercialising quantum technologies and accelerating exploitation. It’s understood that companies including Nokia, Hitachi and Toshiba are all research such quantum technologies. In 2013 the UK announced an investment of £270 million over five years researching the possibility of translating quantum science to new products and services. Aside from navigation, quantum clocks could also be a lucrative market around the world. The exploitation of quantum mechanics that underpins the laws of nature at the smallest length scales has already given the world a wealth of new technologies including semiconductors, microprocessors, lasers, nuclear energy, thermal imagers and digital cameras.","Scientists at the National Physics Laboratory reveal new navigation system .

"Red-faced defence chiefs squandered millions of pounds on 6,000 pistols that were scrapped after just five years. In a damning example of waste of the Ministry of Defence, top brass bought the Sig Sauer handguns before ditching them in favour of Austrian-made Glocks. The embarrassing fiasco came at a time when the cash-strapped department was axing 30,000 troops, fighter jets, warships and tanks in a desperate bid to save money. Scroll down for video . Waste: The Ministry of Defence spent millions on 6,000 pistols which it ditched after five years (file photo) The MoD ordered the consignment of Sig semi-automatic pistols in 2008 as an Urgent Operational Requirement to enable British soldiers to protect themselves better in Afghanistan. But in January last year the Army announced that after extensive tests it was replacing the ageing standard-issue Cold War-era Browning pistol - introduced nearly 50 years ago - with the Glock 17 Gen 4 handgun. More than 25,000 are being purchased for Britain’s Armed Forces under a £9 million contract. The firearm - made famous in countless Hollywood movies such as Die Hard - is lighter, carries more bullets, fires more quickly and accurately, and is safer to handle than the Browning. But it has fuelled fresh criticism of the MoD's procurement policies, raising questions over why taxpayers' cash was splurged on the Sigs. The Treasury has spent £6 billion on Urgent Operations Requirements, or UORs, which has involved rushing new kit into service in Iraq and Afghanistan when existing equipment proves to be dangerously inadequate. Obsolete: Used between 2008 and 2013, the pistols were Sig Sauer models similar to the one above . Major Richard Streatfield, who served in Helmand with the Rifles, hit out at the purchase of the Sigs as an example of waste, rather than long-term capital investment. He said: 'What we've been having is the military equivalent of a fast-food diet. We need to get back to a more sustainable, balanced diet.' Major Gen Richard Semple, the head of the Army's Logistics and Support, denied that public money had been wasted. He said the Sigs had been used in Afghanistan and some of the money spent 'may well be recovered when they're disposed of'. An MoD spokesman said: 'It is wrong to suggest the MoD wasted money on Sig Sauer pistols, which were bought in 2008 to meet an urgent operational requirement and used by British forces in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years. 'By 2013, extensive tests showed the Glock pistol offered a better long term solution to replace the Browning in terms of its capability and value for money.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that a freak 30-minute hailstorm caused £10million damage to RAF planes in Afghanistan. Damage: Cricket ball sized hailstones also punched holes in Hercules transporter planes like the one pictured . Cricket ball-sized hailstones punched holes in five C-130J Hercules transport planes. Up to 15 other aircraft, including two VIP jets and Chinook, Sea King and Lynx helicopters were damaged, but the repair bill has not yet been calculated . The storm last April bombarded the huge NATO airbase in Kandahar causing 'serious damage'. The hail damaged 851 aircraft panels including wings, flying controls, windscreens and fuselages. Four Hercules, which operate as a 'taxi service' shifting troops, equipment and supplies around the warzone, were returned to the UK for repair work under Operation Weatherman at a cost of around £3million. The fifth was repaired in Afghanistan. The storm caused damage to 80 coalition aircraft - more in the space of an hour than the Taliban has managed in 12 years of war. It was so severe that three Afghan civilians were killed by falling balls of ice. Defence Minister Philip Dunne finally confirmed the details in answer to a parliamentary question. Some of the planes are still out of action. An MoD spokesman said: 'While we monitor the weather, this storm could not be predicted.'","Troops given the Sig Sauer guns for urgent self-protection in Afghanistan .

"The power of the internet has become painfully obvious to a number of Chinese citizens who have fallen victims to what officials call the 'human flesh search engine’. The phenomenon sees hundreds of thousands of online users target an individual in order to track them down, sometimes in order to right an action the mob deem ‘wrong’ or simply because their image has gone viral. It has been described as a vigilante movement, but due to the mob mentality, innocent people have found their lives ruined by being falsely accused of actions they did not commit. Rule of the online mob: The 'human flesh search engine' involves thousands of online users targeting an individual in order to track them down in real life . When an image or an event 'goes viral', meaning that it is being shared in large numbers on online social networks within a short space of time, causes are highlighted, news spread instantly and individuals gain momentary fame or end up ‘named and shamed’ across the globe. In the closed online community of China, where global communication hubs such as Facebook, Youtube and Twitter are blocked, these ‘viral’ causes tend to stay within the country’s borders. Despite official censors, who warned of the phenomenon last month, trying their best to monitor content to delete blog posts and comments that disagree with the hardline communist government, the internet moves too fast even for them. As China has the world's largest internet population with 591 million users – a number which is expected to increase to more than 750million by 2015 - the 'human flesh search engine' strikes swift and hard and can ruin a person's life in an afternoon. One recent example is a supposedly innocent taxi driver from the western Chinese city of Urumqi found himself accused of humiliating a homeless person in the street. The 'human flesh search engine': China has the world's largest internet population with 591 million users ¿ a number which is expected to increase to more than 750million by 2015 . When a witness spotted a taxi driver spitting on the elderly man on an Urumqi street, he or she noted the license plate and posted it online urging the 'human flesh search engine' to track the man down and make him pay. The post called for the responsible taxi driver’s details to be spread all over the internet so he could be ‘extinguished’ and forced out of Urumqi. Within hours, the online mob had located taxi driver Yin Feng. However, Mr Yin claims he is completely innocent. ‘All of my private information was made public. My ID card number, name, phone number, address, even my mother-in-law's phone number was dug out and posted online,’ Yin told the BBC. ‘I even received phone calls blackmailing me, threatening to burn my house down if I didn't pay them 200,000 RMB (£20,000).’ Another example is that of 'Milk Tea Girl' an innocent high school student whose photograph enjoying a beverage went viral. Zhang Zetian was snapped by a friend in 2009, after which her image spread on Chinese social networking site Renren.com. 'A newspaper reporter called me one day and suddenly I realised that people had noticed me on the internet,' Zhang told BBC, explaining that she remains an online celebrity several years later and that stalkers even tried to break into her university campus dorm. 'No matter where I go, people attempt to take secret photos of me,' she added.","Phenomenon sees thousands of online users targeting an individual .

"British soldiers have claimed their Afghan colleagues regularly take drugs and sometimes 'touch up the guys they were working with'. The soldiers made the comments as they raised concerns over the Afghan forces while speaking about the future of the country and whether the NATO mission was a success. The revelations come as Stanley McChrystal, former US commander General, warned Afghanistan could slip back into civil war if it does not continue to receive support from the West following the withdrawal of most international troops this year. British soldiers have described how their Afghan colleagues regularly talk drugs as they raised concerns over the country's forces (file picture) Speaking to the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, one of the unidentified soldiers, while talking about drug taking by Afghan soldiers, said: 'The men out there basically on a Thursday enjoy each other's company, it tends to be a Thursday Friday, and sometimes they would try, they would basically touch up the guys that they were working with and some things like that, especially if they were high, which for some unfortunately was quite a lot.' Another soldier, also talking about drug taking among the Afghan forces, said: 'You walk into their lines and you can smell it, you can smell they have been smoking weed and stuff like that. 'I think they are more interested in fighting, they are not interested in all the other bits and pieces that we have instilled into us as professional soldiers.' The news comes as Gen McChrystal said the prospect of renewed internal conflict was a 'worst-case possibility' which could be avoided provided the Afghan government received the backing it needed from its allies. The news comes as a former US commander warned Afghanistan could slip back into civil war if it does not continue to receive support from the West. File picture shows Afghan troops in combat training in July 2010 . In a separate report, he told the BBC Radio 4 Today . programme: 'I don't think the Taliban have the strength to come in and . take over Afghanistan and, clearly, I think the greatest danger is it . would break out into violence, either in direct civil war or maybe . multi-party fighting. 'But . that is the unnecessary outcome, in my view. There is enough capacity in . that country, and certainly enough ties that bind, to avoid that. But I . think that would be a worst-case possibility.' Gen McChrystal, who was the architect of the US troop 'surge' in 2009 but later resigned after critical comments he made about the Obama administration were published by Rolling Stone magazine, said the Afghans needed reassurance that help would be there if it was required. 'I think they do need partners as they go forward though, so I hope that a security arrangement is reached where they get some levels of support from people who have been their allies over the last decade and a half,' he said. General Stanley McChrystal said the prospect of renewed internal conflict was a 'worst-case possibility'. File picture shows Afghan National Army soldiers as they take part in a training session in March 2012 . 'What you really want is a consistency of partnership and that is to maintain in the minds of the Afghan people that we are reliable long-term partners and that is going to take enough people to do certain tasks, to provide some logistic support, to provide advice, and also to be around as a representation that they are not alone.' Gen McChrystal also expressed concern about the use by the Americans of unmanned drones to target leading Taliban figures. While he acknowledged that they could be a highly effective weapon, he said it was important to consider their impact on the local population.","Soldiers raise concerns over Afghan forces as they describe drug taking .

"A street robber shot dead a young woman who would not let go of her purse in Philadelphia last night. Recently graduated architect Amber Long, 26, died after she was shot in the chest by the gunman who stopped her and her mother as they walked in an upmarket area of the city. Miss Long was walking near her boyfriend's house with her mother, Stephanie Long, about 10.30pm Sunday in Northern Liberties, one of Philadelphia's trendiest neighborhoods. The two were walking back from nearby Center City back to get Amber's car, when they were approached by a man, who demanded money, according to CBS Local. Stephanie Long spoke about the incident on Monday, saying through tears that her daughter would not let go of a purse they had bought earlier in the day for just $14. The bandit opened fire on the keen dancer during a scuffle, shooting her in the middle of chest. Tragic: Stephanie Long (left) witnessed her daughter Amber Long (right) get shot in the chest during a robbery in Philadelphia on Sunday night. Amber died in hospital shortly after . Deceased: Amber Long, 26, has been described as 'extremely talented' and dreamed of being a certified architect. She was killed in a robbery on Sunday . Speaking to CBS Local about the death of her daughter, a grief-stricken Stephanie Long said the crime was 'senseless' A purse thief shot and killed a woman in front of her mother on Sunday night as they walked along a street in one of Philadelphia's trendiest neighborhoods, Northern Liberties. Here police are investigating the scene . 'She was extremely talented,' Mrs Long told CBS of her daughter. 'It was so senseless. We had bought that purse earlier that day for $14.' She wouldn't let go of it and he shot her. 'There was no reason. There was no point.' Mrs Long was not injured, but the thief made off with her bag. Long was rushed to Hahnemann University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead about 11.15pm. Investigators will review surveillance video from nearby buildings in the hope of identifying the shooter. Preliminary investigations suggest the man was white and wearing dark clothing. Police are still searching for the shooter involved in killing a woman during a robbery on Sunday night. They issued a $20,000 reward for information on the case . He is said to have gotten into a dark-colored Chevy Impala being driven by another man following the robbery. 'When . we have senseless crimes like this take place there's no reasoning . behind it,' said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey. The city offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case. Anyone with information should contact Philadelphia Police. Amber had written on her Linkedin page that her dream was to become a certified architect. 'The challenges in life feed into my ambition, and the research and hard work needed to turn those challenges into opportunities create the most gratifying experience of all,' she wrote on her profile. 'Fame can be overrated, however loving what you do is priceless.' It was the second shooting police responded to on Sunday night. Around the same time of the Northern Liberties shooting a teen was shot in the head and neck along the 3200 block of Kensington Avenue. The child was rushed to St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.","Amber Long, 26, was walking car near her boyfriend's house with her mother, Stephanie Long, about 10.30pm Sunday .

"They would have heard the roars across the entire United Kingdom even if ITV had switched off the sound. But it is the pictures beamed out from Belfast across the Irish Sea on to and out into the satellite ether which will carry Carl Frampton to global stardom. The exposure of The Jackal’s first world title defence on terrestrial television in Britain and to 55 more countries around the world will generate a huge new audience for one of the most exciting fighters in the world, let alone these sceptred isles.

When Frampton described this five-round demolition of Chris Avalos as 'easy' he did himself an injustice. The challenger came to fight in the warrior tradition of Mexican-American boxers and brought a fiery reputation with him. What he ran into in the bellowing cauldron of the Odyssey Arena was the performance which elevates Frampton to within touching distance of the world’s boxing elite. There was piercing assessment of Avalos, accurate and dispiriting counter-punching under early on, a vicious softening up of his opponent for three or four rounds. Then the savage finish which is the hallmark of real fighters. Carl Frampton lands a big right hand on a night he closed in on the world's boxing elite .

Avalos came in to cat-calls but met the screeches by climbing onto the ropes in his corners and pounding his chest in defiance. The Jackal entered the ring with bedlam prefacing his first defence of the IBF world super-bantamweight title. Frampton had said it's either fight or flight for his opponents in this cauldron. To his liking, Avalos came forward and was caught by enough right-hand counters to give Frampton the opening round. Avalos was again the aggressor at the start of the second and enjoyed some success off his left jab but Frampton was landing the heavier shots. Avalos was striving to make a brawl of it at close quarters but Frampton is a born fighter and gave better than he got to the body. The Mexican-American was using his head as a third fist and there was the beginning of a cut by his right eye. But he rocked Avalos with a succession of left hooks to move further ahead on the cards. Avalos certainly had come to fight and engaged in some furious exchanges – but Frampton’s speed and accuracy with both hands saw him begin to alarm his challenger with combinations of  a high order.

No sooner was Avalos back on his feet than Frampton was on him with a vengeance and not to be denied. A barrage of unanswered blows other than by a shaking of the Avalos head left Foster with no option but to stop it.

"Britain’s fastest snowboarder has released a death-defying video showing him being towed behind a commercial aircraft in Switzerland. Jamie Barrow, who is on the British Snowboard Cross Team, reached speeds of 78 miles per hour during his world’s first feat at the Engadin Airport in Switzerland. The inspiration for the stunt came from an old black and white photo of a skier being taxied by an aircraft in St Moritz Lake over 100 years ago, and as a result Barrow wanted to complete the feat at the same resort. The video footage was released following photos showing the 22-year-old's feat completed earlier this month. Barrow had hoped to perform the stunt on the frozen lake of St Moritz, but after the ice was considered too unstable the operation was moved to the nearby airport. Additionally, the initial plan also featured the plane taking off and pulling Barrow along while flying low, but again this was deemed too dangerous. In order to complete the stunt a long strip of snow-covered grass running parallel to the runway had to be piste-bashed. Jamie Barrow, 22, became the first person to snowboard while being towed to the back of a commercial aircraft in Switzerland . The snowboarder was fixed to the PC12 aircraft via rope and a wooden handle, which he used to hold on as he was dragged behind . Barrow attempted the stunt on a chilly, sunny day at the Engadin Airport near St Moritz, Switzerland . A long strip of snow-covered grass parallel to the runway was prepared for Barrow to snowboard along at Engadin Airport . Timings also had to be considered as private aircraft were landing and taking off throughout the afternoon. Towed by the PC12 aircraft with nothing more than a wakeboard cord attached to a wooden handle, Barrow was unable to communicate with Swiss pilot Duri Jos for the duration of the stunt. Further complicating the already dangerous endeavour was the fact that Barrow was unable to snowboard directly behind the plane and instead was forced to board on its right-hand side. As the plane accelerated down the runway the rope slack tightened and Barrow began speeding along in a remarkably straight and controlled manner. Due to safety concerns, Barrow was unable to snowboard directly behind the aircraft, so had to position himself off to the right . As the plane accelerated, the rope slack tightened and Barrow sped up along the snowy strip reaching speeds of 78mph . Onlookers held their breath as the aircraft powered down the tarmac, praying he wouldn't crash during the dangerous stunt . Onlookers held their breath as the aircraft powered down the runway, praying that he would not catch an edge and crash to the tarmac. Keeping calm and composed Barrow continued on safely through to the end before effortlessly skidding to a halt once letting go. And after completing one successful run, the adrenaline-junkie was keen to have another go. Following his first successful run, Barrow persuaded the pilot to allow him to complete two more for good measure . After his third run, which reached speeds of 78mph, Barrow celebrated with friends and family by giving his mum a big hug . Taking two more rides while hanging onto the aircraft, Barrow eventually reached the impressive 78mph speed, much to the delight of his family and friends. An ecstatic Barrow chatted with press after the event, adding that he'd wished he'd been able to go even faster – if the pilot had taken off – and hinted that there could be a follow up stunt in the future.","Jamie Barrow of the British Snowboard Cross Team reaches speeds of 125 km per hour .

"Google is paying a record $22.5million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking millions of Web surfers who use Apple's Safari browser. The penalty announced Thursday by the Federal Trade Commission is the largest fine imposed against a company for violating a previous agreement with the agency. In spite of their hefty payout, Google isn't admitting any wrongdoing in the latest settlement. Shady dealings: The fine comes as the FTC argues Google used it's cookie software to track user's information without their knowledge . They claim that the fine does not directly pertain to Google's data collection, but for misrepresenting what was happening. Last October, Google had signed a 20-year agreement that, among other things, included a company pledge not to mislead consumers about its privacy practices. The FTC opened its investigation into the Safari activities six months ago after a researcher at Stanford University revealed that Google had overridden Safari safeguards that are supposed to prevent outside parties from monitoring Web surfing activity without a user's permission. The tracking occurs through snippets of computer coding, known as cookies, that help Internet services and advertisers target marketing pitches based on an analysis of the interests implied by a person's Web surfing activity. Paying up: Google CEO Larry Page and his fellow officials deny any wrongdoing in the case but are paying the fine because they misrepresented previous findings . Google immediately withdrew its intrusive technology from Safari after the manipulation was reported. But the circumvention of Apple's built-in settings appeared to contradict a statement in Google's online help center assuring Safari users that they didn't need to do anything more to ensure their online activities wouldn't be logged by Google. The apparent contradiction between Google's words and actions became the focal point of the FTC investigation. Google's fine surpasses a nearly $19million penalty that the FTC slapped on a telemarketer accused of duping people into believing they were donating to charities. Google's stock price increased 60 cents to $642.83 in midday trading Thursday, after the FTC announcement.",Fine is the largest in the history of the Federal Trade Commission .
"A dad accused of killing his 10-week-old baby has claimed that his miniature dachshund tripped him, causing him to fall on the child. The murder trial of Anthony Casanova, 41, began in Muskegon, Michigan on Tuesday, 20 months after the death of his baby son, Tyler, at their home in Norton Shores in January 2013. Casanova has claimed he was holding Tyler in one arm and letting his dog in through a glass door, when the pet ran between his legs, tripping him and causing him to drop the baby on the carpet and then fall on top of him, Mlive reported. But in court, jurors heard how, during a three-hour interview with cops, Casanova eventually said that he had squeezed the crying baby twice before hitting his head against a bed multiple times. Scroll down for video . In court: Anthony Casanova, pictured in court on Wednesday, is on trial for murdering his 10-week-old son in his Michigan home in January 2013. Casanova insists he tripped on his dog and fell on the child . 'Proud': A picture shared in court shows Casanova with his baby son, Tyler, before the boy's death . Police and fire officials were dispatched to the home around 4pm on January 4, 2013 and found the baby not breathing. Detective Anthony Nanna previously told the court that, after hours of interviewing Casanova, the father admitted he had 'lost it' and squeezed the boy. He then took his son into the living room to make it appear as if the incident had happened there. Nanna attended the child's autopsy, where the doctor showed him previous and more-recent broken ribs, a lacerated liver, skull fracture, and bleeding on the brain. Heartbroken: Julia Striker, the baby's mother and Casanova's former girlfriend, appears in court on Wednesday. Casanova said he falsely confessed to killing the boy so that he could get home to her . Testimony: Paramedic Jonathon Degen points to where he saw and felt damage to baby Tyler's head . Discovery: Degen points to where he saw the baby inside the Muskegon home. Casanova told detectives in an interview that he had squeezed the baby and thrown him against a bed before taking him to the living room . On Wednesday, the jury members were to hear a recording of the apparent confession, which Casanova's defense team insists he only made after little sleep and much heartbreak. Claims: Casanova told cops and fire officials that he had tripped on his miniature dachshund, pictured . In court, the Norton Shores fire chief, a police officer, a police sergeant and a paramedic all testified that Casanova told them the same story about tripping and falling on the boy. The only difference between the stories was that, while he told most he dropped the boy and then fell on him, the fire chief remembers Casanova saying the two fell together. They also testified that bruises on the boy's chin and body appeared to be semi-healed, suggesting that they were not newly inflicted. Prosecutor D.J. Hilson has said he believes Casanova should be found guilty of first-degree murder, which comes with a mandatory life sentence. To secure this, prosecutors must show the dad intended to kill the boy or showed 'willful and wanton disregard' for the fact that he could harm or kill the baby. Hilson said he will prove that the boy had received multiple injuries, saying: 'This was no accident.' Casanova faces an open murder charge, however, meaning he could still face second-degree murder or a manslaughter charge. Loss: Baby Tyler was found unresponsive in his parents' home on January 4, 2013 and an autopsy later revealed he had broken ribs, a lacerated liver, skull fracture, and bleeding on the brain . But the defense team, led by Muskegon County Public Defender Fred Johnson insisted that the dog story was true and that Casanova, who has some learning difficulties, told detectives he'd shaken the baby so that he could return home to his fiancee. Johnson added that no family members had spotted signs of abuse on the little boy. 'What happened here isn't murder,' Johnson said. 'This man idolized this child. ... It was a tragic accident.' The trial has long been delayed due to legal wrangling. Most recently, prosecutors were granted permission to play Casanova's videotaped statement to cops.","The murder trial of Anthony Casanova, 41, started in Michigan this week, 20 months after his baby son Tyler was killed at his home in January 2013 .

The three-month-old pet fell out of his hutch and shattered his leg, a fatal injury for most rabbits as the bones are too small to fix. They are usually put to sleep. But Rufus is bouncing with health, and eager to explore. Vet Noel Fitzpatrick holds him securely. 'Rufus thinks he's fixed and he wants to hop around the room... but Rufus hasn't seen the X-ray pictures.' Those X-rays are extraordinary, proving why animal lovers know Noel as the Supervet. Rufus has had two metal plates implanted in his leg, fixed with 12 screws in a bone thinner than a matchstick. 'It was like drilling into cottage cheese,' Noel says candidly. Noel, whose work is explored in a new Channel 4 series, is on a mission to rescue animals like Rufus, the ones that conventional veterinary science agrees cannot be saved. His signature is the bionic op, where mechanical body parts are integrated with the animal's living skeleton to replace a paw or a leg. This pushes medical technology to the limit. 'The op I do isn't yet performed on humans,' he says. 'I hope the technology will one day help human amputees such as war veterans.' At the suggestion that people should get this revolutionary technology before animals, he becomes hyper-voluble. 'For a long time humans have taken for granted that they can have surgery made possible by experiments on animals, but the animals don't benefit. My purpose is to tell people about unconditional love for animals. This is the essence of life.' In the first episode of Supervet, an eight-year-old Labrador called Scooby is referred to him. Scooby has cancer, with a leg tumour that has left his bone looking moth-eaten. Noel Fitzpatrick with Oscar the cat who he gave a pair of prosthetic paws . The dog is in pain, but the family don't want to lose him - their son Freddie, 11, is devoted to his pet and his dad David is in tears too. There is no false hope for this family, and some scenes make difficult viewing. By amputating the diseased leg, Noel can bring Scooby a stay of execution - fitting an expensive prosthetic would bring unnecessary suffering. But on three legs, Scooby is able to enjoy life again. 'It's a big responsibility,' Noel admits. 'You're holding people's emotions in the palm of your hand.' Weekend's gardening expert Monty Don has personal experience of Noel's miracle touch. His golden retriever Nigel was paralysed when he burst a spinal disc and faced being put to sleep. In desperation, and on the recommendation of a friend, Monty contacted Noel - and received a return email within minutes: 'Bring the dog to me.' Six days later, after an intensive course of hydrotherapy and drugs, Nigel was back on all four paws. 'Noel is a brilliant technician but also a deeply emotional man,' says Monty, with unfeigned admiration. Whether it's a cat with metal blades for back legs or a tortoise with a wheel on his shell, Noel wants to restore them to health - even if he has to invent a new solution. 'People said this was impossible,' he says, surveying his operating rooms. 'But everything is impossible until we make it possible.' Supervet starts on Channel 4 in May.","Noel Fitzpatrick is known by animal lovers as the Supervet .

"Famed for his controversial shark preserved in formaldehyde, rotting cow and his skin crawling Let's Eat Outdoors exhibition featuring thousands of flies snacking on an abandoned barbecue, Damien Hirst's name has become synonymous with modern art. Over the years his works have netted him an estimated £350million fortune, with his most lucrative period coming between 2005 and the £111million sale of some of his work in 2008. But it appears that the market value of some of his art may have plummeted, according to figures from art company Artnet, with works from those most profitable years reselling for almost 30 per cent less than their original purchase price. Artist: Damien Hirst poses in front of his artwork entitled 'The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living' in the Tate Modern art gallery earlier this year . Valuable: Hirst's For the Love of God, left, sold for £50million, while Underworld, right, is also highly valued . A third of his 1,700 pieces that have gone under the hammer since 2009 have failed to sell at all, with a number of works not selling at London's Frieze art show this year and Sanctimony, a 2007 work featuring butterflies and household gloss failing to reach lowest pre-sale estimates by the end of an auction at New York's Sotherby's. The fall in value has been attributed to an over-supply of his work - a huge collection of work was created around the turn of the millennium with 218 items marketed at a 2008 sale, and critics questioning the shelf life of the work of some of the Young British Artists, including Hirst. Controversial: The Enfant terrible of the modern art world has caused a fuss with some of his work including . Away From The Flock, pictured . Georgina Adam, editor at large of The Art newspaper, told The Independent: 'I think Hirst was a very good artist at the beginning but he has been a fabricator of luxury goods for a long time now. 'If you have a very early work that will remain valuable, but if you bought a print for £10,000 I don't think you are going to get your money back.' Art market rumours suggest that his own dealers have stepped in to bid up the value of his work. His most expensive work For the Love of God, a diamond encrusted skull, shifted for a hefty £50million. Damien Hirst .

"Posters for the hit musical Spamalot jokingly announce that it was ‘lovingly ripped off from the motion picture Monty Python and the Holy Grail’. But there’s at least one man who’s unlikely to find that statement very funny. He is Mark Forstater, who produced the original 1975 film and is now suing the Monty Python team for a share of the profits from the hugely successful stage spin-off. Reunited: Michael Palin, Eric Idle and Terry Jones all gave evidence to the High Court . Mr Forstater, 69, described yesterday . as the ‘seventh Python’, claims he was promised an equal share of all . Holy Grail merchandising and off-shoots – along with stars Michael . Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Graham . Chapman. Spamalot has already grossed more than £110million during a four-year stint on Broadway. Yesterday, a judge at London’s High . Court heard how Mr Forstater, of Queens Park, West London, was in . financial difficulties having been declared bankrupt. His lawyer Tom . Weisselberg said the row broke out after the ‘huge international . commercial success of Spamalot,’ which is currently running in the West . End. He said that for financial purposes, Mr Forstater should be treated as ‘the seventh Python’. The Palace Theatre in London, where Spamalot! premiered in 2006 . He told Mr Justice Norris: ‘This claim . arises out of a dispute regarding profit-sharing of revenues from the . British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail. ‘Regrettably, the parties have not . been able to resolve the dispute. Mr Forstater is in difficult financial . circumstances and has been forced to bring these proceedings.’ He said the claim concerns the . interpretation of a profit-sharing agreement signed by Mr Forstater with . the Pythons’ company back in 1974, the year before the Holy Grail film . was released. The six Pythons: The comedy pioneers took on the legend of King Arthur in the 1975 film, which descended into typical Python madness within approximately 30 seconds . Victorious: Film producer Mark Forstater has won his High Court battle over royalties for the Monty Python spin-off musical Spamalot . Mr Forstater claims he signed an agreement to allow him one seventh of the Pythons’ share of any merchandising and spin-offs. The surviving Pythons claim this sum . was only ever 1/14. Exactly how much Mr Forstater is claiming was not . stated in court, but after the hearing he told the Mail he was seeking a . ‘ball-park figure’ of £250,000. Mr Weisselberg added: ‘We say it is . common ground that Mr Forstater was entitled to a share in the . merchandising and spin-off from the film. The dispute relates to the . extent of that entitlement. ‘The outrage expressed by a number of . Pythons in their witness statements as to the suggestion that Mr . Forstater was to be treated as the seventh Python is, with respect to . them, misguided.’ Jones, 70, Palin and Idle, both 69, . attended the start of the five-day hearing yesterday. They are expected . to give evidence next week. However, Cleese, 73, who lives in Monaco, . and Gilliam, 72, who is filming in Romania, will not appear. Written by . Idle, Spamalot opened on Broadway in February 2005 and moved to the West . End the following year. The sell-out musical, a comic take on the story . of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, has now returned for . another run in London. Monty Python's Spamalot! The play is inspired by the Holy Grail film from 1975 . Palin is reported as referring to the . money-spinning musical, which includes the hit number Always Look On The . Bright Side Of Life, as his ‘pension plan’. Forstater is also claiming entitlement to money from the film company Freeway Cam which owns the copyright to the Holy Grail. The hearing continues.

"An Ohio man was freed from prison after serving more than 20 years for a murder he claims he did not commit. Dewey Jones, 51, had been in prison since being convicted of the 1991 murder of 71-year-old family friend Neil Rankin and was released after DNA testing disputed that conviction despite not exonerating him. Mr Jones was originally convicted in March 1995 of robbing, beating and shooting to death at his Akron home. Further evidence testing found another person’s DNA on the rope used to tie Mr Ranking before his murder, but it was not Jones’. Write caption here . ‘I knew [this day] would come, I just never thought it would take this long,’ the wild-haired man told NewsNet 5. ‘The truth is the truth and it always comes out.’ Mr Jones was set free despite authorities not declaring his outright innocence, he repeatedly claimed the truth had finally come out. When asked what he thinks the truth is, the freed man said ‘I sure would like to know who I did 20 years for, I wish I knew what the whole truth was.’ Authorities have reserved the right to implicate him again should they see fit, but are not likely to retry the case due to a combination of witnesses passing away and evidence deterioration, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. Freedom: Dewey Jones embraces his son, Zack, in a gallery of family and friends after a hearing before Summit County Common Pleas Court that set him free . Mission accomplished: Attorney David Owens of the Univeristy of Chicago Exoneration Project, left, embraces Dewey Jones after the hearing . The defiant man practically dared prosecutors to haul him back in. ‘I’m ready to go to trial tomorrow, take me to trial, I’m ready,’ he said, becoming short of breath.. ‘I had nothing to do with it, no knowledge of it… they know it.’ Mr Jones, who according to records had previously been convicted of drug trafficking and passing bad checks, credited both DNA testing and the Innocence Project for his release. ‘That’s what probably saved me, what probably brought the truth out.' DNA testing done on the knife used to cut the rope to tie Mr Rankin down while he was killed, as well as the victim’s bloody shirt, did not match Mr Jones. It indicated another person was at the scene, according to NewsNet 5 . The Summit County Prosecutor’s Office referred the case to the Ohio Attorney General for further review to see if a retrial was possible while his lawyers argued for dismissal with prejudice, which would prevent another trial. ‘The anxiety and fear of having them come back after you in the future is something that we definitely want to eliminate,’ David Owens, of The Exoneration Project, told NewsNet 5.

"Executed: Humberto Leal Garcia lost his appeal against execution amid claims he was denied his rights under the Vienna Convention . A United Nations official said that the U.S. was in breach of international law when they put Humberto Leal Garcia to death in a prison in Texas last night. The 38-year-old Mexican citizen was executed by lethal injection for raping and bludgeoning Adria Sauceda, 16, to death with a 40-pound chunk of asphalt. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Leal's execution 'raises particular legal concerns', including whether he had access to consular services and a fair trial. Pillay also cited a 2004 International Court of Justice ruling saying the U.S. must review and reconsider the cases of 51 Mexican nationals sentenced to death, including Leal's. He claims this never happened. In his last statement before he died, Leal apologized to the victim's family and asked for their forgiveness, according to MSNBC. He said: 'I truly am sorry. That is all. Let's get this show on the road. 'One more thing: Viva Mexico, Viva Mexico' Texas executed Leal despite objections from President Obama's administration that the action would violate international treaty obligations and put U.S. citizens abroad at risk. The high court's 5-4 decision was a setback for the administration. Prayers: Relatives and friends of Leal take part in a mass to try to stop his execution in Guadalupe, hours before the U.S. Supreme Court rejected an appeal . Shrine: Leal's family display a collection of childhood photographs of the convicted killer on an altar at his aunt and uncle's house in Mexico . While there were few who doubted his . guilt, Garcia's lawyers said he was not given the chance to contact the . Mexican consul which was his right under The Vienna Convention. The White House also fear that his execution could affect U.S. diplomatic interests. Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, had already rejected appeals to stop the . execution from former president George W Bush as well as diplomats, . judges, senior military officers and the United Nations. Before the Supreme Court ruling came through a spokesman said the governor had no plans to halt the execution and the Texas Attorney General's office has urged the Supreme Court not to intervene. Leal made the 45-mile trip to the Huntsville Unit of the Texas Department of . Criminal Justice from death row at the Polunsky Unit, just outside . Livingston. Appeal: The Obama administration was keen to stop the execution believing it could be detrimental to international relations and affect the treatment of Americans arrested abroad . Humberto Leal Garcia asked for: . Prison officials described him as calm. Leal's final meal request included fried chicken, tacos, fried okra and a . bowl of pico de gallo. He selected a sister, one of his . attorneys and three friends to witness his lethal injection. Also scheduled to witness are two friends of the father of his victim, 16-year-old Adria Sauceda of San Antonio. Leal was convicted in 1994 of raping the girl before bludgeoning her to death with a '30 to 40-pound' piece of asphalt rock 'roughly twice the size of the victim's skull' in San Antonio Texas. 'There was a gaping hole from the corner of the victim's right eye extending to the centre of her head from which blood was oozing,' court documents read. 'The victim's head was splattered with blood.' Texas . authorities failed to tell Leal, who was born in Mexico and has lived . in the U.S. since the age of two, that under the Vienna convention he . was entitled to contact the Mexican consulate when he was arrested. Texas Governor Rick Perry brushed aside appeals from the United Nations and top diplomats to stay Leah's execution . Leal's . lawyers argued that the lack of consular access played a role in the . death penalty being applied because the Mexican national incriminated . himself in statements made during 'non-custodial interviews' with the . police on the day of the murder. Had Leal been given access to the . Mexican consulate it would have been likely to have arranged a lawyer . who would have advised the accused man to limit his statements to the . police. As it was, the Mexican authorities were never informed of his . arrest. However Texas officials argue . that Leal Garcia made statements to authorities before he was in . custody and thus outside the purview of the Vienna Convention. State . Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the federal government had . filed a brief with the U.S. Supreme Court on July 1 supporting Humberto . Leal Garcia's bid for a stay of execution until the end of this year. The UN high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, appealed to Perry to commute Leal's sentence to life imprisonment . She said: 'This is to allow some . consideration of the fact that Mr. Leal was not afforded a visit by . Mexican consular officials at an appropriate moment in the trial . proceeding - so to allow that to be taken into account.' The . Obama administration warned that allowing the execution to go forward . could have serious repercussions on U.S. foreign relations and . implications for Americans arrested abroad. In a letter dated June 28, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Attorney General Eric Holder . wrote: 'The United States is best positioned to demand that foreign . governments respect consular rights with respect to U.S. citizens abroad . when we comply with these same obligations for foreign nationals in the . United States.' A 2004 ruling by the International . Court of Justice held that the United States must review Leal Garcia's . conviction and sentence to remedy earlier instances in which the Vienna . Convention had not been honored in U.S. criminal cases. The . top U.N. human rights official last week urged Texas call off Leal . Garcia's execution, as have dozens of former U.S. law enforcement . officials and ex-diplomats who argue that it would put Americans at risk . in prosecutions abroad. Sandra Babcock, a Northwestern University Law School professor, has been hired by the Mexican government to represent Leal. She points to the fact that, three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a similar appeal by a Mexican national convicted in Texas who objected to the lack of consular consultation. She said: 'We have presented substantial evidence that in this case, the Vienna Convention really mattered. 'The fact is that, if Mr. Leal had received the consular assistance that he was entitled to, he never would have been convicted, let alone sentenced to death.' The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court, rejected Leal's request for a stay of execution. They claimed that Leal 'doesn't have a due process right to remain alive until the proposed legislation becomes law.' Texas executes more criminals than any other state and that has long caused friction with Mexico, which has no death penalty. Although the U.S. government has signed the Vienna Convention, Congress has not passed a law to implement it.","Humberto Leal Garcia executed yesterday .

"The suspect: Homeless teen Maria Garate was arrested and charged with assault of a four-year-old girl and her father with a deadly weapon, police said . The crazed homeless teen who mercilessly beat a young girl and her father inside a California Walmart with a crowbar has admitted 'hunting' for Asians, authorities announced Thursday. Maria Garate, 18, was arraigned on hate crime charges that will send her to prison for life if convicted for bashing a four-year-old Asian girl in the head with the crowbar Tuesday before her father intervened and was also attacked. 'She targeted the family because they were Asian,’ deputy district attorney Kalila Spain said during a media briefing aired by KPIX. 'She attacked them, this is a premeditated, willful, deliberate act on her part.' More details in the horror case emerged as Garate was arraigned on charges of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon in the commission of a hate crime. Garate admitted to detectives that she attacked the father and daughter specifically because they were Asian. Store employees holding the crazed teen down until cops arrived said she shouted 'that little Asian b***h deserved it' while writing on the floor and trying to break free. She was shackled, handcuffed and wearing a jail-issued jumpsuit during the short hearing, and appeared emotionless as the charges were read off to her. Garate did not enter a plea and was held without bail until her next court date, authorities said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Court appearance: Garate was informed her charges carry a hate crime accusation that would result in a life sentence if she is convicted . The young girl’s injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, store employees told KBCW, but Garate has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon. Garate is said by police to have walked into the Walmart with a crowbar and approached the father and daughter browsing the purse section without warning. She then whacked the four-year-old girl and then her father as he stepped in to protect her during the frenzied attack, said cops. ‘The female entered the store and, for no apparent reason, she drew a crowbar that she had carried from her person and struck the child at least twice in the head causing pretty serious injuries,’ A San Jose Police spokesperson told the station. Where it happened: The attacks is said to have occurred in the purse section of this San Jose Walmart . Police have not established a motive for the attack or said if Garate knows her victims. They were taken to a nearby hospital and released after being treated for their injuries. The teen lives in a nearby transient community known as ‘the Jungle,’ sources told the San Jose Mercury News. She is no stranger to authorities, but cops would not say why they came into contact with her in the past. Police also did not say if drugs were a factor. MailOnline was unable to reach a police department spokesperson for further information. Garate is being held in Santa Clara County Jail.","Maria Garate walked inside the store with a crowbar and attacked the father and daughter without warning, police said .

"A Russian TV news presenter who said the country's behaviour in Ukraine was 'wrong' during a live broadcast is being sent to Crimea by the channel's bosses. Abby Martin, a presenter on the Russia today television channel - which is funded through the Kremlin - denounced Russian action live on air. She said she 'would not sit here and apologise or defend military aggression,' before saying her 'heart went out' to the Ukrainian people who she described as 'the real losers here.' In an extraordinary move, Russia Today responded to her statement - saying they would be sending the presenter to Crimea to 'give her an opportunity to make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story.' Scroll down for video . Abby Martin, who works for Kremlin-funded Russia Today, said Russian action in Crimea was 'wrong' during her a broadcast . Ms Martin, a hosts on the American version of the channel, made her statement at the end of her show Breaking the Set. She said: 'Before I wrap up the show, I wanted to say something from my heart about the ongoing political crisis in Ukraine and Russia's military occupation of Crimea. 'Just because I work here, for RT, doesn't mean I don't have editorial independence and I can't stress enough how strongly I am against any military intervention in sovereign nations' affairs. 'What Russia did is wrong.' Speaking live from the show's Washington Studio, she continued: 'I admittedly don't know as much as I should about Ukraine's history or the cultural dynamics of the region, but what I do know is that military intervention is never the answer. 'And I will not sit here and apologize or defend military aggression.' 'Furthermore, the coverage I've seen of Ukraine has been truly disappointing from all sides of the media spectrum, and ripe with disinformation. The presenter added she 'would not sit here and apologise or defend military aggression'. Russia Today responded by saying they would send her to Crimea to 'make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story' 'Above all my heart goes out to the Ukrainian people, who are now wedged as pawns in the middle of a global power chess game. They're the real losers here. 'All we can do now is hope for a peaceful outcome for a terrible situation and prevent another full-blown Cold War between multiple superpowers. 'Until then, I'll keep telling the truth as I see it.' Russia Today later released a statement saying: 'Contrary to the popular opinion, RT doesn’t beat its journalists into submission, and they are free to express their own opinions, not just in private but on the air. 'This is the case with Abby’s commentary on the Ukraine. 'We respect her views, and the views of all our journalists, presenters and program hosts, and there will be absolutely no reprimands made against Ms. Martin.

A Russian soldier looks through the sights of his weapon as Ukrainian servicemen wait at Belbek airport . 'In her comment Ms. Martin also noted that she does not possess a deep knowledge of reality of the situation in Crimea. 'As such we’ll be sending her to Crimea to give her an opportunity to make up her own mind from the epicentre of the story.' Today in Crimea, Russian troops in control of the Belbek air base fired warning shots into the air. Wahl has accused the state-funded Russia Today of deliberately smearing America in order to make the Kremlin - and Putin - look good . About a dozen Russian soldiers at the base warned the Ukrainians, who were marching towards them without any weapons, not to get any closer. They fired several warning shots into the air and said they would shoot the Ukrainians if they continued to advance. The stand-off came as Vladimir Putin ordered thousands of Russian troops participating in military exercises near Ukraine's border to return to their base.","Russia Today news presenter Abby Martin said country was 'wrong'

"For most youngsters, a withering personal put-down by their hero on social media would be the most crushing of blows to their self-esteem. But then, not all teenagers are like Jason Cummings. The 19-year-old Hibs striker might have expected his former Easter Road idol Leigh Griffiths to be thrilled for him after he scored a stunning double in the shock 3-1 victory over Rangers at Ibrox last month. But instead Cummings drew fierce criticism online after boasting in a post-match interview that he had shown ‘the touch of an angel’ in the build-up to his opener against Ally McCoist’s side. Jason Cummings accepts his award for SPFL Young Player of the Month for September . Cummings (left) breaks away from the challenge of Raith Rover's Kevin Moon (right) Cummings has impressed so far this season, scoring four goals in seven Championship matches . And one of the most scathing barbs came from Celtic star Griffiths, who dismissed the player as ‘a Billy big time’. However, when asked about his idol’s negative response yesterday after scooping the SPFL young player of the month award for September, Cummings refused to be dragged into a war of words with the man whose feats he hopes to replicate in Leith - and insisted he had taken his jibe as a compliment. ‘I’m on social media and you always get good things and bad things. You just take it with a pinch of salt,’ said Cummings. ‘It’s always from outsiders, the people who are behind it are people who don’t know what they are talking about. ‘I just concentrate on what I do in here and I try and take it out onto the football pitch. ‘I wasn’t bothered about what Leigh said - I loved it! Just for Leigh to even tweet me was great. Cummings (second left) celebrates with his team-mates after putting Hibs 0-3 up against Rangers . Cummings (right) has attracted a lot of attention for his eccentric use of language . ‘I’ve always liked him as a player and looked up to him. What he did here was outstanding. ‘The fans loved him because he scored goals and that’s all I want to do. If I could do half of what he did then that would be perfect. ‘The fact he even noticed me shows I am doing the right things - and it’s better being noticed than having nothing to say.’ Cummings only made his Hibs debut last season but has quickly gained a reputation for his eccentric use of language. The former Hearts kid, released by the Tynecastle club at 16 after suffering a knee injury, was working as a gardener just over a year ago until the Leith club took a chance on him. And he raised eyebrows last season when he described one of his two goals against Hamilton Accies in the first-leg of their Premiership play-off by saying: ‘It was some zing, I opened a tin of beans there.’ Not even missing a penalty in the second-leg shoot-out, which helped condemn Hibs to relegation, could dent the lad’s confidence for long. Leigh Griffith's tweet about Cummings was far from endearing, calling the Hibs man '#billybigtime' Raith Rovers' Liam Fox (right) challenges Hibs' Cummings during the two sides' recent match . Head coach Alan Stubbs, for his part, has confessed that he just has to shake his head at times at Cummings’ wacky one-liners. But even though the youngster is adamant he will not change his individual off-field style, he insists that he takes his football extremely seriously. It’s certainly the least Stubbs can expect with his team now 12 points adrift of Championship leaders Hearts following last weekend’s 1-1 draw with Raith Rovers. Speaking ahead of this afternoon’s home encounter with Ian Murray’s Dumbarton, a match Hibernian must surely win to retain their fading promotion hopes, Cummings acknowledged the seriousness of the club’s plight and the desperate need for points if they are not to completely lose touch with Hearts and Rangers. But he also summed up his own off-the-wall attitude to life by saying: ‘It’s a short career so you need to enjoy it when it’s happening. Cummings was not the only Hibs man to pick up an award - Alan Stubbs won Manager of the Month . ‘But I do take my football very seriously. I try to eat well and not go out and drink at the weekend, I want to do those things right. I go to the gym and all that. ‘But when it comes to after the game I like to have a laugh. We had just beaten Rangers 3-1 - you can have a laugh then. ‘During the game I don’t do that, I know you can’t muck about. ‘But when the time is right you have to have a laugh. If I didn’t enjoy football I wouldn’t play, and I want to keep enjoying it. ‘It’s all about having a good laugh, isn’t it? ‘This isn’t a dress rehearsal, it’s life. Heff (Paul Heffernan) just taught me that one! You have just got to try and enjoy life and that’s what I am doing. I’m still young so you’ve got to enjoy it. ‘The boys have a bit of banter with me. Someone just called me Angel Gabriel before I came out here. ‘But I love it. They call me everything, I get all sorts, that’s what it’s all about. It’s the job I have always wanted to do and it’s the best job in the world for me.’","Jason Cummings scored two goals against Rangers last month, and was given the award for SPFL Young Player of the Month for September .

"The mystery of a Russian-born British media magnate who disappeared four years ago amid fears he was the victim of a KGB plot may finally have been solved after the discovery of a body. Police in Latvia believe they have found the corpse of Leonid Rozhetskin, a jet-setting filmmaker and  co-founder of the free London business newspaper City AM, hidden in a remote forest. The flamboyant lawyer and tycoon, who liked to dine at the Wolseley in Piccadilly and at the fashionable Japanese restaurant Nobu, vanished in March 2008 from his blood-stained £1 million holiday villa in the Baltic Sea resort of Jurmala. At the time he was embroiled in a business dispute with a close associate of President Vladimir Putin. Flamboyant: Leonid Rozhetskin, pictured in 2006 with his partner Natalya Belova, left, and model friend Victoria Silvstedt, right, vanished in March 2008 . Mr Rozhetskin is thought to have angered Leonid Reiman, a friend of Mr Putin and at the time Russia’s powerful telecommunications  minister, during a £130 million deal involving a mobile phone company in which Mr Reiman was alleged to have had financial interests. Legal action was threatened and the previously extrovert Mr Rozhetskin became reclusive and surrounded himself with bodyguards before fleeing abroad. Mr Reiman has vehemently denied any wrongdoing. Yesterday Mr Rozhetskin’s New York-based mother Elvira, 72, told how she received a mysterious phone call from a Russian-speaking man who said that a body had been discovered. ‘He said that a man had been found in the forest near Tukums in Latvia and there was a credit card on the body with my son’s name on it.’ Leonid Rozhetskin's mother Elvira, 72, believes her son was the victim of a KGB plot . When her son went missing, she claimed he had been murdered because he was committed to exposing corruption in Mr Putin’s government. Mrs Rozhetskin told The Mail on Sunday at the time: ‘My son isn’t missing. My son is dead.’ Days before his disappearance,  the 41-year-old had moved his  partner Natalya Belova, a glamorous blonde former model 17 years his junior, and their son Max, then aged three, into a £3 million apartment in Central London which he intended to be the family’s main home. Mr Rozhetskin had told friends he feared for his life, and had opted to live in London for security reasons and because he wanted his son to have a British education. Police in Riga confirmed last week that they had found a body along with a credit card belonging to the tycoon. The badly decomposed remains are undergoing DNA and forensic tests and results should be known this week, but a senior police source close to the four-year investigation said: ‘It is very likely that the body is Leonid Rozhetskin’s.’ If the remains are identified as Mr Rozhetskin’s, it will be a major breakthrough in one of the most disturbing cases linked to Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. There have been persistent claims Mr Rozhetskin staged his death and fled to the United States, possibly under the witness protection programme with the help of the FBI. Deepening the mystery, his £9 million plane left Latvia soon after his disappearance and in the following days flew on an unexplained odyssey that took in Vienna, Geneva, Norway, Newfoundland and Luton. Then, late in 2008, a former close business partner of Mr Rozhetskin, Vladimir Smolyaninov, claimed he had been told that the tycoon had  received plastic surgery in Miami and was living under an assumed identity in the Caribbean.","Police in Latvia believe they have found the body of Leonid Rozhetskin, who vanished four years ago .

"ITV has been ordered to treat Ukip as a ‘major party’ in the run-up to the European  Parliament elections in May. In a landmark ruling, broadcasting regulator Ofcom last night said the anti-EU party’s success in previous Euro elections meant it should be put on a par with the other main parties. ITV and Channel 5, which are regulated by Ofcom, were ordered to grant Ukip ‘major party status’ in the run-up to May’s elections, guaranteeing it increased coverage. Broadcasting regulator Ofcom said the success of Nigel Farage's party in previous Euro elections meant it should be put on a par with the other main parties . The decision means Ukip will be granted the same number of party election broadcasts as Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, and can expect to have its views given ‘due weight’ in news programmes. A BBC source last night said Ukip could expect to receive ‘the same level of coverage as the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems’. Ofcom’s ruling – which fell short of Ukip’s demands to be treated as a major party on a permanent basis – will also fuel the debate about how the broadcasters treat Ukip during next year’s General Election, including the question of whether party leader Nigel Farage should be included in any televised leaders’ debates. Ofcom's ruling will prompt the questionof whether party leader Nigel Farage should be included in any televised leaders' debates, such as this one in 2010 which featured Nick Clegg, David Cameron and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown . It came as a major new poll revealed that Ukip voters are more likely to be factory workers in the Midlands than tweedy Tories in the Home Counties. The Populus survey of more than 14,000 people suggests that Ukip’s support is drawn disproportionately from working-class and lower-middle class voters, with those in the top three social groups accounting for only 45 per cent of its vote. By contrast, the Tories and Lib Dems both draw 63 per cent of their support from the top three social groups, while Labour is on 53 per cent. The poll suggests Ukip voters are also . less likely to have gone to university, with 76 per cent saying they . gained their highest qualification at secondary school, compared to a . national average of 60 per cent. The . findings suggest that Mr Farage’s appeal has reached far beyond its . original base among disaffected Tory voters in the South. They reinforce . recent byelection results suggesting that Ukip is gaining ground among . working-class voters in the Midlands and the North. But . the results also show that Ukip’s supporters are disproportionately . male and older. Some 63 per cent of the party’s voters are male, and 59 . per cent are aged over 65, with just 9 per cent of Ukip’s support coming . from the under-35s. The Populus survey of more than 14,000 people suggests Ukip's support is drawn disproportionately from working-class and lower-middle class voters . Laurence Stellings, associate director at Populus, said the findings suggested it will not be straightforward for the Conservatives to claw back disaffected voters. ‘If you look beyond the headlines you can quickly dispel the casual stereotypes about Ukip supporters,’ he said. ‘They are not just grumpy shire Tories as some suggest. In fact, your typical Ukip supporter is a working-class male from the Midlands. Perhaps the most striking feature of Ukip’s support is just how male it is. ‘You don’t win back voters like this by simple positioning on immigration and Europe. The challenge for David Cameron and others is a lot more difficult than that. He has to find some way to show that he is genuinely on their side.’ The poll put Labour in the lead on 37 per cent, followed by the Conservatives on 33, Ukip on 14 and the Lib Dems on 10. It also revealed that Ukip  voters have the lowest average incomes, while Tory supporters have the highest. Ukip voters are overwhelmingly male compared to the other parties, who are more evenly split between men and women . Ukip voters are much more likely to be over 65, with Labour having the highest proportion of 18-34-year-olds . The Lib Dems take most of their support from the south, while Labour's appeal is more evenly spread . The average Ukip voter has an income . of £25,410 – £1,500 below the UK average of £26,980. By comparison, the . average Tory voter is on £29,720, while Lib Dem voters earn £28,730 and . Labour voters receive £26,460. The . poll suggests the Tories remain the party of home ownership, with 81 . per cent of supporters owning their own property, compared to just 57 . per cent of Labour voters. Labour has three times as many non-white voters as the Conservatives. The survey also revealed that David Cameron’s ‘problem’ with women voters is easing. Downing . Street has become sensitive to charges of sexism in recent years, but . the Populus poll suggests Tory support among women voters is broadly . similar to the other parties. Some 46 per cent of Conservative voters . are women, compared to 47 per cent of Labour voters, 48 per cent of Lib . Dems and 37 per cent of Ukip supporters.","Ofcom rules ITV must treat Ukip as major party for European elections .

"A micro-brewery based in Tooting may have to stop producing an award-winning Citizen Smith-themed beer following objections from actor Robert Lindsay. The small By The Horns Brewing Company claims to have been told it must stop producing its popular Wolfie Smith Amber Ale if it insists on carrying a label with an image of Lindsay in the guise of Citizen Smith - the hapless Marxist he played in the popular sitcom of the same name between 1977 and 1980. The brewery, which created the 5.2 per cent strength ale last year as part of a range celebrating life in London, says an agent working for Lindsay made contact to say the actor did not want to be linked with an alcoholic beverage. Cease: The small By The Horns Brewing Company claims to have been told it must stop producing Wolfie Smith Amber Ale with labels bearing an image of actor Robert Lindsay in the guise of Citizen Smith . By The Horns sells bottles of Wolfie Smith Amber Ale in pubs and shops across London, but says it did not want to risk a legal battle over the label design as it is still only a small business. Speaking to the Evening Standard, brewer Alex Bull, 28, said: 'We did not feel we could go down the route of a court case.' 'We have considered ways of changing the bottle and cask. We might put a red star over his face, but we want to keep the name,' he added. 'It's a big shame but we are going to have to get rid of Wolfie Smith's well-known face and redesign the bottle that everyone loves,' Mr Bull went on. Linday's spokesman declined to comment. Halt beer: Chris Mills, 29, brewer and co-founder of By The Horns Brewing Company. He claims the small brewery has received a cease & desist order from actor Robert Lindsay over their popular Wolfie Smith ale . Freedom: The sitcom Citizen Smith (pictured) starred Robert Lindsay as hapless Marxist Wolfie Smith . The former City finance analyst founded By The Horns with his friend Chris Miles, 29, with the company producing a range of beers based on London life, including Lambeth Walk, Diamond Geezer and Stiff Upper Lip. But it is their Wolfie Smith Amber Ale product - described as having a light caramel flavour with a big hop finish and a bitter bite - that has proven most popular. By The Horns began as a Sunday morning hobby, with Mr Bull and Mr Miles using a homebrew kit to create a new batch of beer once a week. Eventually they realised the beer they were producing was of high enough quality to sell, hich led them to purchase brewing kits big enough for commercial production, which they housed in an industrial premises in Summerstown, south west London. It was this location that led them to name on of their creations Wolfie Smith Amber Ale, as the site was less than a mile from the setting of the popular 70s sitcom Citizen Smith. The programme, which was created by Only Fools and Horses writer John Sullivan, starred Lindsay as Marxist 'urban guerilla' Wolfie Smith, whose plans to establish the south London suburb as a Marxist enclave continually fail due to his disorganisation.","Actor says small brewery must stop using images of him in Citizen Smith .

"Taxidermy: A Swiss zoo which killed a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it (pictured) to teach children . A Swiss zoo which provoked outrage by killing a healthy bear cub is now stuffing it to teach children how cruel nature can be. Known only as Cub Four, the three-month-old brown bear was put down to 'spare it any distress' when it started being bullied by its jealous father at Bern's Dahlholzli Zoo. Now zoo bosses have hauled the cub's corpse out of a deep freezer and are stuffing it to create a display about the harsher facts of life. A zoo spokesman said: 'The preparation of Cub Four was launched on Tuesday in the first stage. 'The deep-frozen bear was thawed overnight and X-rayed for scientific purposes. The award-winning taxidermist Sabrina Beutler separated the coat from the rest of the body, and it has been tanned. 'The carcass has been measured exactly and it will have lifelike realistic postures to reflect the beauty and perfection of the animal. 'The prepared cub will be used in the future for school purposes in the zoo's education. 'Active observation and experience of animals in their natural environment and understanding of skins, bones or whole-body preparations are particularly important. 'The emphasis here is an emotional experience, in which nature with all its facets - 'beautiful' or not - can be brought closer and made more tangible for children.' The bear will be stuffed using the dermoplastic method, which involves draping the animal's tanned skin over an artificial, stylised body. Cub Four was one of two born at Dahlholzli Zoo in January to Misha and Masha, who were gifts from then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev in 2009. But the relationships within the bear family went awry when Misha, the male, brutally killed Cub Four's sibling Cub Three in April. To the outrage of campaigners, keepers refused to separate the animals even after the killing in front of horrified families. Horrified: The cub, pictured, was put down by keepers in April at Dahlholzi Zoo in the Swiss capital Bern . Distress: The cub, nicknamed Cub Four, was not separated from its father even after its twin Cub Three was killed in the enclosure. It is common for males and even females to kill their own cubs . Keepers claimed the mother of the cub, right, was neglecting it and they could not account for nature's course . When 360kg male Misha started being aggressive towards Cub Four a week later, zoo chiefs decided to kill the cub instead of raising it in solitude. Swiss Animal Protection, the country's oldest and largest animal rights group, was in uproar. A Danish zoo sparked international outrage after killing an 18-month-old giraffe to prevent inbreeding - then dissecting it in public. Copenhagen Zoo killed Marius with a bolt gun, dissected him before a crowd and fed him to lions earlier this year, drawing criticism from animal rights campaigners around the world. But the controversy did not stop there. Shortly afterwards the zoo euthanised four lions. It condemned the action in the 'strongest possible terms' and said the zoo had massively . mishandled the situation. A . spokesman for the group added: 'It is not natural to keep the male bear . with the offspring, and there was more than enough space to have kept . him in a separate part of the cage.' In . the wild, female bears typically drive away males to protect cubs because . males can see them as rivals and try to kill them. Despite this, the zoo defended its position even after the first cub was killed last Wednesday. Keepers said separating Misha or Masha from their cub would lead to other problems, and cause lasting damage for the welfare of all the bears involved. Jürg Hadorn, the zoo's deputy . director, said in April: 'After 12 weeks it was clear that Masha was . irreparably neglecting her role as mother of cub number four. 'Together . with the fact that the male bear Misha had started demonstrating the . same aggressive behaviour as he did to cub number three, in order to . protect cub number four from more stress and pain, we decided to act. As . a result the baby bear was euthanised by a vet. Attack: Horrified families looked on as Misha killed the first of the cubs, Cub Three, pictured. Males often turn against their cubs because they see them as competition, and even females can attack their young . Killed: Cub Three being mauled by its father in April. A week later, Cub Four was put down . Torn apart: 360kg Misha killed his other cub (pictured) but keepers refused to intervene in nature's course . Pictured: The cub which was killed. Switzerland's animal rights group condemned the decision . 'It remains unclear now as then as to why our bears behaved in this way. After killing cub number three on April 2 there was an uneasy truce for 48 hours but since the weekend Misha again started to show the same aggression. 'Misha and Masha are lovely hand-reared orphaned bears who came to us in 2009. They never had the chance to learn from other bears how to behave and their mothers were killed by poachers. 'We have tried when they were here to . keep as much distance between them and humans as possible. Our priority . is the two adult bears. 'Having . young animals is a natural part of the life cycle of every animal and . we wanted to ensure that Misha and Masha had the chance as well. 'But . the loss of the young animals in a biological sense and also according . to basic principles of good animal protection are less serious than the . loss of an adult. Euthanised: The cub put down by the zoo (pictured) was born in January and was one of two . Expert: Brown bear specialist Prof Djuro Huber said bears' natural aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill his cub in the zoo' 'Because Misha and Masha appeared to be clearly unable to fulfil their role as parents, Misha will be sterilised.' He . added he did not want to see a repeat of Knut the polar bear, who was . effectively sentenced to a life of solitude in a Berlin zoo after being . rejected by his mother. In 2007, an animal rights activist controversially said Knut should have been killed rather than being held in captivity alone. Yet . when two cubs were born at another Swiss zoo in January this year, . keepers solved the problem by separating the parents and leaving the . cubs with their mother. Ursina gave birth to King and Zoe at Juraparc animal park near Vallorbe, just 60 miles from Bern. Professor . Djuro Huber, chairman of the brown bear expert team for the . International Union for the Conservation of Nature, said bears' natural . aggression was well-known and it was 'a shame to allow the male to kill . his cub in the zoo'. Different policy: Sixty miles away, two cubs born at the Juraparc animal park were separated from their father . Happy family: A cub in Jaraparc with its mother. The Bern zoo said it was worse to lose an adult than a cub . He told . MailOnline during the controversy in April: 'In nature the male bear . separates from the female after mating season and is not present with . his cubs. 'It is not unusual that the male kills his cubs in captivity. Even the mother sometimes does.' But he added: 'Zoos have too many captive bears and it is almost impossible to send them somewhere. Surplus bears have to be euthanised, and it is better to do that at a very young age when the mortality in nature is also the highest.'","Cub was among two born to Misha and Masha at Dahlholzli Zoo in Bern .

"The nephew charged with shooting hip-hop artist and reality TV star Benzino shot his uncle during his own mother's funeral procession out of self-defense, a court heard on Monday. Gai Scott, 36, of Randolph, Massachusetts, pleaded not guilty in Plymouth District Court to armed assault with intent to murder after an argument broke out as the service was making its way through the streets of Duxbury, Massachusetts, on Saturday, headed for a church in Plymouth. Scott shot 48-year-old Benzino - who was born Raymond Scott and is the former owner of hip hop magazine The Source - as the singer pulled up in his car at the cavalcade about 11.55am. Sources say Scott was behind the wheel of his Bentley and pulled up alongside Benzino's red Dodge SUV and opened fire, striking him three times. Self-defense: Gai Scott, nephew of rapper Benzino, has pleaded not guilty to armed assault with intent to murder and says that he shot his uncle in self-defense .

Benzino was taken to South Shore Hospital with non life-threatening injuries and was released on Monday. Scott was held without bail pending a hearing Wednesday to determine whether he is a danger to society. 'When the dust settles with respect to this case, it's going to be abundantly clear that Mr. Scott, a licensed gun owner, was acting in self-defense and in defense of his family,' said Jon Ciraulo, Gai Scott's lawyer. The Plymouth district attorney's office said in a statement that 'growing family tension' between the men was behind the shooting. The funeral was for Benzino's mother, Mary Scott, who passed away on March 20, and resumed as usual after shooting, ending at St Peters Church. Benzino posted pictured of himself on Instagram on Sunday, saying that he believes the hand of his mother saved him.

Father William Williams, who presided over the ceremony, recalled seeing blood on the vehicles in the funeral cortege. 'I said to one of the guys, ''There's blood on the hearse’',' the clergyman told the WHDH news station. Benzino said he had paid his respects to his mother in private at a Quincy funeral home but that he was not actually going to the funeral because of tensions in the family over money. Benzino, a Boston native who now lives in Atlanta, said he was on his way to Plymouth to pick up a friend when he stumbled upon the procession and someone attacked him.

"A huge debate has erupted over how Muslim stars will prepare for crucial knock-out matches now that Ramadan has started. Many of the biggest names in the tournament are devout Muslims - including France's Karim Benzema, and Paul Pogba, Germany's Mesut Ozil, Belgium's Marouane Fellaini, Adnan Januzaj and Eden Hazard, eight Swiss stars including Xherdan Shaqiri, and the entire Algeria side. Ramadan requires Muslims to forgo all food and liquid during daylight hours - something experts warn could hamper performance at the best of times, but could potentially be dangerous as players push their body to the limit in the South American heat while battling it out for football's greatest prize. Scroll down for video . Religious: Many of the biggest names in the tournament are devout Muslims, including members of the Algerian national side, who typically bow down and pray when celebrating a goal . Stars: Many of the biggest names in the World Cup are Muslims. It is not known whether Karim Benzama (left) will be fasting, but Mesut Ozil (right) has already said he will be eating and drinking as usual during Ramadan . Speculation over which players are observing Ramadan - which began yesterday - is raging in countries with a number of Muslim stars, particularly in France, Switzerland and Belgium. It is the first time a World Cup has overlapped with Ramadan for 28 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly the debate is at its most fervent in Algeria - the only Muslim-majority country still playing in the tournament. This morning the team's Bosnian manager Vahid Halilhodzic accused the media of a 'lack of respect and ethics' for repeatedly asking which players would be fasting during Ramadan. A Muslim himself, Halilhodzic said: 'Ramadan is here and I read in some Algerian newspapers criticisms about me, about my image, about my honour... this is really disgusting.' 'Those who continue criticising our team and my actions, I think it's shameful,' he added, before threatening to walk out of the press conference if he was asked any more questions about Ramadan. Although Halilhodzic insisted each player was entirely free to make his own decision, a number of prominent clerics in Algeria have demanded they observe Ramadan while playing. Several of the more prominent Muslim footballers still involved in the tournament are yet to make a comment on whether or not they will be observing Ramadan. Other than Algeria, the remaining team with the most Muslim players is Switzerland. Philippe Senderos (left) converted to Islam in 2012, while Xherdan Shaqiri (right) was born into a Muslim family in the former Yugoslavia . Although he is often seen praying before matches, France's Paul Pogba (left) has kept quiet on whether he will observe Ramadan. His teammate Bacary Sagna (right) has said he will not be fasting, however . While Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam, individuals who are travelling or going to war can be exempted from fasting. Those players that choose not to observe Ramadan will most likely be doing so under this provision. From the French side, neither Karim Benzema, Mamadou Sakho or Paul Pogba have made a public statement on the subject and their intention remains unclear. Bacary Sagna, meanwhile, has revealed he won't be taking part, saying: 'I know that as a Muslim there are certain...'laws', which are not allowed to be avoided, but personally, I’m not going to do it.' 'Everyone’s free to as they like, I completely respect those who are going to practice it…I don’t think it poses any problem, he added.' But, you have to be ready and take responsibility for it…and to be careful not to have any deficiencies, to avoid injuries, because at this level, you don’t get away with mistakes,' he went on. However Newcastle star Moussa Sissoko has made statements in previous years saying he always observes Ramadan no matter what he is doing, so it seems likely he will among those fasting. Questions: The Belgium side could also be hit by several players fasting, including Marouane Fellaini (left), Adnan Januzaj and Eden Hazard (right). None of these players have yet revealed their plans however . Big names: Switzerland's Gökhan Inler (right) and Valon Behrami (left), and France's Karim Benzema (centre) are among the well-known Muslim stars currently impressing at the World Cup in Brazil . The Belgium side could also be hit by several players fasting, including Marouane Fellaini, Adnan Januzaj and Eden Hazard - although, again, none of these players have publicly revealed their plans. Mousa Dembélé, on the other hand, has refused to observe the fasting saying he cannot risk 'losing power' by not fuelling himself efficiently for matches in such challenging conditions. Germany and Nigeria also have several Muslim players, but while the Germans - including Mesut Ozil and Sami Khedira - dismissed the idea of observing Ramadan, the Nigerians Ramon Azeez and Ahmed Musa are expected to take part. Other than Algeria, the team with the most Muslim players remaining in the World Cup is Switzerland, which has a large Islamic population due to asylum seekers the Balkan states. Among the Swiss Muslim stars are Bayern Munich's Xherdan Shaqiri - who has been one of the tournament's best performers - Napoli trio Gökhan Inler, Valon Behrami and Blerim Džemaili, as well as Admir Mehmedi, Haris Seferović and Granit Xhaka. The majority of these stars are not expected to observe Ramadan, although one Swiss player who might is ex-Arsenal man Philippe Senderos who converted is Islam in 2012 and likely to be more observant as a result.","Many of the biggest names still playing in the World Cup are Muslims .

"A woman whose breakthrough treatment of a bone disease with penicillin led to modern medical practices died on March 1 -- two days before her 83rd birthday. Genean Hixon was one of the first American civilians to be treated with the drug, The Denver Post reports. Hixon, born Genean Smith on March 3, 1931, was hospitalized in July 1943 with severe osteomyelitis, the paper reports -- a bone disease then-considered incurable and possibly fatal. Genean Hixon, pictured, died March 1 -- two days short of her 83rd birthday . Hixon spent several years hospitalized before she was treated with penicillin for osteomyelitis . Her daughter, Connie Hixon Davis, told the Post that her mother spent more than four years in hospital beds in her teens but was saved by the treatment. Hixon was subsequently known as the 'Penicillin Girl' after being treated with the drug. She reportedly received fan mail, and even a bouquet of roses from one soldier. 'Interestingly, she developed an allergy to penicillin and couldn't take it in her later years,' Hixon Davis told the paper. Hixon, seen here, was sadly diagnosed with liver cancer in December, causing her death . Penicillin, which was used to treat Hixon's osteomyelitis, is now considered a standard treatment for the bone disease . Claude Smith, Genean Hixon's father, along with a doctor reportedly convinced the National Research Council to share penicillin with his daughter, the Post reports. At that time, the drug was reserved mainly for the military. On February 19, 1951, Hixon met future husband Donald Hixon, whom she married later that year, the paper reports. The couple went on to have six children together. Hixon was diagnosed with liver cancer in December, causing her death. She is survived by her husband, brother Gerald Smith, 79, 11 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, according to the Post.","Genean Hixon, born in March 1931, was one of the first American civilians to be treated with penicillin .

"Two Russian-themed WWE wrestling characters have sparked outrage by incorporating the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster into their act. In a show last night, the characters 'Lana' and 'Alexander Rusev' launched into an anti-American rant in which they made reference to the flight MH17 being shot down and hailed Russian president Vladimir Putin for 'making fools' out of the U.S.. The Rusev and Lana roles often use Cold War-style rhetoric as part of their act, but their mention of last week's MH17 disaster, in which 298 people died, has shocked the wrestling community.

Perry - said in a hammy Russian accent: 'You blame Russia for the recent current events?' The controversial MH17 comments came during a grudge match between the on the WWE Battleground show on Sunday night. As she walked out to a chorus of boos, the Lana character - played by actress C.J. Perry - said in a hammy Russian accent: 'You blame Russia for the recent current events?' Earlier, she said: 'Tonight we dedicate this match to the most powerful man in the world. Tonight we dedicate this match the man that makes fools out of all of you Americans.' 'He is my role model. The is my idol. The president of Russia,' she added as an image of Vladimir Putin was displayed on big screens around the arena. The image was greeted with audible anger inside the venue, with fans booing and shouting anti-Russian slogans. Outrage: The Rusev and Lana roles often use Cold War-style rhetoric as part of their act, but their mention of last week's MH17 disaster, in which 298 died, has shocked the wrestling community . Shocking: Wrestling fans took to Twitter to voice their anger at the mention of flight MH17 . Role: WWE's Lana character is played by the American actress, who spent several years of her childhood in the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic in the Soviet Union . In early May this year, C.J. Perry's charter Lana began dedicating Rusev's matches to her 'hero', the President of Russia Vladimir Putin. She also ramped up her anti-American rhetoric . The characters involved in the controversy entered the world of WWE in January, amid heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S. over the ongoing crisis in the Ukraine. The Rusev character is played by Bulgarian Miroslav Barnyashev, with his storyline focusing on the wrestler's move from the Balkans to Russia, and becoming a hardline supporter of Putin. The use of a foreign 'baddie' to cause controversy is nothing new in the world of wrestling. In 2005 WWE introduced the character Muhammad Hassan, a Middle Eastern Muslim wrestler who would often pray in the ring and speak about prejudice against Arabs - both of which were often greeted by boos. The character came to an abrupt end when a controversial 'terrorism' storyline coincided with the 7/7 London bombings, leading television networks to pressure WWE into removing the character.","Russian-themed characters incorporated the MH17 disaster into their act .

"A paper wrist strap similar to the bands worn at festivals can help prevent over-exposure to the sun and reduce the risk of cancer. The device lets people know when they have been exposed to a certain amount of UV (ultra-violet) radiation by changing colour. The monitor works by changing colour from yellow to pink as the strength of UV radiation increases. The wristbands change colour when the sun's UV rays can start to cause damage . It operates through an acid-release agent . which picks up ultraviolet light and a dye which responds to pH levels . in the indicator. The agent is decomposed by sunlight, leading to the . rapid change in colour. The bands will be tailored to different skin types to reflect the different tolerance levels that people have to the sun. For example, a band for someone with fair hair and light skin will change colour quicker than a band for someone with dark hair and dark skin. The technology will be commercialised by Swedish-based company Intellego Technologies, established by Swedish entrepreneur Claes Lindahl. 'We are very excited . about the UV dosimeter technology and we look forward to developing it . further and commercialising it,' said Lindahl. 'There . is a substantial need out in the market for a functional UV dosimeter . and we look forward to continuing the process.' Professor Andrew Mills and Dr Michael McFarlane are both responsible for the original invention and were previously with the University’s Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry. They will now be engaged as consultants to Intellego Technologies. Mills said: 'The bands will have to cost less than 10p each because they are disposable and need to be thrown away at the end of the day. Prolonged exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer, of which the most virulent form, malignant melanoma, had 200,000 new cases worldwide in 2008, according to Cancer Research UK statistics. The new technology can alert sunbathers when UV levels are becoming harmful . 'The sunburn monitor will make a significant contribution to public health as an affordable, fashionable device which enables people to enjoy the benefits of the sun while at the same time keeping them alert to the risks of over- exposure.' said Fiona Strang, Commercialisation Manager with the University of Strathclyde’s Research & Knowledge Exchange Services. The development of the device received initial funding and support from Scottish Enterprise's Proof of Concept fund.","Swedish company set to commercialise Strathclyde University's device by spring 2013 .

"A circular metal antenna nicknamed 'the elephant cage' used to intercept radio signals during the Cold War-era will be torn down after 50 years of taking up space at Silver Strand Training Complex in Coronado, San Diego. As part of a mission to get rid of items they no longer need, the Navy will dispose of the 1,300-foot-diameter contraptions known officially as the Wullenweber Antenna Array. Wullenweber technology and the finer facts about its creation remain a bit of a mystery as do many details kept secret by the Cold War-era. The mysterious structures were peppered all over the world as a means of intercepting enemy radio signals from Eastern Europe all the way to the Middle East. No more: Beachgoers will say goodbye this month to the 'elephant cage'--the mysterious metal structure that has graced the south end of the Silver Strand for 50 years . United Kingdom: The elephant cage at Chicksands was used in the late 80s to source electronic signal intelligence related to on-site nuclear weapons inspections . Japan: the view of an 'elephant cage' from the Misawa AB Ski Lodge/sledding hill . One of the few known facts about Wullenweber contraptions is that they were developed in Germany during World War II. 'It’s possible that the Silver Strand antenna is the last of its kind still standing', said Alex Bethke, a Navy historian assigned to the project. It’s been obsolete since the 1970s, reported UT San Diego. A circular antenna was originally used to intercept and detect the location of various radio signals. The reason the atenna is so big is so that it can have antennae listening in all directions. 'It listened in a lot of directions at once. So, instead of turning around to look for a signal — which is what a lot of systems did — it listened in all directions,' said a the naval analyst. 'So whatever comes in, it’s likely to pick up,” he said. “And that was a very big deal.' UT San Diego reports that the antenna at Silver Strand had a range of 3,200 nautical miles and likely searched for signals in South America, the Pacific Ocean, and parts of Central America. U.S. states such as California and Alaska weren't the only homes for these gigantic 'elephant cages.' Alaska:  Circularly Disposed Antenna Array or Wullenweber antenna at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska . Japan: An aerial view of Security Hill with the 'elephant cage' circular disposed antenna array in the background . U.S. allies like the United Kingdom had an 'elephant cage' used to track signals coming from the former Soviet Union and from the Warsaw pact nations in Eastern Europe. Another group of contraptions were located in Italy at the San Vito dei Norrnanni Air Station to intercept signals coming from the Middle East. There were also antenna in West Germany, Japan, Canada, and the Philippines. A United Kigdom array in Chicksands was dismantled following base closure in 1996 and the San Vito array was dismantled following base closure in 1993. the structure was used in the late 80s in Chiksands to source electronic signal intelligence related to on-site nuclear weapons inspections . Misawa, Japan's Air Base’s massive Cold War-era network of 'elephant cages' were dismantled in 2013. Even though the Navy is tearing down the structure itself, it will memorialize the structure by keeping the five tallest screens and some wires and anchorage posts. They are also working on building digital 3-D model of the antenna.","The Navy will get rid of the 'elephant cage' at Silver Strand Training Complex in Colorado officially called  the Wullenweber Antenna Array .

"Wombats are being buried to death during logging and it needs to stop now, the director of Wombat Protection Society said. Marie Wynan and her husband Ray have been patrolling the Glenbog State Forest of south coast NSW but they are still discovering blocked burrows from excessive soil, logs, rocks or debris during logging. The Nimmitabel couple, who run a wildlife sanctuary near their property, have marked over 150 wombat burrows with a GPS, reporting on damages and negotiating with the loggers so they could avoid bulldozing over burrows. The wildlife sanctuary owner Ray Wynan saving a wombat from another collapsed burrow after the logging . The NSW Environment Protection Authority confirmed the state government-owned Forestry Corporation of NSW had agreed to ensure entrances to the burrows were not obstructed by logging debris as it felled the southern forest, according to Sun-Herald. But Ms Wynan told Daily Mail Australia that even restricting truck movements with planned out maps and markings had not been taken into consideration and were completely ignored by contractors. 'It's just heartbreaking when my husband and I find burrows that are compacted by machinery and logs. We can no longer reopen them because they're too deep,' she said. 'Wombats have not been able to dig themselves out and end up suffocating to death.' 'We can't interfere when they're logging but all we can do is go in after it's done and try to reopen the burrows again - that's all we can do for now. 'They are one of the most intelligent animals in the world and they are more clever than dogs. 'We really need to continue and push for legislation to give these wombats a second chance at life.' The burrow backfilled three times and was sitting underneath an enormous pile of logs . Mr Wynan unblocking the wombat burrow . The Wildlife Rescue South Coast members met with EPA officers from Sydney on Saturday to assure the loggers were following the agreement, as well as investigating the deaths of the wombats. But Ms Wynan said the loggers had 'deliberately' removed the GPS markings and filled burrows in again once the EPA officers had left. A Forestry Corporation spokesman said 'wombats use multiple burrows' and 'larger burrows generally have several entrances and wombats are able to re-excavate or remove obstacles at burrow entrances.' With 25 years of observing bare-nosed wombats, Ms Wynan said these claims were untrue. 'Some people believe that wombats can dig themselves out but they don't have the strength to do so. When their burrows collapse or blocked from logging, they're trapped deep down, causing significant harm or drawn out deaths,' Ms Wynan said. Marie Wynan and her husband Ray had taken their time out to mark over 150 wombat burrows with a GPS for the contractors to follow during the logging . The wombat's head and face was injured, bleeding from nose and was disoriented after the logging . She told Sun-Herald that thorough searching had not uncovered a single burrow with more than one entrance and such burrows were rare for this variety of wombat. The Australian Wildlife Society regional co-ordinator Linda Dennis said Forestry Corporation's comments were 'ridiculous.' 'The bare-nosed wombats just have one entrance in and out, so if it is ploughed over, that’s it. You are looking at a slow death with lack of food and water,' said Ms Dennis. NSW Labor’s environment spokesman Luke Foley told Sun-Herald that Forestry Corporation should honour its agreement with the wildlife groups, which had been 'an opportunity for a positive community partnership to ameliorate the impacts of logging.' 'Wildlife carers spent many hours painstakingly marking and recording wombat burrows only to return and find callous disregard had been given to these harmless and vulnerable animals,' he said.","Marie Wynan and her husband Ray have been patrolling the forest and marking wombat burrows .

"He is no stranger to accusations of being a Communist. And Barack Obama did himself no favours today unveiling a new campaign slogan that critics say has unfortunate similarities to ones used by Chairman Mao and other Communists. The President released his new slogan 'Forward' in a triumphant seven-minute campaign video. Scroll down for video . Forward: Critics point out the unfortunate similarities between Barack Obama's new slogan and Chinese Leader Chairman Mao's, right, Great Leap Forward campaign of forced industrialisation . Plainly stated: Obama's re-election team unveiled its new motto in a video released Monday morning . Sombre: The seven-minute video begins by recalling the grim state of the nation's economy when Obama took office . But long-time critics of the President such as Breitbart.com have . pointed out the similarities to Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward . campaign of forced collectivisation and industrialisation - which . resulted in the deaths of millions. 'Spring Forward' was also a slogan used by Vladimir Lenin in Communist Russia. It has been used as the title of a large number of socialist publications, reflecting the Marxist conviction that the triumph of their ideology was an inevitable part of the progress of history. One magazine with the title was the mouthpiece of the Communist League in the 19th century, associated with Communist trailblazers Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. Commentators have been quick to point out that Obama’s new motto seems to be borrowed from MSNBC’s 'Lean Forward' slogan. But a fair few have thought of using 'Forward' in their marketing campaigns before, including Chairman Mao Zedong, pictured above. The leader of the Chinese Revolution launched his 'Great Leap Forward' campaign in 1958. In it, he aimed to create a communist society through collectivization and industrialization. The disastrous campaign resulted in the deaths of millions of civilians and is known to be one of the most deadly of mass killing in history. The campaign also witnessed economic regression. Other companies that have chosen 'Forward'  include: Metro, who opted for 'Forward: a better ride for you', The Jewish Daily 'Forward' newspaper, and Focus Forward – a short film company. Festival organizers in Washington DC chose the name Forward for their five-day music, art and media event. Obama's re-election team today . unveiled the new motto in the video that compares the President's record . on jobs to the preceding years of the financial crisis and trumpets his . record. The film cites . landmarks of Mr Obama's Presidency such as the auto industry bail-out, . Osama Bin Laden's death and the end of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' in the . military. But observers have pointed out that . the new slogan bears strong similarities to MSNBC’s ‘Lean Forward’ as . Obama ditches his successful 2008 motto - ‘Hope and Change’. The video that unveiled the slogan tries to make the case for Obama's re-election in 2012 by saying there is still more work to do going forward. The video begins in black and white with . sombre music and depicts the year 2008. It shows queues of people . searching for jobs and uses graphs to highlight declining employment . rates that Obama faced when he entered the White House. News reporters detailing the bleak economic outlook are heard saying snippets such as, ‘worse financial collapse since the Great Depression’ and ‘economic disaster.’ The video suddenly changes to colour . when it shows Obama addressing his supporters in 2009 before rattling . through his achievements since taking office. With images of everyday Americans going about their working lives, the video recalls the auto industry rescue, credit card and Wall Street . reforms, healthcare reform, student loan reform, green energy . investments, lower taxes for the middle class, equal pay for women and a . repeal of the ‘Don’t ask, don’t tell’ law that banned gays from serving . openly in the military make up. In a move sure to anger the president's critics and . opponents the video then focuses on 'the victory no one saw coming' - the . killing of Osama bin Laden on May 2 last year. Common touch: The majority of the video rattles off Obama's achievements during office and shows him 'connecting' with the 'ordinary folk' Surprise, surprise: The promotional video highlights 'the victory no one saw coming' - the killing of Osama bin Laden - this is the moment Obama told the world of the terror leader's death . The campaign also uses the video to . target congressional Republicans, saying Obama had to overcome GOP . obstruction on Capitol Hill in order to pass legislation. 'Instead of working together to lift . America up, Republicans were waging a campaign to tear the president . down,' the narrator says over changing images of congressional . Republicans. However, Republicans have turned the 'Forward' motto on its head with the Republican National Committee creating the trending Twitter hashtag #Foward. They have used the hashtag to tweet: 'Under Obama's budget, Americans can look #FORWARD to $1.9 trillion in higher taxes.' The campaign says the video will be played for supporters attending the president's first re-election rallies Saturday in Ohio and Virginia.

"The woman who was photographed leaping from a burning building in the most iconic image of the summer riots had filmed the man accused of starting the blaze, a court heard yesterday. Monika Konczyk, 32, had captured Gordon Thompson on her mobile phone allegedly setting fire to a 150-year-old family furniture store opposite her home in Croydon, south London. Miss Konczyk, a shop assistant from Poland, then retreated to her flat where she thought she would be safe. Riot drama: Monika Konczyk (left) had allegedly captured Gordon Thompson (right) on her mobile phone . However, the heat and embers from the blaze set fire to the block of flats she lived in on the other side of the road. As the flames engulfed her building, the frightened woman was trapped inside. She was forced to climb out of her first floor window and leap 16ft into the arms of police officers beneath her – an image captured by photographers and reproduced around the world. The Old Bailey heard how Thompson, 33, ‘endangered the lives of countless people’ by setting fire to House of Reeves furniture store in Croydon last August. In an act of ‘cynical cowardice’, he shouted: ‘Let’s burn this place’ before setting a sofa alight, it was claimed. Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said: ‘The effect, as anyone would realise and as he plainly intended, was catastrophic. Lives at risk: Monika Konczyk was forced to jump from a burning building near to the blaze at House of Reeves . Heritage destroyed: Fire crews battled desperately to save buildings nearby in London Road . ‘The sofa went up in flames, as did . other pieces of furniture in the showroom, and within minutes the . inferno was raging out of control. ‘The . defendant stayed at the scene to watch what he had done before the heat . and flames drove him away. The heat was so intense and it was raining . ash.’ Mr Glasgow added that the ‘resulting fire was devastating’. Booty in hand: Thompson was photographed carrying items looted from the Iceland store in Croydon . ‘Once . House of Reeves was ablaze, glowing embers from the fire set light to . the residential property on the other side of the road and residents . were forced to flee for their lives,’ he said. ‘Some . were lucky to escape at all. Indeed, one young woman became trapped . inside her flat and was forced to jump from a first-floor window into . the arms of rescuers waiting below. ‘There . was nothing that the fire brigade could do. The furniture shop was . razed to the ground and all that remained were the supporting walls and a . pile of smouldering rubble.’ The Old Bailey heard how Thompson ‘ran . riot’ through the streets of Croydon during one of the worst nights of . the civil unrest. He was part of a masked gang that ‘roamed lawlessly’ through the streets. The court was told how Thompson, a painter and decorator, played a ‘leading part in the disorder’. Before the arson attack, he smashed shop windows and looted bottles of alcohol from the shelves of an Iceland store. A short time later he broke into a branch of House of Fraser in a shopping centre with a group of looters and left with ‘armfuls of goods’. Thompson then turned his attention to House of Reeves, a family furniture business that had survived two world wars. He watched as others smashed their way into the store before entering and allegedly stealing a laptop. He then asked a fellow rioter for a lighter and used it to set fire to a sofa, it was said. Around an hour later, Thompson was seen pouring petrol on to a nearby street before attempting to set light to it, the court heard. Bus driver Flint Agyekum, who was at the wheel of the number 157 Croydon to Morden service, watched in horror as he tried to help his passengers off before they reached the worst affected areas. He parked the bus in a side street, but it was later destroyed by fire. Thompson is not alleged to have had any part in this. Thompson has already admitted burgling Iceland and House of Fraser, but denies taking part in the attack on House of Reeves. He is on trial for violent disorder, burglary of Reeves, arson with intent to endanger life and arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. The trial continues.

Worker friendly: At the new Googleplex (pictured) no employee will be more than a 2.5-minute walk from one another . According to civil engineer David Radcliffe, speaking in Vanity Fair, the redesign 'started not with an architectural vision but with a vision of the work experience.' This is the first time the company has worked on office buildings from scratch rather than . remodifying premises built by others. The 42-acre expansion is designed by Seattle-based firm NBBJ. It is built with energy conservation in mind. The new campus will be the biggest office complex in the U.S. with all radiant heating and most employees will be able to work with natural light..

"A newly released police report details an investigation into claims Rudolf Hess was murdered by British agents . Claims that Nazi Rudolf Hess was allegedly murdered under orders from the British to stop him revealing wartime secrets have been revealed in a police report which has only just seen the light of day after 25 years. According to the documents, a doctor who was treating the Nazi Party deputy leader supplied Scotland Yard with the names of two British agents who were suspected of the murder, but the force was advised to stop its investigations. The report by Detective Chief Superintendent Howard Jones, which has now been released under the Freedom of Information Act, provides details on the inquiry into surgeon Hugh Thomas's claims. It was written two years after Hess's death in 1987 after the force was called in following claims by Mr Thomas that the man sent to Spandau Prison in then-West Berlin was not Hess but an imposter sent by the Nazis in 1941. Allied authorities said Hess hanged himself with an electrical cord in Spandau jail on August 17, 1987, at the age of 93. But Mr Thomas said the real Hess was in fact killed by two British agents dressed as members of the U.S. forces amid speculation he was about to be released due to a veto by the Soviet Union, The Independent has reported. The report cites how Mr Thomas 'confidentially imparted' the names of the two alleged suspects which he had received from a former member of the SAS. Mr Jones wrote: '[Mr Thomas] had received information that two assassins had been ordered on behalf of the British Government to kill Hess in order that he should not be released and free to expose secrets concerning the plot to overthrow the Churchill government.' Allied authorities said Hess hanged himself with an electrical cord in Spandau Prison (pictured) in then-West Berlin on August 17, 1987 . Rudolf Hess gives the Nazi salute at the inauguration ceremony of the Adolf Hitler Canal, in Germany, in 1939 . Despite not finding 'much substance' to the murder allegations, Mr Jones ordered an investigation. According to The Independent, the Crown Prosecution Service received a copy of the report in 1989. Within six months the Director of Public Prosecutions at the time, Sir Allan Green, advised the investigation should not continue. Hess was an early confidant of Hitler, who dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf to him while imprisoned during the 1920s. How The Mail on Sunday reported the death of Hess on August 23, 1987 (left). Hess (right) was an early confidant of Hitler, who dictated much of his infamous manifesto Mein Kampf to him while imprisoned during the 1920s . He eventually rose to become deputy Nazi party leader, and was captured in 1941 during a solo flight to Scotland on an apparently unauthorised peace mission. He was later convicted in the Nuremberg trials after the Second World War ended. At the Nuremberg trials after the war, Hess was found innocent of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against peace and conspiracy to commit crimes against peace. His appearance in Britain in 1941 has been the subject of much debate over the years. In March last year a declassified report revealed for the first time the stark scene in which Hess was said to have killed himself and his alleged suicide note. But the report of the investigation into Hess's death, released last year under Freedom of Information, only deepened the mystery surrounding his final moments. Although the official verdict by the Special Investigations Branch of the British Military Police is that Hess committed suicide and no others were involved, historians claimed that the images cast doubt on this version of events.","Doctor who once treated Rudolf Hess made claims following death in 1987 .

"A three-year-old boy suffered first- and second-degree burns after his mom’s e-cigarette exploded causing his car seat to catch fire. Mom Kinzie Barlow was driving near her home in Mount Pleasant, Utah, on Friday when the incident occurred. According to Barlow, the White Rhino e-cigarette exploded while it was charging, causing a white-hot copper coil to shoot out that bounced off the ceiling and landed in her son Khonor’s car seat. Mom Kinzie Barlow was driving near her home in Utah when her e-cigarette exploded causing her son Khonor's car seat to catch fire . The e-cigarette exploded causing a white-hot copper coil to shoot out and land in Khonor Barlow¿s car seat which caught fire . ‘There was a big bang, and kind of a flash, and there’s smoke everywhere,’ Barlow told FOX 13 News. The coil quickly burned through the fabric cover of the car seat, melting the hard plastic and sending flames shooting up the little boy’s body. ‘Seeing your child on fire and hearing them scream “Help me!” is pretty terrifying,’ said Barlow. She tried to smother the fire with her shirt sleeve, but when that also caught fire she was forced to grab her iced coffee and pour it on her son to extinguish the flames. Khonor was lucky to escape with only minor burns to his elbow, left, lower back, right, and bum after his mom threw her iced coffee over the flames . According to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, there are currently more than 3.5million Americans puffing on e-cigs . Fortunately Khonor suffering only minor burns to his elbow, lower back and his bottom. Barlow, who was using the charger provided with the device when she bought it, has said she will never buy one again. Mail Online has reached out to White Rhino for comment on the incident. According to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association (TVECA), there are currently more than 3.5million Americans puffing on the devices. As e-cigarettes have grown in popularity there have been an increasing number of incidents concerning their safety. In other instances devices have exploded because the cigarette have been mismatched with the wrong type of charger or because it has been left in its USB port for too long and overcharged. White Rhino’s website features advice on care and maintenance for the lithium-ion batteries inside the cigarettes. It includes a warning that they the battery shouldn’t be placed in direct sunlight and that they can ‘get hot, explode or ignite and cause serious injury.' In October, the Food and Drug Administration plans to roll out a comprehensive policy to regulate the $1billion e-cigarette business, but it is expected that the new rules would pertain mostly to nicotine levels in the devices rather than matters of fire safety.

"A veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder has killed himself after leaving a note in which he attacked the government for leaving him feeling 'abandoned’. Daniel Somers said that he would rather die than endure the nightmares resulting from taking part in 'crimes against humanity' whilst fighting in Iraq that left him so damaged he couldn’t laugh or cry. He said that he was given 'no help' by the authorities and accused them of being too busy denying the existence of PTSD rather than treating people like him. Veteran: Daniel Somers, 30, killed himself June 10 after being tormented with nightmares and anxiety . Tragic: Somers left behind a wife, Angeline, who wrote on Facebook about her husband's suicide: 'I wish I could believe that if it had gotten out sooner that he would still be here' In his powerful suicide note, which was first published by the Phoenix New Times and then in full by Gawker, he wrote: 'This is what brought me to my actual final mission. Not suicide, but a mercy killing. 'It was quick, and I did not suffer. And above all, now I am free. I feel no more pain. 'I have no more nightmares or flashbacks or hallucinations. I am no longer constantly depressed or afraid or worried. 'I am free.' Duty: Somers served in various capacities in Iraq from 2004 to 2007 . Music: Somers was also a producer, singer and guitarist of Phoenix band Lisa Savidge, which broke up in 2011 . Mr Somers served in Iraq as part of . Task Force Lightning and was on more than 400 combat missions as a . machine gunner in a Humvee. He also worked with Joint Special Operations Command in Mosul in an intelligence position. But . Mr Somers, 30, suffered a traumatic brain injury and had endured . flashbacks and hallucinations related to the horrors he saw between 2003 . and 2006. He killed himself on June 10. In his suicide note he wrote: 'My body has become nothing but a cage, a source of pain and constant problems. 'The illness I have has caused me pain that not even the strongest medicines could dull, and there is no cure. 'Mercy': Somers wrote in his suicide note that after killing himself he was 'free' 'All day, every day a screaming agony in every nerve ending in my body. It is nothing short of torture. 'My . mind is a wasteland, filled with visions of incredible horror, . unceasing depression, and crippling anxiety, even with all of the . medications the doctors dare give. Simple things that everyone else . takes for granted are nearly impossible for me. 'I can not laugh or cry. I can barely leave the house. I derive no pleasure from any activity. Everything simply comes down to passing time until I can sleep again. Now, to sleep forever seems to be the most merciful thing.' Mr Somers said that he was haunted by the 'war crimes' he took part in but tried to stop from happening, although he does not give details. He also claimed that the army instigated a cover up but again does not give specifics about what supposedly happened. Illness: Somers said in his suicide note that the government did nothing to help him with his PTSD . The letter said that Mr Somers has . wrestled with his condition for more than a decade and that his main . motivation for getting up each day 'has been so that you (his family) would not have to bury me'. He cited the statistic that 22 veterans kill themselves every day and railed at President Obama for not doing more to stop it. He said: 'Where are the huge policy initiatives? Why isn't the president standing with those families at the state of the union? Perhaps because we were not killed by a single lunatic. 'It leaves us to where all we have to look forward to is constant pain, misery, poverty, and dishonor. 'I assure you that, when the numbers do finally drop, it will merely be because those who were pushed the farthest are all already dead.' Mr Somers leaves behind a wife, Angeline, and a group of friends who fondly remembered him as a talented musician. Singing: In his suicide note, Somers, front left, wrote the 'widows and orphans [he] created' would be 'outraged' if 'they could see me sitting here in suburbia, in my comfortable home working on some music project' In a post on her Facebook page Mr . Somers' wife Angeline has uploaded a picture of her and her late husband . together at an Army ball - he is smiling in full military uniform. Another post shows her left hand with her wedding ring on the finger. She has said: 'I wish I could believe that if it had gotten out sooner that he would still be here'. Mr Somers' cousin Jamie also wrote on Facebook that he was not a 'martyr' but that he wanted to change the system - many veterans like him claim they do not get enough support to deal with their problems. Jamie wrote: 'There is something very rational about his letter, which almost makes it cut deeper. He was just so out of hope.' Haunted: Somers said he tried to replace 'destruction with creation' but he still had flashbacks and hallucinations . Mr Somers is far from alone in suffering from PTSD. Between . 2000 and 2010 the number of veterans killing themselves went up from 20 . to 22 per day, according to figures from the Veterans Agency. That means the total for the year for 2010 stood at 8,030, an increase of 730. Among serving military personnel, the suicide rate is now almost one every day. In February this year, a US Marine reservist suffering from PTSD was charged with shooting dead Chris Kyle, a retired Navy SEAL who was the most deadly sniper in US history. Eddie Ray Routh, 25, is said to have blasted Mr Kyle at a shooting range during a trip to apparently help him overcome his demons. Mr Kyle, 38 notched up 255 kills during the Iraq war and became so feared by insurgents they put a $80,000 bounty on his head and nicknamed him al-Shaitan Ramad, or 'the Devil of Ramadi'.

"Scientists are hopeful that injecting the blood of young people into the bodies of those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease, could reverse some of the damage caused by the debilitating condition. A human experiment due to take place in October and will build on years of animal research, which suggests the transfusion of young blood can improve organ health, including the brain. Researchers will give blood plasma transfusions, from donors under the age of 30, to volunteers with mild Alzheimer’s. Could young blood cure Alzheimer's? Researchers in California will give a transfusion of blood plasma donated by people under the age of 30 to volunteers with mild Alzheimer’s, and hope to see improvements in people with the condition. A stock image of a person having a blood transfusion is pictured . Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, affecting almost 500,000 people in the UK, according to NHS figures.  With an ever-increasing older population, the race is on to find an effective way of treating the disease. Scientists have been fascinated by the idea that young blood could rejuvenate older bodies since the 1950s, New Scientist reported. Clive McCay of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, stitched together the circulatory systems of an old and young mouse more than 60 years ago to discover that the cartilage in the older mice looked younger than expected. Since then, experiments using the same technique have proved that young blood can rejuvenate the liver and skeletal stem cells of old mice  and that young blood can reverse heart decline in the animals. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, affecting almost 500,000 people in the UK, according to NHS figure (stock image) Dr Amy Wagersat, of Harvard University discovered in 2012 that a protein in the blood plasma called growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) seemed to be linked to rejuvenating effects in old mice with a heart condition called cardiac hypertrophy - a condition which causes the heart to swell. When the ageing mice were given injections of GDF11 for 30 days, their hearts decreased in size, just like when they were given blood of younger mice - leading scientists to think that GDF11 is likely to be one ingredient in blood responsible for rejuvenation. Subsequent studies have shown that injections of the protein increased the number of blood vessels and stem cells in the brains – improving brain function in older mice. Scientists know that the production of GDF11 in humans and mice falls with age and although they do not understand why, they think this decrease has a negative effect on the brain's health and long-term memory. Dr Tony Wyss-Coray at Stanford University, in California, believes that GDF11 could play a role in rejuvenating the brain in humans. He injected young human blood plasma into old mice and found that the blood seemed to have rejuvenating benefits. ‘The human blood had beneficial effects on every organ we've studied so far,’ he said. His team at Stanford School of Medicine will give a transfusion of blood plasma donated by people under 30 to older volunteers with mild to moderate Alzheimer's in October. They hope to see immediate improvements in cognition in the people with the condition, . ‘We will assess cognitive function immediately before and for several days after the transfusion, as well as tracking each person for a few months to see if any of their family or carers report any positive effects,’ he told New Scientist. ‘The effects might be transient, but even if it's just for a day it is a proof of concept that is worth pursuing.’ Experts think that GDF11 is unlikely to be the only protein to keep organs youthful, but it could be a key ingredient. Francesco Loffredo, of Harvard University, thinks that relying on blood transfusions to treat Alzheimer’s is impractical, but  that research could one day lead to a drug that achieves the same results as transfusions. Other experts believe that the findings could one day be used to treat cancer and reverse the effects of muscle wasting in chemotherapy, for example, as well as treating Alzheimer's. Brain training exercises really do work - and can make a difference to cognitive abilities for a decade, American researchers announced in January. A US Government study found that over 74s were able to improve their reasoning and processing skills using straightforward exercises, and that the effects were still detectable 10 years later. Participants in largest study ever on cognitive training were given 10 to 12 sessions lasting 60 to 75 minutes each. People in the study had an average age of 74 when they started the training. After five years, researchers found, those with the training performed better than their untrained counterparts in all three measures. Although gains in memory seen at the study's five-year mark appeared to drop off over the next five years, gains in reasoning ability and processing speed persisted 10 years after the training. 'What we found was pretty astounding,' said George Rebok, an expert on aging and a professor at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who led the study. 'Ten years after the training, there was evidence the effects were durable for the reasoning and the speed training,' Participants in all three training groups also reported that they had an easier time with daily activities such as managing their medications, cooking meals or handling their finances than did participants who did not get the training.","Researchers at Stanford School of Medicine, California, will give a transfusion of blood plasma from young people to Alzheimer's sufferers .

"Two men who were awaiting trial for the brutal murder and dismembering of a 19-year-old Oklahoma girl have had their charges dropped after police failed to find enough evidence to pin them to the gruesome crime. Luis E. Ruiz's parents praised the Lord as their son was freed from Oklahoma county jail yesterday, where he's spent the past seven months behind bars as a suspect in the October 2011 slaying of Carina Saunders. A second man, Jimmy Lee Massey Jr, 34, has also had his first-degree murder charge dismissed but remains in prison on unrelated drug charges. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Free: Luis Ruiz, pictured right as he left prison on Monday, is thrilled to be reunited with his mother, left, and the rest of his family after his murder charge was dropped . Saunders' body was found in pieces in a duffel bag behind a Bethany grocery store. The sickening details of her tortured death were revealed in an autopsy in August 2012, six weeks after Ruiz, 38, was arrested. According to the autopsy report, the teen's attacker attempted to hack out a tattoo on her upper back so she wouldn't be identified. She was decapitated and her hands and feet were missing. Ruiz had been accused of planning and carrying out the torture killing after a witness told police she saw the man, a father and former school teacher, beat Saunders, tie her to a table and then saw off her left foot. The witness claimed Ruiz went to saw off the teen's right foot but the saw broke. The woman told investigators she jumped out of a window to escape after witnessing the horrid incident. It is unclear whether the witness recounted her story to prompt the charges being dropped. Praise the Lord: Ruiz' father, pictured, thanked God for releasing his son . District Attorney David Prater filed a motion on Friday to dismiss the charges without prejudice, meaning they can be refiled against either man, and the order was signed by District Judge Ray Elliott. The charges were expected to be dropped against the men after Bethany Police Department handed the case to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation earlier this month claiming a 'fresh set of eyes' would be positive for the complex case that was going cold. On Monday, Ruiz hugged and kissed his parents as he was released wearing the same shorts and a short-sleeve shirt he was in when he was thrown behind bars in July. Ruiz told NewsOK.com: 'It feels good. I'm just ready to go home to my family that's all.' He said the first thing he was going to do was see his kids. His father raised both his arms and said, 'Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus Christ. Thank you.' Massey is a defendant in a drug trafficking case and remains in custody with bail set at $100,000. 'We are obviously very pleased about the district attorney's decision to dismiss the charges against Mr. Massey,' assistant public defender Mitch Solomon said in a written statement. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the Saunders family as the investigation begins.' Elusive link: Police never revealed the supposed relationship between Saunders, 19, and Ruiz . Solomon criticized the TV media for sensationalizing the case. According to KOCO.com, the witness in the case recanted her claim that she had been present when Saunders was killed. He attorney, David Slane, told the news station his client had drug charges against her, but he insists the facts of the story are true no matter what her motivation was. 'It came out she was just repeating what someone else had said,' Slane said. 'Sometimes people want to help the police. Sometimes they want to help an investigation. Also remember, she was in trouble herself and wanted to get out of trouble. 'I absolutely believe the facts of the story are absolutely true.' The court documents supporting the pair's murder charges, Massey shared details of Saunders' killing with prison detainees while inside on drug trafficking charges. The notes claimed Massey admitted kidnapping a woman and making her watch as Saunders was savagely murdered and also said that he had described how the teen's body was chopped up and left in a field behind the Homeland grocery store in Bethany. Reports last year suggested Saunders was killed . by a human and drug trafficking gang to intimidate female witnesses so they would . cooperate with the gang's demands. Massey and Ruiz were charged with the first-degree murder of the young woman from Mustang on July 23. They had been held in Oklahoma County Jail without bail since then. Ruiz is a former elementary school teacher, according to his family, who later became deeply involved in the drug trade. The . autopsy report revealed Saunders' decomposing body had to be . identified by dental records. Her tattoo, which read 'Kween Spade', . could also be made out on her back. Brutal crime: Luis Ruiz, left, has had charges dropped in the killing and dismembering of Carina Saunders, right, in Oklahoma City . Tragic end: A makeshift cross marks the spot where the body of Saunders was found in Bethany, Oklahoma . There is speculation that the tattoo is adopted by white women who like to advertise themselves for sexual relationships with black men. The tattoo is also taken by music fans of bands of the same name and has references in mythology. 'The body parts were wrapped with plastic wrap, a laundry bag and a duffel bag,' states the report, according to Newsok. There was prescription painkiller tramadol in the 19-year-old's system but the quantity was unclear. According to a probable cause . affidavit filed in Oklahoma County District Court, Ruiz planned and . carried out the torture killing. In the affidavit, a woman named . Michelle Hanshaw told police she went to a house in the city with . Saunders and witnessed Ruiz 'physically beat Carina Saunders and then . tie her up'. Threatening: Luis Ruiz (left) and Jimmy Massey (right) were held without bail at Oklahoma County Jail for seven months before charges were dropped on Friday . Ruiz then . dragged Saunders to an upstairs room and tied her to a small table with . rope and twine before using the saw on her feet, Hanshaw told Bethany . police investigators. Hanshaw 'jumped out a window to escape' after witnessing the killing. Stephanie Howard, Ruiz's girlfriend . in October 2011, told investigators that on two occasions she and Ruiz . had to 'babysit' a girl Howard later learned was Carina Saunders, . police reported. Ruiz said Saunders was going to be 'dealt with', Howard told investigators. The relationship between Saunders and the two men who were accused of murdering her, was never released. Another woman was at the house with . Saunders and Hanshaw, but left soon after, police reported. Tia Downour . said she had been told there was a video of the homicide on the phone, . and the phone belonged to Ruiz. Downour told investigators she shared . a room at the Bel-Aire Hotel with Ruiz in May, and when he went to the . bathroom, she viewed the video, police reported. Possible link: Ruiz's younger brother said Saunders, pictured, resembled a white woman that his brother used to 'hang out with' Horrific find: Saunders' remains were discovered inside a duffel bag in a field behind a Homeland grocery store . 'Downour said she watched for a few . seconds until Saunders began to scream,' Bethany police Lt. JR Jencks . wrote in the affidavit, adding that she told investigators she . recognized Ruiz 'as the person in the video cutting off the foot of . Saunders'. Another person interviewed by . detectives said Ruiz told him he 'had been the one that planned the . entire incident which resulted in the death of Carina Saunders'. Massey, while jailed on drug charges, . shared details of the murder with two inmates, according to a . probable cause affidavit filed with his murder charge. He told one that he . participated in the homicide and 'they cut the girl's arms and legs . off'. The second inmate told police Massey . 'gave handwritten statements in the form of passed notes' describing . what parts of the woman's body were dismembered and how the body was wrapped before disposal. House of horrors: In December 2011, police found blood, hair, and a blood-stained knife inside an apartment where they believe Saunders was tortured and killed . Downour, who told investigators she left the house soon after Saunders and Hanshaw arrived, said Massey, who she also knew as 'Country,' was there when she left. A confidential witness told police she was kidnapped and forced to watch as members of a human trafficking ring tortured and killed Saunders to send a message to others to cooperate with their illegal activities. According to court records, Massey admitted to kidnapping a woman and making her watch as Saunders was tortured and killed October 9. Massey also described how Saunders' body was dismembered and left in a field behind the Homeland grocery store, 15 miles away from her home in Mustang.","Luis E.

"David Cameron will have the grim task of ordering the Armed Forces to shoot down a passenger airliner over Britain to prevent a suicide attack on the Olympic Games. The Prime Minister will have his finger on the trigger as an unprecedented defensive 'ring of steel' is thrown up to protect London 2012. The public will witness a show of military strength not seen at home since the Second World War. The security in . place to prevent a September 11-style atrocity or Mumbai-style terror . attack as the eyes of the world are on London includes: . Pressure: David Cameron will decide whether or not to use the missiles in an emergency . Yesterday it was made clear that Mr . Cameron would be ultimately responsible for a decision to fire missiles . to blast a suicide jet, possibly carrying terrified innocent civilians, . out of the skies. General Sir Nick Parker, in charge of . military operations during London 2012, revealed the unenviable task . would rest at the 'highest political level'. Mr Cameron possesses emergency powers . to authorise the military to bring down planes or helicopters to stop . an atrocity during this summer's sporting showcase. News of Mr Cameron's role came as it . was revealed that surface-to-air missiles could be deployed at six . different sites across London during the Olympics. The Lexington Building in Tower . Hamlets and the Fred Wigg Tower in Waltham Forest, both in east London, . have been identified as potential sites. Launch site: The Army will station soldiers and high-velocity surface-to-air missiles on the Lexington Tower Water Building, seen centre, in East London . Blackheath . Common and Oxleas Wood, both in south east London, plus William Girling . Reservoir in the Lea Valley Reservoir Chain in Enfield and Barn Hill at . Netherhouse Farm in Epping Forest are other possible sites. The . surface-to-air missiles will be deployed as the third tier of defence . aimed at slower or smaller aircraft, and the final decision as to . whether they will be fired will rest with Mr Cameron. The six sites are all potential locations for ground-based air defence systems, should the Government decide to deploy them during the Games. Residents in the private, gated flats next to the Lexington Building Water Tower in Bow have received a leaflet warning them that a team of ten soldiers and police will be placed at the building – home to 700 people – for the duration of this summer’s Games. Security point: The Lexington Building Water Tower in East London is one of the proposed missile sites closest to the Olympic stadium . It follows an announcement by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond in November that missiles might be used to safeguard the Olympic site. No final decision has been made about this potential deployment but it does form part of Olympic Guardian, a major exercise in which security preparations are being tested this week. Last night, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed the missiles would be deployed within the next few days. They describe them as ‘a useful deterrent’. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'Support for the Olympic Games will be an important task for defence in 2012 and this exercise is about pushing our people and our systems to the limit to ensure that we are ready for the challenge. 'The majority of this exercise will be played out in full view of the public and I hope that it will have a secondary effect of reassuring the British people that everything possible is being done to ensure this will be a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games.' Resident Brian Whelan, a journalist, said the MoD leaflet says the missiles will be fired only as a last resort. He said: ‘They are going to have a . test run next week, putting high-velocity missiles on the roof just . above our apartment. They’re stationing police and military in the tower . of the building for two months. Blackheath, one of six positions that could be used to home missiles during the Olympics . Oxleas Wood at Shooters Hill, Woolwich may have a station for surface-to-air missiles . Warning: High-velocity surface-to-air missiles could be stationed on the residential block in East London to ward off airborne terror threats . Netherhouse Farm, in Barn Hill, Epping Forest, has also been earmarked to protect London . The Fred Wigg Tower block in Waltham Forest, east London, which could play host to a missile station . The William Girling Reservoir, Enfield, is another possible site for missile deployment . ‘It’s a private, gated community with an old watch tower which is now a lift shaft. ‘We . have an MoD leaflet saying the building is the only suitable place in . the area. It says there will be ten officers plus police present 24/7. I’m not sure if they are going to live in the building. We have a gym . and a pool and people have seen them there so it makes you think it will . be some sort of Army base – it’s not ideal. ‘The property management company which runs the place put up posters and gave out the leaflets today. Protection: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond saw some of the Rapier System ground-to-air missile launchers during a visit to RAF Waddington near Lincoln, earlier this year . ‘The general tone was, “Great news, aren’t we lucky”, but that’s not normal, it’s not something people should have put on them. ‘I’ve looked these up [the missiles] and I don’t think they’re the kind of thing you can fire over a highly populated area like Tower Hamlets, think of the debris.’ Mr Whelan said the leaflet poses a series of questions residents might ask, such as: ‘Will this make me a target for terrorists?’ The 28-year-old said: ‘But the answer on it is that we will be safer with it here . ‘From the few people I’ve spoken to, and the security we have here, they’re not happy about it. I don’t think it needs to be here at all.’ The RAF's Typhoon F2 fighters are now operational and will protect London and UK airspace from any airborne terrorist threat . Royal Navy Sea King helicopters will be able to respond to threats during the Olympics quickly . The Awacs E-3D Sentry AEW1 Airborne Early warning and control force aircraft will be on hand . Royal Navy Lynx helicopters are another part of the fleet on hand to strike if there is an attack . Target: Security agencies fear the Olympic site in Stratford, east London, will be targeted by terrorists and are preparing for a range of difference scenarios . There are no plans to have soldiers patrolling the streets during the Games but marines will be working as part of the operation on the Thames and in Dorset. The overall 23,700-strong security force for the Games includes a mix of military, private security guards and at least 3,000 unpaid London 2012 volunteers who will be used at the start of the security process. It includes a 13,500-strong military force, which is more than the 10,000 that were deployed to Afghanistan, who will guard the Games. There will be 7,500 military who are set to be deployed inside venues to do screening and search tasks, largely in the vehicle search areas.","Sites across London could be used as surface-to-air missile posts to protect Games .

"A historic Cadillac built for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor is expected to sell for the princely sum of up to £500,000 after surfacing for the first time in 60 years. The jet black American car cost a staggering $16,000 (£9,900) when the former King bought it new in 1941. It was one of the first cars to have electric windows and is decked out with jewellery compartments, cigar lighters, wool carpets and walnut finish. The King's Cadillac: This car, built for the Duke and Duchess of Windsor in 1941, is set to sell at auction for up to £500,000 after 60 years out of the public eye . The car was nicknamed 'The Duchess' and is one of the world’s most famous Cadillacs. But after the royals sold the car in 1952, it disappeared from the public only to re-emerge in 2009 when its new owner decided to fully restore it. He has now decided to sell the Cadillac, described as ‘understated and decidedly European in its elegance,’ at RM Auctions' New York sale next month. The car is expected to sell for between £360,000 and £500,000 when it goes under the hammer on November. Palatial interiors: The car was decked out with many prestigious features including custom broadcloth rose-coloured upholstery (right), Wilton wool carpet, custom dyed to match the walnut finishes and cigar lighters . 'Understated elegance': The Cadillac was nicknamed The Duchess and included custom walnut finish and was one of the first cars to have electric windows . Treasure trove: The car includes four brushed stainless steel jewellery cases, each lined with velvet, to carry the Duchess' famous extravagant jewellery purchases . The relationship between the Duke and Duchess is regarded as one of the most fascinating and enduring love stories, and one which rocked British society at the time. In 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated after less than a year on the throne. He said: ‘You must believe me when I tell you, that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love.’ King Edward VII had fallen for American socialite Wallis Simpson and his abdication heralded the beginning of his 35-year international jet-setting lifestyle.While staying in New York, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor would live in a suite at the Waldorf Towers on Park Avenue with the beloved Cadillac their car of choice. The unique car was upholstered entirely in rose-coloured custom broadcloth, extending to the headlining and sun visors. Private life: King Edward VIII sold the car (which features the Duke's emblem, left, and the Cadillac angel, right) in 1952 after which it disappeared from the public eye until 2009 when its owner decided to fully restore the unique vehicle . Lush limo: The former King was a car enthusiast and enjoyed personally driving the Cadillac and so the front was as luxurious as the back of the car, a rarity for a limousine . Historic design: The car is an 'an exceptionally important part of both automotive and social history,' said Alain Squindo, vice president of RM Auctions. He called it a 'design statement unlike any other to come from Detroit in those years' King's choice: King Edward abdicated from the throne in 1936 to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson and the Cadillac was their car of choice while living in a suite at the Waldorf Towers on Park Avenue, New York . Craftsmen covered the floors in Wilton wool carpet, custom-dyed to match and set against custom walnut finishes for the doors, cabinetry and divider window. It was one of the first two Cadillacs to be equipped with electric windows and was fitted with satin privacy curtains which would roll away when not in use. Other luxuries included four brushed stainless-steel jewellery cases, each lined in velvet, to carry the Duchess' famous jewellery purchases. The Duke had three cigar lighters and two ashtrays, along with a humidor and custom rack for his favoured Sasieni pipes. As a car enthusiast, the Duke - also known as Prince Edward - would drive the Cadillac personally so the front was as luxurious as the rear, a rarity for a limousine. Extravagant lifestyle: The Duke and Duchess of Windsor (pictured left on their wedding day in 1937 and right in 1949) led a jet-setting lifestyle after he abdicated less than a year into his reign . Characterized the couple: Leslie Keno, a senior international specialist at Sotheby's said the 'grace and elegance' of this historic car reflected the uniqueness of the regal couple who originally owned it . After selling the car it was thought it was later destroyed when it disappeared from the public eye, but it was actually living a quiet life in Springfield. The Cadillac was then sold to a Texan in 1964 who stored it until 2009 when the current owner bought it and fully restored it. It is being sold without a reserve by RM Auctions and Sotheby's in New York. Alain Squindo, vice president, RM Auctions, said: ‘This Cadillac is an exceptionally important part of both automotive and social history and it is particularly appropriate that the car should be offered for sale in New York, the city to which it was delivered new and in which it has not been seen in many years. ‘From front to back and throughout the entire interior, it is a design statement unlike any other to come from Detroit in those years.’ Leslie Keno, senior international specialist from Sotheby's, said: ‘Much like the record-setting emerald-eyed panther bracelet sold at the final Sotheby's auction of the Duke and Duchess' collections, this Cadillac is the pinnacle of design. ‘It is emblematic not only of the grace and elegance that characterized the couple, but it is a truly bespoke piece, befitting its regal owners.’","The Cadillac was bought by King Edward VIII in 1941 for a staggering $16,000 (£9,900)

"A couple have been left fuming after spending £200,000 on a brand new home - only to find their cars won't fit into the garage. Claire Walker, 37, was stunned to discover the garage at the detached three-bedroom property in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, was too narrow to accommodate her Volvo S40. Her partner Andy Birkhead, 33, managed to squeeze his Fiesta ST all the way in, but was left stuck in his car because there wasn't enough space to open his door. 'Abysmal': Claire Walker and her partner Andy Birkhead (seen left with son Billy), were stunned to discover the garage at their brand new £200,000 home is too small for their car to fit inside (right) Tight squeeze: Ms Walker claims the garage is not fit for purpose, and said it effectively knocks £8,000 off the value of the family's newly built home in Huddersfield . The couple, who have a two-year-old son, Billy, only discovered the problem when they cleared out belongings they had been storing in the garage since moving into their new £209,950 home in March. When they complained to developer Persimmon, they were told they should have measured the garage before buying their new house, said Ms Walker. The furious health and safety manager has been told that the bungle could knock up to £8,000 off the value of their home. She said: 'It's not fit for purpose. The garage doesn't do what a garage should do. I'm absolutely fuming about it.' She explained: 'We didn't realise for a few months because the garage was stored with our belongings that we hadn't sorted after the move. I tried to get my car in recently but the wing mirrors make it too wide. 'It's a company car so I didn't want to scratch it, so Andy tried to get his car in. 'He could get it inside, but he couldn't open the doors. So unless you have a sunroof it doesn't look like there's any way you can get a car into the garage and step out of it.' Furious: Ms Walker, 37, said the garage - which measures 2m and 44cm from wall to wall - is too small to fit an average-sized family car . No room: The couple, who have a two-year-old son, spent £209,950 on the detached family home in Huddersfield . Ms Walker said the neighbours she has spoken to hadn't realised the problem, because none of them had been using their garages to store their cars. She explained that the specification for the house in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, gave dimensions for all rooms in the house - except the garage. She said: 'I've asked a number of estate agents about the problem, and at least two have told me that I can't advertise my house as having a garage if I know it doesn't function as a garage. 'They said they add 8,000 pounds on to the value of a house if it has a garage - so we've lost that off the 209,950 pounds we paid for the house. 'A house is meant to be an investment - and this one feels like a poor investment. 'I wrote to the chief operating officer of Persimmon but he replied saying he had referred the matter to the technical director in the regional team. 'Poor investment': Ms Walker said the garage houses a tumble dryer and lawnmower instead of the family car . 'And that technical director suggested that I should have measured the garage before we put down a deposit. It's abysmal. 'When you buy a three-bedroom detached family home with a garage you expect the garage to be big enough to get a car into.' Ms Walker has since got out her measuring tape and researched the size of popular family cars on the internet. She found that the garage door width of 2m 3cm was too small for eight of the 14 cars she compared. 'Persimmon deemed the size to be appropriate but it's clearly not,' she said. Including wing mirror width the cars that wouldn't fit included some of the most popular models, from a Ford Focus to a Honda Civic. The garage is big enough to accommodate the Fiesta, the Vauxhall Astra, the Audi A3, the BMW 1 Series, the Mercedes C Class and the VW Jetta. But while the cars would go in, the 2m 44cm wall-to-wall width means none would have sufficient space to open the driver door. For now the 'garage' is used to store a dryer, two filing cabinets, a lawnmower and a strimmer. The mother-of-one said: 'Because the garage is built into the house we realise that they can't just knock it down and start again. 'We asked Persimmon if they would plaster the third wall - two are already done - and put some lino on the floor, so we could use it as a storage room with at least more insulation than it has now to keep out the damp, but they refused.' The couple's drive only has room for one car so they've asked for it to be widened to fit two cars, but they have heard nothing back since. 'We're not asking for anything drastic. It's not like we're asking them to knock down the house and start again,' Ms Walker said. Wayne Gradwell, managing director at Persimmon Homes, said: 'As one of the UK's leading housebuilders it can only be a matter of deep regret to us if any customer is dissatisfied with their new home. 'The garage in question is comparable with new build properties across the UK. We continue to work with Miss Walker and Mr Birkhead to try and resolve the situation.' A spokesperson for Persimmon added: 'The dimensions of each garage are governed by both the size of the house and the relevant planning regulations and are clearly laid out in the marketing brochure. We deeply regret that Miss Walker and Mr Birkhead are unhappy with the size of their garage.'","Couple say the garage at their newly built home is not fit for purpose .

"A British sailor hopes to break the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a powerboat shaped like a torpedo. Alan Priddy, 61, plans to beat the previous record of 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes held by Pete Bethune from New Zealand. The world record attempt is expected to start on November 1 next year and will stop at 10 countries around the world for refuelling including Puerto Rico, Honolulu and Singapore. Scroll down for video . The team hope to begin construction of the 80ft boat early next year so they can start the voyage in November . Mr Priddy, from Portsmouth, conceived the idea four years ago and has now secured £2.9million in funding. The project team, named Team Britannia, hope to begin construction of the 80 foot boat early next year so they can set off from Gibraltar on their 24,000 mile voyage next year. The 'floating fuel tank' has been designed to pierce waves rather than surfing across them, which the team hope will  make the trip smoother than a boat with a conventional hull. Made from marine-grade aluminium - 80 per cent of which will be recycled - it will carry 7,700 gallons of what the team say is a revolutionary emulsion fuel, which reduces harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide when burned. It will have an estimated top speed of 34.4 knots and an estimated average speed of 22.5 knots. Alan Priddy, 61, conceived the idea four years ago and has now secured £2.9million in funding . Length of vessel - 80 feet . Empty weight - 16 tons . Fully laden weight - 45 tons . Estimated top speed (light) - 34.4 knots . Estimated top speed (heavy) - 18.1 knots . Gallon fuel tank - 7,700 . Design and build costs - £2.9million . Fuel saved by streamlined hull - 30 per cent . Made from recycled aluminium -  80 per cent . Mr Priddy, who has already beaten 37 world records on sea, said: 'This project is the culmination of a lifetime's work that I hope will highlight the amazing qualities and skills that we have in abundance in our country - the best sailors, engineers, boat builders and designers. 'This is why when we started this project six years ago we called ourselves Team Britannia. 'We have the finest maritime designers, builders and sailors in the world. The British boat Cable & Wireless Adventurer first set the round the world powerboat record in 1998 and held it for nearly a decade. 'When this record, the pinnacle of powerboating, was lost to the New Zealand boat Earthrace, I knew we had an amazing opportunity to once again showcase the best of British. To show why our marine industry is still the best. 'Team Britannia aims to do just that. It brings together just a few of the people who make Britain and our marine sector great.' The route will see the team head west from Gibraltar, with stops at Puerto Rico, Acapulco in Mexico, Honolulu, Guam, Singapore, Oman and Malta to take on fuel. To complete the record attempt the boat must pass through the Suez and Panama Canals, cross the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, and start and finish in the same place. Mr Priddy will set off with a crew of seven and hopes to offer a place to injured servicemen or women on each leg of the voyage.","Alan Priddy hopes to break the world record for circumnavigating the globe .

"Church camp: The occupation could cost around £1million in lost tourist revenue after St Paul's closed its doors on Friday . The anti-capitalist protest forcing St Paul’s Cathedral to close is a ‘big charade’ with only one in ten tents occupied overnight, the Daily Mail can reveal. Footage from a thermal imaging camera shot by a police helicopter revealed that the ramshackle camp is almost completely empty during the cold nights. It suggests the majority of the 300 ‘defiant’ protesters at the cathedral return home or to hotels after dark to sleep in warm beds. Corporation of London councillor . Matthew Richardson said: ‘It’s incredible. The overnight monitoring of . the site by the police showed that 90 per cent of the tents are . unoccupied. 'It just shows most of the demonstrators don’t have the courage of their convictions and are just here to make trouble. ‘Leaving your tent here overnight is a good way to do it. It’s a phantom camp – a big charade.’ St . Paul’s shut for the first time since World War Two last week after the . site doubled in size in a week and the demonstrators refused to move. The . protesters discussed the number of empty tents in the camp at a meeting . on Sunday and made plans to organise a system to allocate them to any . newcomers. Discussing tactics: Occupy London protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral hold an evening meeting to discuss the location and nature of the banners at the campsite . Giant signs . hang over the encampment denouncing capitalism, but many of the . activists spent much of yesterday sitting in a Starbucks overlooking the . churchyard, several working on laptops. However, most activists maintain a front . of selfless commitment to their cause, with a sign attached to one tent . proclaiming: ‘All day, all week, we’ll sleep on London’s freezing . streets. Solidarity!’ An activist at the centre of the . Dale Farm demonstration and Occupy London’s protest camp is the son of a . property developer it emerged last night. But 21-year-old Jack Hartcup says he does not want to benefit from his father’s success. Mr Hartcup, who is studying a philosophy degree at Anglia Ruskin University, insisted: . ‘I’m an anarchist and I don’t believe in leadership. ‘I’m not set to inherit this fortune. I don’t believe in property. ‘My father has done very well for himself but I don’t intend to do what he does. He has gone along with the capitalist system.’ His . 54-year-old father, James, is the director of Eclipse Building Ltd, . which owns the Eclipse building – a £10million development in North . London. Until 2008 Mr . Hartcup was registered as living with his father in one of the 14 luxury . flats, which sell for more than £1.5million and cost up to £1,500 per . week to rent. The protest is one of several in . Europe, inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York, . intended to highlight inequalities caused by mismanagement of the . economy. The . revelation about the part-time protesters came as it emerged that any . legal move to evict the camp would be likely to drag on for months. But St Paul’s is facing increasing pressure to take legal action to try to remove the protesters. Mr Richardson said: ‘The church has to make a decision and the sooner the better. ‘It is frustrating, but they are just muddling through the best they can. ‘If this church stays closed there’s going to be tremendous trouble. ‘It . could stay closed for Remembrance day, and even Christmas.’ Mark Field, . Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster, said: ‘St Paul’s . is a Unesco World Heritage site and they have turned it into a Third . World shanty town. ‘There’s masses of space in front of the entrance and yet the doors are shut. I’d love to have an explanation for that.’ A City of London Police spokesman said: ‘We continue to use a range of techniques to facilitate peaceful protests.’ He . added: ‘We are constantly assessing the site and continue to provide . low-key policing that facilitates peaceful protest while minimising . disruption to the local people.’ Unhappy hordes: The protesters have set up an 'overflow' campsite in Islington's Finsbury Square near the cathedral . Season's strife: The demonstrators' plans to stay until Christmas could force the cathedral to cancel a swathe of events and services .","Thermal imaging suggests protesters return home or to hotels overnight .

"Nick Clegg clearly suffered when the spoof musical version of his apology for breaking his promise not to raise university fees was played on the Andrew Marr show. Trying to laugh it off, he managed: ‘It’s catchy, very catchy.’ Mr Clegg has given permission for the track to be released in aid of charity. Last night it was at 143 in the singles chart. Scroll down for video . Awkward: Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg grimaces as the remix of his videoed apology for breaking his manifesto promise not to raise tuition fees is played on the Andrew Marr show . Following his interview with political journalist Mr Marr, the Deputy Prime Minister was asked during a Lib Dem conference Q&A what he would do if the song reached number one in the pop charts. But it was his decision to apologise for promising to block a rise in tuition fees – subsequently broken after the coalition was formed – which dominated the hour long session, during which he also revealed yesterday was his wedding anniversary. Uppermost in people’s minds was the idea that the hilarious remix of his ‘sorry’ video – in which he appeared to sing his apology – was set to make him the first Cabinet minister to have a single in the top 40. Questions about how Nick Clegg would celebrate if his remixed apology video topped the charts proved academic - the song by satirical website The Poke only reached 143 . Nick Clegg Says I'm Sorry (the . Autotune remix) stormed up the iTunes chart after its release on Friday . night, reaching number 35 ahead of the likes of Kanye West and Carly Rae . Jepson. But when Radio 1 DJ Reggie Yates announced the official chart tonight, Mr Clegg was nowhere to be seen. Based on record sales for the entire . week, it seems the release of the Clegg song late on Friday night came . too late to make an impression on the record-buying public. It scraped into the top 150 after the . Lib Dem leader gave permission to the track's creator, satirical website . www.thepoke.co.uk, to release it as a single. Mr Clegg told the conference: 'Just . when I thought life couldn't get any stranger, a video of me gets . remixed and becomes a YouTube sensation.'

Lib Dem activists applauded when Nick Clegg announced it was the 12th anniversary of tyring the knot with Miriam . Opinion in Brighton was split over . whether the apology was the right thing to do, with many activists still . signed up to the idea of abolishing tuition fees. But Mr Clegg defended the apology, filmed at his home in Putney, south west London. He told delegates in the conference . hall: 'I hope with the passage of time more people reaise that the . system which is coming into effect is not as pernicious as it was . thought.’ But he was challenged by one activist . who pointed out that before the 2010 general election Mr Clegg had . promised the Lib Dems would be the party that did not break promises, . ‘and then first thing we did was break a promise’. Whose round is it? Nick Clegg gets the drinks in . Mr Clegg insisted: ‘To my dying day I firmly believe we did the right thing by going into government.’ He later stumbled on his words when . referring to the economic plight of other European countries, telling . the audience he mentioned Spain’s woes in trepidation because his . Spanish wife Miriam had just arrived. But he saved his strongest words to . confirm his determination to block 'wild' Tory demands for another . £10billion to be slashed off the benefit bill after 2015.

'What I can assure you is that we will not allow some of these wild suggestions that have been made from the right of British politics, that all the savings can be made from welfare.

"Rhys Webb intends to 'give it my best shot' in the battle for Wales scrum-half starting duty against Australia next month. Ospreys half-back Webb is viewed in many quarters as favourite to wear the number nine shirt ahead of 87 times-capped British and Irish Lion Mike Phillips. While Phillips has had to content himself with a regular bench role for French club Racing Metro this season, Webb has been at the hub of Ospreys' impressive Guinness PRO12 form. Ospreys scrum-half Rhys Webb is pushing for the Wales starting jersey . Lions star Mike Phillips could be dropped having recently enjoyed a stronghold over his position . The league leaders have been guided superbly by Webb and fly-half Dan Biggar, suggesting they could take their domestic partnership into the Test match arena on November 8. 'He (Phillips) is obviously a world-class nine,' Webb, 25, said. 'He has had so many caps for Wales, he is a British Lion, so he is number one. 'I am happy enough enough to come in, give it my best shot and leave it up to the coaches then. 'There is plenty to work on. I know I have to pick my game up nother notch. 'I am just looking forward to getting down to the hard work on the training pitch with the squad. 'It is nice to be fully fit for a change! I've had a good run of games and got my confidence up. I am just really enjoying my rugby at the moment.' Webb, who has won six caps, gained Wales coach Warren Gatland's vote for two games in last season's RBS 6 Nations Championship, starting against France and England before suffering an injury at Twickenham. Dan Biggar, the first choice Wales fly-half, works well in tandem with Webb . But he now appears on course to reclaim a shirt that Phillips has largely made his own, particularly during Gatland's coaching reign that began more than six years ago. 'I am really enjoying it,' said Webb, of his prolific partnership with Biggar. 'It's good to have someone like Dan outside me. 'We've known each other for a long time now, and we know each other inside and out. Playing together week in, week out is obviously good for the (Ospreys) squad and the team. 'I know when he wants the ball and when he wants to kick, and I know when to take the pressure off him if I can see there is too much pressure on him. 'I think with the Ospreys this season I have taken that ownership and taken the pressure off him a bit. 'There is a sense of excitement in the Wales camp. 'The World Cup is a long way off, but it all starts against Australia next week, so hopefully we can have a good training week leading up to that. 'I think a lot of the boys will be frustrated with the South Africa game just gone (Wales lost 31-30 in Nelspruit in June), and really have a point to prove as well.'

"BBC's director General Lord Hall, pictured, wants to target iPlayer users . Enforcement officers working on behalf of the BBC are being offered bonuses of up to £1,000 a month to pursue people who fail to pay the TV licence fee. Almost 200,000 people are taken to court each year accused of failing to pay the £145.50 fee. They risk a £1,000 fine, a criminal record and even jail. Now private firm Capita, which runs the BBC's licensing service, has launched a major recruitment drive to hire extra 'enforcement officers' to hunt down even more fee dodgers. Potential employees were told they could double their basic salaries with commission for collecting the evidence the BBC needs to prosecute householders. A Capita regional manager said: 'A decent officer, hitting targets nine times out of ten, in London, is [on] £30k plus, quite easily.' Enforcement officers are offered a basic salary of £14,000, which rises to £17,000 in London, but they can as much as double this with commission – the equivalent of an extra £1,000 a month. Capita's two-day recruitment drive began last week, on the same day Culture Secretary Sajid Javid called for a review into decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. The BBC is responsible for more than one in ten criminal prosecutions, leading to complaints these are clogging up the criminal courts. Last night Tory MP Andrew Bridgen called on the BBC to review how it collects the fee. He said: 'I'm sure the public will come forward with some evidence of the heavy-handed way licence fee collection is enforced. 'I know from the stories sent to me that there'll be some pretty harrowing accounts. 'I personally know people who have felt so intimidated by enforcement officers that they have paid for a TV licence even when they haven't owned a television. 'They couldn't stand the stress of the aggressive methods and officers knocking on the door.' At a recruitment day, aspiring officers were told the purpose of the role is to 'maximise sales for the BBC' and 'enforce prosecution proceedings by taking statements under caution'. Once an officer has taken 30 statements from householders in a week they can start earning commission. These are higher if customers pay in full on the doorstep. There is a smaller bonus if customers choose to pay in instalments – in case they cancel payments – or if those not at home end up taking out a licence after a calling card is left at their address. This is considered an 'indirect sale'. Last night critics said these bonuses could encourage officers to harass householders for upfront payments. Private firm Capita, which runs the BBC's licensing service, has launched a major recruitment drive to hire extra 'enforcement officers' to hunt down even more fee dodgers (file pic) John O'Connell of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'It doesn't seem right that these officers are incentivised to push for full payments over instalments, when the whole reason some people may not be paying on time is that they're short of cash.' In 2012, 193,049 people were prosecuted for not paying for a TV licence, accounting for one in nine of all cases in the magistrates' courts. Most of those found guilty were fined up to £1,000 and given a criminal record, and between 50 and 70 viewers are sent to jail each year after they fail to pay the court fines. Mr Javid last week said a review of licence fee enforcement 'needs to begin now'. He said: 'In 2012/13, almost 200,000 people ended up in court accused of not buying a TV licence. 'More than 50 were sent to prison. When over 10 per cent of magistrates' court cases concern this one offence, you have to ask whether the current system is really working. 'The Government is committed to a review of decriminalisation once the Deregulation Bill receives Royal Assent. But we can't afford to wait that long. This needs to begin now.' Last month the BBC's director general Lord Hall said viewers who avoid paying the licence by only watching catch-up shows on iPlayer could still have to pay. He said: 'It could be modernised again so it applies to watching BBC programmes both live and on iPlayer. This is for the Government to decide, but worth considering.' In June, the Daily Mail revealed that 463,846 people avoided buying a TV licence through the iPlayer loophole, declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year. A TV Licensing spokesman said: 'In 2013/14 licence fee evasion cost the BBC between £196million and £235million in lost revenue, so it's important that we minimise evasion to ensure as much money as possible goes towards BBC programmes. 'We do everything we can to make sure people are aware of their legal obligations and are given every opportunity to pay for a TV licence.'","Private firm Capita launched recruitment drive to hire more officers .

"The Missouri Department of Corrections discovered, upon preparing to release a prisoner who had served a 13-year sentence in July 2013, that the prisoner had never been incarcerated and promptly sent him to prison. In the intervening 13 years since his 1999 arrest, Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson III, 36, has transformed his life, becoming a master carpenter, starting his own business and marrying and having children. In July last year, as he and his youngest daughter slept in the St Louis home he built for his family, a SWAT team outfitted in tactical gear and helmets swarmed the house, arresting the terrified father of four and delivering him to the Missouri Department of Corrections, where he's been ever since. 13 years late: Mike Anderson is currently nine months into a 13-year prison sentence for a crime committed in 1999 . Now, Anderson is fighting to be released from prison, where he's nine months into the original 13-year sentence. The Riverfront Times reports that it appears some kind of clerical error is responsible for Anderson's predicament. In 1999, Anderson and another man robbed a Burger King store manager of the day's takings as he attempted to deposit the cash in a night-deposit box. The pair used a BB gun and Anderson was arrested two months later after witnesses gave police his car license plate number. Between 2000 and 2004, Anderson filed a series of appeals which were ultimately unsuccessful. At that point, his bail should have been revoked and he should have been taken into custody - but he never was. Family man: Anderson with his wife LaQonna and their four children. In the years since his arrest he has built a business and a loving family life . As the weeks and months passed by, Anderson never attempted to hide: he registered a business, Anderson Construction and Investment, to his home address and married his wife, LaQonna Anderson. He coached his son's football team and volunteered at his local church. He even filed a post-conviction appeal that clearly stated 'Movant is not presently incarcerated.' His co-accused, Laron Harris, was convicted and sentenced to 10 years. In filings, Anderson's address is clearly stated as Webster Groves, whereas the listing for Harris is the Missouri Department of Corrections. No one commented on this discrepancy and Anderson remained free for seven years after his final appeal failed in 2005. Tim Lohmar, the current prosecutor for St. Charles County, where the armed robbery occurred, is baffled at the error. 'Somebody messed up. Somebody messed up big time,' he told CBS News. As to whether Anderson deserves to be free, he said, 'The jury heard the evidence, the judge upheld the sentence,' he says. 'As unfair as it may seem to he and his family, he's got 13 years he owes the state. I don't think there's much more to say than that.' Model citizen: After his scrape with the law, Anderson became a master carpenter, married, and built his family a home from the ground up . Anderson's father, Cornealious Michael Anderson II, said that his son went through a rebellious phase as a young man, but has completely redeemed himself. He had no prior convictions at the time of the crime, and held a full-time job at AT&T. 'If the point of incarceration is rehabilitation, the job's already done,' he told the Riverfront Times. Anderson's attorney Patrick Michael Megaro has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the warden of Southeast Correctional facility where Anderson is being held, challenging the state's right to hold Anderson. It argues that forcing Anderson to serve his sentence 13 years after it was given is a violation of due process, and that taking him away from his family, work and home constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. 'Petitioner was left alone by the State of Missouri for 13 years and led to believe that the State had given up on execution of the judgment. To require this man to now begin serving a sentence in 2013 that should have been completed in 2013 is in essence to double his sentence,' reads the petition. If the petition is rejected, Megaro plans to appeal. Frank Bowman, professor at the . University of Missouri School of Law, said that if all else fails, . Anderson's only other recourse would be clemency. 'Say, . ""Hey, governor, can you pardon him or commute his sentence in light of . this error on the part of the state? This person has taken advantage of . this great chance, has kept his nose clean and become a great citizen. After all, you have budgetary problems. What good is it going to do to . stick this family man inside and pay for his room and board?""' Abrupt end: Anderson and his wife LaQonna, a hotel manager, who way away on business at the time of his arrest . However, Governor Nixon has only granted one prisoner clemency since he took office in 2009. By contrast, the governor of Illinois has granted 900 during the same period. If Anderson is forced to serve out his original sentence, he will be 50 by the time he is released. His business will have failed, his children will be grown up, and his wife will have had to raise them by herself. The victim of his crime contacted the Riverfront Times after reading about Anderson's plight. Known only as Dennis, he says he doesn't believe Anderson should go to jail. '[The state] were supposed to make sure he went to jail,' he said. '[Anderson] screwed up and he was supposed to pay for it. Our government screwed up. Who's paying for that? Does he have to pay for that again? Doesn't seem right.' Anderson says he feels guilty for the crime he committed, but believes his time would be better spent being a productive member of the community. 'Yes, I feel responsible. I could have stopped it,' Anderson says of the robbery. 'A year or two in jail, yeah, I would have done that. I knew that I was there. I knew that something could have been done, but I ran. I was scared. But 13 years for that? There are guys in here on attempted murder; they've been here for ten years, for taking a life.' The court has issued an order for Missouri’s attorney general to respond to Megaro's petition by April 15. Megaro has started a online petition on behalf of Anderson to lobby Attorney General of the State of Missouri and Mississippi County Judge T. Lynn Brown to release him from prison.","Cornealious 'Mike' Anderson was sentenced to 13 years prison in 2000 for armed robbery .

Build-up: The prince's visit comes amid Nato's largest ever military exercises in Estonia . Prince Harry and his former roommate chatted in the sunshine today in a muddy field in the Estonian countryside, surrounded by troops from the Baltic state, Britain and the U.S. As Harry approached Captain Tarlap he said: 'I remember him, that's a familiar face.' Joined by Major General Riho Terras, the head of Estonia's Armed Forces, he added: 'I was trying to explain the reason why we became friends, because you had the internet, the computer, do you remember?' The Estonian officer smiled and replied: 'So you could email your girlfriend.' The two men shared a room with a number of other officers during the prince's first tour of Afghanistan, when he worked as a forward air controller co-ordinating air strikes on Taliban positions. Captain Tarlap, 34, then a lieutenant, was a liaison officer between the British forces and an Estonian company of around 150 men under UK command. They only worked together for a few weeks, but quickly struck up a friendship and exchanged battalion emblems as a sign of their closeness. Harry was pictured proudly wearing the Estonian Guard Battalion's Eagle on his body armour during his deployment. Joking about the military emblem that Captain Tarlap had given him, Harry said to his friend today: 'I've got no Velcro on me, so you can't stick anything to me.' Speaking after the Prince had left, Captain Tarlap added: 'I was the only guy in the camp who had a computer with internet access so he had the chance to chat to his girlfriend or family. Sunshine: The Prince enjoyed warm weather after arriving at the military site in Estonia by helicopter . Just dropping in: The Prince arrived in fine weather in a helicopter to the muddy Estonian field . Memories: The visit harked back to Prince Harry's 10-week deployment to Helmand Province in 2007 . Guest of honour: The Prince made the visit this morning accompanied by the President of Estonia (right) Military man: The Prince arrived in Estonia yesterday - and his mode of transport was a £143 Easyjet flight . 'I think everyone was trying to get a connection with people at home. 'We were sharing a room and he would just knock on my shoulder and asked if he could use my computer.' At the time Harry was dating girlfriend Chelsy Davy. The pair split up and were reunited a number of times before the relationship finally ended a few years ago. Captain Tarlap added: 'When the Estonian company wanted to do some patrolling in the area we ordered some air support and I would ask Harry if this was possible and he always tried to do it. 'It was always planned but sometimes it was a last-minute call. Partners: Harry took part in a friendship ceremony with Estonia, which has been close to Britain since 1918 . Spot the Prince: Harry was meeting Estonian troops alongside Nato forces from Britain and the U.S. Ceremony: A company of Estonian soldiers has been under British command in Afghanistan since 2006 . Honour: The visit to a field this morning will be followed by a tour to Italy by Prince Harry tomorrow . 'He was usually in a good mood and happy - he was always positive. 'He would make jokes and just talk about simple things usually. He was very friendly and always happy and excited to get new tasks from his commander. 'You know what he is but when you speak to each other you use first names like everyone else.' The troops Prince Harry met were part of an exercise called Spring Storm, which involves servicemen from Britain, Estonia and the . U.S. and is the largest army exercise in the Estonians' training . calendar. Soldiers from . the 1st Battalion the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, who have worked . alongside their Estonian counterparts in Afghanistan, are taking part in . the training, the final exercise for Estonian conscripts after a year . of national service.

"Dressed in fatigues and flanked by younger Kurdish soldiers, Brian Wilson uses the Arabic acronym Daesh, a name ISIS reportedly hates, to refer to the extremist group he plans to fight in Syria. The 43-year-old Desert Storm veteran from Ohio says in a video released by Reuters he is one of a few Americans that traveled to 'help the YPG.' While Americans have been confirmed to be among the ranks of ISIS, and among their dead, Wilson is the second American reported to be fighting against the extremist group on the side of the Kurds. Scroll down for video . Brothers in arms: Brian Wilson (center) is seen with four Kurdish fighters in Syria and said he is one of a handful of Americans who has gone to Syria to 'help the YPG' The YPG, or People's Protection Units, is the militia fighting ISIS in the Kurdish-controlled territory in Syria. Kurdish militants are currently engaged in intense street fighting with Islamic State militants over the town of Kobani along the border of Turkey. American-led air strikes only slowed the incursion of ISIS extremists on the town, though The Guardian reports that YPG fighters have been able to hold on to most of the city. Wilson himself has not yet seen combat, having traveled to Syria through his 'Kurdish contacts,' and gave the interview in Qamishli, a town about 180 miles east of Kobani. Wilson's family is still unsure why he left behind his children to join up with the Kurdish militia, though a relative said: 'He's a real big history buff and he has talked about the situation there.' A spokesman for the militia said that Jordan Matson, a 28-year-old from Wisconsin, is also fighting with the YPG and has given an interview to a Kurdish TV station. Foreign fighters: Jordan Matson, 28, also joined the Kurdish militia to fight off Islamic militants, saying that he was upset seeing 'Christians being slaughtered' Departure: News reports say Matson left his girlfriend to join up with the YPG, though others mistook him for a bank employee in Wisconsin . YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil confirmed Matson was with the group and said 'He is fighting in the Jazaa area,' which is in northeast Syria and has been the setting of numerous clashes with ISIS. Matson described himself as a former Marine, though a U.S. Army spokesperson said he was a private first class in the army from May 2006 to November 2007. The Midwesterner, who was seen dressed in fatigues and a shemagh, or headscarf, was reportedly wounded by a mortar shell, according to a tweet from Xelil on October 1. While Wilson waits to join the YPG fighters in battle, he says that the Kurds have welcomed him in their territory. Recruit: There are few clues why the 43-year-old Desert Storm veteran joined up with the Kurds in Syria, though he reportedly talked of the conflict before traveling to Syria . Enlisted: Wilson joined the YPG through Kurdish contacts he had and described his hosts as 'very nice, very accommodating, hospitable' 'Everything has been fine. They're very nice, very . accommodating, hospitable. Very good people,' he said in the video. At a meeting last week chaired by U.S. President Barack Obama, the U.N. Security Council said all countries should make it a serious criminal offense for their citizens to fight abroad with militant groups. The United States has no specific law preventing individuals from joining groups like ISIS, but it has anti-terrorism laws that it has used to prosecute those associated with such groups. The YPG has not been designated by the United States as a terrorist organization but it has close ties to the Kurdistan Workers Party in Turkey, which does have such a designation. The PKK has spent three decades fighting for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds.","Brian Wilson spoke to Reuters from Qamishli, east of the beseiged town of Kobani, where Kurdish militia members were fighting with ISIS militants .

"His ode to nature's 'mists and mellow fruitfulness' came from daily walks to a local beauty spot. And for years fans of John Keats have flocked to the Hampshire meadows thought to have inspired his words. But new research suggests the real site, which seemed to sum up the joys of Autumn, is buried under a multi-storey car park. Eyesore: The car park is run by the local council and its position will disappoint poetry fans . How it was: A sketch of the city around the time Keats visited in 1819 . In a blow to tourists following in the footsteps of Britain's best-loved poet, the closest they may get to his scenic 'stubble fields' is a red-brick eyesore run by Winchester City Council. Academics at Aberystwyth University made the astonishing discovery after looking at a historic guidebook to the city from around the time Keats, a Londoner, spent a few months there in 1819. That is known to be when he composed his 'Ode to Autumn', read by generations of schoolchildren. It begins: 'Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun.' Not so idyllic: The car park in Winchester that researchers believe stands on the site of meadows that inspired John Keats to write Ode to Autumn . In an engraving showing a panorama of the city centre, they realised a dark area on the side of St Giles Hill was actually a cornfield - and believe this is actually Keat's famous 'reap'd furrow'. Months of research revealed that standing from this exact point would explain a number of other references in the poem which have never been accounted for. The discovery has been greeted with surprise by tourism officers in the town who currently advise visitors to follow a 'Keats Walk' taking in idyllic meadows by the river. More appealing: A nicer view of the city, with the River Itchen winding its way past Winchester College . Richard Marggraf Turley, a professor of English Literature said: 'We looked closely at this engraving and saw the ploughed cornfield on St Giles Hill, which no-one had noticed before. It is now a multi-storey car park. 'Keats fans come flocking every year to the meadows, to swoon at the maturing sun over the scenery, but we believe it is the wrong place. He may have written other things there, but not the poem everyone knows him for. Poet: John Keats who used Winchester for inspiration . 'We hope to talk to the tourist board . about our findings and I think it would be good if they could change the . Keats walk to take in the real site. Perhaps they could put up a plaque . there to let people know.' Prof Turley and his colleagues say the new location makes sense as this would explain Keats reference to a 'hilly gourds' in the poem. It would also explain the sheep he . mentions, which were known to be herded there, and the fact his . 'maturing sun' set in the west. If . he was walking in the meadows outside Winchester, where there are no . hills, he would have seen the sun setting in the east, the researchers . said. They say it puts a . dramatically different spin on the poem, as this land had been . publicly-owned but was sold – controversially - to a profiteer landowner . named Nicholas Waller. Land leases from Hampshire Register Office confirm the sale and that it was a cornfield. 'It . all makes sense now', Prof Turley said. 'And it makes the poem much . more political as the reapers Keats mentioned would have been working . hard but unable to afford the corn they were harvesting. 'These were turbulent times, rather like today, and this could be interesting comment on these social changes.' Rachel . Gander of the Winchester Tourist Information Office said: 'People do . self-guided Keats Walks from our leaflets and there are some guided ones . too, which were developed with advice from our historical experts. 'We've . always thought John Keats wrote 'Ode 'To Autumn' about the . water-meadows south of Winchester, which do exist. I'm not sure how much . visitors would want to see a car park but we will have a look into it.' Ellen Simpson, head of . tourism at Winchester City Council said: 'We know Keats did walk along . the meadows and that he wrote the poem after doing that walk so people . are not being duped. 'But it is quite possible that St Giles Hill was part of the walk, and that's where these stubble covered fields were. 'If . so, maybe our sunset walk needs re-modelling. Our historical knowledge . is being updated all the time, so this is fascinating and the debate . rages on.' Jayne Elizabeth . Archer, co-author of the paper to be published in the Review of English . Studies, said: 'Winchester had something so precious for so long under . its feet, but didn't know.'",Academics at Aberystwyth University used a guidebook from the time of poet's visit to Winchester to trace the area behind Ode to Autumn .
"They may look like an abstract painting, or even microscope slides, but these coloured straight lines are made of tulips. A nature photographer has captured bright aerials of tulip fields in the outskirts of Amsterdam to reveal their geometric perfection. Simone Sbaraglia, from Rome, Italy, was inspired to take the images from the air because he was interested in the geometry and colours of the flower-filled fields, which stretch for miles. A nature photographer has captured bright aerials of tulip fields in the outskirts of Amsterdam where they are grown in immaculate rows of differing colours (pictured) The photographer took hundreds of images of the fields over four days in April 2014. Mr Sbaraglia, 42, hoped to highlight the perfectly straight lines in his images – and was not disappointed. The lines resemble those seen in the works of famous abstract painter Barnett Newman and other US painters of the time. They create a sense of simplicity, beauty and harmony in the images, the photographer explained.

This image shows the perfect lines of flowers close-up . The photographer explained that the lines of tulips (pictured) create a sense of simplicity, beauty and harmony in the images . ‘I am especially drawn to the geometry and colours, so I loved the harmony of the tulip fields from an aerial view,’ Mr Sbaraglia said. ‘Having rented a small aeroplane, I explored the area from above, taking several hundred photographs in total. ‘I was happy with the results, as, to me, the pictures seemed like the abstract paintings, and that was what I was looking for.’ Though estimates vary, it is believed that Holland produces more than three billion tulip bulbs every year, and they come in a huge variety of colours. ‘I am especially drawn to the geometry and colours, so I loved the harmony of the tulip fields (pictured) from an aerial view,’ Mr Sbaraglia said.

Biologist Carolus Clusius planted tulips in Vienna's  Imperial Botanical Garden in 1573 and later went on to establish Leiden University's Hortus Botanicus. The year 1594 is considered the date of the tulip's first flowering in the Netherlands, which took place at the university. This is despite reports of the flower being grown in private gardens in Antwerp and Amsterdam decades earlier. Mr Clausius is largely responsible for the spread of tulip bulbs in the final years of the sixteenth century and made note of the variations in colour. Between 1634 and 1637, the enthusiasm for the new flowers triggered a speculative frenzy now known as the tulip mania, when the flowers became so expensive that they were treated as a type of currency.

"A raft of manslaughter charges could be laid following the  decision to reopen the criminal investigation into the Hillsborough disaster, it emerged last night. The new police probe was announced yesterday by Home Secretary Theresa May as the High Court quashed the original inquest verdicts of accidental death and ordered new inquests. Former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart will lead the investigation, which will look at the  possibility of charging agencies other than the police over the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final. Scroll down for video . Relief: Families of the 96 fans killed in the Hillsborough disaster outside the High Court in London today, where the original inquest verdicts into the deaths were overturned . Investigation: Theresa May announced a fresh police investigation into the Hillsborough tragedy, in which 96 football fans died while attending an FA Cup semi-final . These could include the Football . Association, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield City . Council. Ambulance services are also likely to face an investigation. The police probe will work alongside . an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints  Commission which . could bring charges against police officers. It follows the publication in . September of an independent report, which found South Yorkshire Police . lied about the disaster and then covered up the truth. The supporters died in a . crush at Sheffield Wednesday’s Hillsborough stadium on April 15, . where their team were to meet Nottingham Forest. A raft of failings were identified in the report, conducted by the Hillsborough Independent Panel, showing that authorities attempted to shift the blame on to the victims, many of whom could have been saved. It also ultimately led to the . resignation of West Yorkshire Chief Constable Sir Norman Bettison, who . was a chief inspector with South Yorkshire Police at the time. The panel’s report found there were . clear operational failures in response to the disaster and up to 41 fans . could potentially have survived. The report also triggered a raft of apologies from the likes of Prime Minister . David Cameron and former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie. United: Around 40 family members travelled to London to hear Attorney General explaining why the inquest verdicts should be overuled . Relief: MP Andy Burnham, left, hugs Margaret Aspinall as they celebrate with other families on the steps of the court today . Mr MacKenzie was the editor of The Sun when it ran a front page story blaming fans for the disaster. Home Secretary Theresa May today announced that former Durham Chief Constable Jon Stoddart will lead a new inquiry. She said: 'I am determined to see a swift and . thorough response to the findings of the Hillsborough Panel to deliver . justice for the 96 football fans who died and the families who have . fought so hard on their behalf.' Mr . Stobbart will be prevented from recruiting anybody to his team with a . prior connection to Hillsborough, or any officers who worked in the West . midlands, Merseyside or South Yorkshire police forces. His investigation will also work closely with the IPCC's report into police conduct in the aftermath of the disaster. Mr Stobbart spoke of the 'great significance and personal responsibility' attached to the investigation. He added: 'My first priority is to meet with as . many of the families as possible and to establish a working open . relationship with them throughout the investigation. 'I have held a number of meetings . already and have been struck by the families’ humility and steadfast . determination to see justice delivered for their loved ones. Reports: Attorney General Dominic Grieve, left, brought an application to the High Court seeking to have the original inquest verdicts into the 96 fans' deaths overturned, while Theresa May, right, announced a new police investigation . 'My role is to ensure that we . determine exactly what happened in the lead-up to and on the day of the . disaster and establish where any culpability lies.' Jenni Hicks, who lost her teenage daughters Sarah and Victoria at Hillsborough, welcomed the investigation, saying: 'Accountability has to come now'. She added: 'After the truth we had in September it has to be followed up with accountability, and I think today is the first step of that, which is brilliant.' The announcement of the investigation was made before Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge and two other judges in London ordered fresh inquests following Mr Greive's application. Family members of the victims have long . campaigned to have the verdicts overturned and many turned up at the . Royal Courts of Justice today to hear the verdict. The families were joined by six MPs in court, while other relatives watched via videolink from Liverpool. After Lord Judge announced the decision to the court, families in the packed courtroom greeted it with a loud round of applause. Lord Judge expressed regret that the process the families had gone through over the years had been 'so unbearingly dispiriting and prolonged'. He described each of those who died in the tragedy as a 'helpless victim of this terrible event' and ruled that it was in the interests of justice to hold a fresh inquest. Lord Judge said that the 'interests of justice must be served' no matter how 'distressing the truth will be brought to light'. The Attorney General told the court that the Hillsborough Panel’s report was a 'remarkable' document. The report was the product of a review of more than 450,000 pages of documentation from 84 organisations and individuals, in addition to audio-visual material. Horrifying: Fans attending the match try to clamber to safety in a higher stand . No way out: Fans on the pitch of Sheffield Wednesday's Hillsborough stadium in 1989 . Mr Grieve said he carefully studied the findings in the weeks following its publication with a view to 'whether it was right' to exercise his powers under Section 13 of the Coroners Act. He announced to Parliament his intention to make an application 'for the inquests of those who died as a consequence of the Hillsborough disaster to be quashed and new inquests ordered' in October. He said: 'Soon after my announcement to Parliament, I commissioned further expert analysis of the new medical evidence which forms the central plank of this application.' Mr Grieve told the judges: 'The panel’s access to all of the relevant records and expert analysis of the post-mortem evidence confirmed that the notion of a single, unvarying and rapid pattern of death in all cases was unsustainable. 'Some of those who died did so after a significant period of unconsciousness during which they might have been able to be resuscitated, or conversely might have succumbed to a new event such as inappropriate positioning. 'Consequently, the response of the emergency services was not investigated in any detail by the inquests.' He said that measures taken following the disaster had 'severely limited' examination and that there were 'profound concerns' over how original inquests had been handled. The panel had also presented new evidence 'that casts significant doubt on the weight placed at the inquests on alcohol levels detected in the deceased'. Trevor Hicks, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said he is encouraging all sections of the investigation to work together. 'We've said all along that we wanted joined-up writing, if you like. We want them all to work together. There's a common cause and that's justice for the families and how we get that,' he said. Michelle Carlile, 44, clutching a photograph of her brother Paul, 19, . who died at Hillsborough, said of today’s decision: 'It is bitter-sweet. We have known the truth for 23 years.' Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson described the leagl decision as a 'watershed moment'. He said: 'It is the only right and proper decision that the High Court could make . in the wake of the overwhelming and compelling evidence uncovered by . the Hillsborough Independent Panel. 'We must all keep up the pressure that has driven the momentum over the . last few months to make sure that the families get the justice they . deserve. Mary Corrigan, mother of Keith McGrath, said: 'This is the first Christmas we might be able to smile. 'Now they might get some peace up there, they have been looking down on us and guiding us in this fight.' Mrs Corrigan added: 'And my son. The truth is out. We want unlawful killing, we want justice.' Andy Burnham, Labour MP for the North West constituency of Leigh, has been instrumental in championing the Hillsborough victims' plight along with Maria Eagle, Labour MP for Liverpool Garston and Halewood. The pair applauded the Hillsborough families for their enduring determination and strength of character and said nothing they achieve in the future would equal today. Visibly moved and hugged by victims' relatives outside, Mr Burnham said: 'Nothing I will ever do, the deep sense of fulfilment we both have got from this moment, nothing we ever do in politics will mean more to us because it's where the personal and political come together. 'I was at the other semi-final that day, all my friends were at Hillsborough. I was 19 on the day and nothing had a bigger impact on me growing up. It's a momentous day.' Miss Eagle said: ""'This is why I came into politics. This is historical, it is history.'

"The highest-ranking female NYPD chief has revealed how she stepped in to become mother to the sole survivor of 1984's horrific Palm Sunday Massacre. On that tragic day, Officer Joanne Jaffe took a blood-covered 13-month-old baby girl from a pile of bodies that included her mother, brothers and cousins. Thirty years later, that child--31-year-old Christina Rivera--can officially call Jaffe her mom. Journey to motherhood: Now the highest ranking woman in the NYPD, Chief Joanne Jaffe (left) was just a beat cop when she responded to what became known as the Palm Sunday Massacre in 1984. Thirty years and a lot of tears later, she adopted the only survivor of the Brooklyn mass slaying, the now 31-year-old Christina Rivera (right) Though to hear the little known tale is to understand that Jaffe became a mother the moment she laid eyes on that helpless little girl. 'I was assigned to her and fell in love with her,' Chief Jaffe recently told the New York Times. Jaffe is now Chief of Housing and the top-ranking woman in the NYPD. Back then, she was one of the first officers to respond a tortured scene in Brooklyn on April 15, 1984. It was the worst mass slaying New York had seen in decades. Ten lay dead after a cocaine addict named Christopher Thomas opened fire killing Christina Rivera's 20-year-old mother, her 3- and 5-year-old half brothers, and several of her cousins. Gruesome: A cocaine addict named Christopher Thomas gunned down 10 women and children including Rivera's 20-year-old mother and two half brothers in what was New York's most gruesome mass slaying in decades . Rivera's mother Carmen Perez still held the food she'd been feeding little Christina. But the young mom would never feed her 13-month-old daughter again. Jaffe picked up Rivera from the carnage and has never really put her down. 'I can’t imagine my life without her,' Rivera told the Times. 'She taught me what it was like to hope and to truly trust.' Jaffe asked to take the girl home on the day of the gruesome massacre but Rivera was instead sent to a foster home for the night. She would subsequently be reunited with her father and sent to live with her grandmother. For years Jaffe would visit to give Rivera toys and her grandmother a little extra cash. At the time, Rivera knew her only as that funny police lady and knew nothing of her own tragic past until age 10. By the time she was in her teens, Rivera would become increasingly moody and too much for her aging grandparents to handle. They asked Jaffe and her soon-to-be husband to take her, and they consented. Rivera would come and go from the home as tensions between her and Jaffe's husband--who Rivera saw as competing for her new mother's attentions--grew. Palm Sunday Massacre: A 1984 New York Post cover depicts the wrenching moment Joanne Jaffe held 13-month-old Christina Rivera in the back of a squad car. Rivera managed to survive a barrage of bullets that took the lives of 10 in East New York . Rivera spent some time living with her father but never really stopped thinking of Jaffe as her mom. While she was still a kid, Jaffe promised to adopt Rivera but it never came to fruition. 'I felt very orphaned, if that makes sense, even though my mom was still my mom and still there for me,' said Rivera, who's now a state worker and auxilliary police officer in New York. 'It was almost like I wanted to be claimed, like, ""I’m her daughter, I belong to her.”' It wasn't until after Rivera's grandmother's death, a deeply painful event for her, that Jaffe would finally fulfil her promise. 'I’d seen her ups and downs in life and I said I owe it to this kid,' Jaffe told the Times. 'I’d promised her as a kid and I never followed through. I thought this is what she needs if that hole in herself is ever going to be filled.' Fated: A 'for rent' sign hangs in this Google Street View image of the East New York, Brooklyn home where 10 were slain 30 years ago. While Rivera lost one mother that day, she would gain another in the form of one of the first cops to respond .","Officer Joanne Jaffe found 13-month-old Christina Rivera covered in blood and surrounded by bodies after the 1984 Palm Sunday Massacre .

News of the alleged partnership between Bross, who is the vice president of the baseball division of GSM, and Ms Jones is not helping matters for GSM either. In July, a GSM agent named Jason Dubin, 31, was arrested for using the internet to lure two teenage girls to have sex with him. Charged: Jason Dubin was arrested on two counts of luring a minor . Dubin had been communicating with what he thought were two girls named 'Christie,' who said she was 17, and her supposedly 14-year-old neighbour 'Brittany'. Both were undercover police officers. Dubin talked to the two girls over a social media site called MocoSpace.com and they spoke about sex, his preferences for oral sex, and how he wanted to 'teach her a few things'. When he showed up to 'Christie's' house after being told that her parents would not be home, he was promptly arrested on two counts of aggravated luring of a minor. It is unclear which athletes Dubin represents, but he reportedly boasted about his position to police while he was held in custody.","Bibi Jones allegedly slept with ten players in one year .

"Despite a vast security clampdown, riot police and army units allowed the peaceful crowds to vent their anger in the biggest rallies the country has seen since the fall of the USSR. As many as 50,000 massed at Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square near the Kremlin. Scroll down for video... Flaring up: Protest: As night falls, activists continue to voice their anger at the rally . United: Thousands of Russians are out on the streets protesting against Sunday's election results . Burning down: Russian nationalists burn a flag of the United Russia party during a Bolotnaya Square rally . It followed demonstrations in 70 cities . across the country - many held in freezing snow, where campaigners . screamed 'Putin's a louse' and demanded he quit - including Siberia and . the Far East. Last night, protesters issued an . ultimatum to Prime Minister Putin to cancel ‘fraudulent’ parliamentary . elections and stage a rerun – or face an even larger mass protest in two . weeks. The authorities deployed more than . 50,000 police and soldiers for yesterday’s rallies but there was no . repeat of the arrests at smaller spontaneous protests earlier last week. Armoured vehicles blocked access to . Red Square and government buildings around the Kremlin and tiny spy . helicopters monitored the crowds. Authoritarian former KGB spy Putin – . who plans to return to the Kremlin as president in March – now faces his . most acute political crisis since coming to power. Standing room only: An aerial view of the rally in Bolotnaya Square . Flaring up: Protesters walk amidst smoke from a flare in the city centre to attend a sanctioned rally in Bolotnaya Square . Yesterday, he kept a low profile, . monitoring the extraordinary scenes from his official residence near . Moscow. Last night his spokesman said: ‘The government cannot yet . formulate its attitude to the many thousands meeting  at Bolotnaya.’ There were even calls from the crowd . for Putin to be jailed over the ‘rigged’ parliamentary poll, which  his . United Russia party narrowly won last week, and the endemic corruption . which is rampant at all levels throughout the country. Independent observers suggest United . Russia’s vote was inflated from about  25 per cent to 50 per cent of the . total share, enough to give an overall majority. Exact estimates on the size of yesterday’s protest varied but there was agreement it is the largest Putin has seen. ‘Maybe 100,000 people were at this . rally,’ declared Mikhail Kasyanov, Putin’s first prime minister but now a . bitter enemy. ‘Today is the beginning of the end for these thieving . authorities.’ Anger: An elderly Russian holds up a poster of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin which reads No! as thousands packed into Moscow to protest against the elections . Voices heard: Protesters are congregating in Moscow's city centre to protest against the rigged election . Packed out: Bolotnaya Square is filled with tens of thousands of protesters all campaigning against the rigged elections .

Interior Ministry officers stand guard as crowds flock into Moscow city centre (left) as People's Freedom Party leader Boris Nemtsov (right) also protests . Overthrow: Opposition protesters in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar took to the streets today . Taking a stand: Protesters also congregated on the streets of the Siberian city of Novosibirsk . And ex-deputy premier Boris Nemtsov, . briefly jailed for taking part in an earlier protest, said: ‘The current . regime does not know how to behave with dignity. All they know is . cynicism.’ Leading Russian novelist Boris Akunin . said: ‘I haven’t seen such things for 20 years, since 1991. There’s no . way back from events such as these. Our city has changed.’ As the protests unfolded, the . websites of Russia’s two major state-run channels ignored developments . in an act of Soviet-style censorship. In London, protesters chanted slogans . and displayed banners outside the Houses of Parliament. And Moscow rally . organiser, opposition politician Vladimir Ryzhkov, has announced there . will be another protest on December 24, which he says will be twice as . large. The protests come three months before . Putin, who was president from 2000 to 2008 and effectively remained the . country's leader while prime minister, is to seek a third term in . office. The public outpouring challenges his . image, supported by state-controlled TV channels, as a man who won the . affection of most Russians. That image was undercut by last . Sunday's parliamentary elections, during which his United Party narrowly . retained a majority of seats. Ex-pat protest: Russians gathered outside the Houses of Parliament in London to also rally against what they think was a fraudulent election process . But it lost the unassailable . two-thirds majority it held in the previous parliament.  Even that . reduced performance was unearned, inflated by massive vote fraud, the . opposition says, citing reports by local and international monitors of . widespread violations. The reports of vote-rigging and the party's loss of seats acted as a catalyst for long-simmering discontent of many Russians. 'The falsifications that authorities . are doing today have turned the country into a big theater, with clowns . like in a circus,' said Alexander Trofimov, one of the early arrivals . for the protest at Bolotnaya Square, on an island in the Moscow River . adjacent to the Kremlin. Opposition: Protesters took to the streets of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok today to show their anger against the alleged rigged elections . Anger: One of the first protests of the day took part in Vladivostok . Claims: Crowds gathered in Vladivostok to protest against the ruling United Russia party . 'I don't think any citizen of the . country can say he is very happy with anything. We don't have an . independent judiciary, there is no freedom of expression - all this . combined creates a situation where people are forced to protest,' said . demonstrator Albert Yusupov, who was dressed in civilian clothes but . identified himself as a member of the Russian army. By the time the rally started, the . square and adjacent streets were packed shoulder-to-shoulder with . protesters braving intermittent wind-blown snow. City authorities have given . permission for a rally of up to 30,000 people, unusual largesse for an . opposition that generally is either denied permission to rally or . limited to small numbers. It was not clear if police would . choose to crack down if the crowd clearly exceeded 30,000. But they did . try to move demonstrators off a footbridge leading to the island, . claiming it was so packed with people that it could collapse. Protests took place in at least 15 other cities from the Pacific Coast to the southwest. Day of action: A protester in Vladivostok holds a cut-out from Esquire magazine showing the the face of Russian blogger, political and social activist Alexei Navalny . International criticism: The elections which saw . Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin (left) voted back into power have . been condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (right) In the Pacific city of Vladivostok, . several hundred protesters rallied along a waterside avenue where some . of Russia's Pacific Fleet warships are docked. They shouted 'Putin's a . louse' and some held a banner caricaturing United Russia's emblem, . reading 'The rats must go'. And in the eastern city of St Petersburg, observers said more than 10,000 took to the streets. Police stayed on the fringes of that . demonstration and made no arrests. But the Interfax news agency reported . that about 15 people were arrested at a protest in the Siberian city of . Perm and about 30 in the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk when a . flash-mob started an unauthorized protest. Officials in many cities, including . Moscow, gave permission for the protests. But in what appeared to be an . attempt to prevent young people from attending the protest, Moscow's . school system declared Saturday afternoon a mandatory extra school day . for grades 9-11. Students were told of the decision only on Friday, news . reports said. Hundreds of people, were arrested in . smaller protests earlier in the week. Some, including prominent . opposition blogger Alexei Navalny, were sentenced to 15 days in jail. Another prominent opposition figure, . Sergei Udaltsov, was hospitalized after his Monday arrest and was . expected to be released Saturday, but the Interfax news agency said he . was taken from the hospital to a court to face further charges. President Dmitry Medvedev conceded this week that election law may have been violated and Putin suggested 'dialogue with the opposition-minded' - breaking from his usual authoritarian image. The Kremlin has come under strong international pressure, with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton calling the vote unfair and urging an investigation into fraud. The opposition predicts at least 30,000 demonstrators will assemble for the Moscow protest. If today's protests are a success, the activists then face the challenge of long-term strategy. Even though U.S. Sen. John McCain recently tweeted to Putin that 'the Arab Spring is coming to a neighborhood near you', things in Russia are not that simple. The popular uprisings that brought down governments in Georgia in 2003, in Ukraine the next year and in Egypt last spring all were significantly boosted by demonstrators being able to establish round-the-clock presences, notably in Cairo's Tahrir Square and the massive tent camp on Kiev's main avenue. Russian police would hardly tolerate anything similar. In Ukraine and Georgia, police were low-profile, staying on the edges of the protests and keeping their numbers small. It is seen as a far cry from Russian police's usual crowd-controlling method of flooding any protest zone with hundreds of helmeted police who seem to relish violence. Opposition figures indicated today that the next step would be to call another protest in Moscow for next weekend, with the aim of making it even bigger. But staged events at regular intervals may be less effective than daily spontaneous protests. The opposition is also vulnerable to attacks on the websites and social media that have nourished the protests. This week, an official of Vkontakte, a Russian social networking site, reported pressure from the FSB, the KGB's main successor, to block access to opposition groups, but said his company refused. On election day, the websites of a main independent radio station and the country's only independent election-monitoring group fell victim to denial-of-service hacker attacks.

"A Russian cosmonaut has taken a stand against sexism by hitting back at a reporter who asked her questions about her hair and make-up ahead of her mission into space. Yelena Serova was swift to chastise the offending member of the press after they made the comment at a NASA conference to mark the imminent launch of the joint US-Russian mission to the International Space Station (ISS). In the video clip of the press conference which is quickly gaining traction online, a visibly frustrated and embarrassed Yelena challenges the journalist, asking why they have not asked her fellow male astronauts similar questions. Yelena was obviously unimpressed by the nature of questions directed at her during the press conference . Yelena was swift to chastise the offending member of the press after they made the comment . The type of questions asked of Yelena were very different to those asked of her male co-astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) and Alexander Samokutyaev (centre) The 38-year-old, who studied at Moscow Aviation Institute, will serve as a flight engineer aboard the International Space station as well as biophysics and medical experiments about the effect of being in orbit. She is only the fourth Russian woman ever to be launched into space, and the first ever on the ISS. Given the serious nature of her mission, and the extensive training Serova has undergone, it is not surprising that she became frustrated when asked inane and totally unrelated questions simply based on her gender. ‘You are the first woman cosmonaut in 17 years, so what are you expecting from that flight? Are you going to take make-up with you? Clearly irritated by the question, Yelena first simply chooses to ignore it, instead correcting the journalist on their facts. ‘Answering the second part of your question about women cosmonauts I would like to make a correction. I will be the first Russian woman cosmonaut on the ISS.’ However when asked another question, Yelena answers back directly. Yelena, 38, (centre) who studied at Moscow Aviation Institute, will serve as a flight engineer aboard the International Space station . The highly qualified cosmonaut was visibly annoyed to be asked questions about her hair and make-up . A second journalist asks: ‘Can you tell us about your day-to-day life on the station? For example how are you planning to do your hair?’ ‘And I have a question for you! Why don’t you ask about Alexander’s (a male cosmonaut) hair? This is my answer I’m sorry.’ Yelena was launched into space today in the Soyuz spacecraft at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, accompanied by NASA’s Barry Wilmore and Russian Alexander Samokutyaev. The group docked safely on the International Space Station earlier today . She is expected to remain on the ISS for six months and many of the questions asked of Yelena focused on the fact that she will be separated from her 11-year-old daughter during the trip. Although Yelena answers the questions calmly and in detail, the nature of the questions asked of her have riled heckles in feminist circles, especially since both her fellow astronauts also have children.","Yelena Serova is only the fourth Russian women to enter space .

"A recent LivingSocial survey showed that Americans may live up to their poor reputation while travelling abroad. But what’s more surprising is that many of those surveyed self-identified themselves as ‘ugly’ Americans and the world’s worst travellers. The results show that Americans, as well as Canadians and Australians all named U.S. travellers as the world's worst tourists. Self-hating: In a LivingSocial survey, 20 per cent of Americans said they found American tourists to be the worst of the bunch . Those in the U.S. ranked themselves as . the worst travellers by a shocking 20 per cent, followed by 15 per cent . saying the Chinese were the most substandard tourists. In the survey, more than 5,600 people in five countries were polled by Mandala Research LLC. However, hatred for the stereotypical fanny pack-toting American wasn’t universal in the study. The Irish ranked the British as the worst travellers, and similarly, the British thought very poorly of German tourists. American travellers are stereotyped in a number of ways, but the most common are that they wear unflattering, casual clothing (such as cargo pants, sweatshirts, white trainers, and baseball caps) and talk too loudly. Some think that speaking loudly equates speaking clearly, the stereotype goes, and more cruelly, American tourists are thought to be quite stout. In addition, four out of ten U.S. respondents said that they ‘accidentally’ packed or intentionally stole items from hotels, with towels being the most popular items to snatch. In a more positive light, the study showed another American misconception was not true –  Americans, for the most part, are surprisingly well-travelled. The study showed that 78 per cent of Americans have visited at least one foreign country (though there was no word on if it was Canada or Mexico), and 61 per cent have visited more than one country. The average American respondent said they visited more than four countries. According to the findings, Americans also enjoyed fewer vacation days than their European counterparts, with only 16 days off versus 27 days (Australia), 21 days (Canada), 28 days (Ireland) and 23 days (U.K.). Out of their 16 days off, an average of four days was spent abroad, the report said. Perhaps more depressing still was the fact that 66 per cent of Americans said they checked their email whilst on vacation.","LivingSocial survey showed that 20% of Americans polled said they were the worst tourists .

"We all know that some artists put their blood, sweat and tears into their creations, but one woman has taken it one step further - by using her own vomit. Cutting edge artist, Millie Brown, began pushing the boundaries of the art world after becoming sick - literally - of using more traditional methods of painting. The eccentric artist - whose unique work . features in Ripley’s Believe it or Not! - uses a selection of dyed soy . milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows at various . intervals, one at a time, before vomiting it onto a white canvas. Millie Brown is pushing the boundaries of the art world by using a selection of dyed soy milk in a mixture of colours which she then swallows before vomiting onto a white canvas . But despite the regular retching, Millie, 27, insists it doesn’t affect her health. She said she maintains a healthy vegan lifestyle and always leaves a one month rest period between each performance. The vomiting visionary began experimenting with her unique style back in 2005 and has since gained commercial success by regurgitating onto the dress of pop singer, Lady Gaga, in a controversial music video. Millie can be seen vomiting shimmering turquoise liquid over the . singer in Lary Gaga's pop music video, Exorcist Interlude. Millie - whose unique work features in Ripleys Believe it or Not! - uses a selection of vibrant dyed soy milk . Despite having a general idea of what she'd like her work to look like, she prefers to improvise . Although some find the Londoner’s work somewhat hard to swallow, the artist has received positive recognition with critics comparing her to that of abstract expressionist, Jackie Pollock, who was known for his unique style of drip painting. Despite having a general idea of what each canvas should look like, Millie prefers to improvise heavily throughout each performance. Millie said 'I don’t eat for two days prior to performing so that I clean my stomach of any food, that way the only liquid that comes up is beautiful and of pure colour. 'I can drink anything from one pint to four litres depending on if I’m doing a live performance or creating a canvas piece. Millie aims to regurgitate the liquid as pure colour and drinks each glass of dye one glass at a time . She starves herself for two days before each performance to clear her stomach - but maintains she is still healthy . 'It's definitely not recommended to put your body through this but I¿m generally a healthy person so I feel like that balances out the rest,' she says . Millie, who grew up in a Bohemian family, follows a vegan diet and only does a performance each month . 'I time each drink so that each colour doesn’t mix in my stomach and try to space out my performances so that my body can recover properly. 'It’s very much about timing, I find the whole process fascinating and the long meditative fast can be very inspiring. 'I often set out with an idea of what I’d like to create but I enjoy the uncontrollable element of my work and just go with it. 'Filming can be exhausting, it can be an entire day of vomiting which leaves you with migraines but generally I feel good after performing, it’s like a cleanse for your body and mind. Millie times each drink so that each colour doesn't mix in her stomach and tries to space out performances so that her body can recover properly . Millie says each piece is very much about timing, and that she finds the whole process fascinating and the long meditative fast very inspiring . Millie's unique work currently features in Ripleys Believe it or Not! Millie began pushing the boundaries of the art world after becoming sick of using more traditional methods of painting . Quirky: Young artist Millie Brown has taught herself how to regurgitate paint to create quirky canvas art . Up for grabs: One of Brown's unique vomit-art canvases will be available for purchase and many maintain that now is a great time to invest in this hotly tipped artist . Beautiful creation: Critics have noted the abstract beauty of the finished canvases, created when Millie drinks milk tinted with dyes . Abstract: Millie's work has been likened to Jackson Pollock . Bohemian: Sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures . 'I feel my work is an expression of . raw human nature, that pushes boundaries mentally and physically to . create work that has true beauty. 'There . have been so many different reactions to my work, from laughing to . crying, love and even death threats but I think art is made to make you . feel and as long as it makes you feel something it can be powerful. 'It’s definitely not recommended to put . your body through this but I’m generally a healthy person so I feel like . that balances out the rest.' Born in England to Bohemian parents and spending much of her youth in Spain and the South of France, it is clear where Millie’s maverick tendencies originated. Aged 13 and unable to relate the French children of her neighborhood, Millie befriended local street punks. From then on, sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures. After . a brief summer stint in L.A., Millie returned to London at the age of . 17 where she embarked upon her artistic journey in performance art and . film. Speaking about her quirky work, she said: 'I have an inherent desire to push my own boundaries within my art. 'By . creating art from the very depths of my own physical being I am able to . challenge people's perception of beauty, expressing raw elements of . human nature and in turn challenging myself both physically and . mentally.'

"Russell Brand and Vivienne Westwood  joined thousands of masked anti-capitalist demonstrators who  descended on Westminster for a Bonfire Night protest, bringing chaos to the capital. Scores of riot police were on stand-by amid threats from campaign group Anonymous that the demonstration would create a blockade throughout London. Officers were forced to draw their batons as missiles, plastic cones and road signs were launched along the Mall, while fireworks were left off in Trafalgar Square. The masked demonstrators - some as young as 14 - also kicked and dragged over security railings while chanting 'one solution, revolution', as others daubed graffiti on riot vans.

At one point, they surrounded a man driving a new Mercedes car and sprayed the back of it with an aerosol, pushing their tubes at him as he opened windows to remonstrate with them. The protest, known as the Million Mask March, was one of hundreds organised at the same time in cities around the world. Demonstrators wearing sinister Guy Fawkes masks - made famous in the film V for Vendetta - descended on Trafalgar Square, waving banners and placards, before marching towards Parliament Square at 6.30pm. As they milled around the square, they chanted anti-establishment slogans before climbing on to the base of Nelson's Column and letting off fireworks. They then moved onto Buckingham Palace before hundreds of protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus. They then marched to the BBC's headquarters at Broadcasting House on nearby Portland Place and going along Oxford Street to Hyde Park and Park Lane. As of around midnight, ten people had been arrested, including three on suspicion of assaulting police officers, one of a firework offence, three for public order crimes and one of attempted GBH.

During that march, energy bills were burned, fireworks were shot at Buckingham Palace and there were 15 arrests, following scuffles with police. He later wrote an article saying that riots are sparked 'when dialogue fails, when they feel unrepresented and bored by the illusion'. Today, it seemed the group were hoping for a similar result. On its website before the march, one of the group members wrote: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City. 'Complete physical GRIDLOCK. Only thing that gets through are Fire & Rescue and ambulances. NOTHING ELSE MOVES.' Fireworks and smoke were seen rising out of Trafalgar Square as the protest got underway this evening . The crowd tried its best to carry out the wishes of the organisers, which asked for a massive blockade of London City . The group - which uses the Guy Fawkes masks as its trademark - said it fights against mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights . The protest was held on the night of Britain's Guy Fawkes Night, and many of the marchers wore the white masks of the man who plotted to blow up parliament in 1605 . Protesters chanted anti-establishment slogans as they milled around, while others climbed on to the base of Nelson's Column let off fireworks . The group also warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system'. The London march is part of a day of global demonstrations, which include rallies across Europe, the Americas and Asia. The protest has led to officers from the Metropolitan Police, British Transport Police and the City of London Police Force being on stand-by. The heightened security measures came as the Metropolitan Police attempted to contact Anonymous, but no one came forward with any details. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said they had attempted to contact organisers of the event 'without success'. Graffiti was daubed on a police van, while a masked protester stood nearby waving a placard . Most people protested peacefully, but some ten arrests were made, Metropolitan Police said . The group warned it would have 'bigger banners, louder voices, more people and a louder system' than last year's protest . Writing on its website before the march, the group said: 'What I'd like to see is a MASSIVE Anonymous blockade of London City'. Protesters waved banners and placards during the march . The protesters came up with a number of creative ways to express their messages of discontent . The group said in its manifesto that it fights again mass surveillance, austerity and infringement of human rights . Anti-capitalist protesters held up signs saying 'Expect Us' 'We Are Anonymous' and 'We Are Everyone' Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government . The protesters made their way through central London, going to Piccadilly Circus, Regent Street and Oxford Circus . And it added that they have imposed Section 60AA of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 across Westminster between 5pm today and 2am tomorrow, which provides powers to remove masks when police fear a crime will be committed. Scotland Yard said: 'The Met Police deals with around 4,500 protests and events every year. These can range from a single protester to hundreds of thousands of people walking through the capital's streets. 'Officers work with organisers to ensure that people are able to carry out their right to peaceful protest whilst ensuring Londoners can go about their daily business.' Last year’s London march saw more than 2,500 protesters take to the streets, in a rally which saw fireworks thrown at Buckingham Palace and a total of 15 arrests. Rather than communicate directly with local authorities, Anonymous sent a message to the government, and to global world leaders: 'To oppressive governments, we say this: we do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail against the angry masses of the body politic.'","Russell Brand joined thousands of masked demonstrators in Westminster .

"Indian families have been instructed to ensure their future son-in-laws can provide an indoor lavatory before marrying off their daughters. The ‘no toilet, no bride’ campaign has been launched by the government after it emerged that that more people have a mobile phone contract than access to a toilet. The instructions were given by the country's Minister for Rural Development, Jairam Ramesh, who recently angered religious groups by claiming India has more Hindu temples than indoor bathrooms. More loos: Jairam Ramesh has launched the 'no toilet, no bride' campaign in order to improve the sanitary conditions for the Indian population . Over 75 per cent of the 1.2 billion population currently have a mobile phone subscription. In comparison, only 50 per cent of households have a lavatory and 11 per cent have one connected to the sewerage system, according to the 2011 census. This has led to Mr Ramesh calling on families to not only consult astrology when deciding the perfect match for their daughters, but also to check if the potential husband has an indoor toilet, the Daily Telegraph reports. ‘You consult astrologers about rahu-ketu (the alignment of sun and moon) before getting married. 'You should also look whether there is a toilet in your groom's home before you decide. Don't get married in a house where there is no toilet,' he warned during a speech to villagers in Rajasthan. Preferring phones: Half of Indian households have access to an indoor lavatory whilst 75 per cent of the population owns a mobile phone . Earlier this year Mr Ramesh branded India the ‘world’s largest open-air toilet’ saying that 60 per cent of the people in the world who carry out their business in the open, live in India. Speaking at the launch of an ‘eco-lavatory’ in June, Mr Ramesh said the country should be ashamed of this and that ‘even countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan have better records.’ Brindeshwar Pathak, founder of the sanitation charity Sulabh International called on the government to offer cheap loans to help families build lavatories and to make defecating in the open a punishable offence. As well as a sanitary issue, the lack of proper bathroom facilities is a security risk for Indian women as tradition begs them to rise before dawn to go to the toilet. This has led to a number of cases where women have been raped or assaulted whilst searching for somewhere to go to the lavatory under cover of darkness.","Only half of Indian households have an indoor toilet .
Shocking comparison reveals 75 per cent, 900 million, have a mobile phone contract ."
"There are few things in life that are more irritating. You are mid-conversation with a friend and they check their phone and begin replying to a text or checking their emails. But now, people everywhere are beginning to lose patience with the phenomenon known as phubbing: snubbing others in a social setting by checking your phone. Phubbing is the act of snubbing someone during a social interaction to look at your mobile - and now a campaign has begun to stamp it out (file photo) A Stop Phubbing campaign group has started in Australia and at least five others have sprung up in its wake as outrage about the lack of manners grows. The campaign's creator, Alex Haigh, 23, from Melbourne, said: 'A group of friends and I were chatting when someone raised how annoying being ignored by people on mobiles was.' He has created a website where companies can download posters to discourage phubbing and even placecards for weddings. Phubbing is just one symptom of our increasing reliance on mobile phones and the internet which is replacing normal social interaction. Research reveals that 44 per cent of us spend more than half an hour a day looking at our phones, eight per cent admit to checking it for three hours a day and three per cent say they spend five or more hours on their mobiles. A third of Britons polled admitted to . being phubbers and more than a quarter (27 per cent) said they would . answer their phone in the middle of a face-to-face conversation. Posters can be downloaded from the Stop Phubbing website for businesses to help combat bad manners . The survey also found that 57 per cent of Britons check their emails on holiday, compared to 32 per cent who didn't and 11 per cent who weren't sure. A third confessed that they would answer the phone in a restaurant and 19 per cent said they would while being served in a shop. The YouGov research comes after a supermarket checkout assistant in south London refused to serve a woman until she stopped using her phone. The poll, for a Sunday paper, also found that 54 per cent of people checked Facebook, Twitter or other social media every day, with 16 per cent checking more than ten times a day. An unsurprising 63 per cent of people carry their phone with them 'almost all, or all of the time', it found. According to research by advertising . agency McCann, 37 per cent of people feel it is worse to not answer a . message than it is to 'phub' your friends. Phil . Reed, a professor of psychology at Swansea University who has studied . internet addiction disorder, said many phubbers show symptoms of . addiction to their mobile phone. They . also show withdrawal signs if they are not allowed to use their phones . constantly, he said, adding that he does not own a mobile phone. A third of Britons admit to being phubbers while more than a quarter said they would answer the phone mid-conversation (file photo) He said: 'The internet and social media are good things up to a point but we have to control them. If you were talking to someone and someone else came up and you started talking to the other person without including the first person in your conversation that would be thought of as very rude.' Professor Reed, who does not own a mobile phone, said: 'We call it social connection; but it's not.' Many do not realise they are phubbing and are unconscious of the irritation they cause. Rodney Collins, regional director of McCann's Truth Central unit which carried out the research, said: 'People do not appreciate the influence mobiles have had on their lives. 'When it comes to inappropriate or rude behaviour, there's not as much admission to conducting those behaviours in the UK as there are in other markets. 'Only about 20 per cent of British people admit to phubbing, lower than in the U.S.'","A third of Britons polled by YouGov have admitted to being phubbers .

"Two comic-style novels have been shortlisted for the prestigious Costa Book Awards for the first time. One is the story of a heavy metal-loving teenager forced to spend all summer with his mother and the other is a graphic novel biography of James Joyce's daughter. 'Days of the Bagnold Summer' by Joff Winterhart and 'Dotter of Her Father's Eyes' by husband and wife Mary and Bryan Talbot are among 20 books nominated across five categories. Nominated: Mary and Bryan Talbot have been shortlisted in the biography category of the Costa Book Awards for their illustrated memoir about James Joyce's daughter, Lucia . Graphic novel: The Talbot's book, Dotter of her Father's Eyes, was one of two comic-style books nominated this year . The overall winner, to be announced on January 29, wins £30,000, while the category winners receive £5,000. Also nominated is the latest novel by double Man Booker Prize winner Hilary Mantel, 'Bring Up The Bodies'. Earlier this year, Mantel, 60, became the first British writer to win the Booker Prize twice for her historical novels on Thomas Cromwell. 'Bring Up The Bodies' is nominated in the Best Novel category, alongside Winterhart's graphic novel, Stephen May's 'Life! Death! Prizes!' and James Meek's 'The Heart Broke In.' Winterhart's graphic novel tells the story of the Bagnolds - librarian mother Sue and her 15-year-old heavy metal fan son, Daniel. Daniel is supposed to be visiting his father and pregnant stepmother in the United States but the trip is cancelled at the last minute, leaving mother and son to spend the summer together. Sue knows she can't communicate with Daniel, who looks 'like a big, black, sad kangaroo' and the illustrations bring across these generational difficulties in a heart-tugging way. Winterhart, 38, was extremely surprised to receive a nomination: 'It doesn't feel like a novel, it's got pictures in it! 'I didn't know it had enough words to constitute a novel. Some novels are quite epic and very cinematic in scope and mine is incredibly not like that.' Delightful illustrations: Two examples of the cartoons drawn by Bryan Talbot in 'Dotter of Her Father's Eyes' Wendy Holden, one of the category's three judges, said it was funny, thought-provoking and 'sniff-makingly sad'. She added: 'Anyone with a teenager in the family, or anticipating having one in the future, should read it. 'It's not only hilarious and brilliant but deals with real life, as people really live it.' 'Funny and thought-provoking': The judges praised the 'sniff-makingly sad' story of Joff Winterhart's 'Days of the Bagnold Summer' Strong competition: Winterhart's 'Days of the Bagnold Summer' is in the novel category . Strong competition: Winterhart will go up against Booker Prize-winning Hilary Mantel's 'Bring Up The Bodies' Nominated novels: 'The heart Broke In' by James Meek and 'Life! Death! Prizes!' by Stephen May are also in the Novel category shortlist . The Talbot's work is an illustrated biography-cum-memoir of Joyce's daughter Lucia, which also draws on Mary Talbot's personal memories of her troubled relationship with her father, the Joycean scholar James S Atherton. The judges called it ' a strikingly original graphic memoir which links two lives in a highly imaginative way.' It will compete in the Biography category alongside 'Patrick Leigh-Fermor: An Adventure' by Artemis Cooper, 'The Crocodile By The Door' by Selina Guinness and 'Serving Victoria' by Kate Hubbard.

'These luxurious apartments combine Manhattan and Knightsbridge quality with a spectacular Mediterranean setting.' The Rothschild family descends from Mayer Amschel Rothschild - a court Jew to the Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel who began his banking business in the 1760s. Rothschild established an international banking dynasty through his five sons, and eventually made the family one of the most powerful of the era. Many of the family have been elevated to members of nobility, especially in Austria. During the 19th century the Rothschild family was believed to have the largest private fortune in the world. The family's wealth is thought to have subsequently declined, mainly because it was divided amongst hundreds of descendants. Today, the Rothschild businesses are on a far smaller scale although they encompass a diverse range of fields, including finance, mining, energy, mixed farming, wine, and charities. Nathaniel Philip Rothschild is the youngest of four and only son of Jacob Rothschild. His maternal grandparents were Lady Mary Sybil St. Clair-Erskine, daughter of James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn and Sir Philip Gordon Dunn, 2nd Baronet, whose father was the Canadian financier and tycoon, Sir James Dunn. Educated at Colet Court, he was in the same year as George Osborne. He went to Oxford and read history. Rothschild has numerous investments - mainly in the mining and metals industries. Over his many years in business, he has been linked to Glencore, Genel Energy and Volex. He was instrumental in developing Atticus Capital, an international investment management firm established in 1995 and, especially over the past 10 years, has been involved in the growth and development of Vallar Plc.","Luxurious 42-storey Meier-on-Rothschild Tower has 141 luxury apartments ranging from two to eight-bedroom .

"Fifty Doctor Who fanatics showed their devotion to the iconic sci-fi series - and each other - by taking part in a mass 'Whovian' wedding in costume. The superfans got married, entered into civil partnerships and renewed their vows at the event in London in front of a congregation of other fancy-dressed well-wishers who attended dressed as Daleks, Cybermen and the different incarnations of the Doctor himself. The event, which marked the 50th anniversary of the BBC series, saw couples from America and Canada tie the knot alongside Who-mad couples from the UK. Dressed for the occasion: A Cyberman weds his bride in front of a congregation of other Doctors and characters from the show at the Bloomsbury Ballroom in London . Time traveller's wedding: The couples, known as 'cosplayers' even had a page boy dressed as David Tennant's pin-striped suit-wearing version of the Doctor . As part of their time-traveller themed big day, they were given commemorative rings especially designed for the occasion and even complimentary Dr Who themed tattoos. The congregation of Who fans took place at the Bloomsbury Ballroom yesterday and was conducted by a Minister and arranged so that the enthusiasts all said their vows at the same time, making it one of the biggest sci-fi themed weddings in Britain. According to the event's website, one couple, Jennifer Horn and Klehlyn McCord, both 23, jetted in from in Cincinnati, Ohio to take part in the ceremony. They picked out an engagement ring with blue diamonds because it reminded them of the Tardis and Jennifer even wore a blue gown inspired by the Doctor's famous time-travelling vessel. Another couple, Damian and Hayley Marks from Texas, renewed their vows at the event. After proposing dressed as Matt Smith's bow-tie wearing version of The Doctor, Damian married his wife in a Whovian wedding in the US. At that ceremony, Hayley had a miniture Tardis in her boot-strap as 'something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue'. Well wishing Whovians: The event was also open to members of the public who attended to cheer on fellow fans. Many turned up in fancy dress as their favourite Doctor such as Matt Smith's incarnation, right, or David Tennant's memorable version, left . The mass wedding was staged by bespoke experience company Special Events who have also ran Klingon weddings for Star Trek fans. It was open to the public so that . Whovians without a travelling companion could attend the event, with . tickets being sold at £10 per head.

'If there was any doubt that Doctor Who is one of the world's biggest TV shows, this award should put that argument to rest - and how fitting for it to receive such an accolade in its 50th year.'","50 'Whovian' couples marry in themed ceremony in London .

"Three Nobel Peace Prize winners have blasted the decision to give this year’s award to the European Union. In an open letter, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Northern Ireland’s Mairead Maguire and Adolfo Perez Esquivel from Argentina say that the EU is ‘clearly not one of the “champions of peace” Alfred Nobel had in mind’ when he created the prize in 1895. They insist the 27-nation bloc’s values do not match those associated with the prize, and say the prize money of £750,000 should  be withheld. Contesting: Nobel Peace Prize laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu is one of three former winners contesting the decision to give the 2012 award to the EU . Stating that the EU condones ‘security . based on military force and waging wars rather than insisting on the . need for an alternative approach’, they add that it has failed to . ‘realise Nobel’s demilitarised global peace order’. ‘The Norwegian Nobel committee has . redefined and remodelled the prize in a manner that is not consistent . with the law,’ their letter asserts, adding that the committee should . respect the original wishes of the prize’s founder, who died in 1896. The trio behind the letter are among the award’s most respected winners. The Most Reverend Desmond Tutu, now . 81, rose to fame in the 1980s as an outspoken opponent of apartheid in . South Africa. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. Mrs Maguire, 68, won the 1976 prize . for  her ‘Women for Peace’ marches during the Troubles in Northern . Ireland. In recent years she has also been a noted critic of Israel’s . policy towards Gaza. Mr Esquivel, 81, is a pacifist, . painter and sculptor who won  the 1980 award for his defence  of human . rights against the Argentine junta. Their letter was also signed by the . Geneva-based International Peace Bureau, which won the award in 1910, . and several authors, lawyers and peace activists. Announcing this year’s award in . October, the committee hailed the EU for transforming Europe ‘from a . continent of war to a continent of peace’ in the decades following the . Second World War. The controversial decision came as a surprise amid . Europe’s crippling economic crisis. But while acknowledging Europe’s . current financial problems and social unrest, Nobel committee president . Thorbjoern Jagland said the decision was to herald six decades of . advancing ‘peace and reconciliation, democracy and human rights’. Former winner: Northern Ireland's Mairead Maguire, who was awarded the prize in 1976, has also signed the open letter, which says the EU is not a 'champion of peace' EU President Herman Van Rompuy called . on all the bloc’s member states, along with soon-to-be-inducted Croatia, . to send attendees to the ceremony. But while German Chancellor Angela . Merkel and French  President Francois Hollande have said they will . attend, David Cameron leads the list of leaders who plan to snub the . December 10 event in Oslo. Eighteen European leaders have accepted an invitation while six others have declined, the Nobel Institute said yesterday. The Nobel committee has rarely shied away from controversy with its choice of winner. US President Barack Obama won the award in 2009, despite leading a country that was fighting two separate wars. Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist . and inventor, gave only vague guidelines for the peace prize, saying it . should honour ‘work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or . reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace . congresses.’ A prominent researcher and Nobel . critic Fredrik Heffermehl – who also signed the letter – previously . accused the Norwegian jury of gradually widening the scope of the prize . to include environmental, humanitarian and other efforts by selecting . winners such as President Obama. The complaint led to a formal inquiry . to see if the Nobel Peace Prize jury has deviated from its selection . guidelines for winners, but it was later dropped.","Desmond Tutu has contested the decision to award the prize to the European Union in an open letter to the Nobel Committee .

"Her models meld into the grey Manhattan skyline as if they're made of mirrors and glass. Now body artist Trina Merry has spoken about her head-turning technique, painstakingly painting women so they blend in with New York's landmarks, after her incredible creations made headlines around the world. The 33-year-old shuns studios and canvases, instead letting her nude models camouflage seamlessly into the world around them. Scroll down for video . Art imitates life: New York body painter Trina Merry's models blend into the Manhattan Bridge (left) and Guggenheim museum (right) wearing coloured shoes and bikini bottoms. The 33-year-old began her inspiring project after moving to New York from San Francisco because she wanted to provide a 'reflective view within the landscape' Fame: These images have been viewed around the world - now body artist Trina Merry has given an insight into how she creates her work, despite run-ins with police . On the left, a body painted model sits on a bridge with her back to the camera, gazing out across the city with houses, the bridge and the skyline painted across her. While on the right, the model faces the camera with the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge as her backdrop - with only her brightly coloured shoes clearly distinguishable . They have been photographed in front of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges, Central Park, the Guggenheim Museum and the iconic towers of downtown Manhattan. It's not an easy process - the models must be painted live on the streets in a process that takes several hours and can attract some unwanted attention. But the law is firmly on her side, as the city of New York allows people to strip off in public for the purposes of artistic expression - even if that doesn't stop police approaching the artist altogether. Ms Merry came up with the idea after moving to New York from the San Francisco area earlier this year. 'I wanted to engage the city and understand it and make some observations,' she said. Behind the scenes: The painstaking works by Trina Merry (left) take hours to create and have to be done in public, leading passers-by to gawk in wonder . Jessica Mellow, who posed in front of the Manhattan Bridge, said: 'You feel the transformation process. The brush itself, it's really soft. It feels more like a massage' Body of work: The artist must wait until there is no chance of rain. In one shoot, she had to repaint her model after a van that was in the background drove away . Nothing to see here: During this shoot last week, a police officer stopped and spoke to the artist after receiving a complaint about her unusual work. The law in New York has been laid down after decades of legal wrangling and firmly allows people to be nude in public if it is for the purpose of a performance or artistic expression . 'So instead of a person right in front of the Empire State building or the Statue of Liberty, they're softly in the background, and you've got more of a reflective view of the person within the landscape.' Photographers followed the artist as she went through the process of creating her images in the middle of a busy Brooklyn street last week. It is a carefully-planned ritual, which involves waiting until there is no chance of rain which could wash off the meticulously detailed designs. And at one point, Ms Merry had to repaint some of her model after the owner of a van in the background got into it and drove away. That's not to mention the stream of pedestrians and cab drivers who slowed down to gawk, snap pictures and ask questions - their faces a mix of shock, intrigue and anything-goes resignation. 'It feels great to be painted,' said model Jessica Mellow, who wore only a bikini bottom and running shoes. Carefully-planned: As with 3D floor paintings, when shot from any other angle the magical quality of the model's blending into her surroundings completely vanishes . Finished product: Ms Merry with her model in front of the Manhattan Bridge. In 1986 seven women from Rochester, New York, protested laws which allowed men to go topless but not women by holding a bare-breasted picnic in a park - which sparked a change in the law six years later, enshrining the right not to wear a top . Checking the results: The photographs by Trina Merry have made headlines around the world with their otherworldly way of making the models blend in with the city . 'You feel the transformation process. The brush itself, it's really soft. It feels more like a massage.' Passer-by Celeste Hernandez said: 'That's so very New York. You cannot be surprised by anything.' New York's laws allow public nudity when it is in the context of performances or artistic expression, and women are allowed to be topless, two traditions established through a string of hard-fought cases. In 1986 seven women from Rochester, New York, protested laws which allowed men to go topless but not women by holding a bare-breasted picnic in a park. The publicity around the stunt - and their hard-fought campaign afterwards - led eventually to a ruling in 1992 by the state's highest court, the New York Court of Appeals. One of the justices wrote: 'One of the most important purposes to be served by the equal protection clause is to ensure that ""public sensibilities"" grounded in prejudice and unexamined stereotypes do not become enshrined as part of the official policy of government.' This photo required an incredible amount of work to get the body paint dimensions perfect - the model appears almost translucent as she stands before Coney Island .

"An extinct fox that trod the ice-covered Himalayas five million years ago has been unearthed. With its razor sharp teeth, Vulpes quizhudingi was a ferocious hunter and predated well-known Ice Age creatures such as woolly mammoths and sabre tooth cats. The fox adds to a growing body of evidence that the mountains and nearby Tibet were ‘a cradle of evolution’ for mammals living in a cold climate that fanned out as the Ice Age gripped the planet. With its razor sharp teeth, Vulpes quizhudingi (pictured in the foreground) was a ferocious hunter that predated well known Ice Age creatures such as woolly mammoths and sabre tooth cats. This is an artist's impression of the Zanda fauna during the Pliocene . The fox lived between 3.6 million and five million years ago at a time when the Arctic was a little warmer than Tibet. Like modern arctic foxes, the ancient creature has long, sharp teeth for hunting. Based upon the fossilised lower jawbone and teeth, unearthed between 2006 and 2012, Dr Xiaoming Wang, of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County believes the creature was as large as a big male modern fox, and around 20 per cent larger than a modern arctic fox. The Tibetan fox, described in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, predates by three to four million years the previous oldest record of the arctic fox, whose geographical range is at least 1,240 miles (1,996km) away. Like modern arctic foxes, (pictured) the ancient creature has long, sharp teeth for hunting . Tibet is known as the ‘third pole’ of the world. It includes Mount Everest and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, which is endowed with more frozen terrain than anywhere else on Earth except the North and South Poles. Around three years ago, a woolly rhino fossil was found in the Zanda Basin on the north face of the Tibetan Plateau. It lived some 3.6 million years ago, long before similar beasts roamed northern Asia and Europe in the ice ages that gripped those regions. Dr Wang said: ‘Such a model of megafauna coming down from high mountains to spread to the rest of the cold steppes in northern Eurasia and North America offer a scenario of the origin of cold adapted forms. ‘The apparent connection between an ancestral high elevation species and its modern polar descendant is consistent with our out of Tibet hypothesis postulating high altitude Tibet was a training ground for cold environment adaptations well before the start of the Ice Age. ‘In addition to the Tibetan fox, we have also discovered ancestors of snow leopard, hunting dog and running hyena, all of them highly predacious based on their teeth.’ The giants of the Ice Age such as woolly mammoths, rhinos, great sloths and sabre tooth cats, which arrived at least a million years later, have been intensively studied in recent years. But much less is known about where the beasts came from and how they acquired their adaptations for living in the freezing cold. Vulpes quizhudingi was a ferocious hunter that lived in the Himalayas, along the border of Nepal and in nearby Tibet (marked at A) between 3.6 million and five million years ago . Researchers believe the megafauna were descendants of the Pliocene era between 5.3 million and 2.6 million years ago after their ancestors used Tibet as a ‘training ground'. Modern Arctic carnivores such as polar bear, grey wolves and arctic foxes are all highly predatory because of the large amount of energy required to live in such an extreme environment, which is all but devoid of plant food during the winter. Dr Wang said that the Pliocene Tibet carnivore community would have also had the same appetite for meat millions of years ago. Tibet is known as the 'third pole' of the world. The Himalayas that run along its border include Mount Everest (pictured) and the adjacent Tibetan Plateau, which is endowed with more frozen terrain than anywhere else on Earth except the North and South Poles .","Vulpes quizhudingi was a hunter living in the Himalayas and Tibet .

"A collection of manuscripts from caves in Afghanistan has provided the first evidence of Jewish communities living in the devoutly Muslim country 1,000 years ago. The cache of Hebrew documents are thought to have originated from the country's northeast region, a Taliban stronghold. The documents, which include biblical commentaries, personal letters and financial records, were unveiled by Israel's National Library after being purchased from private dealers. Significant: Some of the Hebrew documents purchased by Israel's National Archive, which have been described by researchers as one of the most important ever stashes of Jewish documents ever found . Historic: Haggai Ben-Shammai, academic director of Israel's National Library, displays one of the documents from a collection of discarded religious Jewish writings dated from the 10th century . Researchers have described the collection as one of the greatest Jewish archives ever found. The stash has been dubbed the 'Afghan Genizah'. Genizah is a Hebrew term that loosely translates as 'storage' and refers to a storeroom adjacent to a synagogue or Jewish cemetery where Hebrew-language books and papers are kept. Jewish law forbids any writings containing the formal names of God to be thrown away, so the documents are . either buried or stashed away. The collection of documents has provided scholars with fascinating details into the lives of early Jewish communities in ancient Persia. Conditions in the dry, shady caves have helped to preserve the documents, which were identified using carbon-dating technology and by the use of the unique unique Judeo-Persian language. The documents include writings in Hebrew, Aramaic, . Judea-Arabic and the unique Judeo-Persian language from that era. Discovery: Mr Ben-Shammai said it was too early to compare the cache to the Cairo Genizah, the historical stash found in a Cairo synagogue in the late 1800s . Evidence: The documents include biblical commentaries, personal letters and financial records . Haggai Ben-Shammai, the National Library's academic director, said the documents related to the 'Yiddish of Persian Jews'. He said the manuscripts included mentions of distinctly Jewish . names and evidence of their commercial activities along the 'Silk road' connecting Europe and the East. It remains unclear how the ancient . manuscripts emerged. Ben-Shammai said the library was contacted by . various antiquities dealers who got their hands on them. Bargaining: The library purchased 29 out of hundreds of the documents believed to be located around the world last month, after long negotiations with antiquities dealers . The library purchased 29 out . of hundreds of the documents believed to be located around the world last month, . after long negotiations with antiquities dealers, and they arrived in Israel last week. The library refused to . say how much it paid for the collection, adding that it hoped to . purchase more in the future and did not want to drive up prices. Mr Ben-Shammai said it was too early to compare the cache to the Cairo Genizah - a storage of documents found in a synagogue in the late 1800s including thousands of historically important documents. He said it would take a long time to sift through the . findings from Afghanistan and that the documents were already significant since . no other Hebrew writings had even been found so far from the Holy Land. The Jewish community in the . region at the time lived largely like others in the Muslim world, as a 'tolerated minority' that was treated better than under Christian rule, according to the academic. Afghanistan's Jewish community numbered as many as 40,000 in the late . 19th century, after Persian Jews fled forced conversion. By the mid-20th century, only about 5,000 . remained, and most emigrated after Israel's creation in 1948. Aviad Stollman, curator of the library's Judaica collection, said: 'They were Jews living a thousand years ago in this place. I think that is the most exciting part.'

"She is playing a woman renowned as an icon of Hollywood glamour. But with a khaki parka slung on over her nightgown, it appears Helena Bonham Carter doesn’t share Dame Elizabeth Taylor’s sense of timeless style. Miss Bonham Carter, 46, who is known for her eccentric dress sense, was caught between scenes for forthcoming BBC drama Burton And Taylor, which charts the dying days of the late star’s turbulent relationship with Richard Burton. Between takes: Helen Bonham Carter (left) and Dominic West (right) on set of the BBC drama Burton and Taylor . Miss Bonham Carter, whose big-screen credits include Les Miserables, Alice In Wonderland and The King’s Speech, was spotted with co-star Dominic West, star of crime drama The Wire, who is playing Burton. With his hair dyed grey and wearing a black tuxedo, Old Etonian West, 43, bore more of a similarity to seven-time Oscar-nominated actor Burton. The couple were photographed between takes as they filmed scenes in Chiswick, West London, last week. Burton And Taylor will be screened next year on BBC4. It is set in 1983, the year before Burton’s death, when he and Miss Taylor starred in a revival of Noel Coward’s Private Lives on Broadway. The couple, who at the time were separated, played a divorced couple who meet again on honeymoon with their new partners. Legendary couple: Richard Burton and Liz Taylor during a scene from the Broadway revival of Noel Coward's Private Lives. Speaking about her role in the BBC drama, Miss Bonham Carter said: ‘I look nothing like her for a start but it’s about capturing the essence of them at a particular time. She was and continues to be  a fascinating woman and she was a huge star. There’s no one comparable around now.’ Miss Taylor, who won two Oscars and starred in classics including Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, died in 2011.","Actress pictured on set of new BBC drama about last days of Liz Taylor's relationship with Richard Burton .

"Former West Brom manager Pepe Mel has been appointed coach of Spanish second division team Real Betis until the end of the season, the club announced on Saturday. It is the second time Mel has taken over as manager of the side he also played for as a striker, where he netted 50 times in a four year spell from 1989 to 1993. 'Betis have chosen Pepe Mel as trainer of the first team. The coach from Madrid will take charge of the Betis squad ..with the aim of seeking promotion,' Betis said in a statement on their website.

"Fernando Ricksen is smiling. He is thinking of the family he has behind him. Thinking of partner Veronika, whom he recently wed, and their two-year-old daughter Isabella. ‘All the love and help that I get from them is special,’ he says. ‘I’m a happy man.’ Sitting in a Glasgow hotel, Ricksen looks like any other proud father. He doesn’t look ill. A little thinner than in his playing pomp maybe, but you could walk past him and never guess at the burden he carries. Had his ups and downs: Former Rangers man Fernando Ricksen tells all in his new book, Fighting Spirit . It is only when Ricksen begins to speak that the creeping toll taken by Motor Neurone Disease becomes fully apparent in his slurred enunciation. It has been seven months since he revealed to the world, via a heart-breaking television interview, that he was battling this incurable condition which gradually erodes muscle control. ‘At the moment, I feel good,’ he says. ‘I’m not getting better but the most important thing is I’m not getting worse. I feel physically good, only my talking is poor.’ He is back in the city that was once his playground during six years as a Rangers player to attend the UK launch of his autobiography. It is the story of a life lived to the full, if not quite the full story. Asked if he had left out any tales within his catalogue of high-octane mayhem, Ricksen begins to laugh. Co-author Vincent de Vries reveals the one-time Holland international told him only about 50 per cent of what actually happened was included. ‘I don’t want to hurt other people,’ insists Ricksen. ‘We left out most of the other names in the book. At least those names who have family lives. We didn’t want to cause any divorces…’ It makes you wonder just what else went on. The stuff that has actually made it into print is a riotous blend of drink, drugs and sex. Lots and lots of sex. There is excess, addiction and redemption. For long enough, Ricksen seemed to tackle every aspect of his existence with the manic intensity that made him such an on-field success. Fan favourite: The Dutchman spent six trophy-laden years at Ibrox between 2000 and 2006 . Struggle: Ricksen revealed he was battling Motor Neurone Disease seven months ago . It was during the project of writing the book that he began to feel there was something wrong. His illness is covered only in a short, defiant epilogue. ‘Within a few years you kick the bucket, in normal cases,’ he writes. ‘Normal cases, yes. But I’m not a normal guy.’ Ricksen draws strength not only from his family, but from the numerous fans who have sent their best wishes. He received a phenomenal ovation at Ibrox in January when he took to the field at half-time in a match against East Fife. ‘The reaction I have had has been amazing,’ he admits. ‘From the moment I knew I was ill it has been incredible. Everybody has been there for me. ‘It has helped me to stay positive and just accept what is happening. It was in the summer of last year that I realised I was not well. I got the final diagnosis and it was difficult, very difficult. ‘But I got an incredible reaction when I came back to Glasgow and went to Ibrox. Going on to the pitch that day will stay with me. When I saw the fans I became really emotional. ‘From the moment I came to Rangers until the moment I left, that was the best time. I will treasure these memories.’ Ricksen . hopes to see his old club back at the top but has little interest in . the endless boardroom turmoil at Ibrox. ‘I’m fighting another battle – . not that one,’ he says. His . book was released in Holland last November and has topped the . bestseller list en route to selling 70,000 copies. According to de . Vries, money earned from it will be used to fund Isabella’s education . and protect her future. She . will also one day be able to read about many of the naughty things her . dad got up to during a career that encompassed Fortuna Sittard, AZ . Alkmaar and Zenit St Petersburg, as well as Rangers. Ricksen, . though, felt it was important to be as honest as he could be, as long . as he was only implicating himself in the juicier yarns. Out! Former Rangers boss Dick Advocaat (left) caught Ricksen drunk at 9am while on Holland duty . ‘It is great to see my life in print,’ he says. ‘I am very proud of the book. ‘A lot of what is here was on the front pages of newspapers at the time, so a lot of people already know some the things that I’ve done in my life. ‘People have asked me, “How do you remember if you were always drunk?” But I do remember, I remember everything and all aspects of my life. ‘Some of the stories are nicer to tell than others. But I don’t have any regrets - if I did I would have no book.’ Spent the evening: Ricksen had a one-night romp with Katie Price . Alcohol was Ricksen’s main vice of choice in Scotland. Cocaine became prevalent in Russia. The women were plentiful in both. Ricksen once spent a night with glamour model Katie Price when at Rangers. Then there was a period when four strippers shared his apartment in St Petersburg. He was not, it’s fair to say, an easy player to manage. Dick Advocaat did so at both Rangers and Zenit, but it was an incident when on Holland duty that most upset The Little General. The Dutch team hotel in Minsk just happened to have a strip club in the basement. Ricksen stepped into it after a game against Belarus and was still there five minutes before the bus back to the airport was due to depart the next morning. He made it - but only after kicking down the doors to both his own room and that of Ruud van Nistelrooy in a desperate search for his bags. ‘I was still drunk at nine in the morning,’ admits Ricksen. ‘Dick wasn’t happy. After that, I was never called again to the national team. ‘That hurt me the most. The money didn’t matter. It was always about football. But if I was the coach, I would have done the same as Dick.’ Former team-mate Nacho Novo spent time with Ricksen at the book launch and is among a host of star names who will play in a testimonial game in Sittard a week tomorrow. ‘I have been trying to keep my emotions in check and just speak to him as usual,’ says the Spaniard. ‘This illness shows you that you need to enjoy life every day. To see him laugh and joke the way he does is unbelievable. I don’t know how I would take it in his position. But Fernando has always been a fighter.’ He’s still fighting. And still smiling.

"As Britain's first female Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was not only pioneering in politics but also in fashion, setting an example of how she believed women in power should dress. During her time as PM in the Eighties, she became famous for her power dressing suits, pussybow blouses and, of course, her treasured pearls. The Iron Lady, who died today aged 87, summed up her style as 'never flashy, just appropriate.' Signature style: Margaret Thatcher became known for her smart suits, practical heels and pearls . The former Conservative leader spoke of her fashion choices in an interview with Dr Miriam Stoppard for Yorkshire TV in 1985, saying she did have to be conscious of her image but she was more concerned with feeling comfortable than stylish. She said: 'What you do is decide the clothes in . which you are comfortable. You must be comfortable. You are going to a . great occasion. It must be a style that you are comfortable in. Must be a . fabric that you are comfortable in, that hangs well, and you must know . that you look appropriate for the occasion. Never flashy, just appropriate.' She continued: 'It is not unfeminine to be well-tailored. Indeed, it often perhaps concentrates . on what you are going to say if you have got well-tailored things on . because people no longer look at your clothes.' Feminine touch: She said she often wore pussybow blouses because they were 'rather softening and pretty' Substance over style: The Baroness said she always aimed to dress appropriately . Baroness Thatcher admitted that what she wore 'became part of the job' because she was 'representing the country'. She admitted to Dr Stoppard that she didn't always get it right.  She regretted wearing a blue and white . striped hat in the Seventies when she was the education secretary because she realised it wasn't fitting for her role. 'It was a very smart hat. The fact was it . would have done for an actress, but it was not quite right for a . politician. I learned that lesson ever since. If you are going to wear a . smart hat, wear a very plain one,' she said. The Baroness' signature style was one that she honed during her time as PM. Growing up as the daughter of a grocer, she was used to being on her feet and helping in the shop. Hats off: She was a fan of hats in the Sixties but lived to regret some of her choices and didn't wear them as often during her time as Prime Minister . Grocer's daughter: In her youth, the Baroness, pictured, left, wore frumpier clothes . This helped her become aware of the practicalities of fashion - comfortable shoes like her low heels were always preferable over high heels, no matter how stylish. Her mother and father were also frugal which taught her to buy clothes and accessories that lasted - like her black Asprey handbag that would last . for decades. It still looked as good as new when it sold at auction at . Christie's for £25,000 in 2011. Abi Morgan researched Baroness Thatcher's fashion when writing the script for the film The Iron Lady. The film depicts how the Baroness was advised on how to make her image less frumpy on her bid to win power including giving up wearing hats and pearls. She refused on the latter because they were of sentimental value - given to her by her husband Denis when their twins were born. True blue: The former Conservative leader said her party's colour was always her favourite shade . Firm favourite: She's continued to wear the colour often for public appearances, such as when she returned to Number 10 when David Cameron came to power . Morgan said when the film was released: 'The star-makers may have told her . what to wear but she already knew how to dress - she was of that generation of women . trained to appear in a certain way, hair set, with a proper hat, . gloves, bag and shoes. The grooming was very regal, and her uniform had a . regality about it.' Morgan's belief that the former Prime Minster 'knew how to dress' is backed up by  Marianne Abrahams, the design director of one of the politician's favourite labels, Aquascutum. 'She knows precisely what she wants and she's particular about the fit of the shoulders,' she said of designing some of her bespoke suits in the Eighties. Wardrobe staple: Her penchant for pearls endured over the decades . While the Baroness knew what she wore in the male dominated world of politics would help her to be taken seriously, she also did not want to lose her femininity. 'You do not lose your feminine qualities just because you are a Prime Minister,' she said. This is why she loved her pussybow blouse so much. 'I often wear bows; they are rather softening, they are rather pretty,' she said. When it came to the colour of her clothes, she was always keen to tow the party line - maintaining that her favourite shade was always 'my party's colour' sapphire blue. Follower of fashion: The Baroness with designer Zandra Rhodes appreciated well-tailored clothes . Lasting appeal: A selection of her outfits were auctioned off at Christies in 2012 . She often chose to wear this colour for public appearances long after she was voted out of power. Her fashion choices were often replicated in the Eighties and thanks to the release of The Iron Lady film, other elements of her style have revived in popularity including the Peter Pan collar and midi length skirt. Many people have championed her style over the years including handbag entrepreneur Anya Hindmarch who once told Vogue, 'I am a . lifelong fan of Margaret Thatcher.' She said: 'Margaret Thatcher dressed as a strong . woman and developed a style that was very much her own brand. The hair, . the bow, the pearls and the handbag all became iconic.'","Iron Lady always believed in wearing clothes 'in which you are comfortable'

"From baby turtles scuttling across the beach to the northern lights glowing in the Icelandic sky, these are just some of the hundreds of entries to the Living Planet photo competition. Both professional and amateur photographers were asked to submit images that captured life on the planet in its broadest form. The winner of the competition, run by The Society of Nature and Wildlife Photographers, was a beautifully colourful shot of a ladybird crawling over a yellow flower. First place: David Bladon's ladybird crawling over a yellow flower won the prestigious photography competition which captured the world in all its glory . It was taken by David Bladon from Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland. Mr Bladon, 40, who has just started his own photography business, said: 'Basically, the weather kept going from sun to showers and I was a bit bored. 'Every time the sun broke through I’d search for insects and creatures that would make a decent macro shot. When I saw the ladybird and the colours, I snapped away.' Runner-up was Debashis Mukherjee, 50, a photography graduate from Kolkata in India for his baby turtle picture. He said: 'I took this photograph at Rishikulya Sea Beach in Ganjam district, Odisha, India. 'When I was touring in that area I heard that hatching of Olive Ridley sea turtles was happening and I rushed to that spot at 3.30am. After sunrise I got this shot. Second place: Runner-up was Debashis Mukherjee, 50, a photography graduate from Kolkata in India who took this shot of baby turtles . 'The east facing coast of this peninsular of India has the honour of hosting the yearly ritual of ‘arribada’ meaning mass arrival in Spanish of the Olive Ridley Sea Turtles for their nesting, usually found in the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic oceans. 'Due to trawling and offshore drilling for oil and gas in those oceans these turtles have now been listed under the Endangered Species Act by the US. 'The footprints left behind by these new born little species reflect an emotional track for them to come back for nesting when they again are mothers.' And in third place was Violetta Nowak from Lubuskie, Poland, with her shot of a hedgehog nestling in the autumn leaves. Several Brits were highly commended, including Bill Doherty for a shot of a grebe eating a fish and Robin Lowry for two separate shots of owls. Third place: Violetta Nowak from Lubuskie, Poland, was awarded for her shot of a hedgehog nestling in the autumn . Mr Doherty, 57, from Ashington in Northumberland works with people with learning disabilities. He said: 'The image is of a juvenile great crested grebe taken in Northumberland. The parent bird had caught this fish and given it to the youngster, with no thought of a knife and fork to cut it up into smaller, more manageable pieces. The chick however did manage to consume the fish, after a bit of a struggle.' Robin Lowry, 48, from Billericay in Essex took pictures of a tawny owl and a barn owl which were both highly commended. He said: 'I call the first shot Autumn Gold. I wanted to create a warm intimate portrait of this owl, and this was one of those times when everything fell into place. Nature: Several photographers from Britain were commended including Bill Doherty, with his shot of a grebe eating a fish . In Essex where this picture was taken, with the warm Autumn tones of the leaves still on the trees, the milky early morning sun diffused by light patchy cloud, and the owl posing so nicely, I knew this was going to be a good image.' Of the barn owl, the CGI Creative Director added: 'For this image I used a captive Barn owl. I wanted to get that moment where the owl was getting ready to land but it still took a few goes to get this one where I wanted it to be, with the face and wings in the right position.' Philip Bird, from East Grinstead in West Sussex was highly commended for his amazing shot of a snowstorm coming in. Also in colder climes, a shot of the northern lights in Iceland by local photographer Rafn Sigurbjvrnsson made it onto the highly commended list.

"A Polish artist famed for slipping crocheted covers around unlikely objects has gotten into hot water in Mexico for slipping her brightly colored work around underwater sculptures near Cancun. Agata Oleksiak, who uses the name Olek, said she intervened at the Cancun Underwater Museum this month to call attention to the dangers facing species such as the whale shark. But museum director Jaime Gonzalez said she did so without permission, and may herself have damaged marine life growing on the sculptures in an environmentally protected area.

'Believe it or not, there is a lot of marine life growing, incrusted in the sculpture, and we gather that this has killed it,' he said. Gonzalez said prosecutors are preparing to lodge charges against her. 'If they want to sue me, I don't know. I can pay them back with crocheting more underwater sculptures,' Oleksiak said. 'I don't know why would they sue me but maybe they're a little bit upset that I did it there.' 'But my intentions were positive and that's the most important thing about my work,' she added. 'I really want to create a positive message.' In the past, she's put crocheted covers around a bus and a Wall Street statue of a bull.

"Once, her very presence struck fear into everyone from fellow world leaders to those ‘Tory wets’ she brutally purged from her Cabinet. Her political heyday may be long gone, but the same gravitas was instantly recognisable in Lady Thatcher during a rare public outing last week to enjoy the spring sunshine in a London park. Accompanied by Kate, her ever-faithful carer of the past ten years, the 86-year-old former prime minister sat contentedly watching a group of boys playing football. She was in remarkably good spirits, happy to chat with admirers who stopped to speak to her as she relaxed on a park bench. To the evident delight of Lady T, a young hound which had been sprinting around the park jumped up on to the bench. She didn’t hesitate to stroke the dog affectionately. Contented lady: Baroness Thatcher was immaculately dressed and in good spirits during a visit to a London park . As ever, Lady Thatcher was dressed immaculately, this time in her favourite long green overcoat with a lemon yellow scarf and mitten gloves. Her make-up was flawless. A hairdresser, who visits at least once a week, ensures those distinctive blonde tresses — though whiter than they once were — are never out of place. But it was the comfortable sandals, rather than elegant heels and padded shoulders — the signature of her days in Downing Street — which betrayed her advancing years and unsteadiness on her feet. A walking stick perched at the end of the bench was another indication. But, in typically Thatcherite fashion — refusing to accept any sign of weakness (particularly in others), she often stubbornly refuses to use the stick. Still fiercely proud, the woman who used to survive on four hours’ sleep a night makes few allowances for her own physical frailties. Firm friends: Baroness Thatcher seemed to delight in the company of a dog that bounded over to her . Lady Thatcher — who was Britain’s . longest-serving prime minister in more than a century and, of course, . the first and so far only woman to conquer the summit of British . political life — has suffered a series of strokes in recent years, which . triggered the onset of dementia. Her . mental frailty was the theme of the controversial recent film, The Iron . Lady, which focused on her twilight years. (Neither she nor her son and . daughter, Sir Mark and Carol, have seen the movie.) Nowadays, Lady Thatcher spends most of her time in her elegant four-storey home  in Belgravia with Kate, a trained  private nurse, who works full-time with  the former PM. Kate also lives in, serving  as Lady Thatcher’s cook, her dresser  and, most importantly, devoted friend  and companion. Another carer, a Yorkshire-born nurse called Anne, has also been employed in the past six months to share the responsibilities. And the police protection officers are never far away. Aside from the odd visit to the park, . there are also occasional lunches at Lady Thatcher’s favourite Goring . Hotel, also in Belgravia, where Kate Middleton and  her family stayed . the night before the  royal wedding. Only . two weeks ago, she was there with Mark Worthington, who was her . personal private secretary for almost 20 years. But, most days, she is . simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing . room, listening to classical music. She . skims the newspapers, watches the news on television — although her . favourite television programme is Songs Of Praise — and reads selected . mail. Hundreds of letters pour into her House of Lords office each week, . and she still signs books and photographs for well-wishers. A small but steady stream of visitors forms the devoted and highly protective inner-circle. Cynthia . Crawford, known as ‘Crawfie’, who was Lady Thatcher’s dresser, . confidante and travelling companion in Downing Street, comes to stay in . London for a week at a time. Sir Bernard Ingham, the curmudgeonly . Yorkshireman who was her Downing Street press secretary, is another . regular visitor, along with Alison Wakeham. Her . husband John, the former Cabinet minister, was badly injured in the IRA . bomb which killed his first wife, Roberta, at the Grand Hotel in . Brighton 1984. Alison had been his secretary at the time of the . terrorist attack. Dame Sue Tinson, a former boss at ITN, and Conor Burns, the MP for Bournemouth West, are also regulars. Sadly, . there are infrequent appearances from her children, as Mark lives in . Spain and Carol in Switzerland. Sir Mark’s two children, Michael, 22, . and Amanda, 18, from his first marriage to American-born Diane Burgdorf — . whom he divorced in 2005 — are only occasional visitors, since they . both live in Texas. After a . long day in Downing Street, Lady Thatcher used to kick off her shoes in . the flat upstairs and unwind with a stiff whisky. These days, it is a . weak gin and tonic before dinner. Because her short-term memory is . poor, she is now most comfortable in small groups of friends. She avoids . events with large crowds, and will be absent when the Queen attends a . ceremony in Parliament tomorrow to mark her Diamond Jubilee. Lady and the scamp: The dog entertains the former Prime Minister, her helper Kate (centre) and a woman park-goer . Formidable: Former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher in her heyday (left) and (right) the years are beginning to take their toll on The Iron Lady . A force to be reckoned with: Lady Thatcher with Geoffrey Howe... but these days she is simply content to sit at home in her favourite armchair in the drawing room, listening to classical music . ‘Lady Thatcher will watch it on the television at home,’ says a friend. ‘She is still very interested in what’s going on. And she still has very strong views — as you can imagine.’ There have also been a clutch of invitations to mark the 30th anniversary of victory in the Falklands War next month — one of the defining moments of her premiership. But she has declined them all. Her friends insist that she is comfortable and content. As one says: ‘There are flashes of the old Lady T, when you have to have your wits about you. And whenever you go round, she is always immaculately dressed as if she’s off to a night at the opera. But it’s a quiet life these days, and early to bed.’ Looking at her sitting on the park bench, however, there is one thing that is conspicuous by its absence: her famous handbag. As Prime Minister, she once declared women ‘are generally better at wielding the handbag than the bayonet’. Now, though, it seems Britain’s greatest-ever woman politician no longer has need to wield either.",Former Prime Minister spotted enjoying the spring sunshine in a London park .
"While Apple prefers to remain tight-lipped about upcoming product launches, Samsung’s executive vice president is much more open. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Vegas, Lee Young Hee announced that the firm is looking to release its next flagship phone between March and April - and it will be called the Galaxy S5. Lee also discussed the possibility a future model of the phone could feature iris recognition technology, yet did not confirm if it would be added to S5 or not. Samsung is set to release its next flagship phone - the Galaxy S5 - between March and April. The Korean firm also hinted that either the S5, or a future model, could be fitted with an iris scanner, stock photo of an iris is pictured, that would be used to unlock the device . Rumours have suggested Samsung is working on a follow-up to its Galaxy Gear smartwatch since last year, too, and this could be unveiled at the same time as the S5. Lee told Bloomberg: We’ve been announcing our first flagship model in the first half of each year, around March and April, and we are still targeting for release around that time. ‘When we release our S5 device, you can also expect a Gear successor with more advanced functions, and the bulky design will also be improved.’ Lee is referring to the criticism the watch received when it went on sale in September last year. Biometric experts at New York-based firm EyeLock have created a dongle fitted with an iris scanner. The Myris device can register up to five different users. Each user begins by scanning their eyes to take an image of their respective irises. These unique images are then translated into an encrypted code. The scan takes between 10 and 20 seconds and the authentication code is created immediately. Once registered, each user can add various online passwords to their Myris profile. Next time the user visits one of these accounts, instead of entering a password, they can scan their eyes for immediate and secure access. According to EyeLock, the False Acceptance Rate of the average fingerprint sensor, in which the system is hacked by an unknown print, is one in every 10,000 scans.  For iris scans, this increases to one 1 in 2.25 trillion scans. Myris is set to go on sale before the summer and will cost around $250 (£150) although an exact date and price is yet to be announced. Some analysts claimed the Korean firm had rushed the production of the gadget in order to beat Apple to releasing a smartwatch, and the design suffered. However, Apple has still not announced its rumoured iWatch. Regarding the iris recognition technology, Lee said during Samsung’s press event at the Consumer Electronics Show: ‘Many people are fanatical about iris recognition technology and we are studying the possibility but can’t really say whether we will have it or not on the S5.’ Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple’s iPhone 5S. Samsung is said to be working on adding biometric technology to a future model in its Galaxy range of smartphones and tablets to rival the popular fingerprint scanner on Apple's iPhone 5S, pictured . Seeing double: Two version of the S5 are expected to go on sale in April, a metal and a plastic version . Samsung is also set to unveil a second-generation Galaxy Gear, original model is pictured, along with the S5 at Mobile World Congress in February . Iris scanning is more secure than fingerprint scanning, and the technology involved is cheaper, making it a more obvious choice to add to future models. Iris scanning involves a simple charge-coupled device digital camera that uses visible and near-infrared light to take a clear, high-contrast image of a person’s iris. When the camera takes the image, a scanner plots the centre of the pupil, edge of the pupil, edge of the iris, eyelids and eyelashes. It then analyses the unique patterns in the iris and translates this pattern into a code. Next time the eye is scanned, this code is compared to the pattern to authenticate a match. The iris scanner would not be the first time Samsung has introduced eye-tracking technology. Its Galaxy S4 includes a feature that locks onto the movement and position of a user’s eyes. The phone can analyse where the user is looking and will automatically scroll a web page when the eyes reach the bottom of the screen, for example, or lock the screen when the user looks away. Both of Samsung's new devices are expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. They will likely then go on sale in Korea in March, before being rolled out worldwide in April.","S5 is expected to be unveiled during Mobile World Congress in February .

'I spoke Polish and Russian - still do - and Russia at that time was a serious enemy of ours,' he told CBS New York. He adding that tennis was 'absolutely' his cover.

"When patients were committed to the Willard Asylum for the Insane in Upstate New York, they arrived with a suitcase packed with all of the possessions they thought they needed for their time inside. Most never left. The mental hospital had an average stay of nearly 30 years. When patients died, they were buried in nameless graves across the street of the asylum. Their suitcases, with all their worldly possessions, were locked in an attic and forgotten. In 1995, an employee of the mental hospital discovered the suitcases, 400 of them. They date from 1910 to 1960. Now, photographer Jon Crispin is cataloging each suitcase and opening a window into the lives - and the minds - of the people deemed too unwell to be allowed in society. Pieces of a past life: This suitcase belonged to Anna. Inside was a letter that was not addressed to her, a pair of toothbrushes and several gaudy belts and sashes - as well as shoes and hats . This case belonged to Frank C., a U.S. Army veteran from Brooklyn, New York. Here, a sewing kit, personal grooming kit, toy pistol and bread ration card are all visible. He also carried several photos of himself and his family . Frank C.'s uniform was perfectly preserved - even though it was packed away in the 1950s and not found until 1995 . This is the family that Frank C. left behind. It is unknown whether he ever left the Willard Asylum for the Insane, but most patients died there and were buried in unnamed graves . There is no sign of mental illness is this well-ordered suitcase left behind by Frank C. 'It’s such compelling stuff. These people were essentially prisoners inside,' Mr Crispin told MailOnline. 'Their families largely abandoned them. They gave them a suitcase and had them committed. Either their families filled them up or the patients themselves did. 'Looking at these suitcases, you just get the idea that that these people really had lives outside before they went to Willard.' Frank C., a World War II veteran from Brooklyn, New York, brought his U.S. Army uniform, which remains preserved in nearly mint condition. His suitcase also contains pictures of himself and his family. Remains a mix of his life in the military and his life back home after the war. The suitcase belonging to a woman named Anna reveals that she was a woman who enjoyed being seen in public. She packed a pair of stylish heels and several fine hats. Sequined and gold lamé belts reveal a flair for the ostentatious. Dmytre, who owned this suitcase, is one of the few patients from Willard who is well known. He was committed in 1953 and stayed in the hospital for 24 years. He died in 2000 . Flora T. was clearly a woman of class. Her fine possessions, including a perfume bottle and silver napkin ring, reveal a woman with means. However, the kit of needles and injection drugs adds a dark element to this collection . Flora T.'s kit includes what appears to be strychnine sulfate, which is a drug that could treat epilepsy. It is unknown why she was committed, though . The Willard Asylum for the Insane operated from the 1800s until 1995 - housing untold thousands of patients, many for the rest of their lives. It currently houses a drug rehabilitation program for convicts . A cardboard storage container for Eleanor G. contained a pair of perfectly-preserved curling irons and a sewing kit. Perfume in a hand-blown glass bottle reveals that she was a woman of means when she was committed to the hospital. 'The overwhelming thing that I take from it is is it’s all personal. I can look at the objects in these cases and get a strong idea of what the people who owned them was like,' Mr Crispin said. Thus far, he has photographed 80 of the suitcases. New York state law prohibits Mr Crispin from matching the hospital records with the suitcases to tell the more complete story of patients. They could be committed for any number of reasons. Epilepsy - having seizures - was grounds for lifelong commitment. Young women who were promiscuous, gays and lesbians and mothers who couldn't get over the grief of losing a child in three months or less could all be subject to commitment. Mr Crispin's work is currently being featured as part of an exhibit about mental health at the Exploratorium science museum in San Francisco. The show is called 'The Changing Face of What is Normal.' This remarkably-detailed prosthetic leg was shipped to Willard for Henry L. A moment in time: Peter L. bought a newspaper in Syracuse, New York, the day before he was committed. The date: March 22, 1941 . Photographer Jon Crispin is not allowed to reveal the full names of the patients - nor delve into the ailments that brought them to Willard because they are still protected by medical privacy laws, the state of New York claims . Worn out: Clarissa B.'s suitcase shows dramatic signs of wear - though it appears most of the damage was done before it was locked away for decades . Eleanor G. had several suitcases in the collection. This is one. It contained an expensive bottle of perfume, a pair of electric curling irons and the remnants of a sewing kit . Charles played the zither and he brought it with him when he was committed to Willard in the 1930s. It's unknown whether he was allowed to play it while in the hospital . A bottle of glycerine, still corked, was found in Maude K.'s case, along with a paperweight from the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago .","Photographer Jon Crispin has been documenting the suitcases left behind by patients at the Willard Asylum for the Insane in Upstate New York .

"The family of Sir Jack Brabham has accepted the Queensland government's offer of a state funeral. The three-time Formula One world champion died at his Gold Coast home on Monday, aged 88. One of Australia's greatest sportsmen, Brabham was originally from NSW but lived in Queensland for almost 20 years. Scroll down for video . Sir Jack Brabham during his last public appearance on Sunday at Aeromil Pacific, Sunshine Coast Airport . F1 World Champion Sir Jack Brabham, pictured in Melbourne in March 2013, died aged 88 . Brabham's widow Lady Margaret said the family was delighted by the offer and would meet with Queensland government officials this week to confirm a date and other arrangements. With two of Brabham's three sons based in the United States and England, the funeral may not be held until next week at the earliest to give them time to travel back to Australia. 'I'm sure he would be so proud and it is an absolute fitting gesture for him. He deserves it,' Lady Margaret told motorsports website Speedcafe.com. 'He is so admired and loved by everybody. He did such a wonderful thing and what he achieved will never be done again.' The former Royal Australian Air Force mechanic won world titles in 1959 and 1960 with the Cooper Racing Team, and again in 1966 when he became the first driver to win in a car that he built himself. He was the first motorsport identity to be knighted, after he retired in 1970, and he was awarded Australian of the Year in 1966 and National Treasure in 2012. Brabham, pictured in 1970, won the F1 championship in 1959, 1960 and 1966 . Sir Jack, who had 14 Grand Prix wins to his name, won the Formula One World Constructors Championship in 1966 and 1967. The Australian Grand Prix said Sir Jack died after a long battle with kidney disease. Sir Jack's wife Lady Margaret said her husband had seemed fine after getting up early and eating breakfast on Monday. 'He had just finished his breakfast and then he was gone,' Lady Margaret told Speedcafe. 'He was fine yesterday so it has been a bit of a shock even though he had been sick for some time. 'I have spoken to all three boys and we are in the process of organising funeral arrangements.' Brabham, who had 14 Grand Prix wins during his career, at Silverstone in the UK in 1961 . Formula One: . The rest: . His son David Brabham said it was a very sad day for his family in a statement on Monday. 'My father passed away peacefully at home at the age of 88 this morning,' he said. 'He lived an incredible life, achieving more than anyone would ever dream of and he will continue to live on through the astounding legacy he leaves behind.' Mr Brabham also tweeted: 'Thanks for all the kind messages about my fathers peaceful passing, it is appreciated by the whole family.' Prime Minister Tony Abbott has hailed Formula One champion Sir Jack Brabham as an Australian legend. The 88-year-old boasted many great Australian traits, Mr Abbott said. 'Australia has lost a legend,' Mr Abbott said in a statement. 'He was respected and admired for his spirit, and for his great skill as an engineer.' Kidney Health Australia CEO Anne Wilson said Sir Jack had suffered from kidney disease and had been on dialysis for a number of years. 'Sir Jack was an inspirational patron for Kidney Health Australia and along with his wife Lady Margaret Brabham, who is also a patron of the organisation, attended many charity events, always keen to promote messages about kidney health,' Ms Wilson said. 'Sir Jack always said that coping with failed kidneys was one of the toughest drives of his life.' Fellow Australian motor racing legend Alan Jones described Sir Jack, revered throughout the motor racing world, as an inspirational figure. 'I think he was inspirational for any young bloke that wanted to go across overseas and race cars. He was the man they looked up to and he was the man they wanted to emulate,' Mr Jones told Sky News. The Confederation of Australian Motorsport (CAMS) said the legendary driver, known as 'Black Jack' would never be forgotten. 'Always a man of few words - his nickname 'Black Jack' referred to both his dark hair and his propensity for maintaining a shadowy silence - he avoided small talk and was undemonstrative in the extreme,' a statement on the CAMS website said. 'But behind the wheel he was anything but shy and retiring. He put his head down and drove exceedingly forcefully.' In addition to his knighthood, Brabham was named Australian of the Year in 1966, a legend of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2003 and a National Living Treasure in 2012. V8 Supercars chief executive James Warburton said he led the way for many Australians to succeed on the global stage and for Australia to be recognised as a leader in motorsport. Sir Jack Brabham and his wife Lady Margaret Brabham visit Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital for the Kidney Health Australia patrons awards ceremony in 2009 . Brabham at the RAC British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch in 1970 . 'He will be forever loved, admired and remembered,' Mr Warburton said. Sir Jack made his last public appearance on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday, attending an event at the offices of Aeromil Pacific at the Sunshine Coast Airport, where he mixed with motor racing enthusiasts and inspected a car he built and raced during the 1967 Formula Two season. He had flown by helicopter from his home on the Gold Coast to attend the event, organised by Aeromil Pacific managing director and long-time friend Steve Padgett, who had purchased the Brabham BT23 single seater, still painted in the iconic Brabham green and gold. 'He was certainly a towering figure in motor racing, there's no doubt about that and he was a great Australian,' Mr Padgett told AAP. Brabham takes the Melbourne 2006 Queen's Baton around the Albert Park Grand Prix track in a 1956 F1 car during the Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay . 'We started it up for him ... he cracked a couple of quite nice smiles which was great,' Mr Padgett said. In a testament to his character, he famously ran out of fuel on the last lap of the 1959 United States Grand Prix but pushed his car to the finish, securing fourth place and his maiden world title. In his final years, Sir Jack battled failing eyesight and problems with his kidneys, but he never lost his spark or his sense of humour. 'The big aim now is to die without an enemy in the world. I'm going to outlive the bastards,' he joked. Brabham is survived by his wife Lady Margaret and his three sons Gary, Geoff and David, who all followed their father into the racing industry.","Brabham family accepts Queensland government's offer of state funeral .

That same year, Tuscaloosa County, Alabama's most successful meth cook was also making the purest meth east of the Mississippi . Experienced: Walter White had been making meth for ten years. He's so good that some say he should be called the 'meth chef' Revealing: The meth cook exposes the secret of his legendary operation - he explained how he got started, how he made - and spent - thousands of dollars every day, how he got arrested and why his partners are now serving life sentences behind bars . From 1988, the drug maker who shares the same name with the main character in the ten-time Emmy award winning TV show was cooking and selling methamphetamine across his own county. By 2009 the show was one of the most popular in the country and Alabama's real Walter White and the coincidental similarities between himself and the fictional kingpin on TV every Tuesday was big news. In a video documentary with VICE online, White, 55, explained the ups and downs of his adventure into drugs. Working with a partner, like Walter White in the show, he claims he made the purest meth around. Real or fantasy? Bryan Cranston plays a mild-mannered chemistry teacher who becomes a drug baron to support his family after he discovers he has lung cancer . Parallels: The two Walter White's share a great deal in common, not least of which they were both making thousands of dollars a day trafficking and creating meth . White said that at the peak of his meth-making and drug-selling business, he was making several thousand dollars a day. 'I worked every day and was a family man. It was a good time in my life. It was beautiful. We started making meth part time at first but then demand got so  high i would work during the day and make meth at night,' White says. 'I was making money in construction but the meth money was outweighing it by so much I decided to go down that line.' The fictional Walter White, played by Emmy-winner Bryan Cranston, is a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher who cooks meth and becomes a ruthless drug baron to help support his family after he's diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. The show, created by Vince Gilligan, starred Cranston alongside Aaron Paul who plays a slackers former student of White, who team up to manufacture and distribute huge quantities of the drug in New Mexico. Life imitating art: In real-life, Walter White was alerted to the fact the authorities were onto him and watching his every move. The same is true of the the Breaking Bad character . Recovering: White has since been sent to and graduated from a court-ordered long-term faith-based recovery program at the Foundry Rescue Mission & Recovery in Bessemer, Alabama . 'The sky was the limit,' he said. 'I bought tools, four-wheelers, cars, trucks, you name it. I just stockpiled the money,' White said. 'When you make it like that, it's easy to spend, it's just a different lifestyle. Looking back now, it's hard to believe that I could go through that much money in one day.' 'When you make it like that, it's easy to spend, it's just a different lifestyle. Looking back now, it's hard to believe that I could go through that much money in one day. Several thousand, easy.' He would drop the drop the drugs off at a certain spot and then come back the next day to a seculded spot in the countryside to pick up the cash. Unlike Walter White in the show, played by actor Bryan Cranston, real-life White was not dying of cancer and was not chased by his own brother in-law. But like in the show, it was not an easy ride. On the run: In 2012, White violated his probation in Tuscaloosa County, failed to appear in court and was put on the top of most wanted list by the sheriff there . More money than sense: White was pulling thousands of dollars a day and spending the cash on tools and cars . Bearing all:  Walter was known for having the purest stuff in Alabama and has been speaking about his days in the game, his way of doing things, and of course, his thoughts on the hit AMC show, Breaking Bad . White's wife divorced him, as he began to lose touch with his family. His oldest son describes feeling him drift away from the family because of the time he spent in the lab. As in the show, his lawyer advised him to stop cooking meth because the authorities were investigating his activity in 2008. His partner, Sammy, continued to work and was arrested by the police several times. White later went back into making drugs in another county until he was finally arrested. Family values: Walter White grew apart from his family including his son, Chris, (right) but now he says he is working to repair relationships - after all, they managed to survive without him . Thinking about the future: Walter White knows that he could go to jail for the rest of him life when he has his trial in March 2014 but he resigns himself to the fact he will no longer be hurting anyone but himself . White has since been sent to and graduated from a court-ordered long-term faith-based recovery program at the Foundry Rescue Mission & Recovery in Bessemer, Alabama. White's family and his friends say he's a success story and has left the life of making and selling illegal drugs. In 2012, White violated his probation in Tuscaloosa County, failed to appear in court and was put on the top of most wanted list by the sheriff there. He was eventually caught and jailed with a $2 million bond placed on his release. He was placed on the top of state's Most Wanted List and now faces a criminal trial in March of next year. If convicted of his crimes, Whtie could be put in prison for the rest of his life. 'If i have to go to prison, I won't be hurting anybody but myself this time. 'It's just me answering up to the things I've done. 'My family - they've got jobs and lives - I won't be hurting this time.'","Despite sharing a name and a history with methamphetamine with the protagonist of AMC’s ‘Breaking Bad,’ Alabama’s Walter White has spent far more time in jail .

"Alicia Douvall after having facial implants removed following complications . It cost her her fortune and the men she loved. And by the time former glamour model Alicia Douvall had ploughed more than £1.5million into becoming Britain's poster girl for plastic surgery, it very nearly destroyed her relationship with her teenage daughter Georgia. After Alicia's craving to look like a human Barbie doll led her to have more than 350 procedures - even having her toes shortened so that her feet would look good in sandals - Georgia had had enough. Fearful that her mother would die on the operating table, she issued an ultimatum: 'Stop having surgery or I'll leave home.' It was the wake-up call Alicia needed. In desperation, she wrote to almost a dozen cosmetic surgeons begging them to repair her ravaged looks. Eventually she found two who agreed to help. And now, finally, she is revealing the full results. In a risky nine-hour operation costing £25,000, Alicia had horrific cheek implants removed and her frozen smile restored by Jan Stanek and Caroline Mills. The results from the work  carried out in March are so good that she is now regaining her confidence in her looks. 'They told me there was a chance I wouldn't wake up from the anaesthetic or that it wouldn't work and I could end up as some hideous monster,' Alicia admits. 'Frankly I didn't care. I was fully prepared to put my life on the line to get my natural face back. They had to break my jaw and tighten the muscle. My ears had to be cut off and I had to have screws put into the right side of my jaw to compensate for muscle damage. 'My nose had to be cut off to lift my lip in the hope I would get my smile back. They warned me there was no guarantee how my face would heal. Thankfully, my smile has come back in the past month and I am so grateful. It means my youngest daughter Papaya can see me smile for the first time.' For Georgia, 18, the restoration of her mother's looks has been an enormous relief. 'I tried to stop her  having more procedures lots of times,' she says, speaking for the first time about her mother's addiction. Alicia Douvall with her children Georgie age 18 and baby Papaya . 'As I got older and realised it was dangerous and saw the pain she went through, I tried to talk her out of the operations. Four years ago, I had to call an ambulance because she was in so much pain after one procedure. It's put me off cosmetic surgery for life. My mother was constantly wrapped in bandages like an Egyptian mummy.' It was after having implants intended to make her look like Angelina Jolie went horribly wrong two years ago that Alicia began to realise her passion for the surgeon's knife was transforming her into a stretched and deformed Barbie. 'I had turned myself into a Frankenstein. I looked like a bad drag queen,' she admits. 'When Papaya was born 18 months ago, I was overjoyed. Yet I wouldn't have any photographs taken holding her because I looked so terrible. I couldn't even smile at my new baby.' Alicia wants safeguards put in place and to warn girls plastic surgery is not a cure for emotional distress . She is so shocked that she allowed her addiction to threaten her life that she is now calling for new safeguards to protect women from unscrupulous cosmetic surgeons. Alicia also wants to warn young girls that plastic surgery is not a cure for emotional distress. 'Lots of people think it will make them happy, not understanding that filling their bodies with plastic is not a panacea for whatever insecurities they have,' she says. Best known for her kiss-and-tell affairs with celebrities including music mogul Simon Cowell and actor Mickey Rourke, Alicia says that for most of her adult life she was like a drug addict looking for another fix. 'My obsession has ruined my life.  I spent every penny on cosmetic surgery. I live in a rented apartment. I have nothing to show for all the years when I was earning big money. I'm not in a relationship because no man wants to be with an obsessive who wants to have surgery every week.' As Alicia's addiction grew, she trawled the world for surgeons who would agree to ever more extensive operations. In one botched episode, a nerve on the left side of her face was severed, which locked her face in a frozen stare. Pictured in June 2012, Alicia says her two daughters, Georgia and Papaya made her seek help for a third time . Eventually she was diagnosed as . suffering from a form of body dysmorphia, an obsessive compulsive . disorder which causes victims to become preoccupied with their physical . appearance.She believes an unhappy childhood in Horsham, West . Sussex, with a father who used to call her ugly contributed to her . condition: 'My Barbie doll was my escape and I identified with her so . much that  I wanted to look like her. 'I . had my first breast augmentation as a teenager and became a glamour . model. I was earning £5,000 a month, but I just never believed I was . good-looking enough,' she says. Since . then she has had 71 operations under general anaesthetic alone. 'I've . had so many operations I can't feel my stomach, my left breast, or . anything under my right arm,' she says. 'The only fake thing now is my . 30DD boobs. They will have to stay because I'm not going to let anyone . cut me open again. 'It's like being an alcoholic,' she observes. 'I had to get to the lowest point before I could find my  way out.' Alicia with glamour models Linsey Dawn and Kathy (left) at a party for Front magazine, August 2001 .

"A diner had to be rushed to hospital after eating the toxic liver of a puffer fish in a Michelin two-star restaurant in Tokyo. The restaurant's head chef has been suspended by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for serving the dish at Fugu Fukuji in the capital's upmarket Ginza area. The 35-year-old woman had to be taken to hospital suffering from a headache and numbness in her lips after eating her meal at the restaurant on November 10. Dangerous: Japanese delicacy puffer fish must be prepared carefully before being served . A Japanese health official said: 'The chef served a liver, knowing that it is toxic, even if it was a request from the customer. It should warrant punitive actions'. The woman, who has not been named, recovered after being treated at a local hospital, but the government has temporarily withdrawn the license of chef, Takeshi Yasuge. His license may be revoked for good, he could also e fined and even jailed. A public health official said: 'The chef served a liver knowing that it is toxic, even if it was a request from the customer.' Puffer fish or 'fugu' is an expensive . Japanese delicacy but it must be prepared by specially trained chefs. The trainee chefs have to undergo three years of training and apprenticeship before taking a . test - that only a third are said to pass - before they are qualified to . prepare a fish. Licensed chefs are required to cut out toxic parts of the fish, including the liver and skin before serving it. However, some aficionados ask to be served the banned parts, which are said to be a fine but dangerous delicacy. Two star: Japanese restaurant Fugu Fukuji will retain it's Michelin rating . In 2009, scientists managed to breed a non-lethal species of fugu, however it failed to prove popular in specialist restaurants as purists who enjoy the thrill of eating something potentially dangerous said it ruined the appeal. Historically, chefs who failed to prepare the dish correctly and caused the death of a customer were traditionally bound to commit ritual suicide with their own fish knife. Several fatalities are reported from fugu poisoning every year, although most are of sport fishermen who think they know how to prepare their catch and end up poisoning themselves. Michelin said it does not plan to change its rating of the restaurant, which was based on the dishes its agents ate, a company spokeswoman said. Michelin this week released its latest Red Guide to the Tokyo area, which listed 247 establishments with at least one star. The Japanese capital boasts 16 three-star eateries, six more than Paris.","The 35-year-old woman had to be taken to .

"They have a better squad, a better record and – in keeping with the German reputation for meticulous preparation – they appear to have bagged the best accommodation, too. While England have plumped for an ageing Rio hotel close to a gang-infested slum as their base, the Germans will luxuriate in a  secluded, specially-built £25million resort within easy reach of all their games. Funded jointly by the German FA and private enterprise, the Campo Bahia resort offers beach-facing villas, hot tubs, a 2,000  sq  ft pool area and its own restaurant. The German FA has invested in a purpose built beach-front resort for their team at a cost of £25 million - which will open to the public after the World Cup . The training pitches and media centre are just one mile away. Crucially, the complex – which lies 700 miles north of Rio on the Atlantic coast – offers easy security and is a short ride away from the airport, ensuring that the German players can be delivered to all their games in less than two hours by private  jet. The base will become a commercial resort when the World Cup is over. By contrast, the England team face a journey of between one and two hours to their training ground – an army base – and up to three hours to the international airport from their hotel, the four-star Royal Tulip in Rio. Inside, there is cracked paint, a failing internet service and stained carpets. The £200-a-night hotel was criticised on TripAdvisor by one guest who said: ‘It makes a North Korean prison seem like a dream destination.’ England's hotel is located within view of the Rocinha favela in Rio where armed gangs are being targeted by police . The hotel was named the InterContinental until 2010 when a group of gunmen from a drug gang stormed the lobby, taking 30 guests and staff hostage and killing one woman. A worker said: ‘The hotel was sold and renamed because as you can imagine that incident wasn’t very good for business.’ A staff member at the Tulip said rooms were ‘being renovated’ but added: ‘We have another year and a half to go before the building work is complete.’ When asked if the hotel would be ready in five weeks when the England team are due to arrive he shrugged and said: ‘Look around you, what do you think? We are working very hard to get it ready.’ Inside a room, large brown stains dotted the blue carpet. The bath water took five minutes to run warm and emerged from the tap a dull yellow colour. One note of consolation for the England squad is that the German resort isn’t yet ready, either. While is Arsenal colleagues are stuck in the centre of Rio, Per Mertesacker will be able to enjoy the beach in the German FA's £25 million base 700 miles north of Rio .","German FA develop purpose built resort for their base during the tournament .

"Although the couple’s baby boy is third in line to the throne, he will have a rather rootless existence for the first few months of his life. The Duke and Duchess will, initially, bring their newborn back to Nottingham Cottage, the two-bedroom pied-a-terre in the grounds of Kensington Palace they have lived in for the past two years. Although it has its own small walled garden, the cottage can best be described as cosy and it will only be a temporary arrangement. Scroll down for video . Excitement: Plans are already in place for when the Duchess of Cambridge and her baby boy are allowed to go home . Coming home: Kensington Palace, pictured on Thursday, is in the middle of a refurbishment programme and is covered with scaffolding . For as soon as William returns to work following his two weeks’ statutory paternity leave, Kate plans to depart for her parents’ mansion in Berkshire. She will reside there - on and off -  for the next six weeks, while her husband completes his present tour of duty with the RAF in Anglesey, North Wales. The prince will finish his posting as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley in early September, relocating to London while waiting for his next assignment, meaning the couple can enjoy some quality time together as a new family. Within weeks – by October at the latest - it is hoped that they will finally be able to move into their new official London residence, Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace . Apartment 1A is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and Queen Mary. Home sweet home: Nottingham Cottage, the two-bedroom pied-a-terre circled in red in the grounds of Kensington Palace, will be the baby's first home . Second port of call: Once William is back in Wales with the RAF, his wife  will head to her parents' mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire . Improvements: Apartment 1A, which is covered in scaffolding here, is having £1m worth of public money spent on it to transform it into a home fit for a future king and queen . It boasts generous living space, including five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, staff bedrooms and ‘ancillary’ rooms. Former residents include Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter, and the late monarch’s grandson, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, followed by, most recently, the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon. The couple, who moved in following a £1.5million programme of refurbishment in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ new kitchen (which has since been ripped out) complete with sleek Formica and teak units. It has been barely touched since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, however, and in recent years has been managed by the charity Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which used the apartment as office and exhibition space. As HRP has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work, the Queen was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to William and Kate. This was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is believed to be more than £100,000. Last month it emerged that a further £1million-worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on transforming the apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen. Is it still blue? The Queen's sister Princess Margaret in her drawing room in Kensington Palace. She lived in the flat that will be home for Kate, William and the new baby in October . While William and Kate are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘soft furnishings’ personally (and it is understood that this will include a state-of-the-art new kitchen) all structural work, rewiring, re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally friendly heating and hot water systems, is being met by the government. So far the bill is £600,000 and rising, much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos. A further £400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof. The Duchess, we can also reveal, is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the Queen for the nation, with which to furnish her new home. Historic: A series of royals have lived in flat 1A at Kensington Palace, pictured here in 1960 when Princess Margaret was about to move in . The Collection comprises more than a million objets d’art collected by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years. Although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation, one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘borrow’ items to furnish their private homes. Kate is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases, dining tables and chairs. A palace source argued: ‘It is the same for the Queen and other members of the Royal Family with regards to both their private residences and their offices. The alternative is [that] everything sits in storage.' Contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer, Kate has eschewed offers of professional help and is, it can be revealed, overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office. The Duchess is said to have ‘a real interest in design’ and has been encouraged by her father-in-law, Prince Charles, to ‘stamp her personality’ on the project, albeit using British-sourced, environmentally friendly products as much as possible, naturally. She has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket Chelsea Design Centre in London but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as Peter Jones and John Lewis. ‘It’s a big task but she’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it,’ says an aide. Although aides working for the Duke and Duchess admit the works being carried out at Kensington Palace are ‘extensive’, they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘bare minimum’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately. ‘Currently, the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation,’  said one. ‘The cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the Royal Family privately. ‘The couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum.’ The spokesman added: ‘It is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon moved into the apartment, following their marriage in 1960.‘ . Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Queen has offered the Cambridges the use of Anmer Hall, a Georgian mansion which is part of her private Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, as a country retreat. Royal advisers have already pushed through a series of planning applications relating to the property, largely to ensure its new royal inhabitants have maximum privacy.","Couple will take their newborn boy to Kensington Palace for first fortnight .

"The first woman bishop in the UK and Ireland has been installed by the Anglican Church. The Rev Pat Storey, 53, former rector of St Augustine's in Derry, made history when she was chosen by the Church of Ireland as the new Bishop of Meath and Kildare. The married mother of two was ordained at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin during a service led by the Archbishop of Dublin, The Most Rev Dr Michael Jackson. Consecration: The bishop of Meath and Kildare the Most Revd Pat Storey (left) receives a bible from the Archbishop of Dublin, the Most Revd Dr Michael Jackson (right) The Rev Nigel Parker, guest preacher, paid tribute to her. 'Pat, it has been our privilege over the years to see you respond to our Father's love with love, trust and obedience,' he said to Bishop Storey during the service. 'You have given yourself whole-heartedly to Him and His Church, serving His people as a deacon and priest - teaching the Scriptures and pastoring with that disarming directness, which is your hallmark - a directness, which speaks the truth in love, with a ready laugh and delightful sense of humour. History maker: Pat Storey is the first woman Anglican bishop in the UK and Ireland . 'You have demonstrated your love for the Father in your hard work, impeccable organisation and evangelistic heart, which longs to see people come into the family of God, through the completed work of Jesus Christ. 'You have shown your care and thoughtfulness to many, not least your family, Earl, Carolyn and Luke, and to us, your friends. 'So today, it is our privilege to pray for you, as the Lord Jesus calls you to a deeper life of sacrificial service, calls you to consecrate yourself to Him, His Church and His cause.' Bishop Storey is married to the Rev Earl Storey - who gave a reading during the service - and they have two adult children Luke, 22, and Carolyn, 25, and son-in-law Peter. She grew up in Belfast and studied French and English at Trinity College, Dublin, before training at the Church of Ireland Theological College. She was ordained a deacon in 1997 and a priest the following year, serving a curacy in Ballymena, a team vicar in Glenavy, and as a part-time youth worker co-ordinator. Bishop Storey was rector of St Augustine's in Derry since 2004 until her appointment was passed by the House of Bishops in September, four months after the Episcopal Electoral College had failed to elect a successor. At the time she said she was 'excited and daunted' by the historic appointment. She has taken over from Dr Richard Clarke, who was appointed Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland last December. The bishop-elect Pat Storey (middle) is pictured with the Bishop of Cork, Cloyne and Ross, Paul Colton (left), the Archbishop of Armagh, Richard Clarke (second left), the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Michael Jackson (second right) and the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Ken Good (right) After the service Bishop Storey said she was still getting her head around making history. 'It's great to be the first woman and it's great to be a bishop, I hadn't expected it at all,' she told RTE. 'I'm sort of getting my head around the fact that it's a history-making thing. 'But I'm very happy to be here. It was a lovely service.' Her husband added that he was incredibly proud and thrilled for his wife and for the future.","The Reverend Pat Storey, 53, is a married mother of two .

"Two early casts from Auguste Rodin's masterpiece The Gates of Hell have sold for a total of more than $16 million (£10.3m) at a New York City auction. The Thinker sold last night for $15.3 million (£9.8m), a new record for the figure beating a price of $12 million for a casting sold in 2010. There are more than two dozen castings of the statue, although the most famous, in bronze, is at a Paris museum. Big spenders: Two early casts from Auguste Rodin's masterpiece 'The Gates of Hell' have sold for a total of more than $16 million at a New York City auction . Sotheby's has not revealed the identity of the buyer. The full-scale sculpture was commissioned by publishing magnate Ralph Pulitzer in 1906 and made under Rodin's supervision. It had belonged at different times to publisher Ralph Pulitzer and the late CBS Chief Executive William Paley.

'The Kiss,' from 1909, did not sell. The $230 million tally for the auction came close was $100 million short of last year's when Edvard Munch’s The Scream sold for $120 million. 'It was a difficult act to follow,' said Simon Shaw, head of Sotheby’s Impressionist and modern art department in New York told Bloomberg. Meanwhile a French painting owned by Madonna has sold at a New York City auction for more than $7 million. Sotheby's auction house hasn't said who bought Fernand Leger's Three Women at the Red Table for $7.2 million on Tuesday. The abstract work had a pre-sale estimate of $5 million to $7 million. Proceeds of the sale will benefit the Ray of Light Foundation, which supports girls' education in Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries. Madonna says she wanted to 'trade something valuable for something invaluable' in countries where female education is rare or nonexistent. She bought the work at Sotheby's in 1990 for $3.4 million.

"Australia's top-rating AFL commentator Dennis Cometti has announced he will hang up the boots at the end of the 2016  season. The man many regard as the 'soothing voice' of AFL said he will not look to extend his time as a caller beyond 2016, because of age, and because he believes television networks won't be interested in offering him a new contract. Cometti, 65, said that the AFL and its broadcasters will look to take a new direction in 2017 when the new television rights deal is signed. AFL commentator Dennis Cometti, pictured alongside 'good friend' Bruce McAvaney will retire from calling the game at the end of 2016 . 'I'm 65 now and I can't imagine doing it beyond the current agreement. That'll be the end for me, I'd say,' he told The Herald Sun. In a career spanning almost 40 years, Cometti  mastered the art of commentating down to a tee. Unlike some of his colleagues who raise their voice for affect, Cometti has a softer, smoother tone which is much easier to distinguish from other commentators in the game. It's even been said he has the soothing manner of a dentist when speaking behind the microphone. The former player-turned-commentator played for West Perth in the WAFL and Footscray in the then-VFL, and coached briefly before he turned to a career in sports media. Dennis Cometti was regarded in various public polls as the game's best AFL commentator . He started calling for the Seven Network In 1986 and shortly after became one of the highest profile commentators in the game. In an interview on his impending retirement with The Herald Sun, the 65-year-old said he has never borrowed from other commentators and has never been drawn in to using cliche sporting phrases. 'I try to avoid other people's cliches. If I can think of a few of my own, I just use those.' Various public polls have pitted him against other callers to decide the game's best, and more often than not Cometti comes out on top. He said he never borrowed lines from other commentators and did not use cliches . When asked about a public poll which revealed he was the sport's most popular commentator during the 2014 season, Commetti replied: 'It's certainly better than the alternative.' 'When people (in the street) approach me they are fantastic.' 'There have been only one or two bad experiences over the years.' But none of those he has shared with long-time friend and legendary AFL commentator Bruce McAvaney, who he has called alongside for years. 'There has never been a harsh word between us. We are good friends.' When Channel Seven regained the rights to broadcast AFL games starting from 2007,  it was announced a year earlier that Cometti had re-signed on the basis that he was to commentate alongside McAvaney. As a player Commetti played in the WAFL and VFL for West Perth and Footscray. He said the toll of travelling interstate most weekends and staying in hotel rooms was the biggest factor in influencing his decision to quit. 'It's not the football, it's the travel,' the Perth resident said. 'I've worked out that I've spent five years of my life in a hotel. Age does come into it.'","Dennis Cometti will retire from commentating at the end of 2016 season .
