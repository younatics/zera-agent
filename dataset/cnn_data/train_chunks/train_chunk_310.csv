"Anbar province, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's vice president issued a decree Thursday calling for parliament to meet next week to start the process of creating a new government as the Iraqi military battles Sunni extremist militants. Vice President Khader al Khuzaei, acting on behalf of Iraq's President, made the directive amid calls for political action to tackle sectarian tensions that have fueled violence as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, advances toward Baghdad. On Thursday evening, seven people were killed and 36 others injured in an explosion in the capital's northern neighborhood of Kadimiyah, Iraqi police told CNN. There were conflicting reports about whether a suicide bomber or car bomb was responsible. In a televised speech this week, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki vowed to stick to a Tuesday deadline to begin creating a new government. But the Iraqi leader also spent time in Wednesday's TV address accusing Sunnis of ""coordinating"" the crisis. Al-Maliki accused Sunnis of collaborating with ISIS and blasted a call to have a national salvation government that would remove him from power. He also appealed to Shiites by saying he is adhering to the wishes of Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, the religious leader who called for volunteers to support the Iraqi army and government. Many have accused al-Maliki of marginalizing Iraq's Sunni and Kurd minorities in favor of his fellow Shiites. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday played down al-Maliki's rejection of a salvation government, saying it wasn't something the United States had talked to him about specifically. To the contrary, he said, al-Maliki is committed to the electoral process and creation of a new government that the United States has supported. ""And he (is) committed to moving forward with the constitutional processes of government formation, and that is precisely what the United States was encouraging,"" Kerry said. ""He also called on all Iraqis to put aside their differences, to unite in their efforts against terrorism."" After talks Thursday in Paris with his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, Kerry said the two agreed they want to see the formation of an Iraqi government ""as rapidly as possible that represents unity for the country."" Kerry said he and the French diplomat are also deeply concerned about the challenge of Syria. Fabius said that ISIS had shown ""terrible ferocity and brutality"" and that Iraq must unite to combat it. ""It's a necessity not only for Iraq but the whole region. Because it's a menace for Iraq, for the region, for Europe and the United States as well,"" he said. Kerry will meet Friday in Saudi Arabia with Syrian opposition leader Ahmad Jarba, a senior State Department official said Thursday. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague, on a visit to Baghdad on Thursday, also urged the swift formation of an inclusive government, saying Iraqi political leaders must put sectarian division aside. ""The Iraqi state is facing an existential threat, with huge ramifications for the future stability and freedom of this country,"" he said. ""The single most important factor that will determine whether or not Iraq overcomes this challenge is political unity."" Hague said this would be the focus of his discussions with al-Maliki and Kurdish regional leader Masoud Barzani. Syrian radicals 'brainwash' kidnapped Kurdish schoolchildren . Syrian incursion? Iraqi special forces continued assaulting militant positions at the University of Tikrit Thursday, according to state TV reports. The troops killed 40 militants, according to the state TV, which also carried a report of an Iraqi airstrike on a presidential palace complex in Tikrit. That strike -- among 108 such strikes nationwide in recent days, according to state TV -- reportedly killed 70 militants. The military also said it had ""complete control"" of the Baiji oil refinery, the scene of tough fighting in recent days. On Thursday CNN obtained video of people apparently fleeing Karakosh, a predominately Christian town in Iraq near Mosul. Shelling by ISIS was reported there and in other areas near the city of Hamdaniya. CNN has been told that thousands of Christians began escaping Wednesday, and started to arrive in Irbil Thursday seeking shelter in churches and vacant buildings. Reports that Syrian warplanes carried out a cross-border attack this week on Iraqi towns is further evidence of the blurring of borders as the two countries face an offensive by Islamic extremists. At least 57 Iraqi civilians were killed and more than 120 others were wounded Tuesday in what local officials said were strikes by Syrian warplanes in border areas of western Anbar province. These border cities are among those under the control of ISIS, which seeks to create an Islamic caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria. Maps: How to understand the crisis . Sabah Karkhout, head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN that Tuesday's air attacks struck markets and fuel stations in areas such as Rutba, al-Walid and Qaim. Karkhout said the warplanes bore the image of the Syrian flag. ""Also, the planes flew directly from Syrian airspace and went back to Syria,"" he said. Syrian state media called the reports of a cross-border incursion ""completely baseless."" CNN is seeking a response from the Syrian government. Iraq's border region has been targeted by Syria in the past. As the Syrian conflict escalated in 2012, rockets fired from Syria landed in Qaim in at least one instance. It's uncertain whether this week's strikes signify a concerted effort by Syria to intensify its fight against ISIS. It is also not clear whether the strikes in Iraq were a unilateral action by Syria or were coordinated with the Iraqi government. Iran is also thought to be involved in the conflict. A U.S. official told CNN that Iran is flying surveillance drones over Iraq. It's not known from where they are being launched. Tehran also is thought to be providing small arms and ammunition to Iraq as well as providing intelligence to al-Maliki's government, the official said. Is Baghdad ready for an ISIS attack? In Baghdad, the Iraqi military insists it's ready to beat back ISIS if the fighters reach the capital. According to U.S. estimates, ISIS may have as many as 10,000 fighters in Syria and Iraq, but it's not clear where those forces all are. Soldiers deployed in Anbar province, just 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the center of Baghdad, told CNN that the army would not collapse here -- as it did in Mosul to the north -- and that they were ready to fight to the end. The soldiers said they had chased ISIS out of a tiny Sunni village, killing 32 militants while losing three of their own. Fresh Shiite graffiti was sprayed on storefronts in the now-deserted village. A tank commander, a Shiite from south of Baghdad, said, ""The terrorists will lose the battle with us because they are chicky-chicken."" He denied the Iraqi army had turned tail and run in the north of the country. ""No, no, the army is strong,"" he said. ""Never afraid. I die in this country.""

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- One day after Syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo, opposition groups said another 151 people had been killed in the fighting Thursday. The majority of those deaths occurred in the Syrian capital of Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Another 34 were killed in Aleppo, where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred. The 20-month civil war has claimed more than 42,000 lives, according to the latest tally from the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. The group counts 3,133 government soldiers among the dead. And the bloodletting has since carried on unabated while also threatening regional stability. On Wednesday, 15 people died in the strike on a building next to the Dar al-Shifa Hospital, including two children and a doctor. Ralib al-Omar, a leader of the Yusif al-Asma rebel group, said the strike had targeted the hospital and that the dead included two nurses. A doctor was among the dead -- one of 40 people killed in Aleppo on Wednesday and 113 across the country. Dar al-Shifa is one of the main sources of medical help for people in Syria's commercial hub. In video posted by opposition activists, the blast appeared to have affected the hospital's often-crowded front lobby. Amanpour blog: U.S. has no plan for Syria . Protests first broke out against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in March 2011. Al-Assad responded by turning the army and police on the demonstrations. The government-owned Syrian Arab News Agency reported a series of clashes between security forces and ""armed terrorist groups,"" while intense fighting near the Syrian-Turkish border in recent weeks has pitted loyalist Syrian forces against the rebel Free Syrian Army. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. In a sign of a potential escalation of the conflict, Turkey asked its NATO allies for Patriot missiles Wednesday to bolster its air defenses against its southern neighbor. A letter to NATO included the ""formal request"" that the alliance send ""air defense elements,"" according to a Turkish government statement that cited ""the threats and risks posed by the continuing crisis in Syria to our national security."" The statement added that the NATO Council would convene ""shortly"" to consider the matter. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a Twitter post that the request would be considered without delay. Israel puts trust in Iron Dome . Rasmussen said the letter from Turkey requested Patriot missiles that would ""contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis along NATO's south-eastern border"" and serve as ""a concrete demonstration of alliance solidarity and resolve."" His statement said three NATO countries have available Patriot missiles -- Germany, the Netherlands and the United States -- and it would be up to them to decide if they can deploy them and for how long. A NATO team will visit Turkey next week to survey possible deployment sites for the missiles, Rasmussen's statement said. Sources told CNN that Germany would be the likely source for a deployment. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that any decision involving her country would need the approval of Parliament. Syrian conflict a factor in Israeli election . In Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Selcuk Unal said NATO forces under the command of the alliance would come to Turkey as part of the missile deployment. He noted that NATO-supplied Patriot missiles previously were deployed in Turkey in 1991 and 2003. ""It's not as if they are going to come tomorrow to be deployed,"" Unal said, calling the move a precautionary measure that will deter escalation along the Syrian border. International and Turkish media reported earlier this month that Turkey planned to ask NATO to station Patriot missiles along the border with Syria, but Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan denied it at the time. Turkey has been careful to make clear it plans no offensive action and does not want a war with Syria, which shares a more than 500-mile border. Turkish President Abdullah Gul told reporters November 8 that while going to war with Syria was ""out of the question,"" precautions were needed against ""ballistic missiles as well as mid-range and near-range missiles."" The U.S.-made Patriot missile system -- which became well known during the first Gulf War in the early 1990s when it protected American allies against Iraqi Scud missiles -- works well against short- and medium-range missiles. Last month, Syrian artillery shells hit the Turkish border town of Akcakale, killing five Turkish citizens. Soon after, the Turkish Parliament approved a resolution that would allow the military to carry out cross-border incursions. Since then, Turkish forces have retaliated swiftly with artillery after more than a dozen cross-border artillery strikes believed to have been carried out by the Syrian military. Once-cozy relations between Syria and Turkey have all but collapsed since the Syrian uprising began last year. Turkey is officially hosting more than 111,000 Syrian refugees, but the Turkish government says tens of thousands of unofficial refugees also live in Turkish cities and towns near the Syrian border. Meanwhile, Damascus has repeatedly accused its former ally of meddling in internal Syrian affairs by funding and arming the Syrian opposition, as well as providing sanctuary and medical care to Syrian rebels. CNN's Susannah Palk, Gul Tuysuz, Tom Cohen, Richard Greene and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: By Thursday, another 76 people had been killed in the fighting, opposition groups say .

"(CNN) -- Eight years ago, the Democratic presidential candidates had the luxury of running against George W. Bush. Their main foreign-policy message was that they were different from the incumbent: They were against the war in Iraq; against the way Bush was conducting the war on terrorism; against his unilateral approach to world affairs. In 2016, things will be different. The candidates will have to be much more careful about distancing themselves from President Obama's policies. While they will be able to critique him and highlight how they would try do better, they will also face great pressure to outline their own visions for their future. The task won't be easy, since the Democratic Party is not all on the same page. While philosophical fractures within the GOP are well-known -- among neo-isolationists like Sen. Rand Paul and hawkish conservatives like Sen. John McCain -- there are also deep divisions and tensions within the Democratic Party that candidates will have to sort out. A number of foreign-policy agendas have taken shape among the Democrats, and all are likely to be part of the debate in the primary season. There are the liberal internationalists, arguably the most dominant voice among Democrats. They include the President, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry, who believe that the United States must remain active overseas to maintain global order and protect American interests. Liberal internationalists believe that it is essential to work through international institutions like NATO or the United Nations rather than to go it alone. They accept the need for military force, but also insist on the use of diplomacy and economic sanctions. Another pillar of liberal internationalism is that public sacrifice is needed when the nation goes to war, through higher taxes, volunteerism or, in earlier times, a draft. There is also a strong anti-war faction that has been a central part of Democratic politics since the 1960s. For these Democrats, who are based primarily in the grass roots rather than among Washington elites, military force should be used only under the most extreme circumstances. They tend to distrust what elected and military officials say when justifying the use of force, always remembering the lies of Vietnam. This world view posits that military force is very often a poor method for handling international problems and creates more problems than it is worth. This view rarely finds mainstream candidates, since these arguments play into conservative claims that Democrats are weak on defense. But occasionally their voice is heard. In 2004, Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont made this argument about Iraq. Today, some wonder whether possible candidates like Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts might position themselves that way. Finally, there are the liberal hawks. This faction has been much less vocal since the negative fallout from President Bush's war in Iraq but still lurks in the party. Liberal hawks are more open than their colleagues to the use of military force, even unilaterally, and less concerned about national sacrifice. The tradition was made famous by Washington Sen. Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, who in the 1970s was among the most prominent ""neo-conservatives."" Today some observers see Democrats who could succeed Jackson like New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez. ""So my friends on the left need to understand,"" he said, ""that it is the world as it is, not as we wish it to be."" With the chaos overseas growing in cases such as Russian aggression and the rise of a so-called Islamic state, they could become more of a force once again in the campaign. Candidates won't have to choose one side or another, since most politicians don't fit neatly into one category. But they will need to navigate carefully as they craft their message and figure out ways to develop a platform that can bring together as much of the party as possible. Some possible candidates, such as Hillary Clinton and former Virginia Sen. James Webb, have an eclectic record that could enable them to appeal to multiple constituencies. The best candidates will be the one who can offer a coherent and powerful vision of what the United States and the world should be as we enter into this period.","Julian Zelizer: Dems can't run against Bush foreign policy in 2016, must have own vision .

"(CNN) -- As a swimmer, his countless hours of training paid off handsomely -- earning him a record 18 Olympic gold medals. As a golfer, Michael Phelps is wondering what he's got himself into. ""It's one of the most humbling games I've tried to do in my entire life,"" the American tells CNN. ""I could always pick things up fairly easily, but I don't get how hitting a little object -- a little white ball, that isn't moving -- is so hard. ""Why can't I just hit this in a straight line? Or hook it, or draw it, or fade it -- I can't do it. I'm finally learning how to be able to do all that stuff and do it consistently. But I still do have some pretty bad shots."" Have a quick look online and you'll find Phelps hurling his driver away in disgust after embarrassingly topping his tee shot at the home of golf, St. Andrews in Scotland. ""Throwing clubs, using profanity -- everything comes out,"" Phelps says. But there are some moments of magic, such as when -- as a 26 handicapper -- he sank a monster 150-foot putt at the Dunhill Links pro-am in Scotland last October. However, golf requires both power and precision -- which Phelps, who was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder as a child, is slowly learning to combine. ""He's one of those players that people would look at and say, 'He has a lot of potential.' What that technically means is that the player is very long and very wild,"" says Tiger Woods' former coach Hank Haney, who has been tutoring Phelps in the latest series of his television show The Haney Project. ""They never look at someone who hits it a very short distance and say, 'Oh you've got a lot of potential.' They always comment on the potential someone has as based solely on the distance of their hitting."" Haney has some history in shaping unpredictable talents, having previously worked with former basketballer Charles Barkley and boxer Sugar Ray Leonard among his celebrity TV clients. ""Michael is 6'4 but he has a 6'8 wingspan, so his arms are very long. Because of that he has a pretty long, loose swing,"" Haney tells CNN. ""It's capable of generating a lot of power ... That's been the biggest challenge, to get his swing better so he can control it a bit."" Haney says Phelps is ""definitely getting better"" after carding true hackers' scores of between 97 and 117 in six rounds immediately after the London 2012 Olympics -- where he took his career tally to a record 22 medals. ""His No. 1 goal after the Olympics was to learn how to play golf and be decent at it,"" Haney says. ""I think he's passionate about it. It's nice to have someone like Michael Phelps interested in the game, it's great for golf."" ""Baltimore Bullet"" Golf is not only giving the 27-year-old Phelps a new hobby (if not quite a new career) -- it is also extending his commercial sell-by date. While he's not in the $250 million league that Nike reportedly paid to sign up golf's new star Rory McIlroy, the ""Baltimore Bullet"" has already landed a club deal with Ping. ""Ping is a well-established global brand that should be able to deliver Phelps with huge international exposure,"" says British sports business expert Simon Chadwick. ""Phelps, meanwhile, provides Ping with a brand association that has a strong track-record of success at the very highest level. ""That said, this is a somewhat strange alliance that would be appear to be fraught with difficulty. It doesn't make instant sense, and quite what the tangible returns will be to both parties isn't necessarily obvious. ""If there is no expectation that Phelps will become a professional golfer, the Ping deal tends rather to imply that this is short-term opportunism -- unless, of course, the relaunch and rebranding of Phelps as a global sport or leisure brand starts here. ""If the Phelps brand in golf is to have any sustainable future, he needs to start delivering the kind of performances that fans and consumers will be looking for."" Chinese 12 year-old to make history . Haney doubts that Phelps will be able to make it as a pro golfer, citing the very few examples of sports stars who've been able to switch to the game -- and most of those have been on the seniors circuit. ""The possibility is there, but golf seems to take more time than any other sport -- there's so much to learn and so much to practice. You have to dedicate full-time to golf to get there,"" Haney says. ""It's a big difference between being a scratch golfer or two handicap and being a professional golfer. It's a whole other world,"" Haney adds when asked about the golfing prospects of retired tennis star Andy Roddick, who like Phelps has been hitting the celebrity pro-am circuit. New adventure . And Phelps sounds like he's enjoying his retirement too much to dedicate himself to the same punishing routine that saw him not miss a 6.30 a.m training session for six years -- as Haney was informed by his protege's former swim coach. ""I've been saying a lot more recently about how great it is to be retired,"" says Phelps. ""I can wake up at 10 in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, read the newspaper. ""If I feel like hitting a couple of golf balls, I hit some golf balls. I really just hang out, and it's awesome. ""At this point I'm really just trying to enjoy the sport, learn the sport, and be able to beat all of my friends who I go out and play with."" However, Haney is in no doubt that Phelps is committed to his new adventure. ""The crossover is the work ethic that he has -- he knows what it takes to be great in sports,"" the 57-year-old coach says. ""He's used to being coached, that makes it easier for me. In golf you have to be coached, no-one just knows how to do it. In order for that to happen, you like to have someone that's used to taking coaching."" For someone who has coached 14-time major winner Woods, the goals of a novice like Phelps (""He's thinking pro-ams and playing amateur golf. He'd love to win a club championship one day"") bring Haney back full circle in his career. ""Tiger was my last student and I had determined that when I started with Tiger, I said he's going to be the last touring pro that I have,"" says Haney, who wrote a book detailing his six years working with the biggest name in modern golf. ""I taught touring pros for 32 years and I enjoyed it. It was incredible, a lot of great experiences, but 32 years was enough for me -- I taught over 200 touring pros. It was time for me to do something different. And where do you go from Tiger Woods?"" Twitter tips . Apart from his TV show, Haney is now focused on his corporate work, his International Junior Golf Academy based at Hilton Head, South Carolina -- and taking the game to the people. ""Golf's been awful good to me, I have no problems doing that, I'm very thankful to the game of golf,"" says Haney, who is an active presence on Twitter, giving away tips to anyone who contacts him -- much to the chagrin of some of his peers. ""Last year I did clinics for over 15,000 people, so I feel like through Twitter and doing the clinics I'm much more able to reach a larger audience and giving back to the game a little bit. ""I enjoy being a top instructor who is willing and able to do those things."" He says his junior academy, which has almost 150 students from 22 countries, is not necessarily seeking to unearth the next Tiger Woods. ""I'm really proud of the fact that the kids don't just learn golf but they have a great education. Every kid from our academy last year went to college, 94% of them got scholarships. I really enjoy seeing how much they grow as people from being in our academy.""","Record-breaking Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps is trying to become a golfer .

"Pixley, California (CNN) -- In ""the nation's salad bowl,"" as California's Central Valley is often called, fresh produce grows in abundance. But for many area residents, healthy food is out of reach. ""Here we are in this agriculturally rich area and yet people who live here and work here are hungry, are impoverished,"" said Sarah Ramirez, an educator who grew up in the area. ""(Some) are working in the fields that feed the entire country and then they don't have the resources to support them and their health. It's heartbreaking."" For the last two years, Ramirez has been on a mission to build a healthier community in her impoverished hometown of Pixley. She and her husband launched Be Healthy Tulare, a grass-roots movement to collect produce that would otherwise go to waste and get it to neighbors in need. The group is named for the county where Pixley is located. ""Looking outside and seeing trees just loaded with fruit, I was just feeling like, why aren't we connecting these pieces?"" Ramirez said. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2014 CNN Heroes . Twice a month, Ramirez and volunteers gather fruit and vegetables from farms and backyard trees. They glean from growers and residents who contact them about their excess produce. The group then provides the bounty to a local food bank that distributes it to families in need. So far this year, Ramirez said, she and her group have collected and donated 20,000 pounds of produce. Connecting the dots . Growing up the daughter of farm workers, Ramirez watched her family's health suffer. ""In my own family I have witnessed young family members die of preventable diseases,"" she said. While she was attending college in northern California, she began working at a free health clinic in Sacramento. ""I realized that the illnesses and conditions I was seeing there were not that different from what I saw at home. And I began to ask ... why."" In Tulare County, 73% of adults are either overweight or obese, according to a recent California Health Interview Survey. Many community members do not own a vehicle or have easy access to public transportation, Ramirez said. The result: People are not getting the quality foods that often grow nearby. ""There isn't a full service grocery store that provides the best and most wholesome food at affordable prices here in the community,"" Ramirez said. While working toward her master's degree and, ultimately, her Ph.D., Ramirez worked part-time as Tulare County's epidemiologist. With a background in public health and cultural studies, she saw the link between food insecurity and the high rates of obesity and diabetes. ""I've talked to a lot of people who end up being referred to me ... because they have chronic diseases or their children have chronic diseases,"" Ramirez said. ""I lost count of how many 4-year-olds (I was) seeing with high cholesterol or how many people (came) in due to obesity. I've had moments in the clinic where I have people literally cry because they tell me they can't afford to eat well or eat healthy."" When Ramirez set out to help her community, she gathered residents and asked them for their input. By involving them in her efforts, she aims to instill hope and dignity. ""We wanted to start a project where the community sees the value of their own experiences,"" she said. A community of change . In addition to salvaging produce, residents learn how to live a healthy life. The group runs a community garden, a fitness program and nutrition classes that Ramirez calls ""food labs."" ""This is an educational opportunity to find out how to use foods we grow in the garden,"" she said. ""I like to have community members offer their own recipes. I welcome the community to teach as well. We want everyone to feel involved."" Adults and children participate in the food labs, and generations of families get involved. ""Grandma will bring a potluck, and the rest of the family -- and community -- will enjoy the meal,"" Ramirez said. For Ramirez, it's about creating a sense of belonging and purpose in her community. ""It's not about us looking for someone else to come in and save these communities,"" she said. ""It's how we recognize that the people here already matter, that they have value.""

"(CNN) -- A Bahrain court sentenced prominent activist Nabeel Rajab to three years in prison ""for participating in illegal rallies and gatherings,"" a government spokesman said Thursday. ""You can jail me for three years or 30 years, but I will not back down or retreat,"" Rajab said after his sentence was read in a court, according to the Bahrain Center for Human Rights. Rajab is that group's president. The sentence raised concerns from British and European Union officials who called for Bahrain to reconsider its length. Rajab already was serving a three-month sentence for posting a Twitter message critical of Bahrain's prime minister last month, his lawyer, Mohammed Al-Jishi, said. ""Rajab's participation in these marches and provocation of his supporters have led to severe acts of violence; including fueled rioting, road blocking, arson, acts of sabotage targeting public and private properties, the use of petrol bombs and IEDs, amongst others,"" said a statement from the president's office of the Kingdom of Bahrain. ""The Ministry of Interior announced such acts have caused injuries to over 700 security force members."" Rajab's lawyer told CNN he would file an appeal of the sentence after the end of Ramadan holiday next week. ""The only reason for targeting Rajab is to prevent him from continuing his legitimate and peaceful human rights work,"" the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said in a statement Thursday. The country is ruled by the Al-Khalifa family, which has been in power since the 18th century. Many protesters are calling for the removal of the royal family, whom they blame for the country's high unemployment rate and for running a corrupt government that relies on torture and other harsh measures to clamp down on dissent. On March 20, about 25 people in about a dozen cars pulled up to Rajab's house and took him to the offices of the Interior Ministry's investigative department. There, according to Rajab, he was beaten, blindfolded and interrogated about an armed suspect they believed he knew. Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy anchors its Fifth Fleet, is a small, predominantly Shiite country governed by a Sunni royal family. Amnesty International's Deputy Middle East and North Africa Program Director Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui called the sentencing ""a dark day for justice in Bahrain that further questions the independence of the judiciary."" ""Like many others in Bahrain, Nabeel Rajab is a prisoner of conscience, jailed solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly,"" Sahraoui said. ""He should be released immediately and his convictions and sentences quashed. The authorities must also act to ensure that all human rights defenders are able to carry out their work without fear of reprisal."" ""If anything, this latest verdict marks the end of the facade of reform in Bahrain. The international community can no longer be under the illusion that Bahrain is on the path of reform when confronted with such blatant ruthless tactics of suppressing dissenting voices. Bahrain's international partners need to make this loud and clear to the Bahraini authorities"" Amnesty International also released a comment from Rajab's wife, Sumaya, who was with him at the reading of the verdict. ""The sentence, although harsh and unfair, comes as no surprise to Nabeel and I,"" she said. ""It shows how biased and corrupt the judiciary in Bahrain is. There are no human rights in Bahrain. As the defense team said, this sentence is the biggest scandal in the history of Bahrain judiciary."" The British Foreign Office raised concern about the length of the prison sentence and urged the Bahraini government ""to act proportionately in all cases."" ""The right of individuals to peaceful protest and freedom of expression is a fundamental part of any modern democracy and must be respected,"" the British statement said. ""But we expect opposition activists to ensure their words and actions do not incite violence or other illegal acts."" The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton said Rajab's sentence should ""be reconsidered in the appeal process and that the same treatment will be given to all Bahraini citizens who are being tried for charges relating to the exercise of their fundamental freedoms."" ""Fair and impartial justice is a key requirement to overcome the current challenges in Bahrain,"" Ashton said. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali and Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","NEW: ""You can jail me for three years or 30 years, but I will not back down,"" Nabeel Rajab says .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen people have died so far from the Ebola outbreak that began earlier this month in Western Uganda. According to the World Health Organization, the first case is believed to be from the Nyanswiga village in Nyamarunda, a sub-county of the Kibaale district of Uganda. So far, 36 suspected cases have been reported, WHO spokesman Tariq Jasarevic said Tuesday. Nine of the deaths are reported to have occurred in one household; a health official who was treating one of the patients also died. Unfortunately family members and health officials - those caring for the already sickened - are the most likely to be infected as well. When was Ebola first discovered? The Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The virus is named after a river in that country, where the first outbreak of the disease was found. There are five species of Ebola viruses, all named after the areas they were found in: Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bundibugyo and Reston, according to the WHO. (There can be different strains of Ebola within each species). Health officials have determined that the Sudan species is the culprit in this current outbreak, which is among the three more lethal species of Ebola. The fatality ratios of Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Africa are between 25% and 90%, according to a WHO fact sheet. So far only the Reston species of Ebola has been found to infect humans and not cause serious illness or death. What are the symptoms of Ebola and is there a cure? Initial symptoms of Ebola can be mistaken for other illnesses like the flu because they can be very similar: sudden high fever, joint and muscle pain and sore throat. But Ebola victims then often get bloody diarrhea and/or start vomiting, followed by rashes, red eyes, and internal and external bleeding (bloody nose or gums). Early reports from this outbreak suggest more patients were suffering from vomiting and diarrhea than visible external bleeding. But health officials caution that information about this outbreak is still very scattered and the investigation has just begun. There is no treatment for Ebola and no vaccine. All doctors can do is provide patients with supportive care, like replenishing fluids and electrolytes, keeping their blood pressure and oxygen levels in check and treating any infections that might occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control. There's a lot that's not known about this disease, but researchers suspect that ""patients who die usually have not developed a significant immune response to the virus at the time of death,"" according to a CDC fact sheet. How does it spread? Researchers do not know what the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus is. But they have found its cousin virus - Marburg, which also causes hemorrhagic fever - in fruit bats in Africa. While there are no known cases of a human being directly infected with Ebola by a bat, sources tell CNN, there are two documented cases of humans being infected with the Marburg virus after being in a cave full of fruit bats. However, researchers believe humans are infected either by handling of dead or alive infected animals (like chimpanzees, gorillas and forest antelopes), or by being in direct close contact with someone who is sick with or has already died from Ebola. The virus can be found in bodily fluids like blood, urine, diarrhea and saliva, so direct contact with these fluids from infected humans or animals, can lead to the transmission. People can also become infected by coming into contact bodily secretions found on needles, scalpels, soiled clothes and linens. Can Ebola be contained? Once an outbreak has been identified, the transmission of the virus can be prevented, if proper precautions are taken. Avoiding contact with body fluids from someone sickened with Ebola is key. That means wearing proper personal protection equipment like gloves, gowns, masks and eye protection. Hospitals will also set up isolation wards to isolate Ebola patients from other patients. Officials tell CNN that while those caring for the actively sick need to wear PPE (personal protection equipment), someone walking through a village where a patient was sick wouldn't need to wear a mask because the virus isn't airborne. Could this outbreak spread to the U.S. or other distant countries? Experts think it's unlikely the current outbreak would spread to the United States. While the only example of transmission of Ebola in the United States came with the importation of research monkeys (no humans were sickened), there was a situation four years ago where two tourists traveling in Uganda were infected with Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Both patients returned to their home countries, according to the CDC. One survived and the other died, but nobody else was infected because proper protections were taken during treatment. When is an outbreak considered 'finished'? The incubation period for Ebola is two to 21 days, according to the WHO. Health officials tell CNN an outbreak is considered to be over following two incubation periods after the last person becomes ill - a total of 42 days.","36 suspected cases have been reported, WHO spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Germany's demolition of World Cup hosts Brazil in their Tuesday semifinal in Belo Horizonte is the game that seemingly everyone can't stop talking about. The match generated nearly five million social mentions -- close to seven times as many mentions as the other semi between Argentina and the Netherlands -- according to CNN's Facebook Pulse, which has been charting social media interest in the tournament. ""Facebook generally sees a large amount of conversation around sporting events, but the World Cup has proven to be a unique moment,"" said a Facebook spokesman. Brazil might have gone out of the World Cup in ignominious fashion but the hosts can take some consolation from the fact that they invariably generated the most social media interest regarding the teams that took part. Brazil never failed to fall below below 400,000 social mentions for each game it played.. Brazil's star player Neymar, who was ruled out of the defeat by Germany due to a serious back injury, was by far the most talked about player of the tournament with 33 million social mentions -- seven million more than Lionel Messi, who helped guide Argentina to the final. Ahead of Sunday's final, Germany's Thomas Muller is the most talked about German player with 2.7 million mentions, many of which came after his hat-trick against Ronaldo's Portugal in their opening group stage game. American Tim Howard was the most talked about keeper with over two million mentions, more than a million more mentions than German keeper Manuel Neuer. Despite their poor performance which saw them exit in the group stages, England is second only to Brazil in the number of of social mentions, with over 10 million interactions.","Brazil's 7-1 defeat by Germany becomes huge social media talking point .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Days after Columbus Short's wife publicly alleged he threatened to kill her and himself with a knife, the actor on the hit ABC TV series ""Scandal"" has called it quits. ""At this time I must confirm my exit from a show I've called home for 3 years, with what is the most talented ensemble on television today,"" said Short in an official statement released by his publicist on Friday. Short, 31, has played Harrison Wright, a member of fixer Olivia Pope's team since the Season 1 of the show. Recently, Short's personal life has been also been in the spotlight. Wife accuses actor of violence . Last week the actor's wife, Tanee Short, filed an affidavit asking for a restraining order to keep her husband away from her and their 2-year-old daughter. She also filed for divorce from her husband of almost nine years, citing irreconcilable differences. A judge signed a temporary restraining order and set a hearing for May 6 to decide whether it would be extended. ""As much as I would like to provide my side of events, my counsel has instructed me that a Court of law is the only and proper venue to deal with such matters,"" Short said at the time, in a statement released to CNN through his publicist. ""Accordingly, I must refrain from making any comments even though that is very difficult for me under the circumstances."" The actor has been to jail at least three times in the past three months after accusations of violence, according to court filings. The Season 3 finale of ""Scandal"" aired April 17 on ABC. Just like the plot of the show, the premiere date of Season 4 of the hit series remains a cliffhanger.

"(CNN) -- Friends, Brazilians and soccer fans lend me your ears -- the shimmy and shake of the caxirola is coming to a football match near you soon. The pear-shaped plastic percussion piece is to be the musical instrument of choice for the 2014 World Cup after it was given the seal of approval by Brazil's Ministry of Sport. About time too some might argue after the raucous cacophony of the vuvuzela -- the long, plastic horn trumpeted on the terraces during the 2010 soccer World Cup in South Africa. ""For many people, the vuvuzela is very noisy, but the truth is that no one forgets,"" said the caxirola's inventor Brazilian composer Carlinhos Brown, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2012. ""She foretold that we should continue the pace. As a musician, I could not stop and there arose caxirola, a little less noisy."" If the buzzing vuvuzela, whose raspy monotones drew comparisons to a swarm of angry bees and divided opinion, provided the sound track to the World Cup three years ago, Brazil's aural arouser is based on the caxixi, a woven Indian instrument filled with dried beans. Designed to produce a gentler sound -- similar to maracas or rainsticks -- and dressed in the green and yellow colours of Brazil's national flag, the caxirola has also been given a ringing endorsement by the country's President Dilma Rousseff. ""This image of the green and yellow caxirola, it enchants because of the fact that we are talking about a 'green' plastic in a country that leads in sustainability in the world,"" she said at the instrument's recent launch. ""And at the same time it is an object that has the ability to do two things, to combine the image with sound and take us to our goals."" Pedhua whistle . Vuvuzelas were so popular during the 2010 World Cup that manufacturers such as Masincedane Sport were selling as many as 50,000 of them a month. Brown wants his invention to have similar mass appeal when the World Cup arrives in Brazil for its fiesta of football. ""The caxirola as with the vuvuzela, is the ball of the fans,"" explained Brown. ""We want every South American to have a caxirola in their hands."" However, Brazil might not want their musical invention to follow quite the same path as the vuvuzela. Attempts to ban the plastic horn during the World Cup itself may have failed but it soon found itself on the not-wanted list at global sporting tournaments. Europe's governing soccer body UEFA banned them from all competitions, including the Champions League, the Europa League and Euro 2012 matches. Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur were among the first English Premier League clubs to silence the vuvuzela, banning it from their grounds because of concerns over irritation and safety. Vuvuzelas got such a bad reputation that they were also barred from the Wimbledon tennis championship at the All England Club. Traditional football rattles, though they were lessening in popularity, also disappeared from stadiums in the 1970s because of safety concerns. If the caxirola follows the fate of the vuvuzela or rattle, Brazil has a Plan B involving the production of a plastic version of the indigenous pedhua whistle, which mimics bird calls. So, whoever wins the 2014 World Cup can blow their own whistle -- or do the caxirola shake.","The caxirola has been unveiled as the ""new vuvuzela"" for the 2014 World Cup .

"(CNN)  -- Argentina's Supreme Court ruled Tuesday it is unconstitutional to punish an adult for private use of marijuana as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. A recent poll showed 29 percent of Americans believe the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it. The unanimous ruling makes Argentina the second Latin American country in the past four days to allow personal use of a formerly illegal drug. The case in question involved five young men who were arrested for having a few marijuana cigarettes in their pockets. Supreme Court Justice Carlos Fayt, who at one time supported laws that make personal use of marijuana illegal, told the state-run Telam news agency that ""reality"" changed his mind. Argentina's action came amid growing momentum in Latin America toward decriminalization of possessing small amounts of certain drugs. Mexico enacted a law Friday that decriminalizes possessing low quantities of most drugs, including marijuana, heroin, cocaine and LSD. Earlier this year, a Brazilian appeals court ruled that possession of drugs for personal use is not illegal. Analysts see the shift in attitude as recognition that current methods in the war on drugs are not working. ""It seems quite clear that drug policy based primarily on interdiction and enforcement has failed,"" said Robert Pastor, a Latin America national security adviser for President Jimmy Carter in the late 1970s. ""Therefore, it's natural for people to stand back and ask, 'Is there a better way?' "" Pastor noted that some recent research has shown that handling drug use as a health challenge and focusing on treatment may be more efficient. ""What Argentina and Mexico are doing in many ways is blazing a new path,"" Pastor said. Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute in Washington, sees a trend at work. ""It's all part of a harm-reduction approach,"" Hakim said, noting that policymakers are shifting away from getting rid of drugs and toward figuring out how to reduce harm to users and society. Mexico has been considering decriminalization for several years, particularly under the administration of former President Vicente Fox, who held office from 2000-2006. But efforts by the Mexican congress toward decriminalization met with strong resistance from the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush. ""Mexico tried it under Fox and the U.S. got so snippety that they had to back down,"" Hakim said. President Obama's inauguration in January may have changed the calculus, analysts said. The Mexican congress passed the measure in April and President Felipe Calderon quietly signed it into law. In a visit to the United States, Fox said in May a new approach is needed. ""I believe it's time to open the debate over legalizing drugs,"" he told CNN. ""It must be done in conjunction with the United States, but it is time to open the debate."" Earlier this year, Fox's predecessor and two other former leaders of Latin American nations also called for the decriminalization of marijuana for personal use and a change in strategy in the war on drugs. The three ex-presidents were members of the 17-nation Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy, which issued its recommendations in February after studying the issue for a year. ""The problem is that current policies are based on prejudices and fears and not on results,"" former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria said at a news conference in which the commission's recommendations were presented. Former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil said the group called for only the decriminalization of marijuana and not other illicit drugs because ""you have to start somewhere."" Fox's predecessor, Ernesto Zedillo, was president of Mexico from 1994 to 2000. Gaviria was president of Colombia from 1990 to 1994. And Cardoso led Brazil from 1995 to 2002. In his swing through the United States, Fox said any change in drug laws must be accompanied by an education campaign in schools and homes. And because the United States is a large consumer of marijuana that comes from Latin America, any steps toward legalization must be supported in Washington, he said. Gaviria had said in February that the time was right to start a debate on the subject because of the new administration in Washington. ""In many states in the United States, as is the case in California, they have begun to change federal policies with regard to tolerating marijuana for therapeutic purposes. And in Washington there's some consensus that the current policy is failing,"" Gaviria said. The Inter-American Dialogue's Hakim said one recent poll showed that 29 percent of Americans think the best way to deal with marijuana is to legalize it. Pastor, the former Carter official, wondered whether anyone in Washington is paying attention. ""The question,"" he said Tuesday, ""is whether the United States will be open to this new path.""","NEW: Argentina court: It's unconstitutional to punish adult for private use of marijuana .

"(CNN) -- What's life like when your father is a billionaire, your mother is an actress, and your sexuality becomes an international headline? Just ask Hong Kong businesswoman Gigi Chao, 34, who says she ""didn't have time to be shocked"" when her father, real estate tycoon Cecil Chao, discovered her lesbian marriage and then offered HK $1 billion ($128 million) to any male suitor in the world who could effectively turn his daughter straight. Overnight, Gigi's phone was flooded with messages from suitors around the world -- attention she never wanted. ""There wasn't really an opportunity to mope -- 'Oh, poor me, I got thrown out of the closet,'"" she says. ""There were all these factors out of my control. I thought, I have to be my own rock."" Two weeks ago, Chao defended her marriage with an open letter to her father, writing, ""You have no idea how happy I am with my life."" Her father dropped the dowry the next day. Her parents still refuse to welcome her lesbian partner. But by coming out, Gigi Chao has touched off a society-wide conversation about the difficulties facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender-identifying Hong Kongers as they try to find acceptance within their own families. ""It's a belief that coming out as gay is a blatant disrespect for your parents,"" says Chao, speaking about Chinese culture. ""But it's not that way at all. Most gay people I know respect their parents very much."" Raised in a strict family, with a tycoon father who made her enter university at 16 and an actress mother who was a ""perfectionist"" about her daughter's appearance, Chao says she learned from an early age to hold back parts of herself, including her own emotions. Chao recalls an instance when, as a teenager, she brought her girlfriend to her house. ""My mom... cried and screamed and banged her head against a wall and said, 'I will never accept this fact about you, and I'll never accept it 'til the day I die.' So I just sort of sat there in silence, and took it all in,"" says Chao. ""The best way... is to be grounded and logical about it -- ground yourself in reason, you have to be a combination of a good actor and a good lawyer at the same time,"" says Chao. See who else has been on Talk Asia . Chao says her family's reaction was somewhat typical of the socially conservative Asian society. ""A lot of what Hong Kong is, is family ties and relationships in this tiny, small and overcrowded place, and there's a lot of people who want to keep it that way,"" she says. What's frowned upon, she suggests, are ""troublemakers"" and ""people who rock the boat."" But for some young LGBT Hong Kongers, Gigi Chao is exactly the kind of ""troublemaker"" they need. ""When Gigi came out, it really hit home for me,"" says Callie (not her real name), a 21 year-old lesbian woman whose parents, like Gigi's, are well-known Hong Kong celebrities. ""When my parents saw Gigi, they saw this person who is established, who has a really good career, is still living her life to the fullest -- and that made them realize that I can have that, too. ""Gigi definitely showed the LGBT community that there is hope, and we're moving in the right direction."" For Callie and many others, Chao has become a ""symbol"" of the city's growing movement. Still, Chao says life may not be as easy for members of Hong Kong's queer community who lack her celebrity status. ""A lot of people... come from a life of hardship and inequality, not just because of their orientation but all sectors of life, all facets. And to add one more -- their sexual orientation being another disadvantage they have to face, that's the part that makes it more difficult, and that's what we want to confront."" Despite being thrust into the position of role model, Chao says she does not claim to be a ""leader"" or an ""activist."" ""I am who I am, and I speak for myself and myself only,"" she says. ""All that's happened is I've been given a voice, and people seem interested in what I have to say.""

"(CNN) -- Actress Amanda Bynes stared with a blank, wide-eyed expression at reporters seated behind her in a New York courtroom Tuesday. It was a brief court appearance for the 27-year-old Bynes, required only so the judge could set a date for another pretrial hearing. She faces three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment on May 23. Bynes wore a waist-length aqua and blonde-colored wig from her unusual collection of hair pieces, a tank top, sweatpants and sneakers as she stood silently before the Manhattan Criminal Court judge. She left with her lawyer after the judge set her next court hearing for September 26. A date for a trial, if necessary, has not been decided. Police charged Bynes with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana after they were called to her building in Manhattan's theater district. The building manager reported she was smoking an ""illegal substance"" in the lobby, police said. Police knock down Bynes sex harassment claim . Bynes had headed back to her apartment by the time police arrived, but she let officers in when they knocked on the door, they said. Once inside, the officers noticed a bong and other marijuana paraphernalia sitting on a coffee table, which Bynes immediately started to throw out a window, police said. Police charged her with tampering with physical evidence, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of marijuana. The endangerment stems from the possibility that the tossed paraphernalia could have hit someone below. Bynes told followers on Twitter that the police account was ""all lies."" Her story is that she was ""sexually harassed by one of the cops the night before last"" -- the same police officer who, she wrote, ended up arresting her. New York police later said an internal affairs investigation found no evidence of the sexual harassment claim.

"(CNN) -- It's said nothing is certain in life except for death and taxes. For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death. They fear one of Europe's top leagues, newly resurgent following significant investment from mega wealthy Qataris and Russians, could be irreparably damaged by the tax. On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million. The clubs have been lobbying hard against the tax, arguing it endangers their future. It's estimated the tax could increase their costs by up to 30%. And they feel so strongly over the matter that they plan to go on strike. So if you're a French football fan don't expect to be watching the likes Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic or Monaco forward Falcao in action between 29 November and 2 December. If it goes ahead it would France's first football ""strike"" since 1972. Ibrahimovic is one of more than 10 players at Qatari-owned PSG -- France's richest club -- whose yearly pay exceeds $1.35 million. While the average Ligue 1 player's salary is estimated at just under $800,000, Ibrahimovic reportedly takes home $17.5 million a year. Many players would already be taxed at France's top marginal rate of 49%, which kicks in at $675,000 a year. Just for Ibrahimovic's hefty pay packet alone, PSG's costs would increase by nearly $12 million under the Hollande plan. Since world-class players have their choice of what countries they play in, French teams would have to absorb the increased taxes themselves if they want to attract top talent. Ahead of this weekend's games, PSG and Monaco are joint top of Ligue 1. But PSG could be at a further disadvantage in future given Monaco are exempt from French taxation laws and the principality club's tax expenditure would be $67.5 million less than the French champions per year. ""The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football,"" said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement. Before the start of the season some of the world's best players -- like Edinson Cavani who joined PSG from Napoli -- If the taxation impasse remains, it is likely French clubs would struggle to attract the very top talent. ""French teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to English clubs who only pay 40% tax,"" former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN. ""That will affect the standard of the league. It might also affect money coming into French football from foreign investment --- potential owners might be tempted to get more value for money elsewhere. ""Monaco and PSG have raised the popularity and exposure of French football outside France,"" added Karlsen. ""Some in France are still quite skeptical as to why and how they have got involved, but if you are supporter or if you enjoy watching French football they have brought only positive dimensions. ""As an international observer, it is going to be difficult to uphold the current standard in the years to come if this tax comes in to play."" French football has a strong tradition of developing young players through its academy system, but a French club hasn't won the Champions League -- Europe's top competition -- for over 20 years, though last season PSG reached the quarterfinals. ""In the short term clubs would have to buy cheaper players for lower transfers and would pay lower salaries to avoid paying the 75%,"" said Karlsen as he outlined a grim future for French football. ""When the player reaches a level where he starts to attract offers from abroad and will attract wages far above â‚¬1 million, or when a player becomes an international or starts to play well in European competition then there is no other option for him than to move abroad."" Karlsen added: ""What is a concern for the clubs is that their budgets relate to long-term contracts they have already agreed with players. ""They feel the goalposts have been moved and it makes it extremely difficult for them to continue or plan to be successful in an environment that is already very challenging."" Earlier this week UCPF president Jean-Pierre Louvel unveiled a study outlining the economic benefits French football brings France, given it has an annual turnover of $5.8 billion and there are potentially 25,000 jobs at stake. ""The return on investment for the state is $ .5 billion"", said Louvel, who is also the president of second division club Le Havre. ""In addition, each euro generated by clubs creates additional 2.5 euros ($3.38) in the country's economy."" A survey by pollster OpinionWay in October suggested 85% of voters did not think football clubs should be exempted from the high tax rate, which requires approval from the French parliament. And given France's economic problems -- it has only just emerged from recession -- some members of the French football community remain uneasy about the proposed strike. ""I think that if our corporation goes on strike, we'll have to go into hiding, I mean really go into hiding,"" Evian coach Pascal Dupraz, was quoted in L'Equipe as telling radio station RTL. ""I'm not totally for (the strike) personally, what worries me of course is that there is this tax, but, all French people suffer from having to pay taxes. ""I just don't understand the anger from the club presidents; I just don't get it at all."" It is not all bad news for French football fans given some observers expect a compromise to be reached. ""I remain confident that some sort of solution will be found before the date of the strike voted for by the club's chairmen,"" Julien Laurens, a French football expert and writer for Le Parisien, told CNN.","French president Francois Hollande wants 75% tax on salaries over $1.35m .

"(CNN) -- Apple fans holding out hope they'd see the company's next great gadget on Monday were disappointed. At the keynote address for the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference, software was king. For owners of the 800 million iPhones, iPads and iPods that run the company's iOS operating system, the biggest news may have been the rollout of its latest version, iOS 8. Due to be released this fall, the new system will update lots of existing features and add some new ones. So, here's a first look at eight key features of iOS 8. Health . Apple has been pushing fitness and health apps, such as the one associated with Nike's FuelBand. With Health, they're taking it a step further. Basically, Health pulls together data from different health-related apps into one place, creating a comprehensive profile for the user. It also lets the users send health information to doctors at selected hospitals. It's easy to see this being a prominent feature when (and if) the long-rumored iWatch arrives, which could include sensors that track the wearer's steps, heartbeat and other vital signs. HomeKit . Even if it's not the expansive home-automation system that some rumors suggested, HomeKit is a step toward turning your smartphone into a remote control for the connected devices in your home. Apple has partnered with lots of third-party folks (but notably not Nest, founded by former Apple designer Tony Fadell and recently purchased by Google) on the app. By pulling all of those apps' abilities together in one place, HomeKit will let users control their garage doors, locks, lights, cameras and thermostats with their phone. Obviously, some third-party hardware will be required -- at least for now. New tricks for Siri . The iPhone's famous voice assistant, Siri, only got a quick mention Monday. But she's learned a couple of new tricks. On iOS 8, users who plug their iPhone into their car will be able to wake Siri up by voice without having to touch their phone. Less distraction on the road sounds like a good thing to us. And you'll be able to ask Siri to identify the song you're listening to, using technology from the Shazam app. 'Do Not Disturb' in Messages . This is a simple little feature, but tons of folks following our live blog of the Apple event seemed to really like this one. In Messages, ""Do Not Disturb"" will let you mute conversation threads that you're a part of without having to leave them entirely. So, if your buddies are nailing down that karaoke outing while you're at work, you can make them hush -- while leaving other threads active -- and come back to the chat later. QuickType . Google may be the tech giant most associated with predictive text, but Apple's giving it a go with QuickType. The keyboard feature presumably will make sending messages quicker by guessing what you're writing before you finish writing it, letting you tap and move on to the next word. Phones on Android already have this. But Apple promises that QuickType will learn your language habits, including how you text in different message threads. So for example, it may predict one word in a work-related thread (""Time for my next meeting""), another with your party-time buddy (""Time for my next beer"") and a third in texts with your mom (""Time for my next visit""). Interactive Notifications . With this one, Apple catches up on another feature already used by Android owners. Interactive Notifications let you respond to things such as text messages, Facebook posts in which you're tagged and appointment reminders without leaving the app you're currently using. To Apple's credit, their version looks pretty smooth. It even lets you tap to reply with a voice recording, image or video without abandoning that killer level of ""Candy Crush."" Family Sharing . Up to six members of a family will be able to share their iTunes purchases across different devices, meaning you and your brother no longer have to pay $6.99 each for ""Minecraft."" The catch is you'll have to use the same credit card for all those purchases. It's Apple's way of preventing overly liberal interpretations of the word ""family."" This new feature also will let relatives more easily share calendars, photos, reminders and the like. iCloud Photo Library . Apple will now offer more storage for all your photos and videos in the cloud with access to them from any device. The iCloud Photo Library also will include a ""smart"" editing feature that lets users slide their finger to adjust multiple effects at the same time. For example, the app will allow you to tweak light, contrast and color on photos, with every adjustment automatically updated across all your devices.","Apple unveiled the newest version of its mobile operating system on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Officers arrested the son of legendary actor Clark Gable this week on suspicion of drunken driving after he crashed into six parked cars in Malibu, California. John Clark Gable, 52, was driving a white Ford pickup Tuesday near the Malibu Pier when the crashes occurred, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. No one was injured, but Gable was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, and hit-and-run. It isn't the first time an heir of the ""Gone With the Wind"" actor has been in trouble with the law. In 2011, Clark Gable's grandson, then 22, was accused of pointing a laser inside the cockpit of a Los Angeles police helicopter, endangering the pilot who was flying over Hollywood. Police arrested Clark James Gable and charged him with a felony. He later was sentenced to 10 days in jail, CNN affiliate KTLA-TV in Los Angeles reported. At the time, his manager said it was an accident. ""Boys will be boys, and he was playing with what he thought was a toy and not a felony piece,"" Roxane Davis, the manager, told CNN then. ""From what he told me from jail, he had it out the window, and he was shining it out the window, and the next thing he knew was that he had a spotlight on him."" Clark Gable, once dubbed the King of the Hollywood, is probably best known for his portrayal of Rhett Butler in the 1939 classic ""Gone With the Wind."" He died in 1960. John Clark Gable was born four months after his father's death.","John Clark Gable is arrested in Malibu, California .

"(CNN) -- It would not be surprising for an associate pastor to pray with his parishioners. But Jorge Juan Castro wound up preying on them instead, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Friday. He is accused of raping more than 20 women, many of whom are Spanish-speaking, undocumented immigrants. The alleged abuse began in October 2004, shortly after Castro took a job as associate pastor at Las Buenas Nuevas Church in Norwalk, and continued until September 2012, the department said in a news release. Castro was arrested last Friday at his home in Norwalk and was being held in Los Angeles County Jail in lieu of $2 million bail. The allegations came to light when the women, ages 18 to 39, implicated Castro to a third party who then told detectives, authorities said. The alleged incidents began in October 2004 and continued until September 2012. During that time, Castro was working as an associate pastor and counselor at Las Buenas Nuevas Church in Norwalk, the department said. ""The suspect allegedly preyed upon the victims' vulnerability,"" the news release said. ""He did this by invoking fear by threatening to tell the victims if they reported him he would have the victims deported, while additionally threatening to expose the victims to public embarrassment and ridicule."" Castro was booked on an arrest warrant listing six felony charges of rape, oral copulation and penetration by a foreign object, authorities said. Detectives from the county's Special Victims Bureau were asking for help from the public in identifying any other possible victims.","Jorge Juan Castro, an associate pastor, is being held in lieu of $2 million bail .

"London, England (CNN) -- It wasn't Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie or even Meryl Streep that was named the most profitable actress of the decade -- instead, 19-year-old British actress Emma Watson took the title. Films that the young actress has appeared in have made more money than those of any other Hollywood starlet, despite her being in only the ""Harry Potter"" series and voicing a character in an animated film. Over the course of the decade, films that Watson was involved in made $5.4 billion worldwide and these boasted the highest average box office earnings, making roughly $900 million per film. More notable actresses like Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet were beaten in the list conducted by the Guinness Book of World Records. Watson got her start at the age of ten, playing a young wizard in the first ""Harry Potter"" film back in 2001. Since then, she has starred in five subsequent Potter movies and voiced the character of a young princess in the animated film, ""The Tale of Despereaux."" Ali Jaafar, International Editor at Variety Magazine said it was notable that Watson was a big grosser, but it would be interesting to see how her career progressed. ""She's untested apart from the Harry Potter franchise, but these are young actors and it'll be interesting to see how they develop their careers,"" Jaafar told CNN. ""It's always hard for child actors to develop.""

"(CNN) -- When Sadegh Shahi heard reports about a SWAT team armed to the teeth storming onto a Sunwing Airlines flight to arrest a passenger, he thought to himself, ""it's probably my son."" The father's intuition apparently was correct. Ali Shahi was arrested Friday by at least a half-dozen heavily armed authorities who stormed aboard an airplane looking for him at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Jarring cell phone video of the episode was captured by fellow passengers. Earlier that morning -- about 45 minutes into flight 772 from Toronto to Panama City -- the 25-year-old Canadian citizen made a ""direct threat against the aircraft,"" according to Sunwing spokeswoman Janine Chapman. Witnesses told Canada's CTV news that Shahi said he wanted to bomb Canada. The Boeing 737 -- which at that point was high above West Virginia -- was escorted back to Toronto by two U.S. fighter jets that were on an aerial training drill nearby, NORAD spokeswoman Capt. Jennifer Stadnyk told CNN. The elder Shahi told CNN that Ali is not a violent person and did not mean what he said. He said his son is mentally ill, and has never gotten the support he's needed. ""Ali thinks life is a game,"" he said. ""We've called the cops 24 times in the past year on him. We've begged police for help, but they never do anything. They always send him back home."" Shahi said his son is a friendless, unemployed gambling addict who has suffered from depression and eating disorders for a decade. ""In high school, he was fat,"" he said. ""He was bullied until he became anorexic."" Ali Shahi is charged with mischief to property, mischief or interfering with the lawful enjoyment of property, other threats and endangering the safety of an aircraft, according to Constable Lillian Fitzpatrick of Peel Regional Police. He was released Saturday on $1,000 bond, according to CTV. The ordeal for flight 772's passengers did not end with Shahi's arrest. After taking off from Toronto, the flight was diverted again, this time to Jamaica for a medical emergency, according to Chapman. Eventually, the plane touched down at Panama City's Tocumen International Airport at 9:41 p.m. local time, nearly 12 hours behind schedule.","Canadian airline passenger Ali Shahi out on bond .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Hindu holy man castrated himself in India Wednesday following the arrest of popular preacher Asaram Bapu, revered by millions across the country for his sermons on enlightenment. Police have charged the 72-year old guru with raping a 16-year-old schoolgirl at one of his ashrams, or religious centers, in August. Authorities in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh found Baba Premdas, a 60-year old follower of Bapu, bleeding at his home in Amethi from apparently self-inflicted wounds, city police chief Alankrita Singh told CNN. Premdas was admitted to a local hospital and then taken to a bigger health facility for surgery where his condition ""is stable"", said Singh. Asked whether his act was related to the arrest of Asaram Bapu, Singh added, ""We have heard such things, but all this is unconfirmed."" ""Some say it was because of Bapu's arrest,"" said Singh to AFP earlier, ""some say it was because he feared ending up in Bapu's situation. No one knows."" Bapu has denied the sexual assault allegations leveled by the teenage girl and her parents, both devotees of the guru. The elderly preacher has also claimed he is physically incapable of rape but police say medical tests show him to be in good shape. ""The team of doctors is saying he is perfectly, medically, mentally and physically fit,"" said Ajayal Lamba, Deputy Commissioner of Police in Jodhpur. Bapu, also referred to as the ""godman"" in local Indian media, is currently in jail awaiting trial after a court rejected his bail plea earlier this week, public prosecutor Anand Purohit told CNN. The prosecution plans to present a detailed dossier of the charges in the trial soon, he said. This month's unfolding rape case against Bapu is just the latest in a series of sexual assault incidents in India since late 2012 that have gained high-profile attention both for their frequency and ferocity. It was the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi last December that galvanized Indian society and the media in particular, to examine the pervasive incidence of rape and other forms of violence against women. The barbarity of the crime ignited a wide-ranging discussion across all levels of the Indian media and prompted multiple debates in the national and regional assemblies. Stung into action by public outrage, the government instituted new laws and crucially stricter punishments, which includes the death penalty when victims are killed or left in a vegetative state. Furthermore in a sharp departure with previous practice, predatory behavior such as voyeurism, stalking and groping can now lead to arrest and punishment. India's court system is now making greater use of fast-track trials to prosecute the most heinous and high-profile crimes against women. Local and national media have maintained their spotlight on sexual assaults and other violence against women, leading to a torrent of disturbing reports following last December's horrific rape incident. In March, at least five men from a local tribe gang-raped a Swiss woman camping with her husband in a forest in India's Datia district. A court convicted six men to life in prison four months later. In April, a 4-year-old Indian girl was raped by a 35-year-old man in India's central Maharashtra state. The girl suffered brain damage and was in a coma for two weeks before dying from cardiac arrest. And in June, at least three men gang-raped a 31-year-old American tourist in northern India after she visited the Vashishth Temple after midnight. She accepted a ride from the group after failing to find a taxi. They drove her to a wooded area where they assaulted her. While such incidents have been covered extensively by international news media, an even larger number of cases are only reported in domestic Indian news outlets -- and an unknown number simply go unreported. Just this week in local media, the Times of India reported two men gang-raped a 27-year-old woman who had gone to a local dairy in northern Uttar Pradesh state, the Hindustan Times reported at least six to seven girls were lured to and raped at a deserted steel mill south of Mumbai over the past half year, and the Indian Express reported the story of a 14-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by two people over several months in western Gujarat state. Villagers discovered the girl was pregnant but later miscarried twin babies. According to India's National Crime Records Bureau, the country recorded 24,923 cases of reported rape in 2012 -- a 57% rise in reported cases since 2003. This number is widely considered to be extremely underreported for a country of more than 1 billion people. The United States, with a population of more than 310 million, recorded 270,000 cases of rape in 2010, the most recent year for which national rape statistics are available.

"(CNN)  -- It seems even the White House isn't immune to the nationwide housing slump. In the past year, the estimated value of the 132-room mansion on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue dropped 5.1 percent -- from $308 million to $292.5 million, according to the real estate Web site Zillow. The drop is in step with national trends. Homes across the country fell about 5 percent in price in 2009, said Zillow, which tracks real estate values, based on public records. But the news wasn't all grim for the White House in 2009, just as it wasn't for the rest of America. A year earlier, the White House lost even more of its estimated value -- almost $24 million, a 7.2 percent drop. During the same period, home values in the United States plummeted 11.9 percent on average. Designed by an Irish architect and built in 1792, the White House -- with additions over the years -- now stands at 55,000 square feet, on 18 acres. It has 16 bedrooms, 35 bathrooms, three kitchens, three elevators, 28 fireplaces and an underground bunker. In a December survey in which Zillow asked more than 2,000 Americans whom they'd most like to share a fence with, 14 percent named the Obamas. Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin placed second. The worst neighbors, according to the survey: Nadya Suleman, the California woman who gave birth to octuplets in January 2009, followed closely by reality-television stars Jon and Kate Gosselin.","Value dropped 5.1 percent -- from $308 million to $292.5 million -- in 2009 .

"(The Frisky) -- Matchmaker and dating coach Rachel Greenwald is responsible for 750 marriages, and she doesn't believe you will find the love of your life by waiting for him/her to spontaneously appear in line at the grocery store or sit next to you on the subway. Darn. There goes my approach. This Harvard M.B.A. and New York Times best-selling author advocates a better way -- being proactive and approaching your dating life like a job search. Sure, there has to be an intersection of luck, timing, and opportunity, to find love,"" she says, ""But you increase your odds when you do something about it. If you have a strategic organized plan, something will come through faster."" So, uh, what should this plan be? Her new book, ""Have Him at Hello: Confessions from 1,000 Guys About What Makes Them Fall in Love ... Or Never Call Back,"" just hit bookstores and has some ingenious ideas for us. I had the opportunity to chat with Rachel and get a singles state of the union. Here's eight interesting tips I learned. The Frisky: Online dating is making me depressed . 1. The ""no effort mentality"" is crazy. We are officially the instant gratification dating generation. If love doesn't happen instantly, we're out of there. But anything worth having takes work. Rachel points out that we are willing to put effort into other things in our lives -- our careers, our friendships, our hobbies, our living space --but we expect our love lives to come effortlessly. ""You wouldn't expect to be a CEO in five seconds,"" Rachel points out. 2. It takes a village to find Mr. or Mrs. Right. An important step in working on your love life is letting people know that you're looking. A lot of us are embarrassed to reach out for help when it comes to finding love. We think it seems desperate to admit that we would like to find someone to spend the rest of our lives with. I'm totally not talking about myself, by the way. ""The stigma is all in your head,"" says Rachel. ""That's like someone saying 'I'm unemployed but too embarrassed to find a job.'"" Rachel suggests thinking of all the people in our lives as possible networking opportunities. The Frisky: I slept with your husband and here's why . 3. Stop asking ""Where?"" Ask ""How?"" Asking a friend, co-worker, family member, or acquaintance where you can meet a great guy is a dead-end question. When you mention in casual conversation to your ""village"" that you are looking to meet someone this year, ask ""how."" That way you are enlisting them in your search. ""How?"" is a far more proactive and empowering question. It implies suggestions and solutions. 4. Get online. There's no stigma about dating online anymore -- one-fourth of the people who got married last year met online. So, if you don't already have a rocking online profile ... make one. But Rachel also recommends Twitter as an alternative source. ""Why not throw a Twitter party?"" she suggests. ""Send out a tweet to your friends and tell them that you're having happy hour drinks on Friday at your favorite bar. Tell them to bring friends."" Rachel's also a big fan of Meetup.com. ""It's much more sophisticated then it was a few years ago,"" she says. You can search something like ""Singles, New York, film lovers,"" and find groups that meet in your area. You can even click through the groups and see mini-profiles and pictures of the members. 5. Don't forget about Facebook! One-third of married people met through introductions by friends. Following that logic, Facebook may be our single most underused resource. ""Treat Facebook like an online dating profile,"" says Rachel. ""Take it seriously. If a guy sees a bad photo of you on Facebook or weird things on your profile, he may not give you a chance."" Rachel suggests crafting the image you want to project on Facebook. ""Pick five words that represent you and make sure your Facebook profile reflects those five words,"" she says. Once you're satisfied with your profile, she suggested playing a game she calls ""I Spy a Facebook Guy."" Here's how it works: Give yourself 10 days to cruise around your friends' Facebook pages and find 50 guys that you think are interesting. Then scope out their profiles and write them a message. Hey, you already know someone in common. 6. Married people are a great resource. They know a thing or two about relationships, but more importantly, they know other single people who are marriage-minded. Plus, they're much more eager to see you settle down than your single friends. The Frisky: Why women should ask men out on dates . 7. You may have tried it all, but have you tried it well? Trying something once or twice isn't enough. ""Doing online dating with a bad profile picture or going to a singles event and leaving after you scanned the room once is like looking for a job with a poorly written resume or applying for a sales job [when] you're an accountant,"" says Rachel. Instead, take a look at what you've been trying and how, and think of ways to do it better. 8. It's OK to outsource. How do we know what we're doing wrong in our dating lives? Rachel says that there's no shame in hiring a dating coach. Hey, we have personal trainers, therapists, and head hunters. Outsourcing is part of our culture -- yet we feel we can tackle the dating thing on our own. Why? OK, I'm sold. I will definitely be trying out some of this advice.

"(CNN) -- Often in the middle of the night, while his wife sleeps beside him, John Sheridan picks up his iPhone from the nightstand and shakes the device like it was a conductor's wand on fire. John Sheridan of Florida creates music on his iPhone while his wife sleeps beside him. Sometimes he goes on like this for more than an hour at a time. There's a point to this midnight madness, though. By day, Sheridan is a 53-year-old real-estate agent in Florida. But by night, he's an iPhone musician. In the past few months, he has used his phone to record and upload at least 30 songs to the Web using an iPhone application called ZOOZbeat, which helps anyone -- regardless of musical talent or lack thereof -- create songs by selecting instruments from a list and then waving his or her phone around.

A quick flick of the wrist produces a high note. A gentler movement belches out a lower tone. The app loops the sounds and lets users edit their tracks on the fly or afterwards. Sheridan said he wears headphones while he's jamming, so as not to wake his wife. His recording sessions are part of a pocket-sized revolution in the music world: Smartphone apps and programs for handheld gaming consoles now let all kinds of people create and remix tunes on-the-go. The mobile-music movement is particularly pronounced in the Apple's iPhone app store, where more than a dozen downloadable applications, many of which are free or cost less than $3, let would-be musicians turn their smartphones into keyboards, drums, guitars and all kinds of futuristic synthesizers. One bizarre application, called Ocarina, even lets people create flute sounds by blowing into their phone's built-in microphone while touching the screen to select various notes. ""There's been an absolute explosion in [music] production on mobile devices across all kinds of different platforms,"" said Peter Kirn, editor-in-chief of createdigitalmusic.com. Some mobile musicians are finding online fame on video-sharing sites like YouTube. More than 82,000 people have viewed this video of a woman using the Ocarina app to play the theme to ""Jurassic Park"" with her nose, for example. The band the Mentalists racked up nearly 900,000 views by performing the MGMT song ""Kids"" using four iPhones, each loaded with a different musical app. Professional musicians are taking smartphones on tour with them for their musical capabilities, too. A video of the band Gomez shows the group using an iPhone as an instrument. The Gregory Brothers, the band formed by the siblings who make the ""Auto-Tune the News"" video series, have used the I Am T-Pain application to add robot-style vocal effects to their live shows. Phoenix has performed with an iPhone, and Jordan Rudess of the band Dream Theater has a slate of online videos explaining the musical apps he uses on tour. The smartphones have their technical limits, of course, and the idea isn't to fully replace real-world guitars and drum kits. But the phones do offer a lightweight alternative to heavy tour gear, and they have a novelty appeal for some musicians and music fans. Jeremy Landry, a musician who said he has recorded an entire album on the Sony PSP gaming device, said it's a fun challenge to ""see how much sound you can push out with your hands tied behind your back"" by a mobile device. ""I feel like I have more creativity if I have limits set on me,"" he said. Kirn, the Web site editor, said the trend toward mobile music started with Nintendo's Game Boy and continued on other hand-held gaming devices. But smartphones are giving the trend more mainstream appeal. The iPhone's accelerometer, which allows users to control apps by tilting the phone, makes the ZOOZbeat app possible, said Gil Weinberg, director of the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology and founder of ZOOZbeat. Weinberg hopes the app will help save the struggling music industry by getting people more engaged in the music they love. ""You don't have to have a lot of money, and you also don't have to have a lot of experience in music"" to be an iPhone musician, he said. ""We will help you experience whatever level of creativity you would like."" ZOOZbeat recently released a new version of its app that will make this experience more social. The new app lets people ""toss"" recordings from one phone to another, helping them collaborate on track engineering. It also lets people download professional music samples for remixing and recreation, adding their own lyrics if they choose. People can't sell their ZOOZbeat creations, Weinberg said, but the company plans to hold contests with rewards like backstage passes to concerts. Andrew Beck, a masters student in music technology at Georgia Tech who works at ZOOZbeat, envisions a future when apps like ZOOZbeat will let concert audiences participate in live shows. ""It'd be cool if people were somehow involved in the concert,"" he said, ""but we're not sure exactly how that would work yet."" Beck, who also is a musician, said he tried giving an audience Wii remotes so they could play along with one of his shows. But the experiment just ended up creating a lot of noise, he said. Sheridan, the nocturnal iPhone musician who goes by the screen name strato999 on the ZOOZbeat site, says that making mobile-phone music is addictive. Sheridan earned money in college by playing guitar in a country band. Playing his phone isn't better than playing the guitar, just different, he said. His first iPhone song, called ""My name is John,"" is set to a hip-hop beat -- a stretch for a former country musician. The song's only lyrics are its title, which he repeats nine times in a slithery voice. Synthesizers squeal and records scratch in the background. In a follow-up effort called ""The Juan Song,"" Sheridan applies similar principles to a salsa beat. The lyrics, which were recorded in Spanish with the help of a translation app, go like this: . My name is John Do you like my song? If not, it doesn't matter (repeat) In other tunes, Sheridan just seems to say whatever comes to him in the moment he awakes. He laments about the real-estate crisis in a track called ""Inside Out"" and bemoans the fact that he's on a diet in ""Salad -- The Horror of Salad,"" whose instrumentals sound fit for an '80s TV drama. The song starts off like a spoken-word poem: . Cucumbers. Tomatoes. Carrots. Oil. Vinegar. Lemon ...  SALAD! Carrots, tomatoes are salad ... are salad. I'M SO SICK OF SALAD!!! Sheridan knows his songs are silly. When he posts them on Facebook, his friends tell him to hire a lyricist. But he hopes oddball tunes make people smile -- and bring a bit of a creative spark into his life in the process.","Smartphones and handheld devices increasingly being used to make music .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Marina lost her spleen and has a punctured lung. She was attached to a rebel group as a combat medic, and was hurt during the fighting, she told CNN from her hospital bed. She read a tousled book in an almost empty ward in Donetsk's Kalinin hospital. Her chest drained blood and other fluids to a bottle on the floor. Her nom-de-guerre is Tigger, inspired by Winnie the Pooh's feline friend. She chose not to reveal her surname for safety reasons, but her self-introduction was revealing. ""I'm from Russia, from Kuban, I'm 23 years old, I used to work at a rescue organization and I got here because I couldn't stay out of the situation,"" Marina said. Marina isn't Ukrainian, she crossed a border to join the fight rarely admitted by rebel forces. Help for Donetsk Peoples' Republic, the formal name of the rebels, comes from Russia in many forms, and this combat medic was another example. Now, she spends her days in hospital, receiving care from doctors who are as concerned about their neutrality as they are about their patients. In this war-torn region, every day is a struggle. ""Due to the fighting many people have left the region... we have enough doctors, but there's a shortage of nurses,"" said Dr. Andrei Sagalevich, head of the Surgery Department at Kalinina Hospital. Dr. Sagalevich manages an institution with beds for 1,100 patients; nevertheless, an occupation of around 50% is challenging given their staff and supply levels. Combat wounded represent a relatively small number of people under treatment in Kalinin. Out of 38, at least 15 are civilians. But these figures are imprecise. A hospital building was taken over by the rebels and cases that aren't serious recover there. Doctors have no way of knowing exactly how many people their institution takes care of. Their most reliable supply line is currently run by NGO Doctors Without Borders. Sagalevich told CNN how grateful he is for the medicines and other necessities they donate to his hospital and others across the region. ""The medical staff I have seen is amazing, most hospitals continue to work in this extremely difficult situation,"" said Colette Gadenne, emergency field coordinator for Donetsk's Doctors Without Borders. Donetsk is relatively more accessible, and here they have been able to distribute supplies to treat up to 2,380 combat wounded. In other regions, where these materials are desperately needed due to fierce fighting, logistics are limited. ""We struggle to have access to hospitals to supply them, because of the dynamics of the conflict, it's very difficult,"" Gadenne told CNN. Marina was wounded in one of these hot areas where fierce fighting continues. Slovyansk was under mortar fire and I helped pull a family out of the debris,"" Marina proudly said. Not long after that, she was shot. Her punctured lung made her pant as she tried to speak. Determined to continue talking, sitting upright on her bed, she was already thinking about what to do after recovery. ""I want to join the fight again, there's a shortage of medical staff, and I want to help; Fascism won't be tolerated."" Marina said. Kateryna Zhuchenko contributed to this report.","Her nom-de-guerre is Tigger, inspired by Winnie the Pooh's feline friend .

"(CNN) -- New England Patriots players sang ""Happy Birthday"" to a 6-year-old boy with an inoperable brain tumor Saturday. Daniel Nickerson's visit on the field of Gillette Stadium, where the NFL team was practicing, would be a dream come true for many.Â However, Daniel's biggest birthday wish was much simpler: mail.Â . ""He just loves getting mail, he's always running to the mailbox,"" his aunt, Gail Chamberlin, told CNN. A social media campaign by family and friends brought lots of birthday cards addressed to Daniel to the Foxborough, Massachusetts, post office this past week. It also resulted in the Patriots' invitation to their training camp. Team owner Robert Kraft presented a jersey to Daniel on Friday, his actual birthday. ""Danny"" and the number 6 are on the back of the jersey. Kraft invited the boy back on Saturday to a practice, where he huddled alongside Tom Brady and the rest of the team. The birthday song was ""the highlight of the day,"" his aunt said. Daniel, who was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma eight months ago, has a tumor that is inoperable because it ""grows like fingers into the brain,"" Chamberlin said.Â ""It was very devastating to the family to find out there really weren't any options."" His latest exam showed that the chemotherapy, which the boy will have every two weeks for the rest of his life, has stabilized the tumor's growth, she said. ""It didn't grow and it didn't shrink, so we were happy about that,"" Chamberlin said. When his family asked Daniel what he wanted for his sixth birthday, he told them he just wanted mail. ""He just wanted news, he loves, loves getting mail, seeing things with his name on it,"" Chamberlin said. The large amount of mail -- which his aunt said was at least 100,000 letters and 8,000 boxes from all over the world -- has ""been a blessing"" and gives Daniel something to look forward to each day, she said. While the family is anxious about what they'll learn about the tumor at Daniel's next doctor's visit Wednesday, Chamberlin said, ""He's running around like an average 6-year-old would do, playing."" ""We are all praying it's stable still,"" she said. ""No one really has lived past a year, we know we are on month eight. But we don't really talk about it and we hope there is going to be a cure."" As for Daniel, ""He knows he has a 'boo boo' and that's really it,"" she said. Strangers help with photo in midst of tragedy .

"(CNN) -- Those hardy micro-brewing pioneers of the first Oregon Brewers Festival in 1988 were looking for some free advertising and a few people to taste the beers they were brewing in tanks scavenged from dairies, food processing plants and -- yes -- a never-used nuclear power plant. They hoped 5,000 people might drop by and they corralled their buddies into manning the taps, promising a leisurely day of suds and sun at Portland, Oregon's Tom McCall Waterfront Park on the Willamette River. More than 15,000 people came and chaos reigned. Coolers didn't work right. The beer poured foamy, warm, then not at all because the kegs were dry. Brewers scurried back to their breweries for more kegs. The owner of Deschutes Brewery drove nearly 200 miles from Bend with all the brewery's spare beer -- nine mini kegs. The crowd drained those too, and loved it all. America's Oktoberfest was born. ""I had traveled to Oktoberfest in Munich and knew what a big beer party was like,"" says Art Larrance, who now owns the festival. ""I wanted to create that atmosphere."" The 27th Oregon Brewers Festival begins Wednesday, when a parade of hundreds of brewers and beer fans troops across Portland's Hawthorne Bridge to the park, where Grand Marshal John Maier will tap the first keg. Hundreds more will be consumed over five days by a crowd of more than 80,000. Family-friendly behemoth . From shaky beginnings, the OBF has become perhaps the largest outdoor craft beer festival in the country, a sprawling, family-friendly behemoth that attracts visitors from around the world. It's the spiritual home of Oregon craft brewing and the crown jewel of the city known as Beervana: Portland, Oregon. Denver's Great American Beer Festival is older by six years and offers more beers -- 3,100 last year to the OBF's 80 or so. Tickets cost $80: admission to the OBF is free and a tasting glass costs $7. The GABF isn't a family event: its 40,000 attendees sign up for one of several sessions in a convention hall chockablock with beer fans intent on sampling all 3,100 beers, not in a grassy park on a glorious late July weekend with big white pavilions, ranks of picnic tables and riverine breezes a-wafting. Serious beer judging is a big part of the GABF, where a couple hundred medals are awarded in dozens of categories. In best laid back Oregon fashion, the OBF doesn't award medals and lets the crowd be the judge of which beers are its favorite. ""The GABF was the first, and it was their show,"" said Larrance. ""We didn't want to copy them, so whatever they did, we pretty much went the other way. ""It's a very different festival in that sense, and that's why it's grown and evolved.""

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- At least 49 members of a wedding party are feared dead after a flash flood overturned a bus carrying them in the frontier Rajouri district of Indian-administered Kashmir, as heavy rain has caused flooding that has killed 20 other people. A senior government official told CNN that the bus was on its way to Lam village near Nowshehra in Rajouri, 150 kilometers (93 miles) north of the city of Jammu, when fast water overturned it on a causeway. ""A massive operation is on to recover the bodies from the flooded stream. However, our efforts are being hampered by heavy rains and strong currents,"" said Jatinder Singh, a Rajouri district magistrate. He said the bus was carrying more than 50 passengers. ""Some passengers managed to jump off the bus. ... The exact number of passengers is not known yet. I don't think there will be any survivors now,"" he added. Heavy rain has been falling in Indian-administered Kashmir since Tuesday. The weather has put government authorities on high alert. Many villages and urban areas, including capital of Srinagar, have been inundated, with all waterways flowing above their danger marks. According to an official statement, flooding has claimed 20 other lives so far, and 50 homes have been damaged across the state. More than half a million sandbags have been prepared, the statement said, adding that people in flood areas are being told to move to safety. The Indian air force has been asked to keep an air rescue plan in place, the statement said. The local meteorological office has forecast no change in the weather until late Friday.

"(CNN) -- Joseph Wood snorted and struggled to breathe during his nearly two-hour lethal injection Wednesday, his attorney said. ""It took Joseph Wood two hours to die, and he gasped and struggled to breathe for about an hour and 40 minutes. We will renew our efforts to get information about the manufacturer of drugs as well as how Arizona came up with the experimental formula of drugs it used today,"" attorney Dale Baich said in a statement. He added: ""Arizona appears to have joined several other states who have been responsible for an entirely preventable horror -- a bungled execution."" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer had directed the Department of Corrections to review the process, saying she is concerned by the length of time it took to carry out the lethal injection. A federal judge ordered local officials to preserve all physical evidence in Wood's execution. ""One thing is certain, however, inmate Wood died in a lawful manner and by eyewitness and medical accounts he did not suffer. This is in stark comparison to the gruesome, vicious suffering that he inflicted on his two victims -- and the lifetime of suffering he has caused their family,"" Brewer said. Arizona's corrections department said in a statement that it followed protocol in Wood's execution, re-affirming his ""deep sedation"" seven times before he was pronounced dead. Aside from snoring, he did not make grimaces or otherwise move, the corrections department said. Wood was convicted of murder and assault in the 1989 deaths of his estranged girlfriend and her father. ""I don't believe he was gasping for air; I don't believe he was suffering. It sounded to me like was snoring,"" said Jeanne Brown, a relative of Wood's victims. ""You don't know what excruciating is. What's excruciating is seeing your dad laying there in a pool of blood, seeing you sister laying there in a pool of blood. This man deserved it. And I shouldn't really call him a man,"" she said. The execution procedure began at 1:52 p.m. (4:52 p.m. ET) and concluded, with Wood's being pronounced dead, at 3:49 p.m. (6:49 p.m. ET). Troy Hayden, a media witness from KSAZ, told reporters the execution was difficult to watch. He likened Wood's breathing to a ""fish gulping for air."" ""It was tough for everybody in that room,"" he said. Michael Kiefer, a reporter for The Arizona Republic, has witnessed five executions, including Wood's. ""Usually it takes about 10 minutes, the person goes to sleep. This was not that,"" he told reporters afterward. ""It started off looking as if it was going alright but then obviously something didn't go right. It took two hours."" Kiefer described the sound Wood made as a ""deep, snoring, sucking air sound."" Wood's attorneys had filed an emergency motion for a stay after his execution began, saying then that Wood had been ""gasping and snorting for more than an hour."" The motion read: ""He is still alive. This execution has violated Mr. Wood's Eighth Amendment right to be executed in the absence of cruel and unusual punishment. We respectfully request that this Court stop the execution and require that the Department of Corrections use the lifesaving provisions required in its protocol."" Inmate objected to drugs . Earlier, the Arizona Supreme Court lifted its brief stay of the murderer's execution. Wood was first set to be executed at 10 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET), though it was temporarily halted when the court said it would consider his request for the justices to review his claims. The court lifted the stay shortly after that, saying without explanation that it considered the request but decided not to review Wood's case. Wood was the latest American death row inmate to argue that an anesthetic recently introduced in some states' execution protocols could fail to sufficiently knock out the inmate ahead of the lethal drugs, subjecting the person to an agonizing death. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Wood claimed among other things that the state was going to use an ""experimental"" drug protocol of midazolam and hydromorphone. In documents filed with the state Supreme Court, he contended the use of the anesthetic midazolam was problematic in recent U.S. executions and that it would violate the Constitution's guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment. Wood was ""very concerned they were experimenting,"" said attorney Baich, who witnessed the execution. ""The room was silent. I was focusing on Mr. Wood. There were seven announcements during the process that Mr. Wood was still sedated. This is -- to confirm that he was still sedated. ""He was still breathing and struggling to breathe and gasping and snorting. I have witnessed 10 executions, and I had never seen that before,"" Baich told CNN. Opinion: I was 17, on death row -- and innocent . Controversial Oklahoma execution . Drugs weren't Wood's only contention. He also argued the execution should be stopped because his trial attorney was ineffective and that new evaluations from psychologists show he has cognitive impairments that would make him innocent of premeditated murder. Some states turned to midazolam this decade after they could no longer get sodium thiopental, a drug that was regularly used for executions. A U.S. manufacturer stopped producing sodium thiopental in 2009, and countries that still produce it won't allow its export to the United States for use in lethal injections. Earlier this year, Oklahoma put executions on hold after the controversial execution of Clayton Lockett. Midazolam was part of the injection combination, and it took 43 minutes for him to die, Oklahoma officials said. While state officials said Lockett was unconscious the entire time, a media witness for CNN affiliate KFOR said he uttered the words, ""Man,"" ""I'm not,"" and ""something's wrong,"" before blinds to the execution chamber were closed. His lawyer, Dean Sanderford, said the inmate's body twitched and convulsed before he died. Oklahoma's Department of Public Safety, acting on orders from Gov. Mary Fallin to get to the bottom of what happened, is investigating whether prison officials followed protocols. The review is also supposed to include recommendations about how to prevent something similar from happening again. ""It's time for Arizona and the other states still using lethal injection to admit that this experiment with unreliable drugs is a failure,"" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. ""Instead of hiding lethal injection under layers of foolish secrecy, these states need to show us where the drugs are come from. Until they can give assurances that the drugs will work as intended, they must stop future executions,"" it read. Mississippi mom swaps death row for jail cell to await trial .

"(CNN) -- ""I just love it when I get milk-to-dark converts,"" says Kerrin Rousset, as she prepares to lead a small cocoa-hungry crowd through the narrow streets of Zurich's Old Town. Rousset, who makes a living leading people to the city's finest chocolates, needn't worry too much -- we're already lost to the dark side. We've joined her on a sunny afternoon in Paradeplatz, outside the flagship shop of Sprungli, a high-quality chocolate maker known for its delicate Luxemburgerli bite-sized almond meringues. We're here because, although in Zurich you're never more than a praline's throw from an artisanal chocolatier (not that any sane person would throw away a perfectly good praline), it's surprisingly tricky to locate truly excellent chocolate. It's a task for a local connoisseur who's already cracked the cocoa code. Rousset is a New Yorker with bright eyes, an unbelievably slim figure and a constant smile fueled by chocolate. She's also the founder of the Sweet Zurich tour. A resident of Zurich for the past six years, Rousset shares her knowledge and passion about the small shops during tours she's been running since 2011. Outside Sprungli, Rousset steers us away from what we thought would be our first chocolate hit. ""You should definitely visit Sprungli while you are here,"" she says. ""The place is always lively, but it's not included in our tour as we will focus on the more hidden, artisanal shops that would be harder to discover on your own."" We follow obediently. A few minutes later, we're on a lively pedestrian street in the Old Town, sampling the wares in Honold, a family-owned confectionery and chocolate shop founded in 1905. Unexpected ingredients . I'm instantly hooked on Lotti's Best -- one of Rousset's suggestions -- a crumbly nougat feuilletine with tonka bean and a pinch of fleur de sel, covered with Criollo de Venezuela 65% and milk chocolate. Naturally, it's easier, and much more fun, to taste than to describe. During our next stops, we taste a variety of chocolate creations, often mixed with unexpected ingredients, such as lemongrass or galangal, that test our taste buds and preconceptions. ""The secret lies in the balance: if you find the correct one, then the combination simply works,"" Rousset says. Cupcakes are included in today's menu and we happily try the moist, light cakes with cream cheese toppings (a refreshing alternative to usual butter cream) and playful names such as Marilyn Monroe and Kokos Chanel. Between choc stops, we pause at some of the city's numerous fountains to cleanse our palates. With church bells in the background, we discuss all things chocolate, such as cocoa bean origins and cocoa percentages. We learn that, as with wines, it's important to know where the beans originate from, because their ""terroir"" significantly determines chocolate flavor. It transpires the cocoa percentage figure given on many chocolate bars merely indicates darkness and sugar content and is no reflection of quality. As well as feeding our chocolate-buzzed minds with facts about the world of cocoa, Rousset also tells us how she began leading tours of Zurich's sweet spots. Becoming a chocolate tour guide . ""When friends and family would come to visit, I would take them to my favorite sweet shops,"" she says. ""Of course we would go to Sprungli, a Zurich institution, but it was fun to go to the small local shops where the owners had become friends, where we would chat and taste lots, too."" While answering questions about Swiss confectionery on her blog, she realized that many of her friends who were either from Zurich or living there for years, didn't know about her favorite chocolate shops. That's when she decided to do something about it. Our sugary tour concludes in Conditorei Schober-Peclard, a legendary coffee house that's been successfully transformed into a pastry heaven. Owned by gastronome Michel Peclard, it's housed in an impressive 14th-century building with a lavish interior and photogenic ornamental cash register. The star here is the hot chocolate, which we taste in its cold edition, but there's an abundance of homemade pastries, cakes, ice creams and savory items. While we're recounting our favorite tastings from the evening, the manager invites us to taste his latest discovery, a surprisingly refreshing cold brew of coffee mixed with tonic water. Another great taste from the dark side. Tasting instructions . We ask Rousset to share her expertise on the art of proper chocolate tasting. ""Use all your senses to recognize and appreciate a good quality chocolate bar; look for a nice sheen, not too glossy nor dull,"" she says. ""Sound: Break off a piece and you should hear a distinct snap, letting you know it was well-tempered. ""Smell: There are countless aromas in cocoa beans, so you'll smell a variety of natural aromas from fruits to spices to nuts, depending on the origin of the bean. ""Taste: Let it melt in your mouth -- don't chew -- and you should taste several flavors and no bitterness. ""A sign of a good quality chocolate is when there are several stages of flavor -- they develop in your mouth as it melts. More importantly, the flavor doesn't just disappear after you swallow, but lingers.""

"(CNN) -- The World Cup isn't even a week old yet, but Wednesday could see defending champions Spain knocked out of the contest. If they lose to Chile and the Netherlands beat Australia, Spain won't make it out of the group stage. But the Spaniards will be going into the match with the wind at their backs. Spain has beaten Chile in eight of their last 10 matches. The other two were draws. But there is precedent for the defending champions to be knocked out in the group stage. It happened as recently as 2010 in South Africa, when the 2006 winners, Italy, came last in their group. And Spain got off to an abysmal start. Their 5-1 loss to the Netherlands was the worst defeat a defending champion has ever suffered in the World Cup. After the thrashing the Netherlands gave Spain, you might expect them to deal Australia a similar drubbing. Australia is the lowest-ranked team to make the World Cup this year. But in fact, the Netherlands have never beaten Australia. Granted, they've played each other only three times before. Australia won one, and the other two were draws. In the last match of the day, Cameroon plays Croatia, a game that should break a streak of poor results for one team or the other. Cameroon has lost five World Cup matches in a row. But Croatia has gone five without a win, losing three and drawing two. The two sides have never played each other before. Wednesday's dramas come a day after the 2014 World Cup's best attacking team met the tournament's best defensive team. The result was probably the greatest performance by a goalkeeper most football fans have ever seen.

"(CNN) -- Fresh from a victory that saw a pair of online-piracy bills shelved, Web-freedom advocates are now fighting to preserve their right to jailbreak their iPhones. The Electronic Freedom Foundation, a key player in the fight against the Stop Online Piracy Act, is urging people to ask the U.S. government to declare that hacking their own smartphone, tablet or other device is not a crime. ""Smartphones, tablets, and video game consoles are powerful computers with lots of untapped potential,"" the group says on its website. ""Yet many of these devices are set up to run only software that's been approved by the manufacturer. ""Modifying a device to run independent software -- known as jailbreaking -- is important to programmers, enthusiasts, and users."" ""Jailbreaking"" a phone gives users the ability to download unauthorized apps from any source. It's particularly popular on iPhones because of Apple's famously closed environment, which only allows apps bought from its own stores to be used on the phones. Jailbreaking also allows an owner to unlock their phone and switch mobile carriers. Apple's phones, and its iPads, typically come with an exclusive contract with a mobile provider (originally only AT&T in the United States, although Verizon and Sprint versions have been added). In July 2010, the U.S. Copyright Office issued a ruling that exempted jailbreaking from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) -- the same law used last week to shut down file-sharing site MegaUpload. Under DCMA, Apple had the right to request a $2,500 government fine for ""circumvention of technological measures."" That could be interpreted to extend to jailbreaking, since the iPhone's iOS software is copyrighted. Apple had never actually fined one of its customers, but maintained its right to do so and filed an objection to the copyright office's ruling while it was in the planning stages. The EFF is asking the copyright office to extend the 2010 exemption, which will otherwise expire this year, and add tablets like the iPad to it. They're also asking for a specific exemption for video-game consoles. The group is specifically asking ""people who depend on the ability to jailbreak to write, use, and/or tinker with independent software (from useful apps to essential security fixes)"" to contact the office. The Software Freedom Law Center, another group working on the issue, is asking that exemptions be extended to all personal computing devices. ""People must have the right to control the software running on devices they own,"" said Aaron Williamson, a lawyer with the group. ""That right is essential to the continued development of free and open source software and is foundational to our privacy, security, and freedom, online and off."" Apple did not respond to a request for a comment for this story. In the past, the company has said that jailbreaking, which voids an iPhone's warranty, can introduce bugs and other problems. ""Apple's goal has always been to insure that our customers have a great experience with their iPhone, and we know that jailbreaking can severely degrade the experience,"" a company spokeswoman said in response to the Copyright Office ruling in 2010. ""The vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iPhones.""","Advocates want iPhone 'jailbreaking' to stay legal .
Jailbreaking lets users change carriers or download apps not in the Apple store .
Groups also want a legal exemption added for iPads, video game consoles ."
"(CNN) -- He's the man who rolled into a bedroom in Abbottabad, Pakistan, raised his gun and shot Osama bin Laden three times in the forehead. Nearly two years later, the SEAL Team Six member is a secret celebrity with nothing to show for the deed; no job, no pension, no recognition outside a small circle of colleagues. Journalist Phil Bronstein profiled the man in the March issue of Esquire, calling him only the Shooter -- a husband, father and SEAL Team Six member who says he happened to pull the trigger on the notorious terrorist. It's a detailed account of how the raid unfolded, and what comes after for those involved. The headline splashed across the cover reads, ""The man who killed Osama bin Laden ... is screwed."" In a statement the Navy responded: ""We have no information to corroborate these new assertions. We take seriously the safety and security of our people, as well as our responsibility to assist sailors making a transition to civilian life. Without more information about this particular case, it would be difficult to determine the degree to which our transition programs succeeded."" ""They spent, in the case of the shooter, 16 years doing exactly what they're trained to do, which is going out on these missions, deployment after deployment, killing people on a regular basis, "" said Bronstein, executive chairman of the Center for Investigative Reporting. ""They finally get to the point where they don't want to do that anymore."" Bronstein reported that the man left SEAL Team Six in September. His family's health care coverage ceased. Because he retired before the 20-year mark, he gets no pension. The Shooter is judicious about the details of his story and hasn't been involved in dramatic books, movies or video games that will make millions for some. It's out of loyalty to his work and concern about his family's safety, Bronstein said. The shooter worries what could happen if his name went public, like Matt Bissonnette, the SEAL whose identity was revealed after he published the book ""No Easy Day"" using a pseudonym. CNN can't verify the account in Esquire, or the one in Bissonnette's book. Bronstein reported that the Shooter was offered some witness protection, but no such program exists yet. Home life is a struggle, too. The Shooter and his wife are separated, Bronstein wrote, although they live in the same house -- ""on very friendly, even loving terms"" -- to save money. He has done consulting work, Bronstein told CNN's Wolf Blitzer, but it's not clear how long it will last. ""They suddenly find themselves trying to translate into a civilian world that they're not used, and they haven't been used to for decades,"" Bronstein said. ""I think he has nightmares about how he's going to support his family, and how he's going to feed his family.""

"(CNN) -- For half a century, the world has applauded John Glenn as a heart-stirring American hero. He lifted the nation's spirits when, as one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts, he was blasted alone into orbit around the Earth; the enduring affection for him is so powerful that even now people find themselves misting up at the sight of his face or the sound of his voice. But for all these years, Glenn has had a hero of his own, someone who he has seen display endless courage of a different kind: . Annie Glenn. They have been married for 68 years. He is 90; she turned 92 on Friday. This weekend there has been news coverage of the 50th anniversary of Glenn's flight into orbit. We are being reminded that, half a century down the line, he remains America's unforgettable hero. He has never really bought that. Because the heroism he most cherishes is of a sort that is seldom cheered. It belongs to the person he has known longer than he has known anyone else in the world. John Glenn and Annie Castor first knew each other when -- literally -- they shared a playpen. In New Concord, Ohio, his parents and hers were friends. When the families got together, their children played. John -- the future Marine fighter pilot, the future test-pilot ace, the future astronaut -- was pure gold from the start. He would end up having what it took to rise to the absolute pinnacle of American regard during the space race; imagine what it meant to be the young John Glenn in the small confines of New Concord. Three-sport varsity athlete, most admired boy in town, Mr. Everything. Annie Castor was bright, was caring, was talented, was generous of spirit. But she could talk only with the most excruciating of difficulty. It haunted her. Her stuttering was so severe that it was categorized as an ""85%"" disability -- 85% of the time, she could not manage to make words come out. When she tried to recite a poem in elementary school, she was laughed at. She was not able to speak on the telephone. She could not have a regular conversation with a friend. And John Glenn loved her. Even as a boy he was wise enough to understand that people who could not see past her stutter were missing out on knowing a rare and wonderful girl. They married on April 6, 1943. As a military wife, she found that life as she and John moved around the country could be quite hurtful. She has written: ""I can remember some very painful experiences -- especially the ridicule."" In department stores, she would wander unfamiliar aisles trying to find the right section, embarrassed to attempt to ask the salesclerks for help. In taxis, she would have to write requests to the driver, because she couldn't speak the destination out loud. In restaurants, she would point to the items on the menu. A fine musician, Annie, in every community where she and John moved, would play the organ in church as a way to make new friends. She and John had two children; she has written: ""Can you imagine living in the modern world and being afraid to use the telephone? 'Hello' used to be so hard for me to say. I worried that my children would be injured and need a doctor. Could I somehow find the words to get the information across on the phone?"" John, as a Marine aviator, flew 59 combat missions in World War II and 90 during the Korean War. Every time he was deployed, he and Annie said goodbye the same way. His last words to her before leaving were: . ""I'm just going down to the corner store to get a pack of gum."" And, with just the two of them there, she was able to always reply: . ""Don't be long."" On that February day in 1962 when the world held its breath and the Atlas rocket was about to propel him toward space, those were their words, once again. And in 1998, when, at 77, he went back to space aboard the shuttle Discovery, it was an understandably tense time for them. What if something happened to end their life together? She knew what he would say to her before boarding the shuttle. He did -- and this time he gave her a present to hold onto: . A pack of gum. She carried it in a pocket next to her heart until he was safely home. Many times in her life she attempted various treatments to cure her stutter. None worked. But in 1973, she found a doctor in Virginia who ran an intensive program she and John hoped would help her. She traveled there to enroll and to give it her best effort. The miracle she and John had always waited for at last, as miracles will do, arrived. At age 53, she was able to talk fluidly, and not in brief, anxiety-ridden, agonizing bursts. John has said that on the first day he heard her speak to him with confidence and clarity, he dropped to his knees to offer a prayer of gratitude. He has written: ""I saw Annie's perseverance and strength through the years and it just made me admire her and love her even more."" He has heard roaring ovations in countries around the globe for his own valor, but his awe is reserved for Annie, and what she accomplished: ""I don't know if I would have had the courage."" Her voice is so clear and steady now that she regularly gives public talks. If you are lucky enough to know the Glenns, the sight and sound of them bantering and joking with each other and playfully finishing each others' sentences is something that warms you and makes you thankful just to be in the same room. Monday will be the anniversary of the Mercury space shot, and once again people will remember, and will speak of the heroism of Glenn the astronaut. But if you ever find yourself at an event where the Glenns are appearing, and you want to see someone so brimming with pride and love that you may feel your own tears start to well up, wait until the moment that Annie stands to say a few words to the audience. And as she begins, take a look at her husband's eyes. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"(CNN) -- After months of speculation and hype, the first biopic about Apple co-founder Steve Jobs hit theaters Friday. ""Jobs,"" directed by Joshua Michael Stern and starring Ashton Kutcher as the iconic tech guru, spans much of Jobs' early career, from his hippie days at Reed College in 1974 to the launch of the original iPod in 2001. And guess what? Although it omits or glosses over many chapters of Jobs' life, it's not bad. This is the first dramatic feature film to focus solely on the longtime Apple CEO, who died in 2011. A second Steve Jobs movie, written by Aaron Sorkin and adapted from the best-selling Jobs biography by Walter Isaacson, is due as early as next year. Jobs' tumultuous life could probably fill three movies. But ""Jobs"" focuses on his early years at Apple and ignores almost everything else. Even though the two-hour movie spans 27 years, it makes little or no mention of Jobs being adopted, his work at NeXT, his search for his biological father, his leadership of Pixar, his marriage to Laurene Powell, his late-career triumphs at Apple or the cancer that eventually killed him. It's probably just as well. A movie with all that would be fascinating. It would also be four hours long. Here are five things the movie gets right, and wrong. Surprise! Kutcher makes a convincing Steve Jobs . If you know as Kutcher only as the handsome dimwit from ""That '70s Show"" or lightweight movies like ""Valentine's Day,"" you may be pleasantly surprised. Thanks in part to some subtle hair and makeup effects, he looks a lot like the Apple co-founder in many scenes. Kutcher nails Jobs' speech patterns, distinctive gait, hunched posture and manner of pacing, hands clasped, when speaking to a group. Becoming Steve Jobs: Ashton Kutcher on his movie transformation . He projects the intelligence in Jobs' eyes and his impatience with people he felt were wasting his time. And he effectively captures both sides of the notoriously mercurial Jobs, who could be charismatic one moment and cruel the next. The movie does not have Kutcher portray the skeletal, cancer-stricken Jobs of the late 2000s, however. That would have been asking a lot. Apple was founded over ... a plate of fruit? The movie has some fun with the now-legendary story of how Jobs and Steve Wozniak launched Apple from the garage of Jobs' parents' house in Los Altos, California. Several real-life characters -- electrical engineer Rod Holt and early investor Mike Markkula -- show up at the house for the first time and gaze dubiously at Jobs' workspace and his motley crew of assistants. The scene where Jobs and Markkula negotiate Apple's first infusion of venture capital takes place in Jobs' parents' dining room, with his mother serving the confused Markkula bread and a plate of fruit. ""Steve's a fruitarian,"" one of his buddies says -- a reference to the unusual diet of her young son, who once went a whole week eating only apples. It's not clear whether such a scene actually took place. According to Isaacson's book, which was written with Jobs' cooperation, the early business plan for Apple was hammered out over a period of weeks at Markkula's house. There's no mention in the book of what they ate. Wozniak is almost a minor character . The shy Woz has never gotten enough credit for the early success of Apple, and he fades into the background in the movie as well, lost in the shadow cast by Jobs' larger-than-life persona. The real-life Wozniak didn't cooperate with the makers of ""Jobs"" -- he's apparently been consulting instead on the upcoming Sorkin biopic -- and maybe that explains why his role feels underwritten. The filmmakers also took some creative liberties with a few of Wozniak's most prominent scenes. One shows Wozniak startling Jobs in his office late one night in 1985 by telling him that he's leaving Apple. This never happened. In reality, Jobs found out about Wozniak's departure when news leaked out in The Wall Street Journal. The unassuming Woz, then working quietly as an engineer on the Apple II computer, didn't feel that his leaving the company was important enough to warrant telling Jobs directly. Jobs' dark side . The movie has several scenes of Jobs delivering dynamic speeches while reverent Apple employees respond with wild applause. But to its credit, the film doesn't sugarcoat the more difficult parts of his personality. One scene shows Jobs angrily kicking his girlfriend out of their house after she tells him she's pregnant with the child who would become his daughter, Lisa. It's not clear whether this actually happened, although in real life the couple broke up soon after and Jobs disavowed paternity of the child. Another shows him cheating Wozniak out of several thousand dollars' payment for their work on a video game for Atari, a deception documented in Isaacson's book. Jobs could be especially brutal with co-workers he did not respect. One scene shows him abruptly dismissing an engineer who did not share his enthusiasm for fonts. ""Are you firing me?"" the employee asks, surrounded by a roomful of stunned co-workers. ""No, I already fired you!"" Jobs yells back at him. ""Why are you still here?"" The movie also shows how Jobs coldly refused to give stock options to several of Apple's earliest employees, including his old college pal and roommate Daniel Kottke. ""Jobs"" milks this for drama in much the same way that ""The Social Network"" portrayed Mark Zuckerberg's betrayal of his Harvard classmate and Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin. The 'Think Different' ad . The film ends in 1997 with Jobs in a studio, recording voiceover narration for Apple's famous ""Think Different"" ad, the one that begins, ""Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels."" But while Jobs in real life did record his voice for the TV spot, he ended up choosing a version by actor Richard Dreyfuss instead. The movie's final frames play Jobs' (OK, Kutcher's) ""Think Different"" narration over romanticized images of Apple engineers. Coincidentally, that is almost the same ending that Sorkin favors for his version of the Jobs story. We'll have to wait to find out which works best.","Jobs,"" starring Ashton Kutcher in the iconic role, hits theaters Friday .

"(CNN) -- South Africa's tourist industry happily blew its own vuvuzuela Monday, reporting a half-billion dollars in receipts from hosting this year's FIFA World Cup matches. The tournament brought more than 309,000 visitors to South Africa and generated more than $520 million dollars in added revenue to the tourism industry, South African Tourism Minister Marthinus van Schalkwyk announced. ""I can today say without a doubt that the success of the event will reverberate for many years to come,"" van Schalkwyk said in a statement announcing the final tally. Speaking days after FIFA officials awarded Qatar the 2022 World Cup -- a controversial move many say will scare off fans --van Schalkwyk said that pre-tournament fears that the long travel distances, high airline ticket costs and fear of crime would deter travelers from coming to South Africa turned out to be unfounded. ""The World Cup also attracted a large number of first-time visitors to South Africa, particularly from the Americas,"" he said. The ministry's survey found that 59% of people making the trip to South Africa for the World Cup were first-time visitors. Fans from other African nations made up the biggest share of visitors, at 38%, while nearly a quarter were from Europe. Another 13% were from Central and South America, and just over 10% came from North America, the survey showed. And despite complaints about the buzz of the vuvuzelas and the occasional official's call, most fans said they were happy with the hosts. Of those surveyed, 90% said they thought the South African venues were nicer than expected. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report.","The tournament brought 309,000 visitors to South Africa, the government reports .

"MODESTO, California (CNN) -- The photograph became an icon of the Great Depression: a migrant mother with her children burying their faces in her shoulder. Katherine McIntosh was 4 years old when the photo was snapped. She said it brought shame -- and determination -- to her family. Katherine McIntosh holds the photograph taken with her mother in 1936. ""I wanted to make sure I never lived like that again,"" says McIntosh, who turns 77 on Saturday. ""We all worked hard and we all had good jobs and we all stayed with it. When we got a home, we stayed with it."" McIntosh is the girl to the left of her mother when you look at the photograph. The picture is best known as ""Migrant Mother,"" a black-and-white photo taken in February or March 1936 by Dorothea Lange of Florence Owens Thompson, then 32, and her children. Lange was traveling through Nipomo, California, taking photographs of migrant farm workers for the Resettlement Administration. At the time, Thompson had seven children who worked with her in the fields.  See Lange's photos of the migrant family » . ""She asked my mother if she could take her picture -- that ... her name would never be published, but it was to help the people in the plight that we were all in, the hard times,"" McIntosh says. ""So mother let her take the picture, because she thought it would help.""  Watch a Depression-era daughter's recollections » . The next morning, the photo was printed in a local paper, but by then the family had already moved on to another farm, McIntosh says. ""The picture came out in the paper to show the people what hard times was. People was starving in that camp. There was no food,"" she says. ""We were ashamed of it. We didn't want no one to know who we were."" The photograph helped define the Great Depression, yet McIntosh says her mom didn't let it define her, although the picture ""was always talked about in our family."" ""It always stayed with her. She always wanted a better life, you know."" Her mother, she says, was a ""very strong lady"" who liked to have a good time and listen to music, especially the yodeler named Montana Slim. She laughs when she recalls her brothers bringing home a skinny greyhound pooch. ""Mom, Montana Slim is outside,"" they said. Thompson rushed outside. The boys chuckled. They had named the dog after her favorite musician. ""She was the backbone of our family,"" McIntosh says of her mom. ""We never had a lot, but she always made sure we had something. She didn't eat sometimes, but she made sure us children ate. That's one thing she did do."" Her memories of her youth are filled with about 50 percent good times, 50 percent hard times. It was nearly impossible to get an education. Children worked the fields with their parents. As soon as they'd get settled at a school, it was time to pick up and move again. Her mom would put newborns in cotton sacks and pull them along as she picked cotton. The older kids would stay in front, so mom could keep a close eye on them. ""We would pick the cotton and pile it up in front of her, and she'd come along and pick it up and put it in her sack,"" McIntosh says.  Watch ""we would go home and cry"" » . They lived in tents or in a car. Local kids would tease them, telling them to clean up and bathe. ""They'd tell you, 'Go home and take a bath.' You couldn't very well take a bath when you're out in a car [with] nowhere to go."" She adds, ""We'd go home and cry."" McIntosh now cleans homes in the Modesto, California, area. She's proud of the living she's been able to make -- that she has a roof over her head and has been able to maintain a job all these years. She says her obsession to keep things clean started in her youth when her chore was to keep the family tent clean. There were two white sheets that she cleaned each day. ""Even today, when it comes to cleaning, I make sure things are clean. I can't stand dirty things,"" she says with a laugh. With the nation sinking into tough economic times and analysts saying the current economic crisis is the worst since the Great Depression, McIntosh says if there's a lesson to be learned from her experience it is to save your money and don't overextend yourself. iReport: Are you worried about losing your job? ""People live from paycheck to paycheck, even people making good money,"" she says. ""Do your best to make sure it doesn't happen again. Elect the people you think is going to do you good."" Her message for President-elect Barack Obama is simple: ""Think of the middle-class people."" She says she'll never forget the lessons of her hard-working mother, who died at the age of 80 in 1983. Her gravestone says: ""Migrant Mother: A Legend of the strength of American motherhood."" ""She was very strict, but very loving and caring. She cared for us all,"" McIntosh says.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi government has aired videos showing three men, who claim to be members of the ousted Baath Party, saying they were involved in last month's devastating Baghdad attacks. In recent months the Iraqi government has played a number of such videos for reporters. Many Iraqis have voiced skepticism about their authenticity. In the videos shown Sunday, the men said they were Baath Party members who were involved in planning and executing the October 25 bombings at government buildings. The two suicide vehicle bombings that struck the Ministry of Justice and other government buildings in October killed 160 Iraqis and wounded more than 500. It was Iraq's deadliest attack in more than two years. The attacks mirrored a pair of bombings on August 19 at the Foreign and Finance Ministries that killed more than 100 people and wounded hundreds more. The Islamic State in Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, claimed responsibility for both the August and October attacks. The Iraqi government has said both attacks were a coordinated effort by Baath loyalists and al Qaeda in Iraq. In recent weeks, the government and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki have stepped up the anti-Baath rhetoric ahead of the country's upcoming national elections, an escalation that some fear is a political ploy to keep some Sunni Arab candidates from running in the elections. Sunni Arabs -- a minority in now-Shiite-led Iraq -- dominated Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, which ran the country for decades and persecuted majority Shiites and minority Kurds. The party is illegal in Iraq now, and most of its former mid- and high-level officials are banned from government jobs. In an interview with al-Iraqia State TV on Sunday night, which re-aired on Monday, government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said the attacks originated from people in Syria. Al-Dabbagh cautioned that the Iraqi government is not accusing the Syrian government of involvement. He said a group based in Syria was planning and carrying out the attacks. He said the confessions shown Sunday were only a part of the information and confessions the government has. After the August bombings, tensions between Iraq and neighboring Syria reached an all-time high and both countries withdrew their ambassadors. Iraq accused Syria of harboring Baath Party members who, it said, were financing and planning the attacks in Iraq. Earlier in August, al-Maliki and a high-level delegation visited Damascus and asked the Syrian government to hand over a number of mid-level and senior Baathists living in Syria. Syria refused, and the Iraqis accused Syria of supporting the August attacks by providing a refuge for Baathists who were working with al Qaeda in Iraq. In late August, Syria repeated its willingness to help the Iraqis investigate the bombings and discounted the tapes the government had released as fabricated evidence. ""Syria informed the Iraqi side of its readiness to receive an Iraqi delegation to inspect the evidence available to them concerning the bombings' perpetrators,"" a Syrian official said, according to SANA, the state-run news agency. ""Otherwise Syria considers what has been broadcast through the Iraqi media as mere fabricated evidence intended to serve internal political goals, and the conflicting and contradicting statements by the Iraqi officials are proof of that."" The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, told reporters last week that investigations into the October bombings were under way and a number of suspects were in custody. He said al Qaeda in Iraq has teamed up with remnants of the Baath Party -- a statement that gave more weight to the Iraqi government's claims. ""We have been able to significantly reduce the capability of several groups to include al Qaeda and some of the Sunni rejectionist groups, so what I think we have seen happen over the last year or so is that these groups have started to work together. And so they have started to coalesce, especially at the local level. ... So it blurs the lines sometimes. And I think sometimes it's semantics. Some people say al Qaeda, some people call them Baathists. I would argue that they are probably both involved, they are coordinating at the local level,"" Odierno said. When asked if there was any indication the attacks came from Syria, Odierno said: ""I think my experience is that there probably was some movement of fighters or explosives coming in from Syria. But again, we will continue to work our way through that."" Odierno and Iraqi officials have warned that they expect more such high-profile attacks before the January national elections, the country's second national vote since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. ""We believe there will be attempts to conduct more attacks between now and the elections, because they want to destabilize those. We are working hard with Iraqi security force partners to come up with a comprehensive strategy to stop that, we are increasing efforts, the Iraqis are increasing efforts in the belts around Baghdad and Mosul. ... We are increasing our efforts on the borders and we are increasing our counterterrorism targeting, and the tempo of that has increased significantly over the last month or so,"" Odierno said.","Iraqi officials air videos showing alleged confessions by Baath Party members .

"(CNN) -- Spanish champions Barcelona were held to a battling 0-0 draw by Athletic Bilbao in their Spanish Cup last-16 first-leg tie at the Nou Camp on Tuesday night. Pep Guardiola's side came into the match in a blistering run of form which had seen them score 20 goals in their last five matches -- and were seeking their 11th consecutive win in all competitions. However, despite Guardiola selecting a strong line-up, Bilbao defended superbly to become only the second team this season to prevent Barcelona from scoring. Rafa Benitez's old tricks backfire in Italy . Despite their failure to score, a 1-1 draw in the return leg at San Mames in two weeks' time will see Barca qualify for the quarterfinals on the away goals rule. The winners of the tie, which is a repeat of the 2009 final which Barca won 4-1, will face Getafe or Real Betis for a place in the last four of the competition. Elsewhere in the Spanish Cup, Deportivo La Coruna are favorites to reach the last eight after a 1-1 first leg draw at Cordoba, while the late game between near-neighbors Valencia and Villarreal also ended in a 0-0 draw. Meanwhile, Schalke and Hoffenheim have reached the quarterfinals of the German Cup after last-16 wins on Tuesday. Jefferson Farfan scored a late winner as Schalke triumphed 1-0 at second division club Augsburg, while Hoffenheim secured a 2-0 home win over fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach.","Spanish champions Barcelona are held to a battling 0-0 draw by Athletic Bilbao .

"(CNN) -- A Scottish cardinal who had earlier challenged allegations of sexual impropriety -- claims that once again shined an international spotlight on alleged sexual abuse involving Roman Catholic clergy -- reversed course Sunday and apologized. ""I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal,"" Cardinal Keith O'Brien said in a statement. Until days ago, O'Brien was the archbishop of St. Andrews and Edinburgh. He has been dogged by allegations he abused four men studying to be priests in the 1980s. ""In recent days certain allegations which have been made against me have become public. Initially, their anonymous and non-specific nature led me to contest them,"" O'Brien said. ""To those I have offended, I apologize and ask forgiveness."" O'Brien, 74, also apologized to ""the Catholic Church and people of Scotland."" He did not explain exactly what ""conduct"" he was referring to. O'Brien told Pope Benedict XVI in November that he would resign effective his upcoming birthday, on March 17. But Benedict decided to make the resignation effective immediately in light of the pope's imminent resignation, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. According to his biography on his archdiocese's website, O'Brien asked to step down in light of his ""approaching ... 75th birthday (and) health concerns."" Meanwhile, he had been thrust into the ongoing story about sexual abuse in the church after the British newspaper The Observer reported that three priests and one former priest, as long as 30 years ago, had accused O'Brien. The Observer did not recount the details of the claims or identify the men but said one of the priests alleged ""the cardinal developed an inappropriate relationship with him."" The Scottish Catholic Media Office said then that O'Brien contested the claims and was ""taking legal advice."" The same office released O'Brien's new statement on Sunday. Born in Northern Ireland, O'Brien moved to Scotland as a child, graduating in 1959 from the University of Edinburgh. Ordained as a priest six years later at age 29, he later held various positions -- including as a math and science teacher, as well as rector and spiritual director -- at schools in Scotland, in addition to working as a priest. He was named archbishop in 1985 and became a cardinal 18 years later. Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles, meanwhile, is facing fresh attention over what role he may have played in the cover-up of sexual abuse by priests. The Vatican has also been plagued by another scandal in recent days, as Benedict was ending his papacy. Two Italian publications said Benedict, 85, resigned not because of his advanced age but because of a brewing scandal over the blackmail of gay priests by male prostitutes in Rome. Benedict received a 300-page report in December detailing the possible blackmail, la Repubblica newspaper and the Panorama news weekly reported, citing an unidentified senior Vatican official and dozens of unnamed sources. The Vatican emphatically denied the allegations, with Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone criticizing a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" as the cardinals prepare for their conclave to select a new pope. CNN's Matt Smith, Laura Smith-Spark, Greg Botelho and Hada Messia contributed to this report.","Cardinal Keith O'Brien apologizes and asks forgiveness from those he ""offended""

"(CNN) -- Duke men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, affectionately known by fans and players as ""Coach K,"" surpassed the all-time record for wins in men's major college basketball with a victory Tuesday night against Michigan State at New York's Madison Square Garden. The win, number 903 of his coaching career, broke a tie with Bobby Knight, who was Krzyzewski's college coach and his mentor. Duke beat Michigan State 74-69. It adds to an impressive array of statistics: 466 weeks ranked among the nation's top 25 men's teams, 12 times national coach of the year, 11 Final Four appearances, and four national championships. But, Krzyzewski said in a news conference earlier this week on campus, this moment almost didn't happen. He offered his resignation in the mid 1990s when he was battling illness, but that resignation was turned down. His reaction? Thank goodness. Krzyzewski said Duke University athletic director Tom Butters told him, ""We're not doing that. That's not appropriate."" ""And he was right, which he was just about most of the time about things -- except my first salary,"" Krzyzewski said. His career, including 32 years at Duke, has encompassed some of the most memorable moments in basketball, including beating the dominant UNLV Runnin' Rebels on the way to his first NCAA national championship in 1991 and leading the 2008 ""Redeem Team"" to an Olympic Gold medal in Beijing. Time magazine and CNN named him ""America's Best Coach in 2001."" Admiration for Krzyzewski extends beyond sportswriters and critics to include students and worldwide fans of the team. Students camp out in tents for days in advance to secure entrance to key games, creating a small community known as Krzyzewskiville. He's been known to treat the fans who camp out to pizzas while they wait in line or even a pregame strategy session in the school's gym. Anna Levina, a Duke graduate who joined other alumni at the game, said, ""We were sitting with a lot of fans who were rooting for Michigan State...and when we won, they just stopped talking."" At the end of the game, ""everyone stood, and everyone cheered. It was absolutely awesome.""","Duke's Krzyzewski surpasses Bobby Knight in men's major college basketball .

"(CNN) -- At least 1,000 prisoners are on death row in Iraq, which now has one of the highest rates of execution in the world, the human rights group Amnesty International says in a report being released Tuesday. Samar Saed Abdullah is one of many facing execution in Iraq. She's accused of being an accessory to murders. The courts that sentence people to death do not meet international standards, the report charged, and Iraqi authorities ""provide very little information on executions, and some have been carried out secretly."" It criticizes the Central Criminal Court of Iraq and the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, which issue the majority of death sentences in the country. ""Defendants commonly complain that 'confessions' were extracted from them under torture,"" the report alleges. ""Defendants also complain that they are not able to choose their own defense lawyers"" when they appear before the Central Criminal Court of Iraq. But Iraqi Justice Minister Dara Noor al-Deen Bahaa al-Deen, who said he says he is in favor of abolishing the death penalty, defended the Iraqi justice system, saying it is fair. ""As a judge, I assert that these measures take place with every crime that occurs. Of course, every defendant claims innocence and that the trial is unfair, but I am certain and reassured that -- especially now -- that any defendant, no matter what the sentence is, receives a fair trial and is given enough time for his testimony, that of the witnesses,"" al-Deen said. ""Afterward, the court makes its ruling. If it finds that the evidence is sufficient that he/she committed the crime, it hands down the sentence he/she deserves.""  Watch more about Amnesty's report and a woman on Iraq's death row » . Trials at the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, which tries former Saddam Hussein-era officials charged with crimes against humanity and other major offenses, ""have been marred by political interference,"" Amnesty charges. The group says the trial of Hussein himself was subject to such interference, with the government dismissing a judge considered unlikely to support the death sentence against him. The former Iraqi leader was hanged in December 2006. The report says that Iraqi President Jalal Talabani opposes the death penalty but has refused to block executions. And it quotes Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as ""repeatedly"" defending the death penalty. Amnesty International opposes it ""in all cases without exception,"" the group says in its report. The report lists a wide variety of crimes that can result in the death penalty, including murder, crimes compromising state security, attempting to overthrow the government by violent means and damaging public property. When asked by CNN about pleas not to execute women on death row, many of them mothers, al-Deen said, ""For us, there is no difference between men and women who commit crimes. A person who commits a crime should be punished. In general, this can't happen now or in a year or two, but I hope in the future, the death penalty would be abolished, because I am personally in favor of life sentences rather than the death penalty."" Al-Deen said a request by him to waive the death penalty would have no effect. ""Even if I put in a request, this is a worthless request, because there is a law. As for abolishing the death sentence and replacing it with life imprisonment, that is an amendment of the law, and that has to happen through parliament. And parliament as the representative of the people decides if the punishment changes or doesn't,"" he said. Responding to a reference to ""hasty rulings,"" he said, ""I don't think the judiciary rushes to make a ruling, especially a death penalty for a convict. There are many severe sentences that were handed down, and when they reached the appeals court, they were returned back and changed."" Amnesty International provided CNN with a copy of the report ahead of its publication. The report appears to be based on media reports and information from the Iraqi Interior Ministry and Ministry of Human Rights. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Amnesty International says nation has one of world's highest execution rates .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Iraq has signed troop withdrawal agreements that will have British and Australian troops out of the country by the end of July, Iraqi Defense Ministry said. A British soldier stands guard outside as Iraqi teens look on. Iraqi Defense Minister Abdul Qadir Mohammed Jasim signed the agreements on Tuesday with UK Ambassador Christopher Prentice and Australian ambassador Robert Tyson. Iraq's Presidency Council approved a resolution Sunday to allow non-U.S. troops to remain in the county after a U.N. mandate expires at the end of the year. It was the last step for final adoption of the resolution, which won parliamentary approval last week. The resolution was hammered out by Iraq's main political parties earlier in December after an impasse among parliamentary factions that threatened to push it beyond the deadline. Britain has 4,100 troops in Iraq, the second-largest contingent after the United States with 142,500. Other countries covered under the new resolution -- El Salvador, Australia, Romania and Estonia -- now have just several hundred troops in the country combined. The resolution authorizes Iraq to negotiate bilateral agreements with the countries, said Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman. If it had not been approved by the end of the year, those countries would have been in Iraq illegally. The United States concluded a separate agreement in November with the Iraqi government authorizing the continued presence of its troops.

"(CNN) -- Too soon? While many are still mourning the loss of comedic icon Joan Rivers, Texas Gov. Rick Perry invoked her death to defend a controversial abortion bill he signed last year. ""It was interesting that when Joan Rivers -- and the procedure that she had done, where she died -- that was (at) a clinic. It's a curious thought that if they had had that type of regulations in place, whether or not that individual would be still alive,"" Perry said at a Texas Tribune event Sunday. The regulation Perry referenced requires abortion clinics in Texas to meet the same facility standards as ambulatory surgery clinics in the state. Critics contend that the law is one of the most restrictive in the nation, but Perry told the audience that he supports the measure. ""The will of the Texas legislature -- which I agree with -- (says) that it is a state's right to put particular types of considerations into place -- to put rules and regulations into place -- to make a clinic be as safe as a hospital,"" Perry said.

Darsh Patel, 22, a senior majoring in information technology and informatics, was killed in a heavily wooded area known as the Apshawa Preserve after becoming separated from a group of four friends with whom he was hiking, West Milford Township Police Chief Timothy Storbeck said in a statement. ""The group of five hikers encountered a black bear in the woods that began to follow them, they became frightened and attempted to flee the area,"" the statement said. ""During the confusion, the group became separated as they ran in different directions."" Four of the young men later found one another and contacted police.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Five U.S. servicemembers were killed Monday in central Iraq, the U.S. military said in a written statement. The deaths are the single largest loss of life among U.S. troops in Iraq since 2009, and they come as Iraq debates whether to request U.S. troops stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline that requires 46,000 American forces out of the country. The U.S. military did not say how or where the five died. But two Iraqi security officials told CNN Monday that the servicemembers were killed during an early morning mortar attack at a U.S. military base in southeastern Baghdad. Five servicemembers also were wounded in the attack, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information. The two officials said some of those killed and wounded were sleeping in trailers when the base was attacked. U.S. Army Sgt. First Class Anishka J. Calder, a spokeswoman in Baghdad, declined to comment on details surrounding the deaths. The names of the servicemembers were being withheld pending notification of next of kin, the military said in the statement. The deaths follow warnings by the U.S. military that attacks against American troops in Iraq by armed militias are on the rise, an attempt to demonstrate their power ahead of an anticipated U.S. withdrawal at the end of the year. U.S. troops have increasingly been targeted by roadside bombings and mortar attacks, largely in Baghdad and southern Iraq, Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, spokesman for U.S. Forces-Iraq, recently told CNN.

Meanwhile Monday, 20 Iraqis were killed in a series of explosions across the country. The deadliest attack was in Tikrit, where a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into a security checkpoint staffed by Iraqi army and police, killing 11 people and wounding 17 others, according to Interior Ministry officials who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

"Washington (CNN) -- A classified U.S. intelligence analysis says it is most likely that pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine fired the missile that downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, CNN has learned. A U.S. defense official with direct access to the latest information detailed the analysis to CNN but declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. The preliminary analysis concludes the missile was from a Russian-made Buk system, known as the SA-11 among NATO forces, the official said. U.S. military intelligence analysts concluded only the SA-11 or the SA-20 has the warhead, range and ability to shoot down an airliner, the official said. The Ukrainians are not believed to have an SA-20 system, and there is no intelligence suggesting Russia ever transferred one across the border. However, U.S. intelligence has concluded that pro-Russian separatists have a Buk system. The official says it's unclear if the separatists captured it from Ukraine or Russia transferred it to them. The U.S. military and intelligence community expect to have a more definitive assessment of what happened by the end of the weekend. ""We want to put together a solid picture"" on each element of the event, the official said. That assessment is expected to remain classified for now, but will be shared among NATO nations, the official said. It may eventually be shared publicly to show what the United States believes happened. ""We cannot say with complete certainty, but we do not think the missile came from the Russian side of the border,"" the official said. ""All the indications are it was fired from inside eastern Ukraine."" The initial assessment also suggests separatists thought they were shooting at a Ukrainian military transport plane. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's top military commander, who also is head of the U.S. European Command, is leading much of the U.S. military's technical intelligence effort looking at all satellite, radar and other intelligence data from the area. He is coordinating with other NATO members and east European nations in the region scouring their radar and intelligence assets to see if there is specific data showing the event. For now, the United States has some data that shows a missile launch system was turned on and operating in the area at the time of the plane's downing as well as separate data that shows a heat signature of a major event, believed to be the plane being shot down.

"(CNN) -- With a name like Chiqui Cartagena, you can't escape the fact that you're different from your classmates in school. From the first grade on, I was constantly looked down upon and treated differently -- and sometimes not so nicely. I'm an Army brat. My father was a decorated veteran of the Puerto Rican 65th Infantry Regiment that bravely fought in the Korean War. When he left the armed forces, he became a corporate executive for General Electric in Spain, which is where I grew up from the age of 6 until I was 21 years old. When I came to the U.S. to finish my education and became a journalist, I was fascinated by how little people really understood Latinos. So I have spent my whole professional life helping my fellow Americans understand who we are. The last two Census reports and presidential elections have certainly elevated the awareness of the power and growth of the U.S. Latino community, especially in certain sectors, politics being one of them. But there is still a lot of ignorance about the important impact Hispanics are having on every sector of the U.S. economy. U.S. Latino population is growing fast, and traditional demographic patterns are shifting . There are seven sectors of business -- retail, food, entertainment, financial services, etc. -- that offer companies unprecedented domestic growth opportunities, if only they will focus their efforts on marketing to Hispanics. But business leaders don't feel like they know how to take the proper steps to capitalize on their Hispanic opportunity, so they don't do anything at all. On average, only 5% to 6% of all advertising budgets is allocated to marketing to Latinos, who already represent 17% of the total population and 20% or more of key demographic groups -- children, teens, and millennials. Clearly, there is a fundamental gap between awareness of the need to start marketing to Latinos and the ability to do so. Business leaders often don't know where to begin. It all feels very scary to them -- partly because for so long, language has been the main way people think about Hispanic marketing, when in fact, it's all about culture and creating marketing campaigns that are culturally relevant. Fewer Latinos will speak Spanish, more non-Latinos will . When minorities in general make up almost half of all millennials -- with Hispanics accounting for nearly 25% of them and growing at the fastest pace -- this is an opportunity you can no longer ignore. How can you have a millennial strategy without asking yourself ""What about Hispanics?"" You simply can't afford to leave out one quarter of your target simply because you don't know how to talk to them. If you do, chances are your competition will figure it out and you will lose in the long term. Hispanics are creating a new baby boom in the United States. Think of it this way: Every 30 seconds, two non-Hispanics reach retirement age and one Latino turns 18. Like the baby boomers before us, the Latino baby boom will affect every aspect of American life over the next 50 years. Do you want to be the one missing out on this opportunity? I think not. Although I have spent the last month giving speeches about the importance of the Latino community as part of various events celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month, I feel like the designation of Hispanic Heritage Month is becoming an anachronism. In many ways the influence of Hispanics on America can be felt every day. Does Hispanic Heritage Month matter? From the grocery aisle where you pick up your Corona beer and your dulce de leche ice cream, to the Billboard charts where Pitbull, Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez routinely dominate, to the lunch you order at Chipotle or Panera or, in fact, at the great American fast feeder, McDonald's -- the Latino effect is everywhere. The media and both political parties now readily acknowledge that it was the influence of the Latino vote in the key swing states that got President Barack Obama re-elected last year. In fact, just two weeks ago, Mitt Romney said that insufficient Hispanic outreach was his largest error in 2012. The story behind Hispanic Heritage Month . ""The largest strategic error was not investing sufficiently, particularly in Hispanic TV and Hispanic outreach to help Hispanic voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity,"" Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper of the lesson to be learned for GOP presidential campaigns of the future. Funny, because just this past summer, Univision Network made history when it came in first place during the July sweeps, beating ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox in the much coveted demographic of adults 18-34.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's army had nothing to do with the shooting of an opposition leader in downtown Bangkok, a military spokesman said Friday. The Thursday incident is under investigation, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, an Army spokesman. Violence erupted during anti-government protests in Thailand on Thursday as one demonstrator was killed and the key protest leader was shot in the head while being interviewed by journalists. Tension soared amid the sound of explosions and gunfire and an anarchic mob atmosphere in downtown Bangkok's Lumpini Park, where protesters had massed. Video footage showed one protester dead on the pavement. There was also footage of Red Shirt movement leader Maj. Gen. Khattiya Sawasdipol lying on the ground, dressed in camouflage, as frantic protesters attempted to move him and get help. Tom Fuller of the International Herald Tribune told CNN he was among those interviewing the renegade general -- better known as Seh Daeng, or Red Commander -- when he was shot. One of the more radical leaders in Thailand's wide-ranging protest movement, Khattiya appeared to be bleeding from a head wound. Footage from the hospital showed medics covering his face as he was brought in on a stretcher amid a throng of media. He was in critical condition, his guards said. While it was unknown whether Thailand's military or government was behind the shooting, the government has previously made it clear it would shoot at what it called armed terrorists. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A policeman who saw Khattiya's wounds told CNN that he might have been shot by a sniper. Khattiya's shooting increased volatility on the streets. More gunfire rang out afterward, according to witnesses. It was not immediately clear whether they stemmed from Red Shirt retaliation. The Thai news agency MCOT said police reported 20 people were wounded Thursday. What are protests about? The violence erupted after Thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the Bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month. Officials had said soldiers would seal off roads and shut down rail service leading to the Ratchaprasong intersection at 6 p.m. (7 a.m. ET) Thursday. However, the road on the park's eastern border remained open as of about 8 p.m. A few soldiers were present. The United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD), the formal name of the Red Shirts, greeted the government's announcement with defiance. ""We want peace but they want war,"" said Weng Tojirakarn, a party leader. ""We will fight with our bare hands. We will stay."" Authorities had initially threatened to shut off power, cut supplies and seal off the intersection at midnight Thursday. They postponed the plan because they wanted to limit the impact on area residents, said Panitan Wattanayakorn, the acting government spokesman. The Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation in Bangkok said it has now asked businesses in the area to shut down until the situation is resolved. iReport: Mood grows subdued at protest camps . The government said it has been forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by Wednesday. The UDD has turned the posh commercial center into a fortress of tires and bamboo sticks as they continued to demand that Abhisit dissolve the lower house of Parliament and call new elections. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Spokesman Panitan said continuing protests by Red Shirts would affect the proposed election date of November 14. He said Abhisit had mentioned that the proposed date for the new election had been made with the condition that the Red Shirts stop their protests. ""He never said he withdrew his proposal,"" Panitan said. iReport: Are you there? Send your images, video . More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died in police-protester clashes in the ongoing unrest. Over the weekend, two Thai police officers were killed and eight people wounded in violence that began Friday night and lasted into early Saturday.

"(CNN) -- It was bound to happen eventually. But Marc Marquez has looked so utterly indomitable since the start of the MotoGP season in March, that it still felt strange when it did. The immaculate Spaniard finally succumbed to racing mortality in the Czech Republic, failing to win for the first time in 2014. The fact that he didn't even make the podium in Brno just over two weeks ago made it seem even stranger. This Sunday, at one of motorsport's fastest and most famous tracks -- the UK's Silverstone -- Marquez will be seeking to bounce back. What's more, the youngest world champion in motorcycling's elite class is feeling relaxed now that his record-equaling 10-race winning run has ended. ""I feel a little bit less pressure,"" he told CNN this week, ""because nobody will ask me again if I can win all the races."" The brutally quick Silverstone circuit is also one that the ever-smiling 21-year-old enjoys, in spite of the dependably capricious British weather. ""I always feel good there, and we try to be ready for rain conditions and for dry conditions because the forecast is really unstable, but this year looks okay -- we will try to enjoy it, and try to do our best,"" said the Honda rider, who last year finished second at Silverstone in his debut season in MotoGP. Marquez's teammate and compatriot Dani Pedrosa finally managed to put one over on his young rival in Brno, and goes into the race contented following his first victory since Malaysia last October. He is second overall in the standings, 77 points behind Marquez with seven races to go. ""We had a great weekend in Brno and a good test on the Monday,"" said the 28-year-old, who was third here in 2013. ""We had quite a good race here last year, I had to recover some gap to the front but it was good. I'm happy to be here and the weather is looking good, so hopefully we can have a strong weekend."" Former champion Jorge Lorenzo, seeking to improve on two consecutive runner-up finishes, is sensing that the season might be finally coming together for him and his factory Yamaha. ""After three consecutive podiums I feel good,"" said the Spaniard, who has won at Silverstone three of the past last four years. ""Last weekend in Brno we found some good solutions that surely will give us at least a tenth (of a second) in the next races."" Almost 160,000 spectators swarmed to last year's British MotoGP, and those gathering this year will dine on an unexpected feast of homegrown riders in the premier class. Among them is Scott Redding, a rookie MotoGP rider who knows all about beating Marquez -- because he's done it, albeit in the sport's lower classes. Redding won the Moto2 race here last year, and also triumphed in the 125 cc class back in 2008 as a 15-year-old. He's been on podium four out of six times at his home event. ""I like the character of Silverstone, a fast-flowing track, big open areas, with speed, and that's what gives you adrenaline,"" the 21-year-old said. Redding also enjoys the atmosphere of his home crowd: ""I don't look at it as pressure. I look at it as support. I feel like every one of the fans that are cheering -- even if they're cheering for Marc Marquez -- it feels like they're cheering for me."" Riding an Open-class Gresini Honda means, however, that he will not be troubling the podium this year -- his bike is way off the pace. ""It is a bit annoying and it does disappoint me a bit,"" he explained. Rumors that Redding will be riding a factory spec bike next year are welcomed by Marquez. ""I hope Scott is on a factory Honda next year as I think he's got good potential,"" the world champion told Bike Social. ""I enjoyed riding with him in Moto2, he's a really good rider, really aggressive and keeps pushing all the time."" Bradley Smith, riding for the satellite Yamaha Tech team, is currently the Briton most likely to break into the top five. With the ink barely dry on a new contract for next season, the thoughtful 23-year-old is in good spirits. ""I know the team well; I'll be going into my fifth season, I know the bike now, so it's good,"" he told CNN. ""I don't really want to have to learn a new motorcycle and how to ride it."" Smith admits the Marquez domination was embarrassing for his fellow riders, and expects the Repsol Honda man to bounce straight back after his Brno blip. ""It was hard work ... it makes us look rubbish at the end of the day. It's monotonous, it's the same old Marc, Marc, Marc, Marc, which I understand,"" Smith said. ""I expect him to come out fighting at Silverstone, but now that's given confidence to Dani, Jorge and Valentino (Rossi), that they have got a chance, and there is a slight weakness, and they've just got to keep opening that up."" Last year all British eyes were on the charismatic, straight-talking Cal Crutchlow, who had amazed spectators in 2012 by registering a sixth place from the back of the grid while riding with a freshly broken ankle. Last year's race was disappointing, however, and this year he is enduring an ordeal of a season with Ducati. ""I normally leave here on Sunday night completely smashed on drugs that they've given me from the medical center,"" Crutchlow joked at a recent media event held by British broadcaster BT Sport. He puts his British MotoGP crashes down to simply trying too hard: ""Problem was I wanted to win too early, I never saved it for the race; I wanted to win the practices."" Crutchlow believes that Marquez's dominance has benefited the sport: ""It's not boring, because people were tuning in to see if he'd win again. He dominated most of the races; he was really playing with people."" He also reckons the Spaniard was unlucky in Brno. ""We know he had a tire problem, as did a lot of the riders over the weekend, and I think he would have put up a lot more of a fight than he did."" The three top Brits all see positive signs for the future of the sport in the UK. The British MotoGP is moving to a Â£280 million ($460 million) new purpose-built complex in Wales in 2016. ""It's a fantastic facility, and looks great for motorcycle racing in general,"" Smith said. Redding, however, warns that Britain -- and the world -- has a long way to go to match Spain. ""You go to Spain and it's a completely different ball game. I spent the last two years training in Spain, and that's what's changed me as a rider,"" he told CNN. ""You see riders at the age of six come in on their lunch break from school, go an hour riding and then go back to school ... the passion you get there is unbelievable and it makes a massive difference.""","Marc Marquez is seeking to bounce back at this weekend's British Grand Prix .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Actress and singer Jennifer Hudson testified Monday in the trial of a man accused of killing her mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew. She broke down in tears several times on the stand as she remembered her family. Hudson was the prosecution's first witness. She identified the defendant, William Balfour, the estranged husband of her sister, Julia. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" she said. ""We did not like how he treated her."" Hudson, dressed in black, also testified about her relationship with her mother, saying she spoke with her mom every day and slept in the same bed with her until she was 16. Read a full transcript of Jennifer Hudson's testimony . Through tears, she talked about the last time she saw her family together and the day she found out about the murders. ""I did everything in my power to get home,"" Hudson said. She testified that she identified her relatives' bodies for authorities. During cross-examination, the singer-actress returned to the subject of Balfour. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" Hudson said. In the afternoon, her sister, Julia Hudson, took the stand. She said Balfour threatened to kill her family after she told him she didn't want to be with him. "" 'If you leave me, you'll be the last to die. I'll kill your family first,' "" she quoted him as saying. She also said Balfour was jealous of her son. Julia Hudson recounted arriving home the day of the slayings, finding a bullet hole in the door and running inside. ""I'm saying, 'Mama, mama, mama,' "" she said. ""She didn't answer."" She testified that she ran screaming from the home after finding her mother lying in blood on the floor. When police asked her who could have done it, Julia Hudson said, she told them ""William."" Eighteen people have been selected to serve on the jury in the murder trial: 10 women and eight men. The group includes six alternates. The trial comes more than three years after Hudson's relatives were killed. Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother and brother inside their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's nephew, Julian King, was found three days later inside an abandoned vehicle. Balfour, Julian's stepfather, has also been charged with one count of home invasion. Julia Hudson testified that her main goal after the slayings was finding her son. When she learned that he had been found dead, ""I hollered, and I screamed,"" she recounted Monday. The judge has said he expects the trial to last three to four weeks. Balfour was detained for questioning the day after the victims were found at the Chicago home. Authorities at the time said that they were holding Balfour for an unspecified parole violation, but he was indicted for murder two months later. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyer has said in court that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered three people in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother, Darnell Donerson. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Her career has continued to blossom and remain varied since her relatives' deaths. Her recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight, being cast to play Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie, releasing a new album and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the most recent Grammy Awards show in February.

"(CNN) -- The second Boston bombing suspect is in custody. Now everyone will focus on what it all means, what ""lesson"" we can learn from the events. This is Martin Richard's lesson: . ""No more hurting people."" Martin Richard was one of three innocent bystanders to die on Patriot's Day. As we debate issues of life and death in our state legislatures and Congress, we need to keep the picture of this boy and his sign not in our memories or Facebook walls, but on display. The worldwide response to that picture -- which his teacher, Rachel Moo, said was made as part of a school lesson on the shooting of Trayvon Martin -- has been both heart-stirring and heartbreaking. People are striving to remember and to honor, yes; even more, though, they are trying to make his words real. Everyone killed in the Boston bombing, and during the events that flowed from it, was under 30. Martin Richard was 8 years old; how will his classmates handle their grief? Krystle Campbell, age 29, had moved to live with and help care for her ailing grandmother. Doctors had told Krystle's mother she had survived the blast, but they had mistaken Krystle's friend for Krystle. What must her mother and grandmother feel? Lingzi Lu was a 23-year-old graduate student, the only child of her parents in China, who said learning of her death was ""a dagger in our hearts."" Sean Collier, 26, was shot multiple times while in his cruiser without drawing his gun. He had been a campus policeman with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for only a little over a year, and volunteered at the gym where one suspect trained as a boxer. Three days after the bombing of the Boston Marathon, the U.S. Senate defeated a bipartisan proposal aimed at curbing gun violence; it would have required more widespread background checks for gun purchasers, something 90% of Americans want. As a result of the bombing, immigration reform may soon become another political pingpong ball in the dysfunctional Senate. Every pundit and every politician feels every bit of bombast is justified. And the children? Pictures and comments, memorials on Facebook. That's all. ""No more hurting people. Peace."" The injured: Martin's father and older brother, Henry, escaped injury. His 6-year-old sister, Jane, lost a leg. Martin's mother, Denise Richard, 43, had brain surgery for a serious injury. The father, Bill Richard, 42, returned home briefly from the hospital to get clothing, and a neighbor said he was pale, almost dazed, and too grief-stricken to talk. The sidewalk in front of their house is still covered with colored chalk drawings of butterflies, flowers, and stars that Richard and his sister had drawn before leaving for the marathon. Jack Hart, a former state senator, told the Boston Globe that the Richards are ""pillars of the community ... a model family, who somehow always found the time to give something back."" ""Any tragedy of this sort is extraordinarily difficult, but when you know people, when it's people in your life, in your school, that's when it really hits home,"" The Boston Globe quoted a classmate of Martin's, Colin Baker, 9, who said about Martin: ""If somebody was left out, he would come say, 'Want to join my group?' He sticks up for kids."" ""It should not have happened to him,"" Colin said to the Globe. ""It should not have happened to nobody."" As I read and hear these responses, I keep thinking, what are we -- the adults -- what are we telling the children? Do we think they don't see the hollowness behind our hallowed words? Do we think they don't know the difference between courage and cowardice? There's a clichÃ©: ""Perfect is the enemy of the good."" Apparently, legislation must be perfect, because even after this horror, we are still finding ways to divide people. Should suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev be treated as an enemy combatant? Did the intelligence community pay little heed to the warning it received? Questions. Questions. But let us pause to bury our dead and stand by the wounded as their struggle with the new reality of their lives. Some will have to learn how to simply stand up again -- wounded forever. We should hold Martin's sign in our hearts and resolve to do better. Because, with President Barack Obama, ""I'm assuming our expressions of grief and our commitment to do something different to prevent these things from happening are not empty words."" I, too, believe that, ""sooner or later, we are going to get this right. The memories of those who died and many who are still suffering demand it."" ""No more hurting people. Peace."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","8-year-old Boston marathon victim had carried sign, ""No more hurting people""

"Chicago (CNN) -- More than two dozen people filled a Chicago courtroom Tuesday, listening to testimony in the case of the murdered relatives of Grammy-winning singer Jennifer Hudson. Hudson was seated beside her fiance as witnesses recalled the harrowing events of a rainy day in October 2008, when the singer's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and her brother Jason Hudson, 29, were shot dead. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Her former brother-in-law, William Balfour, is charged with their murders. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Sgt. Richard Dowling, the first police officer to arrive at the murder scene, said he found Hudson's mother lying face down with a gunshot wound to her back. Dowling next found her brother on a bed, he testified, though he recalled that he had difficulty identifying the man because he had been wrapped in blankets. Police searched the home for Julian, issuing an Amber Alert when their initial sweep failed. Police officer Jennifer Bryk testified that she was next to Hudson's sister, Julia, who at the time was separated from Balfour, when he called her after the attack. Full transcript of Tuesday's morning testimony | afternoon testmony . Bryk instructed the woman ""to act normal"" in her conversation to help authorities locate Balfour. Later Tuesday, an acquaintance of Balfour's, Abdullah Smith, 37, testified that the defendant had confided in him, telling him that he was having marital problems. Balfour showed him a text message from Julia Hudson, he said, that told him she didn't love him anymore. Smith also recalled how Balfour once told him that he wished he could beat up Jason Hudson but never heard of him threatening his wife, Donerson or Julian. Several gruesome crime scene photos were entered into evidence on Tuesday, the second day of testimony. They showed the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother. Court is expected to resume at 10:30 a.m. (11:30 a.m. ET) on Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Several prominent leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention said Monday that Baptists have a moral responsibility to combat climate change -- a major shift within a denomination that just last year cast doubt on human responsibility for global warming. ""We can do better"" in responding to climate change, some members of the Southern Baptist Convention say. Forty-six influential members of the Southern Baptist Convention, including three of its past four presidents, criticized their denomination in a statement Monday for being ""too timid"" in confronting global warming. ""Our cautious response to these issues in the face of mounting evidence may be seen by the world as uncaring, reckless and ill-informed,"" the statement says. ""We can do better."" The Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the United States, adopted a resolution last year urging Baptists to ""proceed cautiously in the human-induced global warming debate in light of conflicting scientific research."" The resolution said ""many scientists reject the idea of catastrophic human-induced global warming."" On Monday, however, dozens of Southern Baptist leaders expressed a different view. ""There is general agreement among those engaged with this issue in the scientific community,"" their statement says. ""A minority of sincere and respected scientists offer alternate causes for global climate change other than deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels."" The signatories pledged to do their part to fight global warming ""without any further lingering over the basic reality of the problem or our responsibility to address it. Humans must be proactive and take responsibility for our contributions to climate change -- big and small."" The signatories include Frank Page, president of the Southern Baptist Convention since 2006; James Merritt, president of the convention from 2000 to 2002 and Jack Graham, president of the convention from 2002 to 2004. The group posted the statement on its Web site. The signers of ""A Southern Baptist Declaration on the Environment and Climate Change"" acknowledged that some of them were skeptics at first. ""Some of us have required considerable convincing before becoming persuaded that these are real problems that deserve our attention,"" the statement says. ""But now we have seen and heard enough to be persuaded that these issues are among the current era's challenges that require a unified moral voice."" The Southern Baptist Convention's 16 million members make up roughly 7 percent of the U.S. adult population, according to the convention and the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. The competing and evolving views on climate change within the Southern Baptist Convention mirror a debate that has played out among members of the theologically like-minded National Association of Evangelicals, an umbrella group that represents about 30 million people in 45,000 church congregations, including many Baptist congregations. Its Washington policy director, the Rev. Richard Cizik, has pressed for years for more action to combat climate change, saying in a recent documentary that ""to harm this world by environmental degradation is an offense against God."" His advocacy raised eyebrows given that global warming sometimes conjured ""impressions in people's minds of being liberal, democratic, left wing, big government, tied to population control, all these kinds of things,"" Cizik told CNN last year. Several conservative evangelicals signed a letter in 2007 urging the association to rein in Cizik or encourage him to resign. The signers included James Dobson of Focus on the Family and Gary Bauer, a former presidential candidate and president of American Values. ""We have observed that Cizik and others are using the global warming controversy to shift the emphasis away from the great moral issues of our time, notably the sanctity of human life, the integrity of marriage and the teaching of sexual abstinence and morality to our children,"" their letter said.

"New York (CNN) -- For the second time this summer, a New York City police officer has been stripped of his badge and gun after video surfaced showing what community leaders call a heavy-handed police response. The latest incident to highlight lingering tension with the nation's largest police force occurred Sunday when a handful of officers attempted to disperse a group of vendors in order to reopen traffic after the conclusion of a Brooklyn street fair. In a video taken by an onlooker and posted to Facebook, words are exchanged and officers attempt to arrest a man. A woman intervenes and pushing and shoving ensues. Later, once officers have the young man on the ground, one officer punches him while another kicks him in the back. The scene grows tense, with witnesses taking video of the pushing and shoving and civilians tussling with officers. Five people were arrested on charges ranging from second-degree assault to resisting arrest to obstruction of government administration, police said. ""What we see here is people get assaulted, get hurt and the same thing goes without any sort of accountability,"" Brooklyn resident Dennis Flores told CNN affiliate NY1 News. ""It keeps repeating itself."" On Wednesday, Police Commissioner William Bratton said the unidentified officer seen in the video kicking the man has been relieved of his badge and gun pending an internal affairs investigation. ""I was very concerned with a video that was taken and the actions of one of our officers who was scene kicking an individual,"" Bratton told reporters. ""As best (as) I can tell -- looking at that video -- (it) seemed unprovoked. That officer has been suspended... We will treat those types of actions very seriously."" The tactics of the NYPD came under fire after the July 17 death of Eric Garner, 43. He died after being placed in a chokehold by an officer during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes on Staten Island. The incident, which was captured on video, led to anti-police demonstrations. The New York Medical Examiner's Officer last month ruled his death a homicide. During the encounter, Garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind him grab the 350-pound man in a choke hold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The cause of Garner's death was ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. Acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing factors in a controversial death that sparked calls for a federal investigation. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said. A second police officer was placed on desk duty. The chokehold is prohibited by the NYPD. Two EMTs and two paramedics were suspended without pay, according to Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center. After Sunday's confrontation between police and street vendors in Brooklyn's Sunset Park section, officials wrote Bratton to demand a ""broader conversation"" about relations with the community. ""We find the physical aggression that is depicted in witness videos disturbing,"" City Council member Carlos Menchaca wrote in a letter with Rep. Nydia Velasquez of New York. ""In the last few months, we have seen far too many signs of a deeply strained relationship between the police and our Sunset Park neighborhood... We are community of immigrants that has historically felt isolated from the police. We are a community that has feared the use of excessive force by the NYPD."" Earlier this month, Bratton announced that all NYPD officers will undergo a three-day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. The training will focus on how officers can avoid physical confrontations when talking to and restraining suspects, as well as how to safely take them into custody without bringing harm to either the individual or the officer. Officers will also undergo a leadership and cultural sensitivity workshop.

"(CNN) -- A man convicted of crimes in connection with Detroit's organized-crime family claims to know where Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa's body was buried in 1975. Anthony Zerilli, 85, told New York's NBC 4 that Hoffa was buried in a Michigan field about 20 miles north of where he was last seen on July 30, 1975. ""I'm as certain as I could possibly be,"" Zerilli told the station. ""If I had money, I'd like to bet a big sum of money that he's buried (there)."" Zerilli said the plan was to bury Hoffa in a shallow grave, then move his body to a different location. The latter part of the plan fell through, and his body was left in Oakland County, Michigan. In an interview with CNN on Monday, former U.S. attorney and chief of the Eastern District of Michigan's Organized Crime Strike Force Keith Corbett said there are very few people, if any, who would be more likely to know about Hoffa's disappearance than Zerilli. ""Tony Zerilli was in a very high position within the Detroit organized crime family for decades,"" Corbett said. ""This is a man who would have been in the know about all matters, especially what happened to Jimmy Hoffa."" Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years . Corbett, who prosecuted Zerilli in several cases in the 1980s and '90s, says Zerilli was the head of the Detroit organized crime family from 1970-1975, but was in prison himself when Hoffa disappeared. In 2005, Zerilli was sentenced to 71 months in prison for racketeering and extortion. He was released in 2008. In his interview with NBC 4, Zerilli denied playing any part in Hoffa's disappearance, and said Hoffa did not deserve what happened to him. ""If I wasn't away (in prison) I don't think it would have ever happened,"" Zerilli told the station. ""That's the only thing I can tell you."" The FBI declined to comment on Zerilli's claims. Corbett, however, told CNN he thinks the FBI will be taking Zerilli's words seriously, and will likely see if they can acquire a search warrant for the property in Michigan. Hoffa's disappearance and presumed death has vexed investigators for almost four decades. As recently as October, soil samples were taken from a home in the suburban Detroit community after a tipster claimed he saw a body buried in the yard a day after Hoffa disappeared in 1975. The soil samples were tested, and showed no evidence of human remains or decomposition. One of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded a great deal of sway in many elections -- and when some unions were notoriously tied to organized crime -- Hoffa was forced out of the organized-labor movement when he went to federal prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. Then-President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971 on the condition that he not try to get back into the union movement before 1980. Hoffa, then 62, was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside a Detroit-area restaurant. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. Giacalone died in 1982; Provenzano died in 1988 in prison. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. The FBI said at the time that the disappearance could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. ""I'd like to just prove to everybody that I'm not crazy,"" Zerilli told NBC 4. ""What happened, happened while I was in jail, and I feel very, very bad about it ... (it) should have never happened to Jim Hoffa.""","Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa disappeared on July 30, 1975 .

"(CNN) -- The president of Spain's Catalonia region, Artur Mas, signed a decree on Saturday setting November 9 as the date for a referendum on independence. However, the federal government in Madrid is staunchly opposed to any such referendum and says it is unconstitutional, setting the stage for legal and political confrontation and potential civil disobedience. The holding of Scotland's independence referendum earlier this month buoyed other separatist movements around the world, despite Scottish voters opting to remain part of the United Kingdom. Mas, at the signing ceremony in Barcelona, said that Catalonia wants to speak, wants to be heard and wants to vote. On September 11, Catalan national day, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets of Barcelona for the third year running demanding a vote on independence be held. But Madrid argues that Catalonia, which represents one fifth of Spain's economy, already has broad home-rule powers, including its own parliament, police force and control over education and health. And it insists that the Spanish Constitution does not allow any of Spain's 17 regions to unilaterally break away. The government in Madrid is expected to try to block the vote in Spain's constitutional court. If the court accepts the case, as is widely expected, it would automatically suspend the vote -- leaving Catalonia to decide whether to try to go ahead with it. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, speaking at a news conference earlier this month, dismissed any idea of the referendum taking place. ""Quite simply, it is not legal so won't be held,"" he said. ""In addition to not being legal, it goes against our whole history and our feelings, against what the vast majority of the Spanish people think, against our past and against the future of the Spanish people that live in Catalonia and in the rest of Spain."" Earlier this month, one of Catalonia's key political figures, Oriel Junqueras, leader of the Esquerra Republicana -- or Republican Left -- party, said if the government in Madrid were to block citizens' exercising their ""fundamental right"" to vote, there could be a need for civil disobedience. Those in the crowd in Barcelona earlier this month said that if Madrid blocked the referendum, people should still deposit their ballots. A long list of grievances against Madrid center on taxation and language issues. A referendum is expected to ask a two-part question: ""Should Catalonia be a state?"" And those who vote yes to that can then go to vote on the second question: ""Should that state be independent?"" Polls indicate that a majority of Catalans want to have a chance to vote but that less than a majority would vote for independence, given the chance. Those calling for independence in Barcelona earlier this month did not represent all the region's 7.5 million people. A smaller gathering of several thousand took to the streets the same day in Catalonia's second largest city, Tarragona, calling for the region to remain a part of Spain. One of those protesters told CNN: ""The reason we want to remain a part of Spain, is because we are a part of Spain."" CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","Catalan President Artur Mas sets November 9 as the date for an independence referendum .

"(CNN) -- A Mississippi woman whose death sentence was overturned has been moved from state prison to county jail, where she will await a new trial, authorities say. Michelle Byrom was moved to Tishomingo County Jail on Saturday. The Mississippi Supreme Court reversed her capital murder conviction on March 31 and ordered a new trial. Byrom was sentenced to death in 2000 after a jury determined she was the mastermind of a murder-for-hire plot to kill her allegedly abusive husband. Her son wrote in jailhouse letters that he committed the crime, and according to court documents, told a court-appointed psychologist that he was culprit. According to Tishomingo County Sheriff Glenn Whitlock, Byrom was picked up by sheriff officials Saturday morning and is being held under the original capital murder indictment until the county district attorney or court system takes the next steps. Whitlock told CNN that Byrom isn't receiving any special treatment, and she is currently alone in her cell, but could have cellmates at any time. Byrom's new trial date has not been set yet, according to the Tishomingo County Circuit clerk. The attorney who represented Byrom during the effort to have her conviction reversed no longer represents the 57-year-old. Efforts to reach her new counsel were not immediately successful.

"Chicago (CNN) -- A contract employee accused of setting a fire at a key Chicago air traffic control center made his first court appearance on Monday. The Friday incident created flight problems that rippled across the nation. Brian Howard, 36, appeared before a judge in the U.S. District Court in Chicago, where the charge of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities was explained to him, said his attorney, Ron Safer. The charge is a felony that could bring a 20-year prison sentence and a fine of up to $250,000. Howard will be detained at the Metropolitan Correction Center in Chicago until his next court appearance, Safer added. Thousands of flights into and out of Chicago's two major airports have been delayed or canceled since Friday's fire. The situation improved Monday as the volume of traffic in the area increased, the FAA said. As of noon, the traffic at O'Hare International was 80% of the normal number of flights. At Chicago Midway International Airport, the figure was 90%. The FAA said new communications equipment has begun to arrive at the Chicago En Route Center in Aurora, Illinois, and technicians have started installations. The FAA hopes to have the center repaired and returned to full service by October 13, the agency said Sunday. Other control centers have handled many of the Chicago flights while repairs are made. Police said Friday's blaze was set intentionally by Howard before he apparently attempted to kill himself. According to an affidavit, first responders found smoke when they arrived in the basement of the control center after a 911 call about 5:40 a.m. Friday. They also found blood on the floor. They followed the trail and found two knives and a lighter and then Howard, who was in the process of cutting his throat, according to the affidavit. The paramedics took a knife from him and began to treat Howard, who told them to leave him alone. Howard was taken to a hospital in Aurora. Air travel still hobbled after Chicago fire . Veteran employee . Howard had worked at the center for eight years but was facing a transfer to Hawaii, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. district court in Illinois, obtained by CNN affiliate WLS. The affidavit quoted a Facebook post's of Howard's: ""Take a hard look at the mirror, I have. And this is why I am about to take out... and my life... I am sorry. Leaving you with a big mess. Do your best to move on quickly from me please. Feel like I give a shit for the first time in a long time again... but not for too long (haha!) So I'm gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone."" The FAA will launch an internal review of security protocols at its facilities, its administrator said Monday. ""If we need to make changes as a result of what happened on Friday to improve the system, we will not hesitate to do so,"" Michael Huerta said. ""We need to be looking at everything ... from the people that we employ through our contractors all the way through all the processes that we use -- how they have access to our facilities and what kind of monitoring takes place within those facilities. That's all on the table,"" he said. Huerta told CNN that background checks on Howard had not identified any potential problems, and so he wants investigators to look into that vetting process, too. ""Are there things that we need to do differently? Immediately, it's more eyes, more resources and more frequent check-ins with facilities, but over the long term, if there are things that we identify that we should change, we're certainly going to change them,"" the administrator said. Suspect sent Facebook message: 'I am about to take out' FAA facility . Calls for investigation . Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois is calling for an investigation into whether security was breached. The suspect was able to enter the facility with a black suitcase without raising any red flags, officials have said. CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo said the FAA has to take a second look at who has access to critical facilities. ""You have to make sure you have a system in place to evaluate your contract employees, because remember, the Federal Aviation Administration ... huge percent of their employees are contract employees,"" she said. Most of the air traffic controllers are FAA employees, she added. After the fire, air traffic controllers initially had to transfer flight data manually rather than by computer, said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Church said the fire damaged the telecom line that transfers flight plans from the airlines to the busy O'Hare control tower and then to the Aurora control center. Airlines had to fax flight plans to the control tower, he said. Because so much information had to be manually transferred, two controllers were needed for each position. The effects of the fire were immediate. O'Hare International is a hub for United Airlines and other major carriers. When controllers stop flights scheduled to land or depart from there, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air-traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers. The FAA said it is bringing in extra technicians to replace the damaged communications network in the building. ""Teams will be working around the clock to install equipment, run cable and restore network connections at the facility,"" the FAA said. The FAA said over the weekend that it was managing the air traffic into and out of Chicago ""through other large Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities in Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin with additional help from high-altitude centers in Minnesota, Kansas, Indiana and Ohio."" CNN's Aaron Cooper, Janet DiGiacomo, Ralph Ellis, Mike Ahlers, Kevin Conlon, Jason Hanna, Thom Patterson, Mike Pearson, Amanda Watts and John Newsome contributed to this report.","Brian Howard faces one charge of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities .

"(CNN) -- Remember payphones? This might sound crazy, but if New York City has its way, people might actually start using them again to communicate with each other. The city announced Thursday that it has created Wi-Fi hotspots at 10 payphone kiosks in three of the city's boroughs. It's the first step in a pilot program designed to make wireless access available to as many people as possible in the city. The kiosks (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn and one in Queens) have antennas that create Wi-Fi hotspots providing free wireless service up to 300 feet away. More will be added in the coming months, according to the blog post announcing the program. In an era when it seems like everyone has a phone, smart or dumb, in their pocket, payphones may seem like just another technological dinosaur that the mobile age has relegated to the digital trash heap alongside pagers, beepers and busy signals. But they're not gone entirely. There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 12,000 payphone kiosks in New York, a city of roughly 8.2 million people. The announcement was receiving high marks from tech bloggers Friday. ""I think it's a good start for reusing payphones, which serve less and less need in our mobile-centric world,"" Ryan Kim wrote for tech blog GigaOm. ""And it speaks to our addiction to Wi-Fi and data, which is now even more popular than cellular."" Kim noted that more public Wi-Fi could lessen congestion on busy cellular networks in big, tech-savvy cities like New York and San Francisco, where chasing down those elusive 3G (or 4G) bars can be a frustrating experience. ""I can't recall the last time I've used a payphone but I'll be glad to see them around if it means more free Wi-Fi,"" he wrote. Expanding Wi-Fi service in New York has been a priority for Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The city has partnered with AT&T on a five-year project to provide free Wi-Fi at 26 locations in 20 parks throughout the city.","Ten New York City payphone kiosks have been turned into Wi-Fi hotspots .

"(CNN) -- Would you buy a secondhand car from Li Tian You? You probably don't have a choice. For more than 10 years, she has been selling used cars in Dongguan, a factory town in southern China, and she knows every trick in the book. ""I've already sold four cars today. No, five,"" she says as she guides us through the Dongguan Used Cars Trading Center, which mainly sells Western and Japanese cars. Now, she is looking to score her sixth sale of the day. ""This Volkswagen is very good,"" she says as she opens the door to a 2006 Jetta Sedan, starts the engine and offers me a seat. Loud Chinese pop music starts pumping from the sound system. ""It has only had one previous owner,"" she continues, ""And that was me. So I know it's a good buy. I promise."" Asked about the price, she immediately shaves off 15% -- just for me -- to RMB 68,000 ($10,900), and continues the pitch. ""Volkswagen is very safe. This is the best car if you have a family."" ""But if you want to find a new girlfriend, you buy a Mercedes-Benz,"" she says with a wink. In with the old . It's not only at Dongguan Used Cars Trading Center that business is booming. All across the country small and big car markets are popping up in response to the growing demand. Secondhand cars used to be a hard sell in China as owning one is associated with settling for less. But things are rapidly changing as drivers realize they can get a decent car for a reasonable price when they buy secondhand. Last year, the number of used cars in China increased by 8.6% to 5.2 million units, while the turnover grew 10.6% to RMB 291 billion, according to the China Automotive Distribution Industry And Automotive Aftermarket Report. There's plenty of room for further growth. Today, used vehicles make up only 19.1% of total car sales volume in China, compared with 72.4% in the United States. Nasdaq-listed China Auto Logistics, which buys and sells imported cars, has identified used cars as a market with long-term growth potential. It is transforming a newly acquired 26,000-square-meter auto mall in Tianjin into a flagship site for its used car business. ""Used cars sales have become a much bigger slice of the auto sales pie in China, and we see a major opportunity for Car King Tianjin in the years ahead,"" said CEO Tong Shiping in a statement this month referring to China Auto Logistics' used car flagship store. A used car salesman . Liu Xiao Mei, CEO of Antong Used Cars in Dongguan, says business has been good over the last decade as Chinese drivers increasingly upgrade to new cars and sell their old ones. ""When we started the company in 2004, it was just a very small shop. But it has grown bigger and bigger. Things look bright,"" says Liu. Her company focuses on high-end used cars and has more than 100 vehicles gleaming in the parking lot. Today, she has an unbelievable offer, an almost brand new Mercedes-Benz E260 that has only run 100 kilometers, for no more than RMB 438,000. ""The former owner lost all his money at the casino in Macau and had to sell it. He never had the chance to drive it,"" she says and slashes the price by another RMB 18,000 in the hopes that I will buy it. ""What makes our company different from all others is that we promise that our customers get the perfect car,"" she says. ""Shall we step into my office?"" It's hard to cast aside stereotypes of used car salespeople having a loose relationship with the truth. During our quest to buy a used car in China, we found that the market is quite opaque. First, it's extremely fragmented. Some used car markets are as big as football stadiums, packed with countless dealers and brands of varying quality. But more commonly, shops are tiny, with just a few cars parked by the side of the road. Often there are no staff manning the shops. Customers must call a phone number and normally -- but not always -- a salesperson comes running. Since the market is young, price comparison is difficult. A number of peer-to-peer mobile apps and websites have been launched to serve as a benchmark for pricing, but finding accurate and consistent information is still a problem, which makes it easier for dealers to push their margins. Safety first . A bigger concern though is that a large share of the used cars on offer have a road accident record. The first thing many car dealers in Dongguan say to costumers is ""this car has not been in an accident"" or ""this one has been in an accident but is totally safe now."" Vincent Yin, a 30-year-old businessman from Dongguan who is having his car valued at Antong Used Cars, says that buying used cars in China is a gamble. ""Many of the cars are of very bad quality. Old cars sometimes get a superficial facelift with new paint to hide rust and scratches. How they look on the inside is difficult to know. I never trust a car dealer."" Yin is particularly wary of cars that were made by Chinese brands as they have a reputation for being unsafe. ""I believe Chinese cars often don't pass the NCAP test. Chinese car manufacturers hate this test,"" says Yin, referring to the New Car Assessment Program, the European car safety crash test. The first time a Chinese car earned the full five stars in the test was in late 2013. It was a Qoros 3 compact sedan. Yin's advice to anyone buying a used car is to visit the markets, check prices online, and ignore the salespeople. ""If you have friends in the police force, ask them to check up the car's accident report. Then you give the dealer an offer,"" he says.","Last year, the number of used cars in China increased by 8.6% to 5.2 million units .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Chinese authorities late Thursday dramatically revised upward the death toll of a violent incident they say occurred earlier in the week in Xinjiang, an ethnically divided region in China's far west. According to state-run regional media portal Tianshan, 50 people, including 40 ""rioters,"" were shot dead by police or killed by a series of explosions. ""Police forces reacted decisively,"" said the report. The report didn't specify how many were killed by police. More than 50 civilians were injured during the blasts on Sunday evening, which police called a terrorist attack, according to Tianshan. The bombs hit two police stations, a shop and an open market frequented by ethnic minority Uyghurs. The dead included six civilians, two police officers and two auxiliaries, Tianshan said. The primary suspect behind the bombings was shot dead, police said. On Monday, state media claimed that just two people were killed in the explosions. It is unclear why more details were only released several days later. Local police refused to comment to CNN, saying the information surrounding the incident is ""confidential."" The provincial government refused to provide more details. The violence occurred just two days before prominent Uyghur professor Ilham Tohti was found guilty of '""separatism"" by a Chinese court and sentenced to life in prison. Chinese authorities have stepped up security measures in Xinjiang following several recent attacks in the region, which has been the scene of ethnic strife between the indigenous Uyghurs, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population, and Han Chinese. The Chinese government has blamed recent violent incidents in Xinjiang on Uyghur separatists seeking to establish an independent state. Waves of Han Chinese have flocked to the resource-rich region, fueling tensions with the Uyghurs, who regard themselves as culturally and ethnically closer the people of nations bordering western China, such as Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Xinjiang is now home to more than eight million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs. Unemployment among Uyghurs is high, and they complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces.","Chinese authorities dramatically revise death toll in Xinjiang violence .

"(CNN) -- In the beginning, Lara Croft was a wimp. Now, before you jump down to the comments and start flaming, this was the plan by Crystal Dynamics when the game developer started working on the latest addition to the venerable ""Tomb Raider"" franchise. Their goal was to take you back in time, before the cool gadgets and the clever phrases and the butt-kicking and the Angelina Jolie movies, to show how Lara became the action/adventure heroine everyone knows. In this reboot, also called ""Tomb Raider"" like the original 1996 game, Lara and her crew are investigating reports of strange events on an island near Japan. Their boat is caught up in a storm and is torn apart, stranding the castaways on the island to fend for their survival. Lara is separated from the rest of her party, and the adventure begins. This Lara is young, timid and unsure of herself when the game begins. Only by necessity, through fighting for her survival, does she gain confidence and become the can-do woman familiar to legions of gamers. ""Tomb Raider's"" developers knew that they faced challenges in portraying such an iconic figure so differently from what people are used to seeing. Even Croft's famously pneumatic body has been toned down to something more realistic. Lead writer Rhianna Pratchett said her team wanted to explore Lara Croft's character beyond her physical accomplishments. ""We were taking a little bit of a risk showing her when she wasn't a full-blown tomb raider,"" Pratchett said. ""Everyone associates Lara Croft in 'Tomb Raider' as being exceptionally capable, all the guns, the gadgets, the witty one-liners. That's where our Lara is on the way to being, but we wound up so that those traits are still there, but they're buried below the surface."" Creative director Noah Hughes said the goal was not to recreate the Lara Croft character but to show her at her genesis -- to tell the story of where Lara had come from. ""She was still going to be a lot of the things she always was. She's brilliant; she's resourceful; she's athletic; she has an incredible force of will; she's an archeologist,"" Hughes said. ""All of these things were going to be true, but we were going to roll it back to a point where she didn't have the confidence or competence or even the same belief system that she would eventually develop."" This more vulnerable Lara still does things that most ""normal"" people wouldn't do, like pull a piece of pipe from her wounded torso. But she is also portrayed as someone who needs reassurance and talks to herself in order to build up her own self-esteem. ""It was important that we showed this more realistic, more human side of Lara,"" Pratchett said. ""She is vulnerable, because she's human and she's in very traumatic and chaotic circumstances in which she has to get her head around and deal with it."" Pratchett points to the first time Lara has to kill someone. ""It has quite a big impact on her. Something she has a big reaction to,"" she said. ""It's very up close, and it's very personal, and it's uncomfortable. It should be uncomfortable. It's death."" In fact, Lara throws away her gun and nearly throws up because she's taken a life -- although she later goes back to get the weapon. Later, when talking about it with another character in the game, players get the sense of the journey they are about to experience. ""She says it is scary how easy it was"" to kill someone, Pratchett said. ""That's an important moment for her character, because it addresses how killing does become at that point easier. And she's uncomfortable about that, too. It speaks to something within her that's darker."" There are other moments of emotional conflict and self-doubt as the game progresses, marking the internal struggles Lara is going through. ""She knows if she thinks too hard about what she's doing, what she's becoming, then it is going to incapacitate her,"" Pratchett said.

"(CNN) -- There are certain elements of leadership that survive the centuries -- that are classical, says John Prevas, co-author of ""Power Ambition Glory: The Stunning Parallels between Great Leaders of the Ancient World and Today."" And while these features aren't necessarily a guarantee of success in the modern world, they can provide professionals with a framework around which success can be built, he says. So which leaders from the ancient past should you be looking to model your  career on? Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) Alexander III of Macedon is the standard for leadership by which all others are measured, Prevas says. But does he merit his place as a leadership icon? ""It's questionable,"" says Prevas. On the one hand, Alexander had a capacity for intense focus and was willing to sacrifice friends, family and personal fortunes to reach the top. But ambition fueled by a massive ego eventually proved to be Alexander's undoing, Prevas argues. Having defeated King Darius III in the Battle of Issus, the Persian king offered the marauding youngster the western half of his Persian Empire in return for his family who had been captured by the Macedonian army. Alexander's most senior commander, Parmenio, urged his young master to accept Darius's proposal and consolidate his power in the region. But Alexander ignored the advice, choosing instead to resume his conquest, capturing the Persian capital of Persepolis before hunting down and killing Darius. From there, Alexander continued eastwards conquering large parts of south central Asia before heading to India. But it was here that Alexander's exhausted army refused to carry on, thus ending his eastern escapade. Ancient quote: ""I see no limits to what a man of ability can accomplish."" Modern lesson: Youth is no barrier to success. Be bold and learn to focus on your task, but don't let your ambition or ego cloud your judgment. Listen to the advice of those more experienced than yourself. Xenophon (circa 435-circa 354 BC) An aristocrat by birth, Xenophon was a Greek military leader. But unlike Alexander the Great, Xenophon didn't command by the force of his personality, says Prevas, but sought to forge a consensus. ""What makes Xenophon so unique as a leader is that he's not a soldier, he's a philosopher. He is elected by the soldiers to be one of the leaders based on his ability to articulate a course of action for them,"" Prevas said. Xenophon was a student of Socrates and didn't believe in democratic rule but he actually functioned as a democratic leader, Prevas says, leading a potentially unruly army of Greek mercenaries successfully out of Persia by occupying the middle ground. Ancient quote: ""In life a leader must resign himself to expect anything and never count on anyone but himself."" Modern lesson: Tailor your message to your audience and be sensitive to the moods and opinions of the people you manage. Augustus (63 BC-AD 14) Julius Caesar famously built the Roman Empire by conquest, but it was Augustus, his nephew and first Roman Emperor, who administered it and took it to its greatest heights, says Prevas. Augustus believed that the conquering achievements of Alexander the Great were actually easy when compared to the task of administering and building an empire, Prevas says. ""He was a great administrator who made the political and economic foundation of Rome that lasted for the next 300 years,"" Prevas said. Ancient quote: ""That which has been done well enough has been done quickly enough."" Modern lesson: Augustus said: ""Make haste slowly."" In other words, Prevas says, move cautiously and thoughtfully in everything you do. Cleopatra (69 BC-30 BC) Ancient Egypt's last pharaoh is often feted for her seductive beauty. But Cleopatra was also a woman of high intelligence, as evidenced by her grasp of several languages, says Sean Easton, assistant professor of classics at Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota. ""One of our principal sources for Cleopatra's life, Plutarch (the 2nd century biographer), says that in fact she rarely needed an interpreter to deliver her decisions to the representatives of foreign peoples,"" Easton said. She was a tenacious and resourceful leader who adopted a ""hands-on"" approach to power, consolidating her position through civil war with her brother and sister (Ptolemy XIII and Arsinoe IV), he says. Furthermore, Easton says, ""she was a realist and wasn't afraid to gamble on bringing in a more powerful ally when that was what the situation called for,"" as shown by her personal and political courtship of Julius Caesar and Rome. Ancient quote: Easton says Cleopatra's attitude to power and life could be best summed up with the phrase, ""Let it be done."" Modern lesson: Leaders who back up their god-given attributes with hard work and imagination can create a formidable business package.","Today's professionals can learn much from the ancients .
Alexander the Great was notable for his ""intense focus"" but was undone by his ego .
Lesser-known leaders like Xenophon are good examples of leading by consensus .
Cleopatra was a realist and wasn't afraid to team up with a partner ."
"(CNN) -- If you're walking along the east African coast and chance upon a herd of brightly-striped elephants, flame-hued rhinos and a tower of crazily-colored giraffes, then don't panic, you're not hallucinating -- and neither have you stumbled on a psychedelic new species, sorry. No, in fact this is the vibrant kingdom of skilful artisans where harmful waste is transformed into a colorful bliss -- one flip-flop at a time. Ocean Sole is a Kenyan recycling company that's crafting whimsical pieces of art and fashion from discarded flip-flops and other plastic junk -- piles of rubbish that wash up on Kenya's sandy beaches. Read this: Old boat sails turned into uplifting art . Inside its Nairobi-based workshop, reclaimed old sandals and other polluting pieces of rubber are fashioned into handmade animal toys, eye-popping curtains, intricate necklaces and even life-size sculptures. The playful creations are sold locally as well as in dozens of zoos, aquariums and stores in some 20 countries across the wold. ""It's a trade-based solution to the global problem of marine pollution,"" says Julie Church, the co-founder of Ocean Sole. ""It gets people to think about the ocean and links them to waterways -- and we're doing it through business."" Environmental threat . Like in many other developing countries, flip-flops are the footwear of choice for millions of people in Kenya. Affordable and convenient, they are worn by both children and adults alike, as well as by scores of tourists visiting the white sand beaches in east Africa. But once the sandals' walking life comes to an end, the ubiquitous footwear often embarks on another, more harmful, journey. Masses of broken rubber flip-flops dumped in cities and villages are carried by sewage systems, rivers and other waterways into Kenyan coastlines every year. At the same time, countless of non-degradable flip-flops and other plastic waste ends up on the same shores, brought there by powerful currents from places as far away as China and Indonesia. Read this: Artist's spectacular glasses 'give trash a second chance' The flotsam and jetsam do not only spoil the natural beauty of the environment but are also a major hazard to the wildlife living there. ""Pollution in all our waterways is a big problem,"" says Church, who was born and raised in Kenya. ""Rivers are clogged up with plastic and rubber and everything else,"" she adds. ""When people say that the ocean is plastic soup, it really is, because plastic doesn't go away -- it just breaks down to smaller and smaller parts. Fish, whales, sharks are digesting that plastic and sooner or later that's going to work its way into our food chain."" Trade, not aid . The inspiration for Ocean Sole came in 1997 when Church, a marine conservationist at the time, started working in a sea turtle preservation project on the remote island of Kiwayu near the Kenya-Somalia border. Whilst there, Church was shocked to find beautiful beaches strewn with a myriad of plastic objects that damaged the environment and obstructed the turtles from reaching their nesting sites. But, with curious fascination, Church also watched how local children used this marine debris -- cast-off flip-flops and other junk they'd found by the sea -- to create their own toys to play with. This triggered a thought on Church's mind: What if she could launch a project that would help clean the beaches and also boost development in the community? Inspired by the children's makeshift creations, Church then encouraged the local women to collect, wash and process the thrown-away flip-flops and transform them into colorful artefacts for a profit. ""We started a minor little program there,"" recalls Church, ""with that sort of idea to link conservation and development together."" Transforming rubber, changing attitudes . What began as a part time initiative -- which was initially dubbed UniquEco -- has now been turned into a regular and growing business. Ocean Sole, which provides direct employment today to more than 70 people, aims to recycle 400,000 flip-flops every year. It works with more than 10 suppliers who collect the raw material from waterways in and around Nairobi, as well as from the Kenyan coastline, and deliver it to the company's workshop. Read this: Fishing craft to foosball tables, furniture to float your boat . There, Ocean Sole workers go through large bags full of broken flip-flops every day to select the ones they're going to use in their creations. The artisans then clean the rubber sandals and sort them according to their color. Next, they cut, mold and sand them as they turn the old flip-flops into their eye-catching creations. ""We are focused mainly on animals,"" says Church. ""Our target markets are zoos, aquariums and museums worldwide -- we've done that because that's what we're good at making at the moment but we are exploring other products too."" Church says that Ocean Sole is for her ""a means to an end,"" a more effective way to spread her green message than working as a marine conservationist. ""My goal is to create change in the way people live and change in the way people understand the world and its connections,"" she says. ""Certainly about the ocean, doing that through the business of recycling rubber that floats,"" she continues, ""and doing it independently in a relative sustainable and grown up way where you have to have a market and a good product, you've got to be commercial,"" adds Church. ""I think only if we succeeded commercially we can really succeed in our goal which is to create attitudinal and lifestyle change.""

"(CNN) -- An estimated 600,000 Fijians took to the polls on Wednesday as the country held its first election since a military coup in 2006. There are hopes the election will mark a genuine return to a democratic era for this South Pacific island nation, whose record of coups has seen it labeled a ""Bainimarama Republic,"" after the name of its military leader, and whose turbulent domestic politics sits sharply at odds with the idyllic image that draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year. ""It's been highly anticipated. There's the expectation that after eight years this will be the defining moment for re-democratization in Fiji,"" says Steven Ratuva, a Fijian academic who is a senior lecturer in Pacific studies at the University of Auckland. But in a country that has experienced four coups d'etat in the past 27 years, not everyone is optimistic. ""I'd describe it as a return to a very fragile democracy dependent on the whims and fancies of essentially one or two individuals,"" says Fijian academic Brij Lal, a professor of Pacific and Asian history at Australian National University. Why does Fiji have so many coups? At the heart of the country's political instability, said Ratuva, are ethnic tensions between the country's indigenous majority, predominantly Melanesians, who are believed to have arrived on the islands 3,500 years ago, and Indo-Fijians. The latter group are mainly descendants of indentured laborers brought from India by Fiji's former British colonial rulers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to work on the sugarcane plantations. In the 2007 census, indigenous Fijians accounted for about 57% of the population, Indo-Fijians for about 38%. These tensions were particularly exacerbated by the previous political system, in which ethnicity was politicized and politics was a zero-sum game, says Ratuva. Fiji's first coup in 1987 saw an elected, Indian-dominated coalition overthrown by indigenous Fijians, leading to the implementation, and later withdrawal, of a constitution that guaranteed indigenous political supremacy. In 2000, the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs were held hostage for several weeks in a coup, led by businessman George Speight, that began with deadly riots in the streets of Suva, the capital. By contrast, said Ratuva, during the 2006 military coup, led by then Military Commander Josaia Voreqe ""Frank"" Bainimarama, an ethnic Fijian, the military's role shifted from acting in the name of indigenous nationalist interests to taking action against them. At the heart of the dispute triggering the 2006 coup was proposed legislation that would have granted pardons to plotters of the previous coup, and two land rights bills that Bainimarama believed would have unfairly favored indigenous Fijians over the Indo-Fijian minority. ""In the 2006 coup, the military itself had shifted from being an ethno-nationalist military into a more politically moderate institution,"" says Ratuva. Why does the military play such a large role in Fijian politics? Partly, because it plays a large role in Fijian life, says Ratuva. ""Even before colonialism, tribal leaders who were the dominant chiefs in Fiji came to power as warriors. When the British came they transferred that warrior psychology into the new military psychology,"" he says. ""The notion of the warrior class has always been there."" Over the years, the military has become deeply entwined into Fijian society. ""Almost everyone has a relative in the military. It's linked to the Fijian sense of masculinity, it's linked to the economy -- there are Fijian soldiers doing peacekeeping around the world who send back remittances,"" he says. Will the elections be free and fair? While polls indicate Bainimarama's party is the most popular of the seven contesting the election, questions remain as to how far the strongman prime minister has shaped the process in his favor. ""In terms of whether the ballot boxes are secure, my sense on that front is it will be fairly OK,"" says Lal, a long-standing critic of the regime. ""The problem is that you have to assess if it's fair in the context in which it takes place."" Fiji does not have a free media, he says, with the government controlling TV, radio and newspaper outlets. ""He has media exposure which other parties don't -- they've complained but there's no action. He has used the advantages of incumbency to the hilt."" Lal says there is a ""sense of fait accomplit"" around the election -- ""that whatever happens, Bainimarama will return,"" either through the ballot box, or by insisting on staying if the results are not to his favor. Another scenario, he says, is that the military could step in to safeguard the new constitution, implemented last year, if other parties look to make good on their stated desire to change it. How will the country's ethnic divide be reflected in voting? Bainimarama's changes to political structures have gone some way to creating a more equitable situation between indigenous and Indo-Fijians, says Lal. He has introduced a new constitution, abolished the powerful Great Council of Chiefs, a traditional group of indigenous Fijian leaders who mostly inherited their positions, and done away with electoral boundaries that grouped people according to their ethnicity to the benefit of indigenous Fijians. He pushed steadily for equal rights, culminating in a 2013 constitution, helping him to consolidate his popularity among Indo-Fijians. ""Bainimarama says we have abolished racial voting, which is true, but how does that translate into race relations?"" says Lal. ""Many Indo-Fijians will vote for Bainimarama, partly out of fear that they'll be at the mercy of Fijian nationalists should they fail -- also because his policies are geared towards bread and butter issues, and ... many Indo-Fijians live below the poverty line."" While there are many Indo-Fijians who don't support Bainimarama -- and many indigenous Fijians, particularly among the poor, who do -- many indigenous voters were aggrieved by the changes he had brought about in the name of equality. ""Many indigenous Fijians feel hard done by -- their cultural institutions such as the Great Council of Chiefs have been abolished with no consultation whatsoever,"" Lal says. The restoration of democracy would also help hasten the international rehabilitation of a country that has been diplomatically isolated at the behest of regional powers Australia and New Zealand. If the election is judged fair by the team of about 100 international observers monitoring the vote, the Commonwealth group of nations has indicated Fiji could be welcomed back into the fold as early as this month.","Fiji held its first elections Wednesday since a 2006 military coup d'etat .

"(CNN) -- Add one more uncertainty to the many questions that surround the Amanda Knox murder verdict: Will she wind up back in a cell in Italy? ""I will never go willingly back,"" she told ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Friday. ""I'm going to fight this until the very end, and it's not right and it's not fair and I'm going to do everything I can."" Knox, who is American and living in the United States, said she watched the guilty verdict handed down Thursday by an Italian appeals court over the Internet, translating what was happening to family members who were with her. ""This really has hit me like a train. I did not expect this to happen."" ""I really expected so much better from the Italian justice system,"" she added. ""They found me innocent before, how can they say it's guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?"" Knox, 26, said she ""got my first cry"" en route to the television station. ""You have to stand up for yourself and you have to believe that it's going to be OK,"" she said. Her lawyer was equivocal about her possible extradition back to Italy, where she already spent four years in prison awaiting and during her first trial. ""I can understand why that is the question of the day,"" Theodore Simon told CNN Friday, but he didn't answer it. He did note that the next court proceeding is ""probably a year away,"" and confirmed that he planned to appeal. But many other questions must be answered first. ""It's not really a question that is an issue today, or tomorrow, or for a long time to come. We have to await the motivation that will be generated by the court, we have to see the basis upon which they have rendered their finding. From that, there will be an appeal, a minimum of one appeal. ""So, I understand why you might be posing the question today, but it's really not right for consideration, and I wouldn't comment on that at this time."" Citing privacy and confidentiality concerns, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf declined to say whether Italy has requested that Knox be extradited. Knox and her former boyfriend, Italian Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty Thursday of the 2007 murder of Briton Meredith Kercher. Prosecutors say she was held down and stabbed after she rejected attempts by Knox, Sollecito and another man, Ivory Coast-born Rudy Guede, to involve her in a sex game. Guede is the only person still in jail for the murder. Extradition would be a logical move, Kercher's brother, Lyle, told reporters. ""In as much as, yes, if somebody's found guilty -- and this would go for anybody -- if somebody's found guilty and convicted of a murder."" He added, ""I don't see why they wouldn't."" The retrial reversed an earlier appeal judgment. Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years in prison; Knox, who remained in the United States and did not attend the trial, was sentenced in absentia to 28-1/2 years. CNN legal analyst Sonny Hostin said that Knox may be protected by U.S. law, which dictates that a person cannot be tried twice on the same charge. ""Because of this tension between Italian and U.S. law, it is unlikely that U.S. law will extradite her. When the fight begins, those are the grounds that U.S. attorneys will be arguing."" A law professor disagreed. ""They always forget she was convicted first,"" Julian Ku, who teaches transnational law at Hofstra University in New York, told Agence-France Presse. If Italy does file an extradition request with the U.S. State Department, Knox will have the right to challenge her transfer to Italy in a U.S. court. ""The chances of her winning that are not high because there has to be some very strong claim she'd have to make to block her extradition,"" Ku added. ""I followed the trial, it was slow but I never got the sense that it was unfair,"" he said. But legal rules may not necessarily be followed when it comes to the high-profile case, said ABC's legal analyst, Dan Abrams. ""You have to believe that, despite what all the lawyers will tell you, that this will come down to some degree to politics,"" he said. Would the State Department approve an extradition request? ""I think, with all of the public support for Amanda Knox, that is unlikely,"" he said. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said that, if Knox does wind up being sent back to Italy, it won't happen soon. ""We are very far away from the day when she gets extradited,"" he said. Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said Knox's looks and public support may help her. ""As popular as she is here and as pretty as she is here -- because that's what this is all about, if she was not an attractive woman, we wouldn't have the group love-in -- she will be extradited if it's upheld. ""The Italian legal system, though I don't love it, is a legitimate legal system and we have a treaty with Italy so I don't see how we would resist,"" he told AFP. ""We're trying to get (fugitive NSA leaker Edward) Snowden back -- how does it look if we want Snowden back and we won't return someone for murder?"" he asked. Dershowitz told CNN last March that, even if Knox avoids extradition, ""she remains a prisoner in the United States, because Interpol will put a warrant out for her and, if she travels anywhere outside the United States, she'll be immediately arrested and turned over to Italy."" The grounds for extraditions can be fuzzy. In 1998, an American military jet clipped a ski lift cable, sending a gondola carrying 20 passengers to their deaths in the Italian Dolomite Mountains. Italian prosecutors wanted the crew of the jet tried in Italy, but an Italian court ruled they should face courts-martial in the United States, in accordance with NATO treaties. The aircraft's pilot and navigator were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter, even though the military admitted the plane had been flying lower and faster than authorized. When it emerged that a video that captured the accident from inside the plane had been destroyed, the crew members were dismissed from the Marine Corps. Italians were outraged, referring to the incident as the ""massacre of Cermis."" In another incident, Egyptian cleric Abu Omar was seized off the streets of Milan in 2003 and smuggled to Egypt, where he says he was tortured and released four years later. Although Italy did not request the extradition of any of the suspects, 22 CIA agents were convicted in absentia of the kidnapping and sentenced to prison for their role in the abduction, but none has served time. The Kercher family welcomed Thursday's ruling, which overturns the previous decision to acquit Knox and Sollecito. ""They are tired of this and want justice,"" Francesci Maresca, the family's attorney, said. The case has dragged on for six years. ""I think we are still on the journey to the truth,"" said Kercher's sister, Stephanie. ""I think it may be the fact that we don't ever really know what happened that night, which is obviously something we will have to come to terms with."" Lyle Kercher, Meredith's brother, said the family may have to wait until spring 2015 for a final resolution, since the verdicts reached Thursday can still be appealed at Italy's Supreme Court. ""Nothing is going to bring Meredith back, nothing will take away the horror of what happened for her,"" he said. ""The best we can hope for is finally bringing this whole case to a conclusion, having a conviction, and everyone can move on with their lives."" CNN's Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.","NEW: The U.S. State Department won't say whether Italy has requested extradition .

"(CNN) -- Pediatrician and neurologist Dr. William D. Graf has noticed a disturbing trend. Over the past 20 years, he begun to hear stories of an increasing number of doctors who give perfectly healthy children prescriptions for the sole purpose of enhancing their focus or memory. The dramatic increase in the number of children taking stimulants and other ""study drugs,"" as they are popularly known, seems to back up his anecdotal evidence. Inspired by his growing concern over this trend, Graf collaborated with five other doctors to write a position paper that offers guidance to physicians and discusses the ethics of the practice. Published Wednesday in the American Academy of Neurology's journal, the paper is the first of its kind to focus solely on prescribing these drugs to healthy children, Graf said. ""It wasn't clear to any of us why this hasn't been written before,"" Graf said. ""The trend has been around for a couple decades now. It was clear to us that there needs to be this kind of conversation with physicians."" The paper argues that doctors have a ""moral obligation"" to ""prevent misuse of medication."" It concludes that the practice of ""neuroenhancements"" isn't justifiable. It adds that the prescription of these drugs is inadvisable because of ""numerous social, developmental, and professional integrity issues."" ""We are a highly competitive society, and we know some physicians are prescribing these at a parent's request,"" Graf said. ""Other parents have told us they felt doctors pushed these drugs on their children."" Though the drugs are effective in treating problems like attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder in healthy children, they can have serious side effects like cardiac risks, and taking them can be addictive. ""This is not what these drugs were designed for, and doctors can be a part of the problem,"" Graf said. ""Our professional integrity is at stake."" Graf said the number of prescriptions written for these kinds of drugs has increased tenfold in the past two decades. According to a 2004 study (PDF), in some U.S. school districts, ""the proportion of boys taking methylphenidate exceeds the highest estimates of the prevalence of attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder."" ADHD diagnosis rising . Another study (PDF) suggests that about 16% of the population of some high school and college campuses uses prescription drugs as study aids. ""Many students think there's a magic pill that could fix everything. Trouble is, that's not true,"" said Greg Eells, associate director of Counseling and Psychological Services at Gannett Health Services at Cornell University. He believes that when the law changed to allow pharmaceutical companies to market directly to the public, an entire generation's acceptance of taking prescriptions changed. ""It did make a huge difference in self-diagnosis."" College students take ADHD drugs for better grades . Eells has seen an uptick in the number of students taking or asking for the drugs at Cornell, an Ivy League school known for its rigorous curriculum and ultracompetitive atmosphere. His clinic puts students through a rigorous battery of tests to make sure they actually have ADHD before they receive a prescription for the medication. Still, he knows that if students can't get the drugs at his clinic, they may try to buy them from their peers. That's why he warns students that buying prescription drugs from other students is illegal and dangerous. ""They have a tendency to think if they can Google it, they know what they are getting into,"" he said. ""But there's a reason only people who've gone to medical school for a long time can prescribe these drugs. These drugs are serious business."" Dr. Mark Wolraich, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline subcommittee on ADHD, says this newly published position paper represents ""pretty much the position that all clinicians have."" His only concern is that parents who hear about it may be too nervous to seek treatment for their children with ADHD, for whom the drugs would actually be beneficial. ""They can work really well with kids with ADHD,"" Wolraich said. He also notes that there may be more valid reasons for the growing number of young people taking ADHD medicines. More people are being legitimately diagnosed with the disorder, and doctors have changed their thinking about ADHD, he said. Until recently, many doctors believed that children eventually outgrew ADHD symptoms. ""We used to think it disappeared at puberty, but it's not the case. So there will be more cases of adolescents and people at older ages diagnosed with ADHD,"" Wolraich said. As neuroenhancement grows more popular and new drugs become readily accessible, Graf said, he and his colleagues wondered whether their paper would it still be valid 20 years from now. ""Some have argued this practice is not going to stop. Neuroenhancement is going to continue regardless,"" he said. ""But we came to the conclusion that I think we should draw line at this practice. We don't believe that will change.""","Doctors obligated to ""prevent misuse of medication,"" position paper says .

"(CNN) -- The winner of the 82nd annual Scripps National Spelling Bee said Friday she is ""pretty excited"" but a little tired. Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, reacts to winning the Scripps National Spelling Bee on Thursday night. ""This has been my dream for so long; I've always wanted to win the bee,"" Kavya Shivashankar, 13, of Olathe, Kansas, told CNN. ""I was just really excited when I was able to go up and spell the last word."" The eighth-grader won $40,000 in cash and prizes for nailing the final word, ""Laodicean,"" which means lukewarm or indifferent, particularly in matters of politics or religion. This year's bee -- an event that has skyrocketed in popularity thanks to exposure on television and in movies -- started Tuesday in Washington with a record 293 spellers. Kavya endured 15 rounds. In an event that has seen contestants crack under the strain of the national spotlight, Kavya -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout.  Watch the poised winner describe the thrill » . As she spelled words such as ""phoresy,"" ""hydrargyrum"" and ""huisache,"" she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciation, origin and roots before ticking their spellings off for the judges. ""I focus so much on my word; I don't really pay attention to all the cameras and photographers and all the media in front of me,"" she said Friday. Kavya's father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words, and at one point he appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling ""Maecenas,"" meaning a generous patron of the arts.

"(CNN) -- In news that likely didn't surprise anyone, AMC announced Tuesday that ""The Walking Dead"" was renewed for a fifth season. Airing Sunday nights, the zombie apocalypse show picked up 20.2 million viewers for its Season Four premiere, a number that breaks records for nonsports telecasts on cable. Situated right in the middle of this pop culture hoard of zombies is Greg Nicotero, a makeup effects guru. He's a director and executive producer on the show. In 1988, Nicotero co-founded KNB EFX group, a popular effects studio for film and TV, and went on to establish a reputation in Hollywood. Long before he joined Robert Kirkman, ""Walking Dead"" comic book creator, and Frank Darabont, show creator, Nicotero launched his career as a student of zombie icons George A. Romero and Tom Savini. Nicotero, who still runs KNB, has now become involved in the theme park business by acting as a consultant for Universal Studios Orlando's ""Walking Dead"" attraction at their Halloween Horror Nights event. (It's also represented in part at Universal Hollywood. Zombie 101 with Greg Nicotero . Shortly before the news about Season Five was official, Greg Nicotero spoke to CNN via phone to discuss his outlook on the future of ""The Walking Dead,"" the theme park attraction and the hidden tributes he sneaks into episodes he directs: . CNN: Having spoken with you before, you strike me as someone always striving to learn new techniques. What do you find yourself looking at for the show's future? Greg Nicotero: I appreciate you saying that because every season when I watch the show, I'm constantly looking at what I feel people responded to and what people like, and what I thought was successful or could be refined. A show like ""The Walking Dead"" gives us that opportunity to refine the look of the Walkers and the performances. We have the opportunity to play with the concepts, the designs, the sculptures. Every year we're able to do that and it's exciting. CNN: What are some new things you've learned to bring into ""The Walking Dead"" moving forward? Nicotero: When you make something for a movie, when it's done filming, you remove the prosthetics and throw it away. For these guys (at Universal Orlando], they build it for a completely different mindset. There have been things they've done that I've been like, :Wow, that's really smart, I wish I'd thought of that."" For example, they will put magnets inside the teeth and magnets inside the prosthetics. So the teeth don't clip onto the actor's teeth but the teeth attach inside the prosthetic, so you don't have to put custom dentures into every single performer. That's a really neat idea because, for background stuff, you don't need to worry about putting teeth into all of them. I think that works really well. Photos: Key characters killed on 'The Walking Dead' CNN: As the show progresses each season, and becomes increasingly successful, is there pressure because people expect more from the show, and because it receives additional attention? Nicotero: I think we put the pressure on ourselves to raise the bar. Andy Lincoln and I have had many conversations about that -- about our commitment to the show, our passion and our commitment to the fans. I am really proud of Season Four and where the show is going. The fact that viewers have responded very positively is rewarding because we fought very hard to make sure the show continues every season to raise the bar. We're all creative, passionate people -- every single crew member and actor on the show wants it to be better. Our show runner, Scott Gimple, is a fan first and a great writer second, so I feel like we all challenge each other. I don't know if ""pressure"" is the right word, but we feel an obligation to continue to make the show great. CNN: When Universal first approached you about bringing ""The Walking Dead"" to a theme park, was there any hesitation? Nicotero: No, as a matter of fact, it was quite the opposite. The show has been able to attract quite a significant fan base, and what interested me in this collaboration was giving fans a little more of an interactive experience. What Universal Orlando has been able to do is put fans directly in the middle of the experience. You get to walk through the hallways of the prison, see Hershel's barn, all these really exciting moments. It's like the greatest hits of the show. Being able to do this is an exciting endeavor. CNN: Was there a concern about quality control since the Walkers in the park are based on your design, but you're not there to manage it? Nicotero: I'm not there on a day-to-day basis, but I have interacted and consulted with Mike Aiello and his creative team in regards to all of the sculptures. I provided them with photos of a lot of sculptures we did at KNB EFX. They replicated a lot of the stuff we did. In a few instances, like with Michonne's pets, I sent them actual prosthetic pieces used on the show so their sculptors could duplicate, as close as possible, the work we did on the show. I really was involved in that capacity. CNN: What do you think the appeal is of theme park guests walking through ""The Walking Dead""? NIcotero: I am a movie fan. I've flown to Martha's Vineyard to see where they shot ""Jaws."" I have been to the Monroeville Mall to see where they shot ""Dawn of the Dead,"" been to the steps in ""The Exorcist"" where Father Karras falls down the steps. I have been that guy who has been to those locations because it connects me to the material I love so much. That's what everybody does when they go to Universal. They're going to connect themselves to the experience, and they now know what it's like to be on the set of ""The Walking Dead."" Fans will seek out those experiences. CNN: Has the success of ""The Walking Dead"" added to the awareness of George Romero's work, or do you feel like you need to encourage people to look back to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and his other films? Nicotero: That's a great question, and I'm very glad you asked that. I saw George about two weeks ago in Los Angeles. There was a 30th anniversary screening of ""Day of the Dead,"" and I went and hadn't seen George in about two years. The guy, in my opinion, is a genius. He was the guy that got me into the business. ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Jaws"" teeter back-and-forth as the number one movie that I loved, and which influenced me. Before 1968 (when ""Night of the Living Dead"" came out), zombies were strictly referred to as a voodoo character, not even an undead but under a spell. He created a new creature; they came back from the dead, eat the flesh of the living and you shoot them in the head to kill them. As far as I'm concerned, ""The Walking Dead"" wouldn't exist without George Romero. ... Robert Kirkman's comic book is really a love letter to George Romero. His movies were so groundbreaking that they influenced guys like me and Robert Kirkman and Darabont. When I saw him two weeks ago, I was still geeking out. CNN: Now you're serving as a frequent director on ""The Walking Dead,"" so how does that make you think differently about your past effects work? Nicotero: I think about things differently because I did come up in the ranks of the makeup effects world. When I get to direct episodes now, what's fun is I throw little tributes in there. We did a cameo of the airport zombie from ""Dawn of the Dead"" with the plaid shirt in Episode 15 last year. I get to put those little in-jokes in. I love doing that. I'm directing Episode 15, and I'm popping in a few tributes. The thing I love the most is I've been doing this 30 years, and every day I come to work and still learn more. It really is the ultimate position, creatively, for me.","Special effects master Greg Nicotero previews ""The Walking Dead"" theme park attraction .

"(CNN) -- If you have a fever, headache and runny nose, you might go to Google and type the words ""flu symptoms"" to see whether you've come down with influenza. Google Flu Trends provides a map of influenza activity in the U.S. at www.google.org/flutrends. Google knows that you might do something like that, and it also knows which U.S. state you're in. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that Google says could detect flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use. Google's new public health initiative, Google Flu Trends, looks at the relative popularity of a slew of flu-related search terms to determine where in the U.S. flu outbreaks may be occurring. ""What's exciting about Flu Trends is that it lets anybody -- epidemiologists, health officials, moms with sick children -- learn about the current flu activity level in their own state based on data that's coming in this week,"" said Jeremy Ginsberg, the lead engineer who developed the site. The tool, which launched Tuesday, operates on the idea that there's likely to be a flu outbreak in states where flu-related search terms are currently popular.  Watch CNN.com's Elizabeth Landau explain how Google Flu Trends works » . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with Google on the project, helping validate and refine the model, and has provided  flu tracking data over a five-year period, said Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch in the CDC's influenza division. Although it doesn't replace the need for real viral surveillance data, Flu Trends is a good model, and the CDC looks forward to testing it this flu season, Bresee said. ""We really are excited about the future of using different technologies, including technology like this, in trying to figure out if there's better ways to do surveillance for outbreaks of influenza or any other diseases in the United States,"" he said. ""In theory at least, this idea can be used for any disease and any health problem."" Researchers found a tight correlation between the relative popularity of flu-related search terms and CDC's surveillance data, Ginsberg said. In the 2007-08 flu season, Google accurately estimated current flu levels one to two weeks faster than published CDC reports in each of the nine U.S. surveillance regions, Google said in a statement.  Test your knowledge of cold and flu » . Traditionally, influenza surveillance has involved physicians' reports of patients with flu-like symptoms, lab reports of influenza from nasal and throat swabs, and death certificates. Only that kind of analysis will detect the spread of influenza strains not covered by the flu vaccine, information that search engine information does not reflect, experts say.  Read more about who should get vaccinated » . But there has been concern that influenza surveillance systems in place are not fast enough, and the new tool could be useful for the basic purpose of quickly detecting outbreaks, said Dr. Randall Stafford, associate professor of medicine at Stanford University's Prevention Research Center, who was not involved in the project. ""Sacrificing accuracy may not necessarily carry a big penalty if you're able to predict increasing flu incidence as well as the other systems, and do it more rapidly,"" he said. Still, there are limitations, Bresee said. The tool may miss cases of influenza spreading among elderly people, because they are less likely to use the Internet than younger people, Stafford said. He also noted that many people who search for flu-related terms have viral infections that are not actually influenza. Google has also taken into account that people sometimes look for flu-related terms in response to certain news headlines and do not actually have the flu, Ginsberg said. The tool looks for terms that, for example, reflect searches by a person who has chest congestion or wants to buy a thermometer, he said. Flu Trends may also help doctors make diagnoses, Ginsberg said. ""I would be very hesitant to diagnose influenza at this point in the year, but if the tool tells me influenza in California is really increasing dramatically, I might be more likely or willing to diagnose,"" Stafford said. Influenza is responsible for more than 500,000 deaths worldwide each year, according to the World Health Organization. Flu Trends cannot be used to identify individual users, the company statement said. The search engine relies on aggregated counts, made anonymous, of how often certain search terms occur each week. But every computer connected to the Internet has its own internet protocol address, or IP address, which reveals its location to Google. Software engineers and public health experts at Google.org, the company's philanthropic arm, collaborated on the project, Ginsberg said. The search engine giant turned 10 years old this year. The overall flu activity in the U.S. is low, although a few states -- such as Hawaii, Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, Delaware and Maine -- have ""moderate"" activity, according to Google's map, based on data current through Monday. ""There's no question that testing for virus in blood is the only way to get the most information, but having this sort of information earlier does make sense,"" Stafford said.","Google Flu Trends may predict flu outbreaks up to two weeks faster than CDC .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Shelly Sterling says she can finally get some rest now that it looks like she will be able to sell the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. But Donald Sterling's lawyers say this is just one battle in a war their client wants to continue waging. It appears, however, they are losing the war to keep the franchise Donald Sterling has owned for more than 30 years. A California probate judge ruled Monday that a deal to sell the NBA team for a league-record price can move forward. Judge Michael Levanas tentatively ruled in favor of Shelly Sterling, saying the estranged wife of Donald Sterling acted properly in removing her husband from the trust that owns the NBA team and in winding up the affairs of the trust. The sale can go forward regardless of any appeals, Levanas said. And Donald Sterling will appeal, his attorneys said. ""His reaction is very calm. He didn't see this as the final battleground. This is one stage of a long war,"" Bobby Samini said. The ruling is expected to become final in about 10 days, after Donald Sterling's lawyers are allowed to enter their objections to the judgment. CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin said it is unlikely that Sterling's lawyers will succeed if they appeal the final ruling. Appellate courts are very reluctant to overturn a probate judge's decision on the facts, she said. NBA pleased . Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has agreed with Shelly Sterling to buy the Clippers for a league record $2 billion. ""We are pleased that the court has affirmed Shelly Sterling's right to sell the Los Angeles Clippers to Steve Ballmer,"" the NBA said through spokesman Mike Bass. ""We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible."" Pierce O'Donnell, an attorney for Shelly Sterling, said they hoped to have the sale completed by August 13. ""This is going to be a good thing for the city, for the league, for my family, for all of us,"" said Shelly Sterling, who added she will still be sitting courtside next season. ""And come see the Clippers next year!"" She called Ballmer the ""best new owner that anybody could ever find."" She said that she hadn't slept well for two months. ""I'm just glad it's over,"" she said. Doctors ruled Donald Sterling was mentally incapacitated . Shelly Sterling was within her rights to remove her husband from the trust under which each Sterling had owned 50% of the team, the judge agreed. She became sole trustee in May after two doctors determined Donald Sterling was mentally incapacitated. In April, Donald Sterling, 80, came under fire for making racist remarks against African-Americans in comments to his companion V. Stiviano. The recorded conversation was published online. In response, the NBA banned Sterling for life, fined him the maximum $2.5 million and moved toward terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights in the franchise. Donald Sterling, in turn, sued the league for $1 billion for alleged antitrust violations in its handling of the matter. Samini said they would switch their focus to this case. Sterling also is suing Shelly Sterling and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, seeking monetary damages in civil court. Court documents filed by Sterling's attorneys call the potential deal ""unlawful"" and ""fraudulent,"" and ask for an injunction to block the sale. Donald Sterling revoked the family trust in June, and the lawsuit contends that the move reverted the Clippers back to his sole ownership and therefore Shelly Sterling has no power or right to sell the team. All the stock for the franchise was issued in his name, court documents said. Donald Sterling has said he will never sell the Clippers. The NBA Board of Governors, a group of the league's 30 owners, will also have to approve the sale for it to go through. Donald Sterling bought the Clippers in 1981 for about $12 million and is the longest-tenured owner in the NBA.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- The mayor of the Iraqi city of Falluja was shot to death while bombings there, in Baghdad and in another city killed 24 more people Wednesday, police reported. Adnan al-Jalbawi, Falluja's mayor for the past three years, died in a burst of gunfire while visiting a sewage pumping station, police officials in Anbar province reported. One of the mayor's bodyguards was critically wounded as well, the officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, police said. Iraq's Shiite-led government has blamed other recent killings on Sunni extremists loyal to al Qaeda in Iraq, and the Anbar provincial council voted to fire police commander Gen. Hadi Azraiej on Wednesday due to the deteriorating security situation there. Meanwhile, separate attacks in Baghdad and Baquba, to the north, each killed 10 people, police said. The Baquba bombing targeted pilgrims gathering for the Shiite religious commemoration of Ashura, the holiest day of the Shiite calendar. Ashura commemorations were frequent targets of jihadist attacks in the years following the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. The 2012 commemoration was the first since the invasion to pass without significant violence. In Baghdad, Shiite pilgrims and security forces were among the targets of gunfire and more bombs, which left 10 dead and 17 wounded in six separate incidents, police said. Back in Falluja, bombs destroyed two houses belonging to police officers on the city's east side -- and when onlookers gathered around the homes, which were empty at the time, a second bomb exploded, police said. That blast left four people dead and 14 wounded, women and children among them, they said. They're the latest victims of the fighting that has persisted in Iraq since the final withdrawal of U.S. troops at the end of 2011. Nearly 6,000 people have been killed so far this year, according to the United Nations. Falluja, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad, was a hotbed of resistance to the U.S. occupation of Iraq. American troops fought two major battles to reclaim the city from insurgents in 2004.","NEW: Baghdad attacks targeted Shiite pilgrims, security forces .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A militant group with links to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a deadly wave of bombings across Iraq, strikes designed to undermine government security plans for the upcoming Arab League summit. The Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, made the claim in a statement posted on an al Qaeda website. The explosions killed 45 people and wounded hundreds Tuesday. Occurring on the ninth anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, the attacks were ""coordinated"" and launched by ""Sunni lions"" in Baghdad and other provinces ""simultaneously,"" the online statement said. Sunni lions is an adulatory reference to militants. The bombings were meant to target the security plan ""of the government of fools inside the Green Zone, in preparation of the meeting of Arab tyrants in Baghdad,"" the statement said. The country is hosting the next Arab League summit March 29. Al Qaeda in Iraq is a Sunni militant group in a majority Shiite country. The Sunni minority had a great deal of power during the reign of longtime dictator Saddam Hussein but lost its clout after he was toppled. Many Sunnis have felt disenfranchised in Iraq in the post-Hussein era and some have embraced the insurgency. Sectarian conflict raged between Iraq's Shiites and Sunnis during the Iraq war. While the insurgency's support and potency has eroded in Iraq, authorities believe the bombings were meant to send a message that the militant group is still able to carry out such attacks. Police in Baghdad reported more violence Wednesday . A mother and her three children were slain in Zafaraniya, a Sunni-Shiite neighborhood in the city's southeast. Gunmen shot dead a Ministry of Trade employee in the northwest. Nine people were wounded, six in a car bombing in central Baghdad and nine by a roadside bomb in the southeast.","The Islamic State of Iraq is an al Qaeda front group .

"(CNN) -- Imagine a future passenger experience. One that considers both consumer needs and trends in society. One that draws from the next generation of technologies that are changing the flying game. One in which the flying experience reflects air transport's environmental responsibility and thus looks for inspiration from nature. This is what Airbus designers are busy imagining with the Airbus Concept Cabin: A holistic, future-oriented approach inspired by nature. I discussed this in a TED talk I delivered at TEDGlobal this past June. The approach is presented in our award-winning ""Flying Green Experience"" showcase in Hamburg and the amazing Autodesk gallery in San Francisco. These demos offer a platform for discussion and the growth of fresh ideas -- ideas about eco-efficiency combined with eco-effectiveness, and aimed at making sustainability not just another buzzword but something that makes future cabin innovations worth doing. When looking at future trends in society, we see a couple of core developments shaping the kinds of passengers that will fly and what they will expect. For instance, women are projected to account for more than 70% of higher-educated students in the UK and for an average of 59% across the nations of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by 2025. More women business travelers will mean more of a desire for privacy in a very dense area like an aircraft cabin. The graying members of society will have their own requirements: better accessibility to services on board during flights and less stress during boarding and deboarding. The list goes on: Tall passengers would like more seat pitch, and obese passengers simply need more seat width to enjoy their flight. Of course, we already have female travelers, old and obese people on board. But in the future passenger landscape, how well their travel needs can be accommodated will have a decisive impact on how they choose to spend their vacation and which vehicle they use to get there. Their growing awareness of the human impact on the environment will cause them to take responsibility for how they travel. And there could be a time when some are asked to pay a fee for greenhouse gas emissions. Passengers may ultimately select airlines based on their environmental profile, not only by the ticket price. As we envisioned our future air transportation we needed to consider how technology could help us to combine both passenger comfort and operational efficiency. We consulted technology experts, futurists and also experts from other industries for their insights, while staying close to our philosophy: ""inspired by nature."" For starters, weight reduction is of course key in the aviation industry, and plays a role in improving the environmental profile of the aircraft. It's not enough to build the plane with biodegradable eco-materials if they don't reduce its weight. But airframe structures are already very efficient in terms of weight and structural performance. How to improve this further, then? One way would be to remove all windows and replace them with ""digital windows"" or simply displays. But we wanted to look for other weight-reducing solutions that enhanced the passenger experience. Thus we came along with structures that are inspired by such things as bird bones, trees and plants. A concrete example: Slime mold -- a single-celled organism that lives in soil and can spread rapidly -- creates very efficient redundant structures. This behavior can be transformed in mathematical equations which are implemented into software. Using it, we ""create"" structures that are very light and stable at the same time. Another example of inspiration for strong, light structure is the water lily ""Victoria Regia"" which creates very large leaves that float like pie plates on the water, stable enough for kids to sit on. Nature is full of similar examples and therefore it is in our interest to preserve its natural diversity. We understand nature as an open space from which to get fresh ideas. We came up with a portfolio of technologies that would help us turn the ideas into something usable and eco-friendly. It included direct manufacturing, fiber optics for data transmission and the idea of transparent Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFPR) as a strong and unorthodox material for the aircraft's outer shell. We were trying to determine how different technologies might evolve in context to others -- important, because only if you understand certain technologies and their huge potential are you able to pick the appropriate ones. Then we used this portfolio of technologies in the context of passenger needs to rethink the traditional class system in the aircraft. Our concept plane has three different zones. First we put our focus on the entrance area with wide central doors, ""active surfaces"" and shape-changing materials. This helped us to create a space which is entirely customizable and transformable during the flight. As a passenger you won't need to stay in the galley during the flight anymore, when you wish to stand for a while. You will meet other passenger in this ""interaction zone"" to share your thoughts, play digital sports or just have a drink together. For the airliner, or customers, new business opportunities come along with this. The interaction zone divides the cabin into two other sections: the ""smart tech zone"" and the ""vitalizing zone."" The smart tech zone, which is located in the aft fuselage, is focused on business travelers and people who like to use the latest technologies. It could also feature seating options -- seats that change shape, have increased pitch and even rows that fold up when they're empty. The vitalizing zone is the big highlight of the concept cabin. It responds to passengers' behavior by tracking their well-being through sensors that can recognize gestures and could perhaps even determine when a passenger is, for example, dehydrated. It could also afford an impressive 360-degree outside view through translucent ceiling and walls. As a consequence we had to relocate the cockpit to the cargo bay. Yes, in the future we consider that pilots are still important. You might think that these guys just produced some inspiring pictures of cool, nature-inspired aircraft and futuristic, high-tech interiors. Or maybe you find our concept cabin disturbing and you never would believe that this might even become reality from the technical perspective. Or maybe you only would be afraid to imagine sitting as a passenger under a transparent roof while flying at an altitude of 30,000 feet. But the core objective is not to consider whether this imagined future is the only way to go, but to paint a picture of the future -- based on scientific trends and technology research -- so that we can understand the core driving forces for air travel and point towards potential solutions. You need a picture to make that potential future tangible. You need a story about the future -- with images to go along with it -- to help extend the imagination. It's how you turn critical reflection on how to use the technology into a vision of aviation that pushes the boundaries even further.

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A teenage boy was killed and 39 people were wounded Sunday evening when hundreds of demonstrators clashed with Kurdish security forces in Sulaimaniya in northern Iraq, officials said. Most of the demonstrators opposed Massoud Barazani, Kurdistan regional president, and the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party. Witnesses said that dozens of angry demonstrators threw stones at security forces who were trying to disperse them using water cannons. Eleven of the demonstrators were wounded when the security forces opened fire, said Dr. Hawar Hassan, director of Sulaimaniya's emergency police. The teenager, a 17-year-old boy, died from wounds he suffered in the shooting. In addition, 12 security officials were also hurt, Hassan said. Also Sunday, masked gunmen attacked and burned an independent television station, wounding a guard. In a statement, NRT TV said 50 armed attackers stormed a gated community called ""German Village"" where the station is located. The attackers fired weapons at broadcast equipment and burned the entire building, wounding one NRT guard, according to the statement. NRT, the first independent television station in northern Iraq, started broadcasting on February 17, and was the only station to air footage of shots fired at demonstrators on the first day of the protests, according to the statement. On Saturday, clashes between police and protesters in Sulaimaniya injured 14 people, according to a regional health official. Witnesses said police used water cannons and fired weapons over the heads of rock-throwing demonstrators who had taken to the streets to protest the violent response of security forces that killed one demonstrator and injured 57 who attacked the local offices of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. Saturday's protesters shouted ""Down, down with Massoud Barzani"" in a demonstration that began at 11:30 a.m. and lasted several hours. The violence followed another demonstration by hundreds of students at Sulaimaniya University seeking the release of people arrested in previous protests and the prosecution of a local party official they said ordered security forces to open fire. On Thursday, Barzani issued a statement saying the protests were the work of a ""very small group of people determined to undermine the stability of the region."" The regional government is organizing a meeting between government leaders and representatives of opposition groups scheduled for Monday, according to the statement. The protests are the latest in a string of recent demonstrations across Iraq, apparently inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and focusing on complaints of rampant unemployment and poor government services.","Most of the demonstrators oppose the Kurdistan regional president .

"(CNN) -- Former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will pursue a lawsuit against conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. Breitbart posted an edited video clip of Sherrod appearing to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance. The clip showed her addressing a chapter of the NAACP. ""I will definitely do it,"" she said when asked whether she was considering legal action. Sherrod made her remarks during an appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in San Diego, California. Breitbart ""had to know that he was targeting me,"" Sherrod said. ""At this point, he hasn't apologized. I don't want it at this point, and he'll definitely hear from me."" Breitbart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He has said he released the Sherrod video because he believes it shows the NAACP itself tolerates racist behavior within its ranks -- an accusation that came after the civil rights group made a similar charge against the conservative Tea Party movement. ""This was not about Shirley Sherrod,"" Breitbart told CNN's John King. Brent Bozell, head of the conservative Media Research Center, said Thursday Sherrod was the one who needed to apologize. ""Andrew Breitbart is going to be fine. He's done nothing wrong,"" Bozell said. ""I wonder if Ms. Sherrod, who is such a champion of transparency, will publicly disclose who is putting her up to this. And I also hope this champion of honesty will stop lying about Fox News,"" which has been accused of pushing the story before full details emerged, he said. ""I'm also waiting for Ms. Sherrod to publicly apologize for accusing anyone opposed to nationalized healthcare of being racist,"" Bozell said. ""Last time I checked, that was more than half the country."" The controversy surrounding the clip led to a rush to judgment and Sherrod's forced resignation. However, it was later determined that her speech, unedited, focused on how the incident changed her outlook and made her realize people should move beyond race. The incident occurred 24 years ago, before Sherrod began working for the USDA. She received an official apology from the USDA and a phone call from President Barack Obama once the full text of her remarks came to light. Sherrod has since been offered another position at the Agriculture Department. Obama said earlier Thursday that Sherrod ""deserves better than what happened last week."" Speaking at a National Urban League conference in Washington, Obama called the claim of racism against her ""bogus."" ""Many are to blame"" for the reaction that followed, he said, ""including my own administration.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The death of a sixth patient from a SARS-like virus comes on the week that marks 10 years since the deadly outbreak hit Hong Kong. Reports of the new virus' spread remind me of a phone call I received a decade ago: ""Kevin, we're hearing that there might be a case of SARS on Lamma,"" said my boss, referring to the tiny island off Hong Kong where I live. Back then I was working for The Wall Street Journal Asia, and my colleagues and I had been reporting on the outbreak for weeks from our homes. Like many businesses at the height of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, employees were encouraged to stay away from the office, or any other places where large numbers of people gather. Still, I remember thinking: What do I do with this information? How do I defend against what is unknown and unseen? And is the sniffle I have more than just a runny nose? When the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its global alert on March 12, 2003 -- an ominous warning of a ""world-wide health threat"" due the outbreak of an unknown form of severe pneumonia -- Hong Kong became a city under siege. Those of us living in the city in the months following that alert watched as the disease spread daily, growing from 150 confirmed cases in 10 nations to 8,096 cases in 30 nations -- killing 774 people -- by July, according to WHO. Hospitals were overrun, an apartment complex was quarantined, and restaurants and bars in one of the most crowded cities in the world were deserted. The disease decimated social conventions: A public service announcement suggested Japanese-like bows rather than handshakes at business meetings; signs offered instruction on how to wash hands and proper spitting etiquette. Money changing hands suddenly took on a new scrutiny. Catholic priests were forbidden from offering sacramental wine and placing communion wafers in the mouths of the faithful. Many in this city of seven million turned to wearing masks, a prophylactic against panic yet an unnerving reminder of the life-and-death fights in the city's medical centers. We now know SARS started in November 2002 across the border in mainland China's Guangdong Province, percolating there until 10 years ago today. On February 21, 2003, a Chinese doctor who treated patients with atypical pneumonia in Guangdong province in China checked into Hong Kong's Metropole Hotel to attend a wedding. The next day, the doctor was admitted to a Hong Kong hospital for respiratory failure. Disease detectives say SARS then spread to other travelers at the hotel, who then hopped on jumbo jets and spread the illness around the world. But that is hindsight. At the time, more was unknown than known, which ratcheted fears. Statistics offered comfort: The numbers were relatively small, we told ourselves, and noted that tens of thousands of people die each year of pneumonia in the U.S. alone. But our emotional lives aren't lived in a realm of statistical truth, as the casino and lottery industries can attest. You can tell yourself the odds are far against infection, and farther still against death, and yet -- what's that tickle in my throat? Fear was driven by the novelty of the disease. Epidemiologists had a number of false starts on the origin of the disease -- It's chlammydia penuemoniae; no, it's a paramyxovirus -- until it was revealed to be a new strain of coronavirus, the same family of disease as the common cold. This did little to salve public nerves, because who hasn't come down with a cold? One day during the height of the outbreak I went to a movie with a friend, and I choked on my drink. As I coughed uncontrollably, a couple sitting behind us -- the only other people in the theater --got up and left. The economic and political backdrop of the disease didn't help. The WHO announcement came just days before the 2003 Iraq War began. The September 11 terrorist attacks were still fresh in the public psyche, and before the disease was identified many serious questions were being asked whether it was bioterrorist attack. Hong Kong was already dealing with record high employment, which SARS further raised to an unprecedented 8.6% by June. ""It's a general emotional backdrop; life is not safe, the world is not safe, even the ground under my feet I can't count on,"" a local counselor told me at the time. ""People are very, very tired and very insecure."" Rumors spread faster than the disease. The suspected outbreak on my island proved false. After the outbreak at Amoy Gardens, an apartment complex where 329 people were infected and 42 killed, city officials went into overdrive to stop a rumor going viral on the internet that entire city was poised to be quarantined. A 14-year-old boy was later arrested for creating a fake news page creating the story. Most of the sick and dying were city medical professionals -- which made sense, considering they were the ones at the frontline treating the illness -- but that only added to our worries: If doctors and nurses can't protect themselves, how can we? The cost to business was high. Conventions shut down, tourists stayed away. A friend of mine nearly lost his consulting business as he paid office rental space and salaries for three people with no income for three months as clients canceled training sessions. The Asian Develop Bank estimated SARS cost East and Southeast Asian economies $60 billion in lost demand and business revenue. But as the months passed, so did the malady. You could see the green sprouts of recovery in the early weeks as people turned masks into fashion statements, embroidering surgical masks with sequins; other entrepreneurs started selling masks with Hello Kitty or other cartoon characters. On July 1, 2003, half a million of the city's residents took to the streets on the sixth anniversary of the handover of the former British colony to China. Ostensibly, the protests were against a controversial new security measure, but the outpouring of support was fueled by frustrations with public officials over SARS. The city's property market was leveled by fallout from the disease, but anyone who lived in Hong Kong at the time (this author included) is now kicking themselves for not purchasing an apartment during SARS -- the city's property is now among the most expensive in the world. In retrospect, it can be argued that the paranoia of the first few months paid off: SARS was identified and stopped with unprecedented speed. ""It was rapidly contained within less than four months of the initial alert, as a result of an unprecedented level of international cooperation designed to prevent it from becoming established in people, as HIV/AIDS had done during the 20th century,"" Professor David L. Heymann, head of the Centre on Global Health Security at UK think tank Chatham House, recently wrote. Still others argue lessons from SARS remain unlearned. ""Once the initial dilly-dallying gave way to decisive and swift state action, resources were effectively mobilized against the epidemic and policy coordination was significantly improved,"" Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow on global health for the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote earlier this month. ""Yet many of the measures widely credited for stopping the spread of the virus, such as isolation and quarantine, were only implemented after the virus"" had dissipated, he said. The cases of a new SARS-like virus hitting a handful of people in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UK serves as reminder of the strange days that we in Hong Kong lived through a decade ago, and the hope that early detection of these cases will prevent other cities from living through a similar siege.","A decade ago on February 21, the first victim of SARS came to Hong Kong .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has confirmed to Swedish diplomats that it is holding an American citizen, the U.S. State Department said Friday. The State Department has declined to confirm the identity of the citizen, citing privacy issues. But the family of 85-year-old Merrill Newman of Palo Alto, California, has said he has been detained in North Korea since October 26. Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, and it has been working through Sweden -- the U.S. protecting power in North Korea -- to obtain information about the American. ""We are working in close coordination with representatives of the Embassy of Sweden to resolve this issue, and they also have requested on a daily basis consular access,"" State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters. The revelation came the same day that Newman's wife, Lee, pleaded for his release. ""The family feels there has been some dreadful misunderstanding leading to his detention and asks that (North Korea) work to settle this issue quickly and to return this 85-year-old grandfather to his anxious, concerned family,"" she said in a statement. Newman, a Korean War veteran and retired financial consultant, was last seen aboard a flight from Pyongyang to Beijing. Just minutes before the plane was to depart, he was removed from the flight by North Korean authorities, the family has said. ""He has been detained somewhere in North Korea since that time,"" Newman's wife said in the statement. According to the family, Newman and a traveling companion, Bill Hamrdla, had been on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea. The family has said Newman suffers from a heart condition and only had enough medication for the trip. ""We have had no word on the state of his health, whether or not the medications sent to him through the Swedish Embassy in North Korea have been delivered or why he was detained,"" the statement said. The day before Newman was to leave North Korea, he and his tour guide met with ""one or two Korean authorities,"" his son said. During that meeting, Newman's service record was discussed, Jeff Newman said. ""I understand my dad was a bit bothered,"" Newman told CNN. But neither he nor his traveling companion believed there was an issue. The United States this week issued a warning to American citizens against all travel to North Korea, which has become a magnet for adventure travelers after Pyongyang lifted some of its travel restrictions. Newman was a customer of Juche Travel Services of London, company spokesman David Thompson said in a written statement. ""The tour arrangements were handled by the Korea International Travel Company,"" Thompson said. ""Mr. Newman had in place all necessary and valid travel documents to take his tour. We have no information concerning what has occurred to result in the current situation."" The 10-day private tour, which included the use of a tour guide, was the culmination of months of planning, Newman's wife said. ""The postcards sent to friends while on that trip describe good times, good weather and knowledgeable guides,"" she said in the statement. The family's statement came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called on North Korea to release Americans being held, calling the detentions ""very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans."" Newman is one of two American citizens being held in North Korea. The other one, Kenneth Bae, was arrested in November 2012 and sentenced in May to 15 years of hard labor. The North Korean government has said he was found guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government. North Korea has not publicly said why it is holding Newman. Is American man detained in North Korea a bargaining chip? Among the possibilities is his military service. He served as an Army infantry officer during the Korean War, which saw North Korea fight South Korea, the United States and the United Nations between 1950 and 1953. An armistice signed in 1953 ended the three-year war between North Korea and South Korea. The two sides technically remain at war. It is also possible North Korean authorities mistook him for another Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran awarded the Silver Star for valor in combat. North Korean authorities are known to routinely run background checks on foreigners, travel agencies warn potential visitors. The first the decorated combat veteran heard about Newman's detention was in a telephone call from the San Jose Mercury News, which first reported the news of the American's detention. ""I thought it was a coincidence. I didn't think much about it,"" Merrill Newman of Beaverton, Oregon, told CNN. Of his service during the war, he only said: ""I went there, did what I was told and went home, went to college and started a family. ...That's what you did in those days."" How you travel to North Korea . News of the apparent detention came as talks were under way between the United States and China, North Korea's closest ally, about reviving negotiations to dismantle Pyongyang's nuclear program. The timing raises questions about whether North Korea plans to use Newman as a bargaining chip in the negotiations, a move the West has previously accused it of doing to try to gain concessions with negotiations. Newman's detentions bring to at least seven the number of American citizens who have been detained by North Korea, including four who allegedly entered the country illegally, according to the State Department. Two other U.S. citizens who entered the country on valid visas were arrested for other reasons, and U.S. officials have received reports of other Americans being arbitrarily detained, according to the State Department. Previous Americans detained in North Korea have been released when high-profile visitors have traveled to the country to plead their case. Most notably, former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter went on two separate occasions in 2010. Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former ambassador to the United Nations, has visited North Korea a number of times over the years, most recently this year to discuss the release of Bae. Richardson's spokeswoman, Caitlin Kelleher, said he has been ""in touch with his North Korean contacts"" regarding Newman's detention. The photos North Korea doesn't want you to see .

"London (CNN) -- Garett Hickling's personal motto is, ""No fear -- give 110%"" -- and he certainly lives up to it. Despite having broken his neck in a 300-foot cliff fall that killed one of his friends, the 41-year-old Canadian is a legendary figure in the brutal Paralympic sport of wheelchair rugby -- or ""murderball"" as it was originally named. Teams are 12-strong but only four wheelchair athletes are allowed at any time on the court, which is similar to a basketball space, with the basic aim of crossing into the scoring zone at either end while carrying the ball. Contact between wheelchairs is allowed -- and frequent -- while players often get tipped out of their chairs as the action is fast and furious. Hickling, who took up the sport in 1993, is one of its leading players and has the scars to boot. He had to have his neck realigned in 2004, ripped his left tricep in 2008 and last year separated his right shoulder. He has been MVP many times at major international competitions with Canada, including the 2002 world championships in Sweden, where he led his country to the gold medal. Canada won a bronze medal when wheelchair rugby was introduced to the Paralympics in 1996 as an exhibition sport, and then placed fourth when it gained full status at the 2000 Sydney Games. Silver and bronze medals have followed in Athens and Beijing for Hickling and his teammates. Broken neck . Hickling was brought up in British Columbia and played ""pretty much any sport imaginable,"" including ice hockey, baseball and football. But in February 1987 came the accident which was to leave him in a wheelchair. Out with friends, tragedy struck when they fell down a 300-foot cliff. One died, the other suffered severe injuries, and Hickling broke his neck. Determined not to let his disability curtail his sporting activities, Hickling initially took up wheelchair basketball and road hockey, but it was a meeting with Duncan Campbell, one of the Canadian founders of wheelchair rugby, which changed his life. ""He got me to come out, hit my first guy -- knocked him out of his chair -- and haven't looked back since,"" Hickling told CNN's Human to Hero series. That was in 1993, when he was 23, and he has now been competing at the top level for nearly 20 years. North American rivalry . For much of that period, Canada's players have been battling with their neighbors in the United States for global supremacy in wheelchair rugby. In the five world championships held since 1995, the U.S. has come out on top four times, with Canada's 2002 triumph in Gothenburg breaking that chain. But the most recent championships on home courts in Vancouver saw Hickling and his teammates back in fifth spot. Despite that setback, he still relishes the competition, particularly against the Americans. ""There's definitely a little bit of rivalry there because the U.S has been ranked number one for many, many years,"" he said. ""There's definitely a rivalry because we want to be there, and being such close neighbors we compete against each other a lot. "" But with the growing popularity of the sport, other countries are muscling in on the medal action. Golden dream . Heading into the 2012 Paralympics in London, which begin in late August two weeks after the Olympics finish, Hickling believes that the destination of the gold medal is no foregone conclusion, despite the traditional U.S. domination. ""Now, it's anybody's game. In these Olympics you actually don't know who's going to win,"" he said. The result of the Paralympic test event in London last month would appear to back up Hickling's assertion, with Australia beating hosts Great Britain in the final. Canada claimed the bronze medal, beating Sweden, but all the matches were close and high-scoring affairs. In the likely autumn of his outstanding career, Hickling is desperate to add gold to his collection, having come so close in Athens and Beijing. ""I've always enjoyed rugby but my ultimate is to go for that gold,"" he said. ""That helps motivate me, makes me train harder, makes us go out six or seven days a week and try to be in the best shape we can be and ready to go out there and pound some chairs."" Sporting philosophy . As Hickling's motto suggests, he is not an athlete who leaves anything on the court. ""I try to give 110% no matter what I do, whether it's writing a paper or trying to hit a guy ... you know? It's give it all you got, whenever you can."" Despite his uncompromising attitude, Hickling has made many friends off the court, even among his American rivals. ""We do go out and have a drink or social after wards with the guys, but when it's on the court, it's game on!""","Garet Hickling is one of the top players in wheelchair rugby .

"(CNN) -- As Pope Benedict XVI steps down, the moral authority and future of the Roman Catholic Church depends on the next pope forcefully dealing with child sex abuse in its ranks. Benedict had the power to effect fundamental, institutional change from the top that would have protected children of future generations. Benedict failed to change the Vatican's traditional methods of handling child sex abuse by priests and so abuse of children continued, with thousands of more cases. Before his installation as pope, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was the keeper of the traditional papal secrecy around sexual abuse as the leader of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. He issued Vatican orders directing cardinals, archbishops and bishops to keep credibly accused priests in ministry, to move them to a different parish or to keep them in the priesthood because they were too young, too infirm or their removal would cause too much scandal for the church. As pope, he condemned the abuse more strongly than his predecessors, but he did nothing to really change the situation. News: How is a new pope elected? What must the next pope do to regain trust and moral authority? There are seven concrete measures the future pope can and must implement to bring about change within the clerical culture on child sexual abuse.First, disclose the names of all the clerics credibly accused and known to the Vatican worldwide along with the country, state and parish or school where the offenses were allegedly committed. More than a dozen bishops have already created such lists and made them public. Second, publicly disclose all of the documents within the Vatican's archives that pertain to reports of child sex abuse, the Vatican's response to it and the hierarchy's role in the abuse. The church must begin to make amends to survivors, and exposing the secrets and concealment contained in such documents is a critical step. Third, revise church canon law and Vatican protocols so that no secrecy surrounds child sex abuse. Secrecy is toxic, and in it, child abuse flourishes.Fourth, require each bishop and church official to report clergy accused of sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement. Opinion: Benedict a pope aware of his flaws . Fifth, retain independent and outside professionals to conduct an audit to assure compliance and reliability. An example of a case where this independent investigation worked is the Louis Freeh Report regarding Penn State and the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse scandal. Sixth, retain independent and outside professionals, nonclerics who do not have a requirement of obedience to the pope and bishops, to conduct investigations into child sex crimes by clergy. Seventh, retain independent and outside professionals to train, educate and modernize child protection procedures and protocols in every diocese worldwide. To move forward, the Roman Catholic Church and its leader, the next pope, ultimately must handle child sexual abuse among its clergy with transparency and honesty, rather than internally and secretly. Then and only then will the church and its leader regain any moral authority and move the Roman Catholic Church forward from the 16th century to the 21st on child protection. Can any and all of these things be actually done? Of course. But if past is prologue, the Vatican will continue to operate above the law in denial, minimization and blame. News: The pope in retirement -- What to expect . I do believe though that there is hope and promise for a better future with a transformative and transparent attitude at the top, with a new pope dedicated to openness and accountability for all clerics who have participated or been complicit in these crimes. I represent thousands of survivors of childhood sexual abuse by clergy, and in two of those cases, I have named Pope Benedict XVI and the Holy See as defendants, because I truly believe that all roads lead to Rome and thus, responsibility is seated there. Until and unless there is transformational change at the top, they will continue to be faced with worldwide and mounting global crises, external pressures and the continuing fall of a moral empire. Until there is change at the top, it is business as usual. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Anderson.","Jeff Anderson: Pope Benedict XVI's departure is an opportunity for real reform of child abuse .
Next pope must stop culture of secrecy, he says; make names, documents public .
Vatican protocol and law must change and abuse reported to police, he says .
Anderson: Real change will come only with transformation from the top ."
"(CNN) -- The number of interracial couples in the United States has reached an all-time high, with one in every 10 American opposite-sex married couples saying they're of mixed races, according to the most recent Census data released Wednesday. In 2000, that figure was about 7%. The rate of interracial partnerships also is much higher among the unmarried, the 2010 Census showed. About 18% of opposite-sex unmarried couples and 21% of same-sex unmarried partners identify themselves as interracial. The term interracial, as it pertains to the study, is defined as members of a couple identifying as of different races or ethnicities. Neither black nor white: Three multiracial generations, one family . Analysts suggest the new figures could reflect U.S. population shifts, broader social acceptance of such unions and a more widespread willingness among those polled to be classified as mixed race. ""Identifying as an interracial couple shifts over time,"" census spokeswoman Rose Kreider said. Among interracial opposite-sex married couples, non-Hispanics and Hispanics are by far the most frequent combination, making up about 45% of such partnerships, Kreider said. The second most represented group are those in which at least one person identifies as multiracial, while the third are marriages between whites and Asians. Marriages between blacks and whites are the fourth most frequent group among married opposite-sex interracial couples.","One in 10 opposite-sex married couples in U.S. say they're of mixed races, census data show .

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN) -- When Huang Long Hao stepped on stage carrying a kitchen sink to battle against a team of hundreds of Chinese consumers on a recent Saturday afternoon, he knew that he and the sink were most likely going to lose. Shop therapy: Organizing themselves online, Chinese shoppers hunt for bargains in packs . Hao, a sales manager for Gacor, a Chinese kitchenware manufacturer, hoped to sell the sink for 799 yuan (about $120), but the team wouldn't have it. ""No, we don't want it!"" they yelled back at him. ""We're all losing interest,"" joined in the group's negotiator. ""We want the lowest price we can get!"" Sensing his impending defeat, Huang tried a few more times, offering lower and lower prices until the group haggled him down to a final score of 600 yuan (about $85). Team members raised their hands and cheered. ""Dou yao mai! (All of us want it!),"" they chanted as they all got up to place orders for new kitchen sinks. Welcome to China's hottest sport for shoppers: tuangou, or team buying. The game goes like this: Individuals band together via online BBS (bulletin board systems), chat rooms and other Web forums around products they are interested in purchasing, from fast food to cars or furniture. Once a team amasses enough members, their appointed captain approaches retailers to organize in-store haggling sessions. ""The final price was beyond my expectations,"" said Ellen Liu who recently bought a purple Toyota Yaris after her team called ""Shanghai Yaris"" negotiated a 30,000 yuan ($4,400) discount with a local dealer for each of its 40 members wanting to purchase the car. ""We were very surprised."" Since bartering teams started to emerge around five years ago, they have increasingly become a defining characteristic both of online and offline consumerism in China, reshaping the way retailers reach out to customers on the Internet as well as how they interact with them in stores. A number of companies, like the electronics chain Gome, have started to deal directly with the groups, while dozens of professional tuangou Web sites have also emerged. Retailers say they often feel they have no choice but to join the bartering or lose business. Some retailers wait months just for an invitation to take part in an event. ""These events help connect us to consumers,"" Huang told CNN. ""I know I can't make money here, but I am meeting a lot of potential clients."" Huang also says his company monitors Qeeka.com on a daily basis, studying the site's forums for feedback about their products, sometimes even engaging directly with consumers. ""This is crucial to our company's success,"" said Huang. ""We don't want to be left behind by this trend."" The tuangou Web sites negotiate prices on behalf of shoppers while guaranteeing quality products and customer service. They also offer companies valuable market research based upon the conversations consumers are having about products on their online forums. ""We are one of the most influential web sites here in China,"" said Deng Huajin, founder of Qeeka.com, a group purchase site that has over 500 employees working in 22 branches across the country along with around one million registered users. ""All of the home furnishing retailers are setting their eyes on e-commerce, and we are the prominent Web site here, so they want more and more of their business to be done through us."" Part of tuangou's rise in China stems from the still-developing shopping landscape across the country. Quality products can often be hard to come by while pricing systems lack transparency. Chinese consumers are more likely to be influenced by the opinions and experiences of friends rather than advertising. The Internet has also served as a valuable a tool for shoppers to compare prices to ensure the best deal. Hunting in packs . Bargaining is much more than a team sport in China -- it's also a way of life that has been ingrained in the psyche of Chinese society for centuries. ""It is deeply rooted in our culture,"" said Luna Wu, who bought a set of suitcases for 30 percent off the sticker price. ""We have the impulse to bargain everywhere."" Social networking has also been vital to the phenomenon's success. According to 2008 figures from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), nearly 100 million Chinese netizens regularly visit online bulletin boards to share opinions, ask for help or socialize with friends. ""These Internet based communities are the soul of Chinese social media,"" said Sam Flemming of CIC, a Shanghai-based research and consulting firm that tracks Chinese bulletin boards and blogs for multinational companies. ""The Chinese Internet is more developed from a social perspective than in the West. There are more people who are participating in these kinds of conversations, and they are more active. ""You have that foundation where people are already communicating with each other and sharing information and eventually that impacts commerce."" Several companies have tried to start group buying sites in America and Europe, yet most of them have failed due to a sheer lack of interest from consumers. ""I had read about it in China and thought maybe it would work over here, but it didn't work out too well,"" said Eliot Sykes, founder of UK-based StoreMob.com, which is now inactive. ""I am not sure people's attitudes over here are right for it."" However, with the exploding popularity of social networking and the backdrop of the financial downturn, some companies are starting to test whether Western consumers are ready to team up and bargain like the Chinese. One work in progress is a Facebook application called Twangu, which allows buyers to build teams across friend networks for products they want to purchase. The company then recruits retailers to bid against each other to offer the groups the lowest price. ""It is an uphill battle, I will be very frank,"" said John O'Brien, co-founder of Twangu, which now has around 1,000 users. ""Changing consumer behavior is difficult, getting them to understand and trust this site is one thing. The other thing is getting vendors to understand what this means for their business as well,"" said O'Brien. Dell is also trying to harness the potential for commerce via social media with an initiative called Dell Swarm. The concept, which the company started piloting in Singapore in May, encourages customers to buy computers in groups in order to save money. ""With social networking, the innovation is taking place right in front of us,"" Walt Mayo, vice president and general manager of consumer sales and marketing for Dell Asia Pacific and Japan, told CNN. ""It is going to be part of how people engage with companies, learn about products, shop for products and ultimately buy products. How exactly it evolves, we don't know. What we do know is we don't want to sit on the sidelines. We want to engage and start to figure out how this makes sense for us and for our customers.""","Chinese shopping use Internet to organize shopping trips for bargains .

"(CNN) -- Rick Santorum likes to tout his conservative credentials. ""I've been a great, consistent leader of the conservative cause,"" the former two-term Republican senator from Pennsylvania told CNN's John King recently. ""I've been someone who's had ideas, fought for those ideas and have been able to accomplish things."" Santorum formally announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination on June 6, telling an audience that, ""I'm ready to lead. I'm ready to do what has to be done for the next generation."" Santorum made his kickoff comments at a campaign event in Somerset County in the western part of his home state, near where his grandfather worked in a coal mine after coming to America from Italy. Santorum said his grandfather came to Somerset County to escape fascist Italy, to ""give his children, my dad, who 7 years old when he came in 1930, the opportunity for freedom, to live your dreams, because he knew America believed in him, believed in people, gave people a shot, if they worked hard, they could succeed."" Santorum is arguably the most frequent flyer in the battle for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. Since 2009, he has made 15 trips to Iowa, where the caucus is the first contest in the election cycle, 18 to New Hampshire, which holds the first primary, and 15 to South Carolina, the state that holds the first primary in the South. More Santorum coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . Late last year, Santorum started building up staff in these crucial early voting states. On May 3, he announced the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, filing papers with the Federal Election Commission. Two days later, he participated in the first GOP presidential debate in Greenville, South Carolina. Santorum will appear June 13 at a CNN/WMUR/New Hampshire Union Leader debate in the Granite State. For all his travel and appearances, Santorum still has very low name recognition among most Americans, and according to just about every poll, he registers in the low single digits nationally among Republican voters when it comes to the choice for their party's next presidential nominee. Because of his poll numbers and because he faces much better-funded rivals, Santorum faces long odds in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination. But because of his strong opposition to abortion rights and gay rights, Santorum remains popular with many socially conservative voters who have long had an influential role in the GOP primary process. Earlier this spring, Santorum made headlines by winning a much-watched straw poll at the Greenville County, South Carolina, Republican convention. At the Faith and Freedom conference, a recent gathering of social conservatives in Washington, Santorum highlighted his credentials saying, ""I had always been pro-life, I had always been for traditional marriage, but I had always been like a lot of folks -- a lot of folks who weren't here last year but are here this year who come and make the pledge, vow to social conservatives that they'll check the boxes, they'll be for the things social conservatives care about. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't just take the pledge, I take the bullets."" Santorum also emphasizes his pro-Israel stance as well as his experience in the Senate when it comes to foreign policy, which could distinguish him from most of his rivals. And he is hyping his fiscal conservative credentials. In recent interviews, Santorum suggested that House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan's controversial budget is not strong enough, saying ""not even Paul Ryan and his budget now has the temerity to go after Social Security,"" Santorum was elected to the House in 1990, at age 32, and first elected to the Senate four years later. He lost his 2006 re-election bid by 18 points to Democrat Bob Casey Jr. and until last year was largely out of public view except for appearances on the Fox News Channel. He's married with seven children. His youngest, Bella, was born in 2008 with a serious genetic disorder (Trisomy 18), which in most cases is fatal.","Santorum announced his candidacy near Pennsylvania coal mine where grandfather worked .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of government supporters demonstrated in at least five Shiite provinces in southern Iraq on Tuesday, opposing protests by thousands of people in mainly Sunni provinces that have gone on for more than two weeks. The demonstrations highlight the country's sectarian tensions. The Shiite demonstrations took place in Basra, Diwaniyah, Karbala, Al-Muthana and Babil provinces. Demonstrators carried banners reading, ""Yes, yes to al-Maliki implementing the constitution"" and ""No to canceling accountability and justice law,"" referring to Baathists and opposing protesters' demands in Sunni provinces like Anbar and Salaheddin. Protesters chanted, ""No to sectarianism, no to dividing Iraq, yes to national unity."" Some carried Iraqi flags and posters of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is a Shiite. Others carried photographs of relatives who they said were killed in attacks by terrorist groups such as al Qaeda in Iraq. Parts of the demonstrations were broadcast on Afaq satellite television, which al-Maliki owns. Hundreds of pro-government demonstrators took to the streets in Diwaniya province, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) south of Baghdad. There, Shiite cleric Qassim al-Moussawi told the protesters that behind this crisis are ""America and Israel"" as well as ""Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar."" ""No to the return of the Baath party and their loyalists, no to the return of mass graves,"" he shouted. ""We reject dividing Iraq into three regions: Sunni, Shiite and Kurd."" Al-Moussawi also called for a comprehensive dialogue among all political parties to achieve stability in Iraq. The Shiite demonstrations came after ongoing demonstrations in predominantly Sunni provinces inflamed by the arrest of several guards of Sunni Finance Minister Rafei al-Essawi. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have protested for more than two weeks, demanding that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. They also are demanding the release of detainees they said were held without charges, calling the government corrupt and accusing it of unfairly targeting Iraq's Sunni people. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq is closely following the demonstrations, according to a statement released Tuesday. The group supports the political and human rights of all Iraqis, as well their social, cultural and economic rights, in the framework of the rule of law. The protesters have voiced grievances they see as violations of their human rights. The government has acknowledged that peaceful protest is a constitutionally guaranteed right of all Iraqis. ""We call on the protesters to refrain from violence and to maintain the peaceful character of their demonstrations, and on the security forces to show the utmost restraint in maintaining law and order,"" said Martin Kobler, the special representative of the United Nations secretary-general. Kobler said that all sides should engage without delay in a peaceful and constructive dialogue in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution and law.","Shiites demonstrated in Basra, Diwaniyah, Karbala, Al-Muthana and Babil provinces .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Iraqi authorities executed four al-Qaeda senior leaders after they were convicted of terrorism, the nation's Ministry of Justice reported Monday. Manaf Abdul-Raheem Abdul-Hameed al-Rawi, the leader of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq in Baghdad, was among the four who were executed by hanging Monday morning. The executions came on a day when a suicide bomber drove an oil tanker into a police station in central Tikrit, killing at least nine people and wounding 20, an official with Iraq's interior ministry said. Tikrit is about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. It's a predominantly Sunni town located in Salaheddin province and is the hometown of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In Baghdad, two policemen and a civilian were shot dead by gunmen in a pair of incidents, the Interior Ministry said. Two other people were wounded, according to the ministry official. The security situation in Iraq was supposed to be the subject of a parliamentary session Monday attended by Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is also the military's commander-in-chief, along with the acting minister of defense, the acting minister of interior, the commander of Baghdad operation command and the head of Iraqi intelligence services. But al-Maliki did not attend, instead sending a letter to the speaker of the parliament, Ossama al-Nujaifi, saying that to discuss such sensitive issues in an open session could harm national security. 18 killed as car bombs target Shiite worshipers in Iraq . The prime minister asked for a closed session including only the leaders of the Iraqi political blocs and the members of the parliamentary commission for security. He asked that the meeting be at his office to guarantee confidentiality. After the letter was read to Iraqi lawmakers by al-Nujaifi, they agreed to schedule a closed session next week, but insisted that al-Maliki should come to the parliament and discuss security developments in front of all Iraqi lawmakers. ""We will not give up our constitutional duty. It can be in a closed session but al-Maliki should attend the parliament and speak in front of all members of parliament,"" al-Nujaifi said. A few members shouted that al-Maliki should adhere to the Iraqi constitution and not give weak excuses for not attending Monday's session. The session was broadcast live on a number of Iraqi satellite television carriers. However, Al Iraqiya state television aired only part of the session. Executions such as those conducted by the government Monday morning were addressed in Amnesty International's annual report, issued in March. The death penalty was suspended after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion but was quickly restored by the first post-invasion Iraqi government. Executions resumed in 2005. 2 killed when explosive device detonates in Iraqi restaurant . Since then, at least 447 prisoners have been executed, including Saddam Hussein, some of his main associates, and alleged members of armed groups. Hundreds of prisoners await execution on death row. Iraq, where 129 prisoners were hanged in 2012, is now one of the world's leading executioners, Amnesty International said. With Monday's violence, April's start was similar to March's end. On Sunday, at least seven people were killed and more than 17 were wounded in violence across the country, police officials said. In figures compiled by Iraq's Interior, Defense and Health ministries for the month of March, 163 Iraqi civilians, policemen and soldiers were killed in acts of violence across the country and 256 were wounded. The figures don't include the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq. Since the pullout of the U.S.-led coalition forces, Iraqi security forces have sometimes struggled to maintain order. Daily violence has drastically dropped across the country since 2008, but attacks continue.","NEW: Four al-Qaeda senior leaders are executed in Iraq .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China will maintain its one-child policy for at least another decade, the country's family planning minister said in an interview published Monday. Nearly 200 million Chinese will enter child-bearing age over the next 10 years, the government says. The policy, begun in the 1970s, prohibits most couples from bearing more than one child. Nearly 200 million Chinese will enter child-bearing age in the next 10 years, Minister Zhang Weiqing told the China Daily newspaper. He said abandoning the policy during this period would cause ""serious problems and add extra pressure on social and economic development."" ""After the new birth peak ends, we may adjust the policy if there is a need,"" he said. China's population, which now stands at about 1.3 billion, is growing at the rate of 0.6 percent and is expected to peak around 1.6 billion by 2050, according to the U.S. State Department. China's Communist Party first implemented the one-child rule three decades ago amid fears that the country would not be able to feed a skyrocketing population. The policy has prevented about 400 million births, the China Daily said. Families living in cities are barred from having more than one child -- unless neither parents have siblings. In rural areas, the law allows for a second child under certain circumstances. And the guidelines are also looser for ethnic minorities with small population. Enforcement varies but usually takes the form of fines to discourage extra births. While the policy has helped curb population growth, it has also led to forced sterilizations in some parts of the country, the State Department said. Because of a traditional preference for male heirs, many Chinese have aborted female fetuses, according to human rights groups. Even within the country, there have been growing calls in recent years for the law to be overhauled, the China Daily said. Some Chinese worry that the law has led to a gender imbalance. They also worry about China's aging population. Those 60 years of age and older are expected to make up more than 200 million in the next seven years, according to government figures. Zhang said the problems should not be blamed solely on the one-child rule and ""it will be simplistic"" to look for a single approach in addressing them.

"(CNN) -- Mark Zuckerberg is not in danger of losing his job, but that doesn't mean he can brush off recent criticism of his leadership. Facebook has had a rough first three months as a public company. The social network's stock has performed poorly since going public in May, and on Monday morning it dropped to an all-time low of $18.75 -- less than half of the company's initial share price of $38. Investors are looking to place blame for the disappointing performance, and the obvious target is Zuckerberg, the company's founder and chief executive. The 28-year-old casual-wear enthusiast built Facebook from a dorm-room project into a publicly traded company with 900 million monthly users that saw $3.7 billion in revenue and $1 billion in profits last year. But since the stock slumped again this week, some critics have openly questioned whether Facebook's boy-wonder CEO has the maturity necessary to navigate the corporate world. In a much-repeated quote that reflected the divide between buttoned-down Wall Street and laid-back startup culture, one analyst wondered if Zuckerberg ""is in over his hoodie."" ""He is a brilliant guy. He is the visionary behind this company. But ... what he is not is CEO material,"" Newsweek columnist Joanne Lipman told CNN this week. Now Zuckerberg is tasked with rebuilding confidence among investors and employees. And some analysts said they think he should start by speaking up about what, exactly, Facebook is up to. ""It's his responsibility; it is his obligation to deal with investors,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""I'm not sure he cares enough, and I think the management is going to do what the CEO tells them to do."" The shift from coder to investor-relations manager might not come naturally to Zuckerberg, who has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook was not started as a company, and its goal is to focus on the product before profit. ""We don't build services to make money; we make money to build better services,"" he said in a letter to investors before going public. But since its initial public offering, the company has been slow to introduce major new products. One cause of the company's stock troubles, according to Pachter, is that it changed its strategy between its IPO and the first earnings call, significantly increasing operating costs. The vast majority of Facebook's revenue comes from advertising, but the company hasn't explained in detail what it's spending its new revenue on, and how or when those investments will translate into increased profits. A lack of transparency can create uncertainty, which causes people who own the stock to sell and people who are inclined to buy the stock to wait until they have more information, Pachter said. ""Investors don't know how to think about Facebook, most likely because they don't use it,"" said Brian Solis, an analyst at Altimeter Group, who speculates that typical investors are more likely to be on LinkedIn. He agrees that more communication from Zuckerberg is needed to give investors faith. Even shareholders who fully understand Facebook's business model are jumping ship. The company's morale was dealt a huge blow this week when venture capitalist Peter Thiel, a board member and early Facebook investor, unloaded the majority of his shares, bringing the amount of money he's made off the company to more than $1 billion. Loss of confidence by shareholders exacerbates Wall Street's other major concern -- that Facebook issued too many shares to begin with. Facebook's lockup periods -- rules that prevent early investors and employees from selling stock for a set amount of time following an IPO -- are starting to expire, allowing people such as Thiel to sell. ""The lockups are expiring too soon; the market is just not prepared to absorb this many shares,"" Pachter said. Facebook employees aren't able to sell their stocks just yet, but if Zuckerberg can't instill confidence in Facebook soon, they could add to the problem by selling off their shares as soon as it's allowed later this year. For now, they are powerless to do anything but watch while the value of their stock tumbles. Sagging morale can have a negative impact on every aspect of running a business, including employee recruiting and retention. According to The Wall Street Journal, Zuckerberg addressed employees' concerns in a meeting in August, saying he understands it may be ""painful"" for them to watch the value of the stock drop. ""He focuses on shipping and user experience. He gives his employees a mission to believe in,"" said Solis, who favorably compares Zuckerberg's strategy to that of Steve Jobs, another tech-company founder who focused on products above investors. That leadership approach turned out pretty well for Apple. But Zuckerberg is not leading the company on his own. He has surrounded himself with experienced Silicon Valley and business veterans, including Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, who previously worked at Google and for the U.S. Treasury Department. Publicly, Zuckerberg is keeping his head down while Facebook works to address other issues, such as its challenges making money on mobile users. On Thursday, the company rolled out updates to its mobile iPad and iPhone apps, which are significantly speedier than the previous versions. Also, the company's purchase of Instagram was approved by the Federal Trade Commission this week, which will allow Facebook to focus even more on mobile products. Despite some speculation in the media about whether he might step down, Zuckerberg's job is safe. He has job security primarily because he smartly owns 20.7% of Facebook's stock and has a 57% voting stake in the company. Many investors also recognize how integral his image and leadership are to the Facebook brand, and they are still willing to give him a chance. ""He has not proven his lack of ability and he has not yet proven his ability,"" Pachter said. ""So let's give him a few more quarters and see what he does.""","Facebook stock hit a record low of $18.75 this week .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States accused Russia on Monday of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing cruise missile tests that date to 2008, senior State Department and White House officials said. ""This is a very serious matter which we have attempted to address with Russia for some time now,"" said a senior State Department official. Russia's suspected violation of the treaty was first reported Monday by The New York Times. ""The 2014 Compliance Report of the treaty includes a determination that the Russian Federation is in violation of its INF Treaty obligations not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,417 miles), or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles,"" a White House official said, adding that they ""have kept the Congress and our allies informed of this matter."" The violation was for cruise missile tests that date back to 2008, prompting an administration review as to whether the tests are in violation of the 1987 treaty between the United States and Russia banning medium range missiles. President Barack Obama has written his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin a letter about the matter. Monday's news comes during a increasingly icy period for relations between Washington and Moscow due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia is said to be supporting separatists. The United States will place new sanctions on Russia this week, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken announced Monday without elaborating. Opinion: We must end this trade in weapons of war . The United States also is upset with Russia for giving asylum to National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. The officials said the administration has also informed NATO allies of Russia's suspected violation. The officials said Washington, which first raised the issue with Russia last year, has recently notified Moscow of the determination and has proposed senior-level talks in the effort to bring Russia back into compliance with its obligations under the treaty. Officials pointed out the treaty doesn't just protect the United States and Russia, but the 11 former Soviet republics also a party to the treaty, as well as allies in Europe and East Asia. ""The United States is committed to the viability of the INF Treaty. We encourage Russia to return to compliance with its obligations under the Treaty and to eliminate any prohibited items in a verifiable manner,"" the senior state department official told CNN. One of the officials said further talks with America's allies would ""take into account the impact of this Russian violation on our collective security if Russia does not return to compliance."" The administration has been raising this issue with Russia for more than a year. The Russians responded that they investigated the matter and considered it closed.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The father of a New Jersey man who went missing while studying in Israel has joined police and hundreds of volunteers searching the forest outside Jerusalem where his son disappeared. Yeshiva student Aaron Sofer, 23, was reported missing Friday by a friend who was hiking with him in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. Sofer's father, Moshe Zvi Sofer, arrived in Israel Monday with his wife from their home in Lakewood, New Jersey, to join the search, which is now in its fifth day. The couple is offering a 100,000 shekel (about $28,000) reward for whoever finds their son, Sofer's father said in a video posted online. ""It means a lot to us that everyone is doing their share, whatever they could to help us find my son,"" he told CNN at the search site Wednesday. Police, volunteers search forest . Avishai Landau, who is organizing the search, said the group of ""hundreds and hundreds of people"" started combing the forest Saturday. Landau, who's been volunteering on search and rescue missions for years, called Sofer's disappearance ""extremely unusual,"" and said that the search party has come up empty-handed. ""We have absolutely nothing that could explain what happened to him,"" he said. Police have questioned a friend of Sofer's who was ""the last man who saw him face-to-face, eye-to-eye,"" Rosenfeld said. The friend lost contact with Sofer while walking with him and reported the disappearance to authorities, the police spokesman added. What happened? ""We are looking in a number of directions,"" Rosenfeld said. ""It is not clear if the disappearance was personal [or a] kidnapping. It's not clear at all."" The missing man's brother, Joel Sofer, told CNN Tuesday that family members are ""just praying hard and doing everything we could do."" He said he had visited the area where his brother went missing. ""I actually was over there today on site,"" he told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""And you know, there's nothing. They have no evidence. They can't find anything."" Binyomin Isseeman, Sofer's rabbi in Lakewood, called the young man a ""very normal, a very healthy boy."" ""His mind is clear, no problems at all,"" Isseeman said to CNN affiliate WCBS reported. U.S. State Department assisting . Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the U.S. Department of State was helping Israeli authorities in the search for Sofer. ""There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction,"" Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Sofer's disappearance comes two months after what Israeli authorities have called the revenge killing of Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16. His body was found in the Jerusalem Forest on July 2, just miles from where Sofer went missing. Two minors and an adult were indicted in the killing. Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in June. One of the Israeli youths also had American citizenship. CNN's Michael Schwartz reported from Jerusalem and Leigh Remizowski reported from New York.

"(CNN) -- When life gives you Comcast, make a ""shamecast."" Shamecasting is what I'm calling tech journalist Ryan Block's ingenious method of publicly shaming Comcast for the way the cable company treated him on the phone. I hope it becomes a national trend. On Tuesday morning, Block posted an audio clip of his 18-minute, nightmarish attempt to try to cancel service. Instead of cooperating with Block's simple request, which Comcast is legally required to do, the customer service representative badgered him, threw up obstacles and generally exhibited sociopathic behavior. After the clip went viral, Block received an official apology from the company, which said, in part: ""The way in which our representative communicated with him is unacceptable and not consistent with how we train our customer service representatives."" Nor is it consistent with the social norms of any society on Earth. Yet the clip went viral because of our cathartic solidarity with Block. We've all been held hostage by big companies afraid of losing business. We've all been told by anonymous customer service representatives that they ""can't"" help us. They ""can't"" discontinue service. They ""can't"" give us a confirmation number. In short, we've all felt helpless. Comcast's apology also cited its ""embarrassment."" If embarrassment is the only language these companies speak, let's give it to them. Let's shamecast companies who refuse to treat customers with respect. Coincidentally, a few weeks before the Comcast episode, I started recording my own phone calls with customer service representatives. My latest dispute had gone on for months, and I was still receiving bills for work that was never done (and that had been officially canceled). But things took a swift turn when I notified the representative that I was recording the conversation. Soon after that call, I was contacted by the same person â€” this time with an apologetic tone, assuring me the matter was resolved. Most customer service representatives do not exhibit the sociopathic behavior of the Comcast employee. Most customer service reps are nice people who are just trying to do their job. Furthermore, many of them have to suffer their own abuse from angry callers who feel trapped and mistreated by a company. Most of the time it's not the customer service rep's fault. But we've got to do something about the dysfunctional system of customer service. Enter shamecasting. Online review sites are helpful, but there's a big difference between interpretation and reality. With a recorded conversation, you've got proof. It's the difference between ""I'm being mistreated by a company"" and ""I'm being mistreated by a company â€” listen to this audio clip of our interaction."" The next time you call a big company and get a difficult customer service representative, protect yourself. If you have an iPhone, you don't need anything else. There are several apps that can record calls for you. (For legal reasons, make sure you notify the representative that you're recording the call.) If you don't have a smartphone, no problem. As long as you put your call on speakerphone, there are several ways to record it. Most laptops have built-in microphones, and you can simply record the conversation using Garage Band or another piece of recording software. Or you can buy a cheap digital audio recording device that records in several modes, including .wav and .mp3. These files can be easily transferred to your laptop, and then, if necessary, to the Internet. As you record your conversation, stay calm. If anybody is going to look like the bad guy, it's not going to be you. Hopefully, your call will go well, the company will cooperate with your request, and you can go about your day. But if not, you can upload your audio clip to Soundcloud, like Block did, and then broadcast it to the world through Twitter, Facebook, or your blog. Imagine the relief you'll experience the next time you interact with a telephone representative. When he or she tells you that your call may be recorded for ""quality assurance purposes,"" you will be able to respond with: ""And just so you know, I'm recording this call for consumer protection purposes.""","A Comcast customer service representative's rude call with a customer went viral .

"(Wired) -- Walking into one of Yayoi Kusama's infinity rooms is like walking into a completely different universe. The door shuts behind you, and suddenly you find yourself surrounded by what appears to be a galaxy of shimmering LEDs. The scene is beautiful, in a surreal, space-age fairy tale sort of way. But it's also a little jarring in its intimacy; it's almost as though you've been instantly transported from a whitewashed gallery into Kusama's buzzing, obsessive mind. It's a strange place to inhabit, if only because you get the sense that what goes on inside Kusama's mind is very different than what's happening inside, say, your neighbor's, or your colleague's. The Japanese artist has lived in a Japanese mental institution since the 1970s, when she checked herself in after a particularly stressful stint in New York City. But Kusama's struggle with obsessive compulsive disorder and other mental anguishes is not a shameful secret. In fact, it's the opposite. Read more: Wildly detailed drawings that combine math and butterflies . Kusama's mental woes fuel her work, with her obsession and compulsion manifested in her exaggerated use of shapes, colors and mirrored rooms. For as long as Kusama has been an artist (she's currently in her mid-80s), she's been obsessed with polka-dots. A result of hallucinations she's had since childhood, the shapes are plastered across her paintings, on her clothes, and incorporated into her trippy infinity rooms. It's not hyperbole to say they are everywhere. Including her newly opened show at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York City. In ""I Who Have Arrived in Heaven"", Kusama continues the motif with 27 new paintings and two infinity rooms, all covered in dots of varying shapes and sizes. The colorful large-scale paintings covered in eyes and dots are beautiful works in their own right, but the real reason most people will trek to the Chelsea gallery and wait in the 4-hour line is to see Kusama's brilliant mirrored infinity rooms. GIZMODO - Infinity Rooms from Gizmodo on Vimeo. Kusama has been making these magical boxes since the 1960s, when she first lined a small room with mirrors and filled it with polka-dotted phallic shapes, creating what I like to imagine a brothel in the Dr. Seuss universe might look like. Her newest room, ""The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away,"" is more along the lines of her beloved ""Fireflies on the Water,"" a mirrored infinity room that showcased hundreds of warm-hued LEDs at the Whitney last year. Read more: Mind-blowing portraits made of test tubes and pushpins . In her new room, Kusama has again suspended multi-colored LEDs from the ceiling at varying lengths that reflect off of the mirrored walls and shallow pool on the floor in a strobe light pattern that repeats itself every 45 seconds. Just down the street at the gallery's connected space is another infinity room, ""Love Is Calling, which this time is filled with brightly colored inflatable sculptures covered in polka dots that shoot up from the floor and hang from the ceiling like technicolor tentacles. The artist says the kaleidoscopic rooms are her attempt to investigate life, death and infinity, and if you're prone to existential pondering, it's easy to see that connection. Contemplating the infinite does have a way of drudging up those ""what's it all mean?"" feelings. But for most people, being inside Kusama's glimmering universe is simply a brief reprieve from a dulled world they left on the other side of the door. For a moment, you can almost forget about the line waiting outside, the 360 degrees of mirrors and ultimately, yourself. But just for a momentâ€”because there's no way you're leaving without taking a selfie. I Who Have Arrived in Heaven will be at David Zwirner through December 21 . Read more from WIRED: .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the important decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to block mining in Alaska's Bristol Bay in order to protect the wild salmon population there, it's a good moment to take stock of the many dangers facing our world's waterways -- and our world's fish. It turns out the wild salmon of Bristol Bay are one of the five least toxic fish to eat around the globe and thankfully will stay that way, thanks to the Obama administration. But what are the other four? And why are the world's fish and water under such threat? A range of abuses of the environment flow into each other in our world's oceans and lakes and rivers. There's marine pollution in which garbage is intentionally disposed of or carelessly dropped into our waters to such an extent that, for instance, in the north Pacific, there is actually a giant swirling vortex of garbage estimated to be the size of Texas. Then there's climate change. Our world's oceans have already absorbed 80% of the additional global heat that has been added to our climate system and absorbed 33% of the carbon dioxide humans have emitted into the atmosphere. Add to that over-fishing. With the world's fish supplies already cut down by environmental hazards, mass fishing technologies like bigger boats and bigger nets have cut the fish population even further, which in turn limits reproduction and natural repopulation. A stunning three-quarters of the world's fish supply is being harvested faster than the fish can reproduce. And 80% of the world's fish have already been fully exploited or are facing perilous decline. And then the fish that survive are sick. Water runoff dumps poisons like industrial PCBs, heavy metals, including mercury and lead, agricultural pesticides and sewage system effluents directly into our water. Fish eat or absorb that poison and when you eat the fish, those toxins are passed onto you, often at dangerous levels. So what's an omnivore to do? Fortunately, there are good fish -- fish that are healthy to eat and responsibly caught in ways that are good for the health of other fish and our oceans. According to SeafoodWatch.org, a helpful resource on these issues, healthy fish must have low levels of mercury and provide high levels of Omega-3s (the good oils our bodies can and should be getting from eating fish). Plus healthy fish are caught or farmed responsibly, which prevents endangered fish populations -- yes there are many -- and ensures that dolphins or other sea creatures aren't harmed by fishing nets. So what are the best fish to eat? According to SeafoodWatch, in addition to Alaska's wild caught salmon (the salmon now thankfully preserved in Bristol Bay and beyond), you want to go with canned wild Alaska salmon, Atlantic mackerel and freshwater Coho salmon. Also... sardines, the subject of the video at the top of this story. Wild-caught Pacific sardines are plentiful and quick to reproduce and don't eat a lot of toxins during their short lives. And they can taste great, especially if you find larger filets and grill 'em up. Those are the best of the best. SeafoodWatch also counts as healthy choices sablefish/black cod from Alaska and the Canadian Pacific, and troll- or pole-caught albacore tuna from the United States or British Columbia. And if you can't get these, there are less sustainable and only sorta-toxic options in between, but it's best to avoid the ""dirtiest of the dirty"" fish, which include imported catfish and shrimp, bluefin tuna and Chilean sea bass. In general, stick with the fish on the healthy list, and you'll be doing your body and the planet a big favor. Responsible fish eating won't solve all our ocean and fish problems around the globe. We still have to stop polluting the oceans and address climate change, which is hurting our nation's water. But for starters, one thing you can do when you go out to eat or cook at home is pick fish that are good for you and good for the planet. It's a simple and delicious step in the right direction.

"DAMASCUS, Syria (CNN) -- Syria hopes a series of indirect talks with Israel will soon lead to direct negotiations, President Bashar al-Assad told CNN's Cal Perry Thursday in an exclusive interview. French President Nicolas Sarkozy (right) and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad meet in Damascus. Al-Assad said that possibility was discussed during a summit attended by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the leaders of Turkey and Qatar. Word of the Syrian proposal came during a landmark visit to Damascus by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. He and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad took part in a summit Thursday that also included the leaders of Turkey and Qatar. ""The dialogue today was about the peace,"" al-Assad told CNN's Cal Perry in an exclusive interview. ""I could not say we achieved something but starting the dialogue is a positive issue."" Al-Assad told CNN: ""We are talking about the future, the role of Europe and especially France in particular during the next phase which is the direct negotiations,"" he said. Syria and Israel have been involved in indirect talks in Turkey for the past few months. There have been four rounds of talks so far, and Syria hopes to begin a fifth round early next week, according to a senior official close to the negotiations. The Syrian government has put forward a six-point proposal outlining goals for furthering indirect talks with Israel, a senior Syrian government official. The Syrian government handed the proposal to Turkey to pass along to Israel, the senior official said. Israeli officials did not immediately confirm whether they had received a copy of Syria's proposals, but they did say they were trying to set up another round of talks with Turkish mediation. ""We are still interested in the continuation of the talks with a genuine intention to reach an agreement,"" an Israeli official said. U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said the United States wants to see Syria ""play a more productive role in the region."" ""I think it remains to be seen just how serious Syria is about engaging in peace discussions with Israel,"" Wood said. ""If Syria is serious about it, about making peace with Israel, I think what is important is to see actions not words."" Al-Assad has consistently said the United States must be involved in the process before any direct talks can begin. He has also said there is no point in involving the U.S. before the presidential election in November. The Bush administration hasn't ""done anything, to be honest,"" he said. ""Now it's too late. We have to wait for the next administration, after the American election, to see what we can do."" Al-Assad added that he would be happy to host whichever presidential candidate won the election but would not say if he thought Republican John McCain or Democrat Barack Obama would be better for U.S.-Syrian relations. Sarkozy is the highest-level French official to visit Syria since their good relations froze after the 2005 assassination of the former Lebanese prime minister, anti-Syrian Rafik Hariri. A U.N.-appointed commission investigating Hariri's assassination has implicated top Syrian officials. Syria has denied any involvement in Hariri's murder.  Watch more about Sarkozy's visit to Syria » . Sarkozy said Wednesday the two countries were about to open a new page in their friendship, the official Syrian news agency, SANA, reported. The French president said indirect talks between Syria and Israel were ""excellent"" for the two countries and for the region, and he expressed hope that they would lead to direct talks as soon as possible, SANA said. The main issue in the Syria-Israel negotiations is the Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the 1967 war. The senior official close to the negotiations said one prospect being discussed is a land-buyback plan to allow Syria to purchase the Golan Heights over a period of 99 years. CNN's Cal Perry and Jordana Miller contributed to this report.","Syrian president raises possibility of direct talks with Israel .

"NASHUA, New Hampshire (CNN)  -- The economy in southern New Hampshire is not by any means among the worst in the nation. Still, according to city records, there are 29 foreclosed homes on the books in Nashua -- many of which are in deplorable condition. Walls had been ripped open in this foreclosed home in Atlanta, Georgia. ""This house is not livable right now,"" Nelson Ortega, the city's chief building code inspector, told CNN as he stood in front of a boarded-up single-family home on a residential street in Nashua. The foundation of the house was fractured, Ortega said, and there were cracks and fissures in many of the supporting beams. At the side entrance to the house were broken windows, garbage and peeling paint. In 2006, Ortega said, the property sold for $200,000. It's anyone's guess, he said, what price the home might bring now, if it ever sold. That this foreclosed home might not ever sell was not news to a researcher who lives nearby. ""About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged, either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure, that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing,"" Thomas Popik told CNN. ""So there is going to be all kinds of government programs to help, but if they don't qualify for standard mortgage financing, there's no one to buy these properties."" Popik says responses from thousands of real estate agents nationwide to the questionnaires he sends out quarterly indicate that badly damaged foreclosed homes -- so-called ""distressed"" properties in real estate jargon -- are a much bigger element of the national housing picture than officials in Washington have acknowledged. Popik's work is under the auspices of Campbell Communications, a Washington-based group that supplies data to private mortgage industry analysts. ""In many cases, it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses, it's just not cost-effective,"" he told CNN. ""And the properties are eventually going to be bulldozed."" In some cities hit harder by the national economic downturn, a quick glance at foreclosed homes paints an even harsher picture. ""A lot of these homes have been vandalized,"" Dana Ash, an Atlanta, Georgia, real estate broker, told CNN. She was speaking in front of several foreclosed, boarded-up houses not far from the city's center. ""They are a little scary going into them,"" she said. ""The power is out, a lot of them are boarded up."" A CNN camera crew was allowed into several of the houses. Trash was everywhere; plaster walls had been ripped open to expose wiring; and in one case a toilet was dumped on an empty living room floor. The banks that own the properties, Ash told CNN, probably will not simply walk away from the homes. ""Usually abandoning homes means it hasn't sold,"" she explained. ""They will eventually sell. It will be pennies at best on the dollar, but they will eventually sell."" From his office in New Hampshire, Popik said he is not at all certain of that. ""There are some cases where the properties have been so damaged that it's not profitable for the mortgage investor, which is a bank, to take title to the property,"" he said. The Mortgage Bankers Association told CNN it found no hard evidence of such a trend. Some of the information, a spokesman said, was ""anecdotal,"" but there was no data one way or the other yet collected. A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington told CNN that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties. But, the spokesman added, the worse the economy is in a particular region, the more damaged and vandalized foreclosed homes are likely to be.","Many foreclosed homes are so damaged, they probably won't be sold, some say .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong's narrow streets were once a dazzling gallery of neon, where banks and even bordellos plied their trade under sizzling tubular signs. But while the city's nights remain bright, its fluorescent facades are fast disappearing as science and safety concerns make them obsolete. The lights are unlikely to go out completely, however, thanks to a new museum that hopes to preserve Hong Kong's colorful past so that it can illuminate generations to come. M+, a state of the art ""visual culture"" museum due to open in 2017 has already acquired two classic 1970s neon logos -- one depicting a red rooster and the other a large cow. Now it's seeking public help to keep Hong Kong's neon heritage ablaze. Light bulb moment . Aric Chen, head curator of the museum's art and design section, came across the rooster sign, the well known mascot of Hong Kong's Kai Kee Mahjong schools, in 2013 while touring an area earmarked for redevelopment. That was to prove a light bulb moment. ""It was a no-brainer for us to collect neon signs,"" he says. ""They are a marriage of craft and technology, as well as typography and graphic design. ""They are used by artists and filmmakers as a lens for us to look at Hong Kong visual culture."" To drum up interest in its new acquisition, M+ is holding an online exhibition of Hong Kong's neon signs. The show calls on the public to submit images and information on their favorites. The crowd-sourcing approach is more than just a digital-era gimmick -- it's a necessity. ""Neon signage is a highly under-researched topic,"" says Chen. ""We are asking the public to tell us what they know about them so we can document what is left."" Fading neon glory . The museum's spotlight on neon is well timed since the signs are rapidly becoming obsolete in Hong Kong, unlike 30 years ago when they supported a thriving industry. ""There were so many orders we almost couldn't handle it,"" veteran neon craftsman Leung Lap Kei says in a video documentary by M+. Those neon glory days are gone. William Tam, the second generation owner of Hong Kong signmakers Nam Wah Neonlight & Electrical Manufacturing, says orders have decreased by 85% since the 1970s. One reason is a government crackdown on illegal and unsafe structures that in 2009 led to the removal of about 5,000 signboards, many of them neon. ""In the 1980s, whenever we had a serious typhoon, several signs would get blown down,"" recalls Lawrence Yau of Hong Kong's Urban Renewal Authority (URA). ""There has been an official campaign as early as the 1980s to remove illegal signage. This wasn't only due to safety concerns. Many of the signs removed in Mongkok and Yau Ma Tei districts were also related to prostitution."" The neon cow that will enter the M+ collection was deemed unfit as, at 4.5 meters wide, it busts official size limits. In 2010, authorities issued an ultimatum to the owner of Sammy's Kitchen, the steakhouse where the cow had been hanging for three decades, to take it down or face a fine of up to HK$200,000 ($25,000) and a year in jail. Yau, a curator for Hong Kong's Heritage Museum before taking up post at the URA, is sorry to see the cow go, but says: ""Life has to move on. Today's design is tomorrow's history."" Buzzing bulbs . Perhaps the biggest enemies of neon are its own idiosyncrasies. The lights are tricky and expensive to make, requiring a neon tube-bending technician and, for something like the neon cow, a budget of HK$250,000 ($32,225). Plus, that classic neon sign buzzing sound gets on some people's nerves. The city's streets continue to be bathed in fluorescence -- so much so that it's considered the most light-polluted place in the world. But these days, Hong Kong business owners who want their brand name up in lights opt for cheaper, energy efficient LEDs that lack the whimsy and extravagance of handmade neon. A push from mainland China to use LEDs has also dimmed Hong Kong's love of neon. ""Many cities in China no longer support neon signage and this inevitably affects Hong Kong's businesses,"" says Tam. Since LED light is harsher than the soft glow of neon, it's a trend that has worsened Hong Kong's light pollution. It also creates other environmental issues since LEDs, unlike neon, aren't normally repaired or reused.resurrects . But the neon lights aren't going out for good. ""It's fairly safe to say neon's heyday is over and not coming back,"" says Chen. ""However, it is such a compelling medium and holds so many associations that artists, designers and filmmakers will continue to use it in their work. ""Neon is increasingly being seen on its own terms. In terms of quantity, neon will recede. In terms of content, it is almost growing.""","Hong Kong's newest museum now owns a rooster and a cow sign .
Neon production has decreased by 85% since 1970s .
Unauthorized signs can lead to HK$200,000 fine and jail .
China pushes the use of LED lights over neon ."
"(CNN) -- In the age of Amazon and e-books, common wisdom claims that brick-and-mortar bookstores are going the way of the dinosaurs. If a national chain such as Borders, which folded in 2011, couldn't succeed in this climate, what are the odds of an independent shop going the distance? Surprisingly good, it turns out. I've published three novels over the past three years, and each time I head out on tour, I discover amazing bookstores. While it's hard to beat the Internet for sheer efficiency, virtual book-buying can't satisfy the same itch for discovery that browsing in person can. Moreover, it's become easy to love e-books and local stores since Kobo started partnering with independents to make some 3 million titles available electronically. The stores that are succeeding offer a mix of author visits, staff recommendations and community outreach that's impossible to replace. While there are incredible indies all over North America, these are my favorites: . BookPeople: Austin, Texas . They say everything is bigger in the Lone Star State, and BookPeople seems determined to make that point. This three-story shop has sat on a prime plot of downtown Austin real estate since 1970, and its marquee sign out front lists that day's special guests, which have included former presidents, rock stars and best-selling novelists. What makes BookPeople special is that it's just as welcoming to newly minted authors, too. While every department is fully stocked, crime novels get a lot of love here, especially since the 2012 launch of MysteryPeople, a store within the original store. Big as the store is, it's still a place where handwritten notes from staff line the shelves, personally recommending favorite reads. 6 incredible artist studio tours . The Poisoned Pen: Scottsdale, Arizona . While its name suggests a criminal enterprise, The Poisoned Pen specializes in fiction -- not only mysteries, but historical novels, literary fiction and works set in the Southwest. Still, crime fiction is close to its dark little heart -- beating since 1989 -- and this is a place that stocks its shelves with British and Canadian titles that are often impossible to find elsewhere. The store's owners are so passionate about books that they founded the Poisoned Pen Press in 1997, and it's since become one of the largest hardcover publishers of English-language mysteries in the world. I think of it as the little press that could. Ben McNally Books: Toronto . If I could give an award for the most beautiful bookstore in North America, this one in Toronto's Financial District would win. With its soaring ceiling, elegant chandeliers, slender columns and leather wing chairs, Ben McNally looks like an idyllic private club for book lovers. Some dedicated bookworms have even tied the knot in the store. Beautiful as it is, the shop's biggest strength is its charming staff, who are adept at sussing out any visitor's interests and recommending what to read next. Seductive as their home base is, they also sponsor readings and events around the city. Mysterious Galaxy: Redondo Beach, California . The first time I encountered the staff of this shop wasn't at the store itself, but at a Noir at the Bar reading in Los Angeles -- a popular crime fiction reading series that takes place in cities across the country. Home base is a shiny new space that only opened in 2011 (the original San Diego store has been operating since 1993), but Mysterious Galaxy is hardwired into the local community, hosting author events at schools, its popular Ladies, Lunch & Literacy program at independently owned restaurants, and organizing the Passion & Prose conference for romance readers. Subterranean Books: St. Louis . When Subterranean opened in 2000, it carried a mix of new and secondhand books; since then, it's shifted its focus to carrying only new books. But they don't try to stock everything. Instead, they've carved out a niche with cult-classic novels, intriguing offerings from small presses, and books about film, pop culture and history. Everything in the store has been personally selected by staff members, so their recommendations are deeply personal. The Tattered Cover: Denver . Technically, there are three branches of the Tattered Cover, and each one is spectacular in its own right. The downtown store near Union Station, which boasts 20,000 square feet of retail space, is where the Dalai Lama reads when he comes to town, and there's the gorgeous Highlands Ranch outpost in the suburbs. My personal favorite is the location on East Colfax Avenue, which remade the historic Lowenstein Theater into a bibliophile's paradise with cozy corners and couches. McNally Jackson: New York . It looks like an elegant, old-fashioned bookstore, with its tightly packed rows of bookshelves, overstuffed international newsstand and a cafÃ© that serves rose water and cappuccino. But underneath that elegant surface beats the heart of an innovator. That was clear when McNally Jackson introduced its Espresso Book Machine, which takes mere minutes to print library-quality paperbacks from a catalog of almost 4 million titles. (That same machine also allows authors who wish to self-publish in print easy access to a press.) Book Passage: San Francisco . This shop has two locations, but the tiny one in the San Francisco Ferry Building is the one that grabbed my heart. I discovered it while attending a conference, and I was instantly charmed by its towering shelves, spectacular travel section and inspiring view of the water. Two years later, I returned on tour and found the same staff I'd met the first time still working in the store. ""We never want to leave,"" one told me. I didn't either. La Maison Anglaise: Quebec City . In a city where fewer than 5% of the population is Anglophone, what hope could there be for a store specializing in English-language books? La Maison Anglaise, whose name translates as The English House, has been going strong since 1984 in its small space near Laval University. That's partly because its owner, Guy Dubois, is an extraordinary organizer who co-founded the QuebeCrime literary festival, which has drawn superstar writers such as Lawrence Block, Ian Rankin and Daniel Woodrell to town. Parnassus Books: Nashville . This is the one store on my list that I haven't visited -- yet. But I'll be in Nashville for a conference in August, and Parnassus Books is at the top of my sightseeing list. One reason why is that the store was co-founded by Ann Patchett, the author of ""Bel Canto"" and one of my favorite novelists. I love the fact that she opened this store at the end of 2011 when independent bookstores appeared to be in steep decline. (Patchett decided to open the store after Nashville lost its last local bookshop, saying she had ""no interest in living in a city without a bookstore."")

"Washington (CNN) -- Central American leaders signaled to President Barack Obama they're working on a ""comprehensive plan"" to address the underlying reasons for the surge of immigrant youth from their countries who are entering the United States illegally. The presidents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala met with Obama at the White House on Friday as Washington struggles to find a solution to what many consider a humanitarian crisis. The influx this year of tens of thousands of child immigrants, many unaccompanied, has become a partisan flashpoint on the already divisive issue of reforming a U.S. immigration system that all sides agree is broken. Obama and Presidents Otto Perez Molina of Guatemala, Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras, and Salvador Sanchez Ceren of El Salvador issued a statement that reiterated ""our commitment to prevent families and children from undertaking this dangerous journey and to work together to promote safe, legal, and orderly migration."" They ""all agreed that an effective solution requires a comprehensive and joint effort"" from those countries, other nations in the region and the United States, they said. Specifically, the Central American presidents ""indicated"" to Obama that they were working on a plan to address the root causes of why people are leaving their countries. Underlying causes . Part of that, all at the meeting agreed, must address strategies for reducing crime and promoting greater social and economic opportunity. Priorities include pursuing criminal enterprises ""that are exploiting this uniquely vulnerable population"" and the need to discourage use of ""smuggling networks"" that place immigrants at ""high risk of violent crime and sexual abuse."" Obama and the others also pledged to redouble efforts to counter misinformation about U.S. deportation policy around young immigrants that some say is fueling the surge, and promised to further efforts to ""humanely repatriate migrants, consistent with due process."" Most can't stay . Obama told the Central American leaders that most of the child migrants crossing the border illegally now won't be permitted to stay. Some have been deported already, while most are being allowed to stay temporarily while their immigration status is sorted out. Also being discussed within the Obama administration has been a pilot program that would let the United States assess asylum claims in those countries in order to reduce the number of illegal immigrants. But Obama sought to play down that option as an answer. ""There may be some narrow circumstances in which there is humanitarian or refugee status that a family might be eligible for. If that's the case it would be better for them to apply in country rather than take a very dangerous journey all the way up to Texas to make those same claims,"" Obama said. But he added that potential applicants would still have to meet the same criteria to qualify. ""Under U.S. law, we admit a certain number of refugees from all over the world based on some fairly narrow criteria and typically refugee status is not just based on economic need or because a family lives in a bad neighborhood or in poverty it's typically defined fairly narrowly,"" he said. The White House previously called the idea premature. But spokesman Josh Earnest said before Friday's meeting that it could be extended to other countries, if successful. Struggling for a solution . The administration and Congress have struggled in recent weeks to come to a consensus on how to address the surge that has overwhelmed border and immigration services. Obama has asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border efforts, while Republicans and some Democrats in Congress are resisting that proposal, and offering alternatives that would spend less and change immigration policy to deport kids faster. Either way, Obama and others are concerned that lawmakers will leave at the end of next week for their August recess without approving a fix. House Republicans are expected to vote on a scaled-down border bill next week. It would provide less than $1 billion to address the crisis and would modify a 2008 law to make it easier to deport children from Central America who enter the United States illegally. Currently, kids who enter the country illegally from Central America can stay until they receive an immigration hearing. That process can take months or years. The proposal to alter that law all but ensures the bill will not come to a vote in the Senate, where Democrats are opposed to tagging that change to a funding bill of its own for the border crisis. Democrats worry that accelerating the process will result in many falling through the cracks and being sent back to situations characterized by many as violent situations in their countries. Guard troops to border . The administration also is considering sending National Guard troops to the border, according to a White House official, just days after Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he would do just that in the Rio Grande Valley area. Immigrants or refugees? The Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services sent a team this week to assess Border Patrol efforts in the Rio Grande Valley. The number of unaccompanied minors seeping through that area has slowed dramatically since last month. Key questions about Rick Perry's border plan . CNN's Dana Bash, Jim Acosta, Halimah Abdullah, Kevin Liptak and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","NEW: Central American leaders meet with Obama on youth migrant surge .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- On Tuesday, asteroid 2005 YU55 is scheduled to pass near Earth, slightly closer than the moon. If you've seen the ""Asteroid"" (1997) or ""Deep Impact"" (1998) movies, you know why people pay attention to what NASA calls ""potentially hazardous objects"": A large asteroid hitting the Earth could cause global catastrophe. YU55 will not hit the Earth anytime soon, certainly not in the next 100 years, according to NASA's Near Earth Object Program. Still, collisions of space rocks with the Earth must have happened many times over its 4.5 billion year history because the surface of the moon, our near sibling, is pitted with crater impacts left undisturbed by earthly weather, volcanoes, erosion or vegetation. Follow space and science news on Light Years . David Rabinowitz, a planetary scientist at Yale, estimates that asteroids the size of YU55 come this close to the Earth about once every 100 years, and one this large hits the Earth only every few 100,000 years. 2005 YU55 (its name derives from the year and month in which it was found) is big compared to you and me but moderately sized for an asteroid, about 400 meters across (four football fields), and very small compared to the Earth or the moon. Let's try a size analogy: If the Earth were a medium-sized house, the moon would be a large car about half a mile away (nine football fields). The asteroid would be a tiny pencil point dot (like the thinnest lead you can buy for a mechanical pencil) that never gets closer to the Earth-house than about seven football fields away. This is much smaller than the asteroid reputed to have killed the dinosaurs and created the Chicxulub crater near the Yucatan. That asteroid was probably 25 times bigger across and more than 15,000 times bigger in volume. It was still small compared to the Earth or the moon -- about the size of your pinky fingernail in the house-car-pencil point analogy -- but big enough to wreak the global havoc of mass extinction. Fortunately, large asteroids like the dinosaur-killing one 65 million years ago are very rare, so the chance of an impact from such an asteroid is quite small. In the late 1990s, NASA started a census of large asteroids -- larger than about 1000 meters (10 football fields) across. That census is about 90% complete, with some 900 known large asteroids and fewer than 100 not yet accounted for. None of the known asteroids is currently on a collision path with the Earth. Smaller asteroids are much more numerous, so even though they don't individually cause as much damage, they are more likely to impact the Earth. The chance of serious harm to the Earth depends on these two competing factors: how many and how big. The danger, as in the Goldilocks story, comes from the middle, from asteroids small enough to be plentiful yet big enough to do damage. YU55 is that ""just right"" size. A similar asteroid hitting Earth could seriously damage a city or cause a tsunami. If a large asteroid were found to be heading toward Earth, scientists and engineers have ideas about how to deflect it, perhaps using gravity or explosives. The farther away the asteroid, the smaller the change needed in its trajectory, and thus the easier it would be to avoid a collision. Recent results from NASA's WISE infrared satellite suggest there are 20,000 space rocks with diameters between 100 meters and 1,000 meters. Tracking these down will not be easy. It's ""like trying to detect a candle at the distance from the moon,"" Lindley Johnson, WISE project scientist, said in a press conference last month. Nine years ago, NASA asked a team of scientists to make recommendations about how a census of smaller asteroids could be done. Their report, issued in 2003, estimated there are roughly 500,000 near-Earth objects with diameters of 50 to 100 meters (comparable to one football field), with an estimated impact frequency of one every thousand years. Scientists think the famous Tunguska event of 1908, an enormous explosion that flattened 80 million trees over 830 square miles (2/3 the size of Rhode Island) in Russia, was caused by an impact from an asteroid or meteorite about 50 to 100 meters in diameter. The force of this explosion was roughly 1,000 times larger than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The 2003 study recommended NASA search for potentially hazardous objects larger than about 140 meters across, or about 1/3 the size (1/9 the weight) of YU55. Looking for smaller objects would be prohibitively expensive and would not result in a large gain in overall safety. However, stopping at 1,000 meters -- for which the present census is reasonably complete -- was deemed insufficient to protect the planet. Searching for near-Earth asteroids can be done with telescopes on the ground and in space, observing at optical and infrared wavelengths (like WISE). In recent years, Congress has provided some funding for two sky-watching projects, Pan-STARRS (the first telescope has been deployed) and LSST (so far, in the design phase). Scientists know there is far more to asteroids than danger; they are the material out of which the inner rocky planets in our solar system (Earth, Mars, Mercury, Venus) formed. Understanding the composition of asteroids, as well as their size distribution and shapes, yields important information that theories of planet formation have to explain. YU55 is thought to be very black, as if it were made of carbon, like charcoal. Because it is passing relatively nearby, the next few days will provide a gold mine of data for scientists. For them, especially, the porridge is not too hot, not too cold, but just right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","A midsized asteroid will pass by Earth on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- Alexis Murphy was last seen at a gas station earlier this month, and though police have arrested a suspect in her abduction, his attorney tells a CNN affiliate his client split ways with the 17-year-old after a drug deal. Her disappearance set off a search that extended for 30 miles outside of Lovingston, Virginia, and involved helicopters, search parties with canine units, the Nelson County Sheriff's Office, Virginia State Police and FBI. Alexis left her Shipman, Virginia, home to visit Lynchburg on August 3, and police have surveillance video showing her at a Lovingston gas station, according to affiliate WVIR-TV in Charlottesville. Randy Taylor, 48, was seen on the video and was arrested in her abduction Sunday, police told CNN affiliate WRC-TV, but Taylor's attorney, Michael Hallahan, told WVIR that Taylor was arrested because they found one of Alexis' hairs in his camper. The attorney also told WVIR his client wasn't the last person to see Alexis and that police need to be looking for a ""black male, mid- to late-20s, cornrows and a 20-year-old burgundy Caprice with 22-inch wheels."" Taylor saw the girl the night she disappeared, the lawyer said. They were both parked at the gas pumps, and Alexis made a reference to smoking marijuana, Hallahan said. Taylor told her he'd like some marijuana, the attorney said. ""She said, 'I know a guy.' She told him to meet at another location in Lovingston and they rode up there in both cars,"" the lawyer told the station. That ""guy,"" Alexis and Taylor all took separate cars to Taylor's camper in Lovingston, where Taylor bought $60 worth of marijuana. The men smoked and drank together, but Murphy did not, the attorney said. Alexis and the unidentified man left before sundown, and that was the last Taylor saw of either of them, Hallahan told WVIR. Hallahan further told the station there is DNA evidence of the unidentified man -- in the form of a 12-ounce Icehouse bottle -- in the camper. Alexis was last seen wearing a pink blouse, floral spandex pants and brown boots, according to WRC. She was carrying a gray purse. Her 2003 Nissan Maxima was found August 6 in the parking lot of a movie theater near Charlottesville. The teen's aunt described her as a ""girly girl"" and told WVIR that the volleyball player had just taken her senior pictures and was looking at colleges. ""She was just looking forward to everything, excited for everything, and for this to happen is just completely out of character for her,"" Taylor told the station.","Alexis Murphy, 17, disappeared August 3, according to CNN affiliates .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made headlines last week when one of his aides admitted that he had surgery to lose weight. Christie said that the surgery had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with his health and his family. Christie said: ""It's not a career issue for me. It is a long-term health issue for me and that's the basis on which I made this decision. It's not about anything other than that."" It is impossible to know whether we should take Christie at face value. Given that there has been ongoing speculation about his presidential aspirations for 2016, often coupled with discussions of his struggle with weight, it is certainly not unreasonable to wonder whether these are related. Why do Americans care about the weight of a candidate and why is appearance an issue in presidential elections? There is very little chance that the issue will go away. Certainly, old-fashioned bias has something to do with this concern. The willingness to ridicule obesity and make fun of appearances based on weight remains more acceptable than other kinds of biased comments that are no longer tolerated. One study by Yale University recently showed that male jurors were biased against heavy women, and more likely to find them guilty than leaner women. Some have called obesity the last acceptable bias in American life. Opinion: Congrats Gov. Christie - You saved your life . We are also in a political era when politicians are more in the public eye than ever before. Like it or not, appearance matters. When William Howard Taft -- weighing in at over 300 pounds -- was president, most Americans rarely saw him, though jokes about his weight still circulated. But it was still a very different world. In the early 20th century, there was no television or Internet broadcasting constant footage of the president in action. Other than the occasional still image in the newspaper, or the footage in the newsreels before movies until the 1940s, politics was still a medium of words and print. Since the emergence of television, however, we live in a visual political culture where appearances have become much more important. We vote based on what we see, or at least that is part of the calculation. It has become more important for presidents to convey the charisma of a John F. Kennedy and harder for those who are not as easy on the eye. Shallow visual preferences are not the only dynamic at work, however. The last half century has witnessed massive improvements in personal health. Americans are living longer and living better as a result of great advances in our understanding of nutrition and physical care. It is no longer uncommon for Americans to use a gym on a regular basis and to be much more cautious about what they eat. We expect politicians to live by the same standards. Indeed, we want our leaders to set examples for the rest of the nation. Christie is certainly not the only candidate to face these kinds of questions. When Bill Clinton ran for the presidency in 1992, the media covered his tendency to eat junk food on the campaign trail and his weight gains were treated as problematic. After Clinton gained 30 pounds during the Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton noted, ""The good news is, my husband loves to eat and enjoys it. The bad news is, he loves to eat, even when things are not always right for him."" Another reason that weight and other physical health concerns have become more important is that the job of the presidency has become much more demanding. As the role of the federal government has expanded at home and the presence of the United States overseas has intensified, there is much more for a president to handle on a daily basis. The massive size of the executive branch and intense 24-hour news cycle makes the presidency a physically brutal job. We often watch as presidents enter the White House looking young and spry, then exit with gray hair, tired and visibly worn down. As with many other high-powered jobs, physical health is important to the ability of a person to handle these kinds of tasks, so it is logical that these considerations enter into the conversation. All of this is to say that there are many reasons why voters and reporters will talk about Christie's weight, and why Christie's weight could become a major issue if he runs for president in 2016. It's important to note that there is some social science evidence that in certain cases voters may not be swayed by weight. In fact, according to one study, voters in certain cases can prefer obese to non-obese candidates. The studies showing this finding are still limited and, from the evidence of the presidential races of the past century, the signs still point to voters preferring candidates who are leaner. There is clearly a huge risk in making our decisions about leaders based on appearances, which really do tell us little about what a person would do when faced with the big challenges of the day. Regardless, the conversation is unlikely to subside, given the times in which we live. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Chris Christie, a potential presidential candidate, had weight-loss surgery .

"(CNN) -- Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride. Athletes' victories on the global stage made us proud of the new China. The new ""open"" China was full of hopes, dreams and opportunities. A strong, united nation working together to build a better tomorrow was the higher calling for all of us. To serve this calling, many kids who were identified as potential elite athletes were enrolled into the government supported ""sports schools."" If they trained hard and were talented enough, they would make it to represent their city, their province and then one day their country. When there is a demand, there was also a reward. Chinese Olympic champions were well rewarded through national and local government, both in terms of compensation and social status. Lang Ping, the star of the 1984 women's volleyball team that won a gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, was the Michael Jordan of China. As the son of a sports reporter, I was fortunate enough to know her when I was a kid. The fact that I knew her made me very popular at school, pretty much like telling everybody at school today that Kobe Bryant is your friend. In 2008, China won 51 gold medals (100 medals overall) and topped the gold medal tally at the Beijing Olympic Games. After this astounding success, many started to ask what's next? Economic growth means that people have more options in terms of career. It is more and more difficult to find kids (and parents) who want to join the ""sports school"" system and aim for that one-in-a-million shot to become an Olympic gold medalist. Academic performance offers a more certain path to success. Better grades means better universities, better universities means better jobs. At least that has been (and will probably still be for a long time) the belief of many parents and teachers. There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China. A growing urban population and middle class are seeking a better quality of life and personal well-being. In 2013, more than 750,000 people participated in a running competition or marathon, up 50 percent on 2012, according to the China Track and Field Association . In 2014, there will be 53 marathons registered at the China Track and Field Association and this number is projected to grow at least at 20 percent annually. Compared to the 200 marathons held each year in Japan, China still has a long way to go but there is a new enthusiasm for sport at the grassroots level. However, we also see that more kids (and parents) are embracing sport and the values it teaches. We operate a sports academy in Shanghai that teaches fencing, squash and Thai boxing. Through a season of sports training and competition, we help kids to build confidence, work in teams and develop leadership skills. These are the qualities that will help them to secure that better future over and beyond their academic performance. The Chinese government and many Chinese educators are starting to see the value of sports in education. They could do more by making sports an important part of school grades. Six years after the Beijing Olympic Games, there is another Olympic Games currently taking place in China this month -- the 2nd Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing. This Games is different. At the opening ceremony, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach urged participants to take selfies to show off their good fortune and stressed the importance of sharing, learning and making friends. Most people don't know who won the first gold medal or how many gold medals China has won. In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride. Sport in China: What's wrong with winning?","The meaning of competitive sports is changing in China .

"(CNN) -- A body found in a Jerusalem-area forest is that of missing American Aaron Sofer, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Thursday. Forensics investigators were working to determine the cause of death, Rosenfeld said. Sofer, 23, was reported missing Friday by a friend who was hiking with him. The young man was a Yeshiva student, studying in Israel. Meir Lichtenstein, a Lakewood, New Jersey, committeeman who is a friend of Sofer's family, told reporters that though the investigation was continuing, the family believes that death was accidental and no foul play was suspected. ""There is some closure to the fact that this may very well have been an accidental death as opposed to their son being abducted,"" he said. Lichtenstein said Sofer was ""not the most experienced hiker"" and may have suffered an ""accident related to his walking in a rough terrain."" ""I say that with caution because the investigation is still ongoing,"" he said. Family joined search . On Monday, Sofer's father, Moshe Zvi Sofer, joined police and hundreds of volunteers searching the forest outside Jerusalem where his son disappeared. Moshe Zvi Sofer traveled to Israel with his wife from their home in Lakewood and the couple offered a 100,000 shekel (about $28,000) reward for whoever found their son, Sofer's father said in a video posted online. Sofer's friend lost contact with him as they walked together. The friend reported the disappearance to authorities, Rosenfeld said earlier this week. ""It is not clear if the disappearance was personal (or a) kidnapping,"" Rosenfeld said. ""It's not clear at all."" Lichtenstein said Sofer's family ""very strongly supports Aaron's friend and believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with this and that it was an accident."" Sofer will be buried in Israel, Lichtenstein said, and shiva will be observed in New Jersey. Sofer's disappearance came two months after what Israeli authorities have called the revenge killing of Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16. His body was found in the Jerusalem Forest on July 2, just miles from where Sofer went missing. Two minors and an adult were indicted in the killing. Prosecutors allege the killing was retaliation for the deaths of three Israeli teens whose bodies were found in the West Bank in June. One of those Israeli teens also had American citizenship. Leigh Remizowski, Michael Schwartz, Haimy Assefa and Marina Carver contributed to this report.","New Jersey official says death of Aaron Sofer, 23, may have been accidental .

"(CNN) -- Flu vaccine myths can confuse people trying to decide whether to get a shot. Here are five common myths and, based on information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the truth. 1. The shot can give you flu . Not so, says the CDC. The viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine, which means they cannot cause infection. The vaccine batches are then tested, with a group of people randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or salt water. ""The only differences in symptoms was increased soreness in the arm and redness at the injection site among people who got the flu shot,"" the CDC found. ""There were no differences in terms of body aches, fever, cough, runny nose or sore throat."" Still, some people feel bad after a flu shot. Soreness at the injection site is one reason, but it usually dissipates within two days. It's caused by the immune system making antibodies to the killed viruses in the vaccine that help a person fight off the flu. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says symptoms, in rare instances, include fever, muscle pain, and discomfort or weakness, which also typically go away after a day or two. And, though a flu shot won't give you the flu, its protection doesn't kick in for two weeks from the time of injection. During that time, you are vulnerable. In addition, it's easy to confuse seasonal flu for an illness caused by a number of other pathogens, including rhinovirus. Or you may be exposed to a flu virus that is not included in the vaccine. Finally, the flu shot does not always work -- particularly among the elderly and people with weak immune systems. But even among these high-risk groups, the vaccine can prevent complications. 2. It is better to get the vaccine later in the season to limit the risk that its efficacy will wane . No. The shot lasts an entire flu season, except for some children who may need two doses. The CDC recommends that all people older than 6 months get a flu vaccine. 3. The flu shot might adversely affect my pregnancy . No. The flu vaccine is ""an essential element of prenatal care"" and is recommended for all pregnant women, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia, infections and dehydration. Though babies cannot be vaccinated until they have reached 6 months of age, antibodies they received in utero from their mothers may help protect them. But note that the group recommends against the nasal spray -- the live, attenuated version -- for pregnant women. The CDC says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. 4. I've had the flu before and it was no big deal, so bring it on . No. Seasonal flu exacts a bigger toll in some years than in others: Between 1976 and 2007, the flu was linked to a low of 3,000 to as many as 49,000 fatalities in the United States, with more than 200,000 hospitalizations. There are two main reasons: The viruses that circulate in one year may differ from those that circulate in another. And, of course, people change from year to year, meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another. 5. The flu shot doesn't work . It doesn't work all the time, but it does confer some level of protection. For example, the CDC says preliminary data for the 2010-2011 season show that it was about 60% effective for all age groups combined, and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to 90%.","The flu vaccine cannot give you the flu, according to the CDC .
The shot lasts for an entire season, except for some kids who may need two .

"(Health.com) -- OK, so you baked yourself silly in high school. Who didn't? What counts -- at least in terms of looking younger -- isn't so much what you used to do, but what you're doing right now.

In the last 10 years, skin-care breakthroughs have made it possible to pull that off, repairing skin's most vulnerable areas with targeted products and treatments. So what gets results you can actually see at the best possible price? That's the question we put to leading dermatologists. The good news: Many of the remedies they raved about are affordable and don't require a trip to the dermatologist. Get ready for smoother, softer, younger-looking skin -- starting right now. Health.com: 7 ways you're aging your skin . Rejuvenate your face . It's not your imagination: Your skin may still be willing, but it's no longer able to bounce back quite the way it did even five years ago. With every birthday, your body's production of collagen and elastin -- two proteins responsible for skin's structural support and elasticity -- slows down. As a result, your skin begins to stretch, especially if you've spent a lot of time in the sun. Bottom line. If you do nothing else to age-proof your skin, apply sunscreen each morning and a retinoid at night. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher every day -- no matter the weather or season -- isn't just about preventing sun damage. A study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology found that sunscreens also protect against free radicals -- the molecules that cause aging -- and the majority of the protection is thanks to the UV filters rather than antioxidants. As for retinoids, research shows that they're the ultimate multitaskers, preventing the buildup of dead skin cells, diminishing wrinkles, and lightening sun spots. Not everyone can tolerate the vitamin-A derivative, so start with an over-the-counter retinol product. If you don't notice an improvement after six weeks, see your dermatologist for a prescription retinoid (like Renova) and apply it every other day until your skin adjusts, then every day, suggests Sadick. Health.com: Get flawless skin naturally . Baby your eye area . The area around those two windows to your soul is the first place most of us notice signs of aging. Blame the loss of collagen coupled with decades of smiling and squinting, plus the inherent trickiness of shielding your eyes from the sun. (Age-accelerating UVA rays can sneak through your sunglasses.) Any moisturizer (especially if it has hyaluronic acid, which draws moisture from the air) will plump up the area temporarily, but one that also has antioxidants like vitamins A, C, and E can help reverse the signs of sun damage and prevent further damage. What exactly do these alphabet answers to aging do? Vitamin A is the age-reversing ingredient in retinoids; vitamins C and E help protect against free-radical damage. Bottom line. The best eye creams aren't necessarily the most expensive ones. Pick a product that has antioxidants high on the ingredient list. And give it a chance to work before moving on to another. ""You should stick with any anti-aging product for at least a month,"" says Diane Berson, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. ""It takes time to see the benefits."" If OTC eye creams don't give you the results you want, injectables like the muscle relaxers Botox and Dysport, or fillers such as Restylane and JuvÃ©derm, will help. These last anywhere from 3 to 18 months, and start at about $400 per treatment. Not cheap, but effective. Health.com: Makeup tips to make your eyes pop . Smooth out smile lines . You don't have to have ever lit up a cigarette to develop feathery vertical lines along your upper lip line, or be a Debbie Downer to get frown (aka ""marionette"") lines. Both are caused by a lifetime of facial expressions such as pursing your lips, smiling, and, yes, frowning. The fix usually involves some version of a plumper or filler. Bottom line. A plumper (such as Sally Hansen Vita C Lip Plumper, $5; mass retailers) helps temporarily fill out superficial, upper-lip lines, says Jaliman. But deeper lip lines usually call for in-office laser treatments (like Fraxel) at about $750 per session. As for erasing frown lines? ""That 'line' is a deep fold caused by muscle contractions, not a crease, so a cream isn't going to get rid of it,"" says Berson. If it really bothers you, she says you're better off saving your money for an in-office skin-tightening procedure. Thermage, usually a one-time treatment, starts at about $1,000; injectable fillers such as Perlane, Juvederm, or Radiesse cost about $600 per injection. (Each treatment lasts six months to one year).

But these three areas tend to suffer from neglect -- as in, skipping the sunscreen or devoting all your skin-care dollars to your complexion.

"(CNN) -- Acclaimed actor-director Richard Attenborough has died at 90, the actor's agent said. Attenborough is perhaps best known for his work on the 1982 film ""Gandhi,"" which won eight Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. The film took Attenborough some 20 years to make. ""I was bankrupt several times. I had to mortgage my house. My family suffered to a certain extent,"" he said. ""I placed things at risk because I cared about it so much."" He died Sunday, according to his agent, Dallas Smith. The family is expected to make a statement Monday, Smith told CNN. ""Our thoughts are with them and his friends at this very sad moment as we mourn the passing of a truly great man of the cinema and the arts,"" Smith said. Attenborough began his career as a classically trained English actor and went on to star in such films as ""The Great Escape,"" ""Jurassic Park"" and a remake of ""Miracle on 34th Street."" He was knighted in 1976. British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted Sunday: ""His acting in 'Brighton Rock' was brilliant, his directing of 'Gandhi' was stunning -- Richard Attenborough was one of the greats of cinema."" The cause of his death was not immediately clear. Attenborough's marriage to actress Sheila Sim spanned seven decades and produced three children. ""My philosophy has always been that I believe that art is not an elitist gift for a few select people. Art is for everyone,"" he once said. Attenborough also appeared as Santa Claus in the 1994 remake of ""Miracle on 34th Street."" After playing several characters in movies, he moved to the other side of the camera. ""It's what I love. I'm not a great movie director. I'm not an auteur,"" he said of directing. ""I'm a storyteller. I'm a craftsman. And I love beyond anything else working with the actors and finding a way to make the actor believe that what they're about to do is the best performance they've ever given.""

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Violence killed hundreds of Iraqi civilians in August, authorities said Wednesday, a day after President Barack Obama marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in the country. The month's toll included 295 civilians killed and 508 wounded, the Ministry of Interior said. Fifty-four Iraqi soldiers were killed and 150 more wounded in the same month. In July, the number of people killed in the nation's violence was the highest since May 2008. Nearly 400 civilians were killed in that month. The month of September started off with at least three attacks, authorities said. In one, a police officer who works for the Interior Ministry was killed when a bomb attached to his civilian car exploded Wednesday morning in northwestern Baghdad. In a separate attack in Tikrit on the same day, three police officers were wounded when a roadside bomb struck a police patrol. And one more officer was wounded when a roadside bomb exploded outside his house in Falluja, authorities said. The officer was heading to work when the bomb went off. The attacks came a day after Obama officially ended the U.S. combat role in the nation, saying ""It is time to turn the page."" While the U.S. will support Iraqi officials, it will refocus its energies on its economy and the war in Afghanistan, the president said Tuesday evening. ""The United States has paid a huge price to put the future of Iraq in the hands of its people,"" Obama said in an address from the Oval Office. ""Through this remarkable chapter in the history of the United States and Iraq, we have met our responsibility. Now, it is time to turn the page."" The U.S. combat mission in Iraq ends more than seven years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Roughly 50,000 U.S. troops will remain in Iraq until the end of 2011 to train, assist and advise Iraqi troops. If Iraq requests an extension and the U.S. agrees, some troops could remain beyond that. Obama praised American troops for their sacrifices in Iraq and said the country is in position to shape its own future. ""We have persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people -- a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization,"" he said. Though attacks continue across Iraq and leaders are struggling to form a coalition government, Obama said violence is at its near lowest level since the war began. Overall, violence in Iraq has dropped drastically over the past two years compared with the height of the sectarian war in 2006 and 2007. Before the speech, some Republicans urged Obama to acknowledge that the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq ordered by then-President George W. Bush had worked. Obama, then a U.S. senator and candidate for president, had opposed it.","A series of bombings Wednesday target police officers .

"(CNN) -- Get ready to bow to The Capitol. ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part 1"" is set to hit theaters in November, and on Wednesday, the immense fandom got a taste of what's to come. Lionsgate has released ""propaganda"" posters from the forthcoming film, which salute the hero citizens of Panem. Each poster contains a representative from each of the districts dressed to represent their region, along with slogans such as ""Panem Today, Panem Tomorrow, Panem Forever."" The studio also released a video of ""President Snow's Panem Address,"" which sees Donald Sutherland as the villainous President Snow delivering a not-so-veiled threat to his nation. Even the YouTube description for the teaser indicates the kind of place Panem is. ""CITIZENS,"" the description begins, ""The Capitol requires your viewing of President Snow's official Panem Address, 'Together As One,' brought to you by Capitol TV in stunning 4K. ""Your districts are the body,"" Sutherland's Snow says. ""The capital is the beating heart. Your hard work feeds us, and in return, we feed and protect you.""

"Karachi, Pakistan (CNN) -- The sister of a Pakistani prisoner described as the ""poster girl"" for Islamic jihad has urged ISIS hostage-takers to let their captives go. Speaking exclusively to CNN from her home in Karachi, Pakistan, the sister of Dr. Aaifa Siddiqui said the jailed neuroscientist's family wanted ""no violence in Aafia's name."" ""I'm Aafia's sister. We're Aafia's family. And we speak on her behalf as well. We want no violence in Aafia's name. Our whole struggle has been one that is dignified that is peaceful that is legal,"" Fowzia Siddiqui said. A jury in New York convicted Aafia Siddiqui on seven charges, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers, in 2010. No one was wounded in the incident. She is serving her 86-year sentence at a facility in Texas. At the time of the 2008 shooting, Siddiqui was in police custody after being arrested outside the Ghazni governor's compound in Afghanistan. She was said to be acting suspiciously and found to be carrying ""numerous documents describing the creation of explosives, chemical weapons, and other weapons involving biological material and radiological agents,"" according to court documents. The papers included descriptions of various U.S. landmarks and military assets, excerpts from the ""Anarchist's Arsenal,"" and a number of chemical substances in bottles and glass jars, the documents said. Terror links? Siddiqui has never been charged with a terror-related offence, though U.S. authorities made the link long before her capture. In 2004, she was placed on an FBI alert list as a sought-after al Qaeda member. Her family has insisted she has no ties to terror. ""There is no connection with al Qaeda, the Taliban or any terrorist organization. She wasn't even charged with terrorism,"" Fowzia said. However, Saddiqui's name has recently appeared on documents purportedly from Islamic militants in Syria. A letter sent to the family of U.S. journalist James Foley, before video of his beheading surfaced this month, said the U.S. government had been given ""many chances"" to negotiate for his release. It singled out Siddiqui by name. ""We have also offered prisoner exchanges to free the Muslims currently in your detention like our sister Dr Afia Sidiqqi (sic), however you proved very quickly to us that this is NOT what you are interested in,"" the email said, which was published in full on the GlobalPost website. 'She is an icon' Fowzia Siddiqui said her sister's name had been appropriated by terrorists to suit their own agenda. ""Any kind of kidnappers, ISIS these days, the Aafia brigade, or whoever wants to claim Aafia,"" she said. She said labels like ""Lady al Qaeda"" and the ""Grey Lady of Bagram,"" used by the media in reference to her sister made her cringe. ""When I hear these things, like Lady al Qaeda --I don't even want to repeat that word -- and you know, it hurts. It really hurts."" Deborah Scroggins, the author of ""Wanted Women,"" said Siddiqui had become a cause de celebre for followers of jihad. ""She is an icon, she is the poster girl for jihad, a rallying point ... she's not just any woman, she is the premier symbol of the Muslim woman in distress,"" she said. Conflicting accounts . Fowzia, an accomplished clinical neurologist who trained at Harvard Medical School, said her family had suffered tremendously since Aafia vanished with her three young children in March 2003. She had just finished her thesis in cognitive neuroscience, and had left the family home to go to Islamabad, but never arrived. The youngest child was just six months old. ""It's as if she had fallen off the surface of the Earth ... I can't tell you how painful it was not knowing. You know if someone dies then you have a closure. Here, there was no closure,"" Fowzia said. Five years of rumor and false leads ended in 2008 when news emerged that Aafia was in U.S. custody, accused of crimes for which she was later imprisoned. Prosecutors said Siddiqui shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. The warrant officer returned fire, shooting her in the torso, according to court documents. Her family said the official version of events was wrong. ""She was in custody. How could she in custody snatch a rifle, or even pick up a rifle from six armed U.S. marshals, one woman?"" she asked. ""I mean, these are U.S. Marshalls, FBI agents trained in weaponry, how could she? It just doesn't make sense."" Calls for release . Fowzia said her sister was the victim of the ""war on terror,"" that she said had created an atmosphere of fear and prejudice against Muslims. ""It's like they are labeled guilty and not even given a proper chance to prove their innocence, and a similar kind of thing happened with my sister,"" she said. She said a lot of a misinformation had created a false impression of a woman who had wanted to use her degree to improve education in Pakistan. The family claims Aafia was never married to the nephew of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Muhammad, as had been widely reported. A online petition to the White House seeking Aafia's release has received more than 100,000 signatures over several weeks, and her family is currently seeking her release on appeal. ""Aafia should be released, but not for ransom, not in exchange, not for other people that are kidnapped by extremists, no. She should be released because that is the right thing to do,"" Fowzia said.","Aafia Siddiqui is serving 86-year sentence in a Texas jail for attempted murder .

"(CNN) -- The gun outrages continue, the latest the shooting of a gun instructor in Arizona by a 9-year-old girl who was taken to the range by her parents so she could shoot an Uzi, an Israeli-made submachine gun. The question that the whole world asks is this: Why was a 9-year-old girl allowed even to try to shoot a submachine gun? I have a further question: Why does anybody not on the front lines of the military in a war zone need to have access to a submachine gun? It's not as though we haven't had plenty of evidence that this gun thing in America isn't working. Since the ghastly massacre of elementary school children at Sandy Hook on December 14, 2012, by a deranged teenager, as of June there were at least 74 school shootings, on school grounds or in schools themselves. It's commonplace in this country now: A deranged shooter appears, armed to the teeth, out of his mind. Everyone ducks or runs for cover. The shooter proceeds calmly through the building, taking out innocents. What kind of country have we become? Was this what the Founding Fathers had in mind? The NRA will scream: The Second Amendment! The Second Amendment! Please be aware that most of what you think you know about the history of this amendment is nonsense. Many good books and articles exist on the subject, all neatly summarized by Saul Cornell a couple of years ago. He wrote: ""If the nation truly embraced the Second Amendment as it was originally written, it would be the NRA's worst nightmare."" Look at this amendment again: ""A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" James Madison and the others who framed this single sentence understood perfectly well that you can't have unregulated mobs running around in the streets with guns. That's why ""A well-regulated militia"" goes first in this single sentence. Regulation is the key concept here, which is why the framers foregrounded this clause. So who were these militias in need of regulation? In the South, they were called ""slave patrols,"" and they were paramilitary groups that regularly patrolled slave plantations to make sure restive slaves weren't going to rise up against their white overlords.Remember the line in the movie ""Django Unchained""? Leonardo DiCaprio wonders: ""Why don't they just rise up and kill the whites?"" It was a real question, and the answer was that ""well-regulated militias"" in the Southern states kept the slaves in check. Patrick Henry, George Mason and James Madison knew, as they considered the Second Amendment, that it would be essential if they hoped to get the Southern states to ratify the brand-new U.S. Constitution. It was designed to keep these states on board. There were hundreds of slave uprisings in the South before the Constitution was ratified. For a full history of this, get your hands on Sally E. Haden's book, ""Slave Patrols: Law and Violence in Virginia and the Carolinas."" As Haden demonstrates, most men in the slave states between age 18 and 45 would have had to serve on one of these well-regulated militias at some point. The Southern states were police states designed to keep slaves in check. Their economy had been built around slavery. It is clear in the recorded speeches of Patrick Henry and George Mason, two of the Founding Fathers, that the Second Amendment was specifically handed as a bone to the Southern states, manufactured to keep them happy. James Madison, a slave-holder himself, had no doubt about the need to keep these slave militias going in the South. He wrote about this often and without ambiguity. Thom Hartmann discussed these ideas in a recent article. The National Rifle Association has tried to blur the historical truth about the Second Amendment. In fact, at its headquarters in Washington, the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance. Oops! They have emblazoned exactly half of this brief amendment, leaving off the embarrassing front part, about a ""Well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."" (Notice also, the amendment says State, not Nation -- and these framers knew the difference, as it's a major difference noted elsewhere in the Bill of Rights.) The idea that owning a gun in America was an individual right only dates to the 1980s. A bunch of right-wing think tanks got to work creating this individual right. In 1991, Chief Justice Warren Burger called this new wrinkle in the Second Amendment ""one of the greatest pieces of fraud -- I repeat the word 'fraud' -- on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime."" Burger was right. It's a fraud. There just is no right for the individual to bear arms in the Bill of Rights. You have to belong to a well-regulated militia, such as the National Guard, if you want to bear arms. Of course, the Supreme Court did an end run in recent years around what the framers of the Bill of Rights actually intended. (So much for our famous ""originalists,"" such as Justice Antonin Scalia, who really does whatever he wants and comes up with a bogus argument to say he's going back to what the framers actually meant.)  The 2008 case known as Heller is a botched piece of argumentation, as even conservative judge Richard A. Posner has written, tearing Scalia's opinion to shreds as an incoherent piece of tripe. Let's say, however, that hunters should have the right to possess and use hunting rifles. Why not, if they keep them unloaded except for when hunting? It should be just fine to belong to a gun club and shoot skeet or whatever. But nobody needs an assault weapon who is not fighting in the Middle East, or perhaps going after drug lords in Mexico. Why, then, do Americans love their guns? I will make a bold suggestion. In a country where Americans sense, quite genuinely, that their freedoms have been taken away by the government -- as in the U.S. Patriot Act, as in NSA surveillance -- people feel powerless. It makes you feel more powerful if you can enhance your personal strength with a gun. There is the romance of the Old West, too, which reinforces this idea. It's ""High Noon"" all the time in America. But this is dangerous and false thinking, and it leads to chaos. Chaos is what we now face on the streets in this country every single day. It's time for us to revisit the Second Amendment and get every assault weapon off the streets, for good.","Jay Parini: Only someone on war's front lines should have access to a submachine gun .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama entered office with two overriding legislative goals: health care reform and climate change mitigation. He obtained the first goal but not the second. Now he has to decide whether the laws that Congress passes pose any constraint on his actions, or whether those laws are simply vessels whose precise contents can be filled as the President sees fit. On Tuesday, two federal courts rendered contrasting decisions regarding the legality of subsidies paid to those who have obtained insurance through the federal exchange established under the Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare legislation that a deeply divided Congress passed in 2009. The act contains a provision authorizing federal subsidies to low-income individuals who purchase insurance through a ""state"" health exchange. The question that the two courts had to answer was whether the specific statutory reference to state exchanges precludes subsidies to those who obtained insurance coverage through the federal exchange. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 that such subsidies were not permitted; the 4th Circuit, the federal appeals court based in nearby Virginia, held that the subsidies were allowed. The conflicting decisions reflect conflicting views of what counts as the law. According to the D.C. Circuit's majority, the law is contained in the plain language of a statute. But according to the Virginia-based court, the law consists of what Congress intended to do when it enacted the Affordable Care Act. For its part, the Obama administration emphasizes what Congress intended instead of what Congress actually wrote and passed. When White House press secretary Josh Earnest was asked if ""the letter of the law matters to the White House on this,"" he responded that ""what the courts are charged with doing is evaluating the intent of Congress."" That approach would save the subsidies that underpin the Affordable Care Act, but it would doom the administration's approach to climate change. When Obama took office, he asked Congress to enact sweeping federal legislation to combat climate change. The President insisted that such new legislation was necessary to respond to climate change -- indeed, some of his more zealous supporters argued that federal climate change legislation was necessary to save the world from destruction. But once Congress rebuffed his plea for such a law, Obama decided that maybe it wasn't necessary after all. Instead, he turned to the Clean Air Act, which Congress enacted in 1970 to reduce the clouds of air pollution that plagued so many American cities at the time. The intent of the Congress that passed the Clean Air Act was to empower the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate emissions of substances that make people sick when they breathe them. That Congress did not even think about climate change, and the pollutants that Congress did contemplate are fundamentally different from greenhouse gases that occur naturally in the atmosphere, are not toxic when breathed even at the elevated levels that now exist in the atmosphere, and that cause harm indirectly by facilitating the greenhouse effect that has begun to change the world's climates. If we were to follow Earnest's advice and evaluate the intent of Congress, then the Clean Air Act would not apply to climate change. But the Supreme Court read the Clean Air Act in the same way that the D.C. federal appeals court read the Affordable Care Act. In the landmark 2007 decision of Massachusetts v. EPA, the high court held the clear text of the Clean Air Act encompassed all sorts of air pollutants, not just those that were in the mind of Congress when it enacted the law. That broad understanding of the Clean Air Act forms the legal foundation for the EPA's ongoing regulation of greenhouse gas emitters and of Obama's Climate Action Plan. Now Obama, a former adjunct law professor, faces a choice. If he defends efforts to interpret the Affordable Care Act based on what Congress apparently intended rather than on the law's actual provisions, then he undercuts the legal theory for his response to climate change. But if he defers to what the law actually says, then he loses the subsidies that are integral to the success of the Affordable Care Act. Of course, the President could simply advance whatever legal theory suits his policy aims. We expect more from judges. And few judges have articulated the judicial task better than Oliver Wendell Holmes, who remarked, ""We do not inquire what the legislature meant; we ask only what the statute means."" Even if Josh Earnest would prefer otherwise. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","President Barack Obama's team argues against a literal reading of the health care law .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Every day that Abu Yaqoub opens his Baghdad liquor store, he believes it may be his last. It's a fear that began months ago for 45-year-old Yaqoub, when insurgents began bombing primarily minority-owned liquor stores in the Iraqi capital after officials rescinded a law banning the sale of alcohol. But in recent weeks as the attacks have mounted in both scope and ferocity, so, too, has Yaqoub's fear. It's not clear who is attacking the stores, though the reasons invoked by stores owners, authorities and lawmakers are as varied as the problems facing Iraq: from political to social, from religious to secular. ""It's the most dangerous job to have a liquor store in Baghdad because there are many groups against this kind of business, either within the government or outside it,"" said Yaqoub, a Yazidi minority that has been a target of insurgents in recent years. Ashur Essa knows Yaqoub's fear. He, too, owns a liquor store in central Baghdad that sits a short distance from a police checkpoint. ""It's painful to see this happening to our country, "" said 46-year-old Essa, a Christian. ""All Iraqis used to live together, and it didn't matter who was Sunni or who was Shiite, who was Muslim or who was Christian."" Essa believes the attacks are not really about liquor stores so much as it is about a struggle to balance a fledgling democracy with a conservative religious tradition. ""It's about the new democracy that Americans promised us,"" he said. Under Islamic tradition, Muslims do not drink alcohol. But in many parts of Baghdad, it is not uncommon to see people drinking alcohol at outdoor cafes and restaurants. Within months of the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, liquor stores in Baghdad and elsewhere were bombed and shot up. Store owners blamed the attacks on al Qaeda or Shiite militias, such as radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army. Despite the attacks, the number of liquor stores and nightclubs in Baghdad flourished. But elsewhere, outright bans or laws aimed at curbing the availability of alcohol were put in place or enforced in primarily conservative Shiite communities. Last year, with a Shiite-majority government, local officials in Baghdad reintroduced a Saddam Hussein-era law that banned Muslims from selling alcohol and required anyone selling alcohol to have a liquor license -- essentially banning the sale of alcohol. At the time, officials said the crackdown was aimed at regulating alcohol sales, much like other countries. But in January the head of the Baghdad Provincial Council, Kamil al-Zaidi told The New York Times, ""We are a Muslim country, and everyone must respect that."" During the same period, al-Sadr -- an ally of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government -- railed against liquor stores and nightclubs, going so far as to issue a fatwa, a religious opinion, asking his followers to support the ban and stand against those who want to be ""immoral like the West."" But when tens of thousands of demonstrators, inspired by popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia, took to the streets across Iraq to protest corruption and lack of personal freedoms, Baghdad officials rolled back the law. Within weeks, attacks began against liquor stores. Since March, at least 25 stores in Baghdad have been bombed, an interior ministry official told CNN. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Most of the liquor stores targeted were owned by Christians or Yazidis, the official said. Religious minorities, such as Christians and Yazidis, make up less than five percent of Iraq's population, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Since 2003, attacks against these minorities by insurgents and religious extremists have driven more than half of these minorities out of the country, according to UNHCR statistics. Yazidis, among Iraq's smallest minorities, are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrism. On a recent day, a liquor store owner swept up debris left after a roadside bomb planted outside his store exploded. The owner, who would only identify himself as Khalil, said he was hopeful when Iraq's Ministry of Tourism granted him a license that allowed him to reopen his store after the law was rescinded. But two weeks later, his store was bombed during the daily overnight curfew in Baghdad. It's a time, Khalil says, when only Iraqi security forces are supposed to be on the streets. ""If the Iraqi army and police cannot stop such simple attacks, then what is the point of a curfew?"" said Khalil, a Yazidi. Khalil, 28, said he was considering closing his store and leaving Baghdad for the Kurdish north, an area he considered safer than the Iraqi capital. ""I'm telling you, there is no safe place in Baghdad,"" he said, ""and I'm thinking I will have to leave."" He stopped sweeping and stared silently at the cars driving past his damaged store. Then he shuffled back inside to continue cleaning. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq reported from Baghdad; Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta .","Iraqi officials says 25 liquor stores have been bombed .

"(CNN) -- The Ohio State University Marching Band, known for entertaining fans at sporting events with hypnotic formations choreographed to music, was also known among university insiders for a culture that facilitated sexual harassment, according to an investigative report. Marching band director Jonathan Waters was fired Thursday after the report's release, Ohio State University President Michael Drake said. Waters' lawyer said his client was a ""convenient scapegoat"" who tried to change a sexual climate that predated his tenure as director. Waters had known for years about the ""sexualized"" environment surrounding the band, in which members had to swear an oath of secrecy to protect its ""objectionable traditions and customs,"" according to an investigation report released by the Office of University Compliance and Integrity. He failed to eliminate and prevent the recurrence of this climate, the report said. A parent of a marching band member alerted the office to the problem, the report said. ""Nothing is more important than the safety of our students,"" Drake said. ""We expect every member of our community to live up to a common standard of decency and mutual respect and to adhere to university policies."" The report described traditions such as the ""midnight ramp,"" in which band members entered the stadium through a ramp wearing only their underwear. Staff members, including Waters, were present for the annual event, the report alleges. Nicknames, many sexually explicit, were given to new members each year by upperclassmen as well as a ""trick,"" an act often simulating sexually explicit acts that usually corresponded with the nickname. These tricks were to be performed by members ""on command or at their own volition,"" the report said. When Waters was asked by investigators about the offensive nicknames, he said ""50%"" were probably ""questionable,"" according to the report. After being told that sexual nicknames were not appropriate, investigators asked Waters why he tolerated the practice. He responded, ""good point,"" the report alleges. The tricks, however, were not performed in front of staff, according to several witnesses interviewed in the report. New band members also took part in ""rookie introductions,"" where they stood at the front of a bus en route to games and answered sexual questions or told dirty jokes before walking to the back of the bus ""while other students attempted to remove articles of clothing,"" the report said. Waters' lawyer, David Axelrod, said his client was named acting director in February 2013 but that the objectionable acts laid out in the report started many years before. Waters had previously served in other staff positions and was a sousaphone player in the band as a student from 1995 to 1999, the report said. The marching band, which calls itself ""the best damn band in the land,"" consists of 225 members and garnered international attention in 2013 for its halftime show tribute to Michael Jackson, which has over 10 million views on YouTube. ""During his time as director he did everything he could to stop this,"" Axelrod said. The university has appointed former Ohio Attorney General Betty Montgomery to lead an independent task force to further investigate and ensure steps are taken to change the band culture, Drake said. It is unclear what steps Waters will take next, Axelrod said. ""In one way or another Jon is going to fight to restore his name. Jon was Ohio State. He bleeds scarlet and gray,"" Axelrod said. ""He won't let his beloved alma mater take away his good name.""

"(CNN) -- Thirty was not a good year for Michelle Jackson. A few weeks before her birthday, she lost her job. Then her husband left her -- with a 1Â½-year-old at home. So it's understandable that as her 40th birthday approached, the Milwaukee resident was nervous. Sure, she had a new job that she loved and her husband had returned. But the medical data analyst was more than 150 pounds overweight, despite working every day with experts who stressed the importance of staying healthy. Around her 38th birthday, Jackson came across an article about weight loss. It discussed aging and how middle-aged women have to work out three times a week just to maintain their weight. After 40, Jackson remembers reading in horror, metabolism slows and the pounds don't come off as easily. Unfortunately, says CNN's diet and fitness expert Dr. Melina Jampolis, that's not a myth. Jampolis says she sees evidence of it all the time in her practice -- women over 40 who are attending spin class every day and restricting calories, frustrated because they can't drop five pounds. There's nothing magic about the age of 40, Jampolis says. But in the premenopausal years, a woman's sex hormones start to change. The body produces less healthy estrogen, and more estrone -- a type of estrogen that comes from your body's fat tissue. More estrone leads to insulin resistance and a loss of muscle mass. And with their hormones going crazy, women start to crave carbohydrates and sweets. ""It's like PMS on steroids,"" Jampolis says. ""The best thing to do is a preventative attack in your 30s. It's going to be much, much harder to lose the weight in your 40s."" Jackson decided to take control of her upcoming milestone. ""At the time I was 38. (I thought), 'I'm going to turn 40 regardless. Why don't I accomplish something in two years instead of being in the same place?'"" She launched her mission: ""Fit By 40."" But starting a new lifestyle was easier said than done. ""I'm regarded as a pretty great home cook and take a lot of pride in that,"" Jackson wrote in her iReport submission. ""I've also never been any good (with) sports -- physical sport typically conjured feelings of embarrassment. It was daunting to consider eating differently and exercising regularly because I was contemplating something larger: losing the compliments on my cooking and facing embarrassment at the gym."" Always data-obsessed, Jackson started using SparkPeople.com to plot her weight along a goal line. She cut her calories to 1,600 a day and started logging 30 to 45 minutes at the gym three times a week. Jampolis says weight training needs to be a priority for women before and after 40. More muscle leads to a higher calorie-burn -- essential when your metabolism decides to limp along. Also important is eating a healthy diet, Jampolis says. Vegetables, fruits and grains should be spaced out between several servings of lean protein. ""Women are super busy in their 30s; they're usually raising kids or kicking butts in their career,"" she says. ""They really need to put (the focus) back on themselves to make a smooth transition to their 40s."" On the new plan, Jackson's weight dropped at a steady rate. Since March 2011, she's lost more than 100 pounds. Along the way, she realized she had always known how to get healthy.The problem wasn't a lack of information. The problem was motivation.""If you had asked me when I was at my heaviest how being heavy had impacted me, I would have said, 'not at all,'"" Jackson says. ""I was comfortable in my own skin."" She didn't consider herself unhealthy at 330 pounds. Yet after losing weight, she stopped snoring, went off her asthma medication, felt less pain in her knee while walking and threw out the acid reflux medication she used to take before bed. ""Michelle is a driven, determined and strong-willed force,"" her friend and co-worker Krissy Fischer says. ""When she committed to weight loss, there was no doubt she would succeed. Michelle was never shy, but she has become even more confident, outgoing and self-assured as she has lost weight."" Jackson won't reach her goal weight of 164 pounds -- a healthy body mass index for her 5-foot-8 frame -- by her birthday in February. She could add more intense workouts or drop her calorie intake, but she wants to maintain a lifestyle she can keep up for the rest of her life. As her big birthday approaches, she isn't nervous anymore.""I'm excited for it,"" she says. ""I've taken 40 into my hands.""

"(Health.com) -- ""Life is good, I gotta be honest,"" laughs Giuliana Rancic. She's in her apartment in Chicago with her husband, Bill. And who's napping in his room? Their baby boy, Edward Duke. ""I'm in baby heaven,"" says the Italian-born TV host and fashion designer, sounding surprisingly calm considering that one year ago, after four years of struggling to conceive, she got the devastating news that she had breast cancer. Viewers of the couple's hit Style Network show ""Giuliana & Bill"" know the story well: Giuliana went through three IVFs (one she miscarried; one didn't take), and then, at 36, was diagnosed with cancer. She had a double mastectomy. Unable to carry the embryos from her third IVF (due to her cancer medication), she enlisted a gestational surrogate, who gave birth to their son on August 29. Come November, after a few months of baby-bonding, it's back to work. On November 12, Giuliana will return to ""E! News"" with a new co-anchor, Terrence Jenkins. In addition to her co-hosting gig on E!'s Fashion Police, she has just launched her G by Giuliana Rancic collection on HSN, and will host NBC's spring show Ready for Love with Bill. Now, she tells Health what she's learned about staying positive when your world turns upside down. Health: Congratulations on Duke! What's your favorite thing about him? Rancic: I love when I feed him in the middle of the night. Those moments are incredible, when it's so quiet and there's just a little bit of a light on, just looking at his little face. Health: The road to baby was a tough one for you. You've said you were blindsided by how difficult it was. Rancic: It was a big shock! I always say how I chased my career instead of chasing guys. And everybody was patting me on the back. No one ever told me, ""Oh, by the way, your eggs change when you reach a certain age."" I didn't think 35 was old! So when the doctor said, ""It's not as easy as you thought it would be,"" it was a real blow. Because I felt so young. I mean, this is a girl who was running six miles a day, and eating healthy, so how can you tell me that I'm not healthy in that department? Health.com: A top doc reveals 8 fertility misconceptions . Health: So would you have done anything differently? Rancic: I don't think I would've frozen my eggs. A lot of people throw that out there, like, ""Oh, just freeze your eggs."" That is major.

But the second one, I did not get pregnant, and that was the biggest kick in the stomach, because I just could not believe you go through so much to get those eggs and put them in, and when the doctor calls you, to hear, ""Oh, sorry, it didn't work."" That was the most shocking. I would go, ""I'm a good person, and I could give someone the greatest life of all, but yet I can't get pregnant."" And then you watch these TV shows, ""16 and Pregnant,"" and these girls who want nothing to do with their babies are pregnant. And you're going, what? None of that made sense to me. Health: Had you known what was coming, would you have chosen to keep any of this private? Rancic: Had you given me a crystal ball when we were signing on to do the reality show that said, ""This is what's coming up, do you want to do it?"" I would've said absolutely not. You couldn't pay me enough. But, looking back, I'm so happy that I did do it. As I would question God, ""Why are you doing this to me, why me?""

Health: After finding your cancer, did you know what your next steps would be? Rancic: No way, are you kidding? I was shell-shocked. I thought I was going to die. I didn't know that if you find breast cancer early enough, you have a 98 percent survival rate. I went to work right after finding out and did E! News. I recently watched that episode and I don't know how I pulled it off. Afterward, I ran into my dressing room and started hysterically crying. Bill was really the one who had to pick me up off the floor and say, ""Hey, we're making a plan here."" He took over. Health: You seem to display such grace under pressure. What is your secret? Rancic: Focus on the positive. Whenever I was so sad, when I was on the floor kicking and screaming and crying, the best way I could pull out of it was when I would remind myself: Even with this happening, you're still better off than a lot of people. For me, it was saying, ""Yes, I have breast cancer. Yes, I had to have a double mastectomy."" But, you know what? Thank God I'm going to a good doctor. I'm so fortunate I found it early. I'm so fortunate to have Bill. I'm so fortunate that I have a boss who understands. Health: What is your cancer prognosis right now? Rancic: As of this week, I'm a one-year survivor!

Rancic: Adoption was something we were very open to, but when we did the third IVF, we got the embryos and I would have put them into myself, but that was when we found the breast cancer. Part of the treatment is five years of tamoxifen, which can cause birth defects. So we said, ""Dr. Schoolcraft, what now?"" He said the next step should be surrogacy because we had the embryos. As Bill likes to say, they were ""on ice."" So we met this lovely French girl who was living in America and she carried our baby for nine flawless months. We are still open to adoption if we decide to have more kids. But we do still have some embryos on ice, so if we wanted to try surrogacy again, we could.

Rancic: If you call and say, ""Can I do anything for you?"" nine out of 10 times, do you know what they're going to say? ""No, no, I'm OK."" When you are going through cancer, you feel out of control, so you overcompensate. So basically, you insist. Call and say, ""While you have your doctor's appointment, do you mind if I come watch your kids?"" Or, ""I'm just going to drop off groceries; you don't even have to come to the door."" As a breast cancer survivor, I hated the ordeal, but I'm ultimately glad I had cancer, as it shifted my priorities. Were there any good parts for you? — Diana Tumminia, Brooklyn, New York . Rancic: If I could erase all this, I would. But I can't, so I look at the positive. It made me a stronger and a better person. It definitely shifted my priorities. But I still love my career.

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences and analyze the news behind events. Here, CNN's Nic Robertson describes a tour of Camp Bucca, the largest U.S.-run detention facility in Iraq. Some 2,000 suspected al Qaeda loyalists are held at Camp Bucca, the military says. CAMP BUCCA, Iraq (CNN) -- The inmates huddle below the barbed wire, looking up at the strangers who have arrived at the detention facility. They're dressed in bright yellow, almost fluorescent jumpsuits. There are 2,000 of them, described by the U.S. military as hard-core al Qaeda loyalists. These inmates are kept behind a maze of chain-link fences, topped with barbed wire, and are guarded by heavily armed men in military fatigues who hold shields. We're escorted through Camp Bucca, the United States' biggest detention facility in Iraq, by Marine Gen. Douglas Stone, who runs the camp. ""They're hard to break,"" he says of the suspected al Qaeda inmates. As Stone speaks, some inmates begin pointing up and we're told to keep moving. We wear protective glasses to cover our eyes. Inmates here throw rocks from the dusty, gravel floor at visitors, sometimes using makeshift slingshots to hurl the pebbles at 100 mph. Several guards have been blinded by the projectiles.  Walk along with Nic Robertson through the facility » . ""This is not a place you want to hang around, so we really don't want to stand here that much longer because they will organize around us,"" Stone says. We press on through the facility. As we record our television piece, we're not allowed to talk to the inmates or show their faces -- doing so would be in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Inside Camp Bucca, the al Qaeda loyalists make up a minority of more than 19,000 civilian detainees. They are neither criminals nor prisoners of  war. They are detained because they are deemed a security threat, many accused of taking up arms against American soldiers. There is no maximum period for holding them. They are freed only when it has been determined by a review board they are no longer a security risk. Some have been locked up for more than three years. Just last year, the facility was known as a jihadist haven where violence was rampant. At its worst, rioting involving between 1,000 and 10,000 detainees spread across half the compounds in the camp. Fires burned through many areas. Plots to kidnap and kill guards were common, authorities say. It became so bad the U.S. military considered the facility a strategic threat. Stone took over in May last year. ""It most assuredly was a jihadist university,"" says Stone. He even admits he was on the verge of shooting rioting detainees, a prospect that would have made the abuses at the notorious Abu Ghraib prison pale in comparison. Stone says that was his turning point. Since that time, Stone has radically reshaped the camp, working to change the attitudes of the guards and detainees alike. Inmates undergo religious re-education where imams preach a moderate interpretation of Islam. The prison also offers art classes. Some attend English courses. Even civics courses teaching Western-style democracy are offered.  Watch the change from ""jihadist university"" to model lockup » . Stone has also allowed families to visit the detainees much more frequently. He says detailed research shows most detainees at Bucca got family permission to take up arms against Americans so they could make money. ""The reality is this is the battlefield of the mind,"" Stone says. He says the new policies are already paying dividends: ""Detainees now tell us more about the network of al Qaeda, about the training techniques of al Qaeda, about how they fund their operations."" He says 7,000 inmates have been released. Only seven have been returned to the facility, according to Stone. The hope is that the detainees will return to their communities and spread a message of moderation. ""Each detainee represents the possibility of being a moderate missile, if you will, fired into a community to spread a degree of moderacy and that's the way we view it,"" he says. ""If we have half of them hitting their target, it makes a huge difference."" My crew and I get a firsthand glimpse in one Bucca classroom. An imam explains to the detainees they have to respect other people. He also tells them everyone makes mistakes, and it's up to each individual to correct those mistakes. He tells them killing people is wrong and un-Islamic. In another part of the facility, hard-core extremists are kept isolated from the rest. On this day, they are getting a math class. Their teacher stands outside their wire cage; it's too dangerous for him to talk to them directly. Stone's priority is to separate the extremists from the moderates and give religious re-education to all -- even if the most radical may reject it. His work at this facility is part of the counterinsurgency strategy employed by the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus, designed to isolate extremists from the population. The re-education techniques are used by governments in other Muslim states to tackle Islamic radicals. Stone's approach has remodeled the U.S. detention system in Iraq and appears to have reduced the practice of putting well-trained extremists back into the community to rejoin the fight in what U.S. military officers disparagingly called a ""catch and release"" program. How the new approach holds up after Stone leaves when his tour ends in the coming months will be a test of how successful he has been in changing the psychology of guards and detainees alike. Walking around the facility, it appears the U.S. military has put the scandal of Abu Ghraib behind it. Stone wants Camp Bucca to be the model for three new detention facilities to be built around Iraq closer to detainees' families. They could cost $250 million to build. But if Stone's tactics are right, they could also have a significant impact on winning the war in Iraq. E-mail to a friend .","CNN's Nic Robertson goes inside main U.S. detention facility in Iraq .

"Amsterdam (CNN) -- Is it wrong to watch football while the world's on fire? Is it wrong to love the World Cup, to get excited about a goal scored in Brazil while there's mayhem in Iraq, destruction in Syria, Russian troops massing near Ukraine? The answer is no. Enjoy the Cup. When I was a child I had what I thought was a brilliant idea: Instead of fighting all those awful wars, countries with gripes should challenge each other to a soccer game. The victor could be declared the winner without all the nastiness of fighting a real war. My childhood plan for world peace didn't pan out, but soccer, and the World Cup in particular, remains the premiere arena for make-believe international conflict. It captivates massive crowds, stokes intense rivalries and fills people with surprisingly intense emotions. This is true even for the people caught in the middle of real wars. In Syria, in the middle of a civil war, rebel fighters put their weapons aside to watch the World Cup. In Baghdad, as the ruthless ISIS jihadists march toward the Iraqi capital, cafes are filled with people watching the Cup. In Vienna, Iranian officials took a break from nuclear negotiations to watch their team. Refugees, astronauts, politicians are all watching the World Cup. Clearly, there's no need for the rest of us to feel guilty. No need for mixed feeling about switching between Obama's announcement on Iraq and the Colombia-Ivory Coast match. In Europe, where nationalism got a bad name after World War II, patriotic pride overflows with uncharacteristic fearlessness when the national teams play. Even people who never pay attention to soccer, known almost everywhere as football, are cheering, bragging about Van Persie's spectacular diving header against Spain. The streets of Amsterdam, where I am right now, are filled with the royal colors, with orange streamers, orange flags and toy soccer balls hanging over pedestrian streets and canal boats. When the Netherlands plays, everyone watches. People love sports, but they love the World Cup for special reasons. Like other competitions, it resembles life in that the outcomes are the product of skill, merit, luck and even unfairness. All the preparation in the world can come to nothing because of a slip in the grass, an unexpected shove, a referee's mistake. Unlike other tournaments, this one puts countries of all sizes on the stage. Small ones can topple big ones. It seems as if entire nations take each other on. All the wealth and power in the world cannot protect a squad. The United States is an underdog. China didn't qualify. England was defeated by tiny, tight-shirted Uruguay. The tournament distills human emotions to their essence. With so much passion, every point triggers an explosion of unadulterated happiness. What can capture human emotions better than those reaction images from the stands? In Amsterdam, when the team scores, I mute my television and hear the entire city roar with exhilaration. The tournament may have political resonance, occasionally pitting rival countries, but it also brings out the child in every fan. I have seen grown men walk around wearing neon-bright orange wigs, no doubt wishing they were in the stands in Porto Alegre with their faces painted and Styrofoam cheese for a hat. Everyone's a child. Another electrifying aspect of the Cup is that the entire world is watching, even in countries not playing. I have found myself working in a variety of countries during the World Cup, often during times of conflict. For some reason, people everywhere seem to dance in the streets when Brazil wins a match. National pride is tightly wound with every country's squad. When a Dutch actress tweeted a Photoshopped picture making it look as if Colombian players were snorting the foam marking kick lines, Colombia protested, and the actress, Nicolette van Dam, lost her post as a UNICEF ambassador. Peace was restored. The idea that there could be a connection between soccer and peace, as it turns out, came up long before I mentioned it to my father years ago. One of history's poignant moments came during World War I, in December 1914 -- almost exactly 100 years ago -- when a Christmas truce was declared and German and British soldiers set their guns aside to play a friendly soccer match. When the truce ended, the killing resumed. Unfortunately, soccer is no panacea. Even violence directly connected to the Cup occurs. For most, the World Cup is a wonderful distraction from the difficulties of daily life, from wars and from work, from challenging circumstances and from the knowledge that there is so much else that is serious and troubling in the world. It is not wrong to watch, much less to enjoy the event, even if it does not prevent or stop any real wars. Around the globe, the World Cup is a source of sheer excitement, except for the moment when one's favorite team loses. But here's the beauty: When your team loses the disappointment is deep, the sadness is real. Then you remember it's just a game. It's really not the end of the world.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Film director Tony Scott left notes in his car and office before plunging to his death from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California, a Los Angeles County coroner official said Monday. Scott, best known for the films ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" apparently committed suicide by jumping from the bridge about 12:30 p.m. Sunday, said Lt. Joe Bale of the coroner's office. ""There's nothing to indicate it is anything else at this time,"" Bale said. Director Tony Scott: An appreciation . A friend found a note from Scott, 68, in his Los Angeles office, apparently written for his family, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. A note left in his car on the bridge including names and phone numbers for his family was probably intended for officials investigating his death, Winter said. The bridge spans Los Angeles Harbor, connecting San Pedro and Terminal Island. A passerby who saw Scott jump from the bridge called 911, according to a statement released by the coroner's office late Sunday. ""The L.A. Port Police recovered the body from the water,"" the statement said. Opinion: Scott made tense films for jittery times . Born Anthony D.L. Scott in North Shields, England, in 1944, he got his start as a teenager in front of the camera, starring in his older brother Ridley Scott's film ""Boy and Bicycle."" In 1995, the two joined forces to create the production company Scott Free Productions. Simon Halls, a publicist who represents the Scott brothers, confirmed the death. Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the mega-hit ""Top Gun,"" starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis. He followed that up with the Eddie Murphy action movie ""Beverly Hills Cop II"" in 1987. Both Cruise and Murphy released statements mourning the loss of their director. ""Tony was my dear friend and I will really miss him. He was a creative visionary whose mark on film is immeasurable. My deepest sorrow and thoughts are with his family at this time,"" said Cruise. Murphy described Scott as a ""wonderful collaborator"" and said he will be missed. Pepperdine University film professor Craig Detweiler called Scott ""the supreme stylist"" who ""operated at the top of his game throughout each decade of his career."" ""He was able to make the thinnest of premises into something pulse-pounding and exciting and he's almost a filmmaker as a magician who found drama amidst almost contrived situations,"" Detweiler said. Taking his own life by jumping from a bridge is ""a high-adrenaline ending, which matches his dramatic style,"" he said. ""He put Denzel Washington, Will Smith and Tom Cruise in movies where one man overcomes all struggles, triumphs over struggles, and yet it appears he was not able to write that story for himself,"" he said. Actor Michael Rapaport, who was directed by Scott in ""True Romance,"" took to Twitter to praise the director. In one post, he said there hasn't been a day since the movie was released in 1993 that someone doesn't tell him how much they loved the film. ""Tony Scott was a sweet enthusiastic & lovin man,"" Rapaport wrote. Scott cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner and ""Days of Thunder"" with Cruise. In 1998, he directed ""Enemy of the State"" with Will Smith and Gene Hackman. EW: 11 Tony Scott films to remember . It was on the set of ""Days of Thunder"" where Scott met actress Donna Wilson, whom he married in 1994. They had twin sons. Reaction to Scott's death poured out Monday, with directors, actors and fans mourning the news. ""Being around you was always the ultimate experience -- intensity, vitality and celebration. Pure rock and roll and great cigars. Your warmth and generosity was palpable to all us. You treated everyone with care and respect,"" said actor Edgar Ramirez, who starred in Scott's 2005 film, ""Domino."" ""You always focused on the subtleties, taking the best out of us. I am proud to be your friend, and although I won't be seeing you for a while, you will live on in the laughter of our memories of you."" ""Tony Scott as a friend and a mentor was irreplaceable. Tone, wherever you are, I love you man. RIP,"" director and producer Joe Carnahan said on Twitter. Carnahan recounted how when his movie ""The Grey"" was finished, Scott called to tell him he had seen it. He told Carnahan it was great and not to allow anybody to change anything in it. ""Tony always sent personal, handwritten notes & always drew a cartoon caricature of himself, smoking a cigar, with his hat colored in red,"" Carnahan said in a post. Scott directed his last film, the train thriller ""Unstoppable"" starring Denzel Washington, in 2010. ""For me, it was the most challenging movie of my life, and the most dangerous because I'm shooting 90 percent of the movie on a train that is running between 50 and 70 mph,"" Scott told CNN at the time. Scott's reputation in Hollywood was low-key. ""He wasn't a showy kind of guy,"" longtime entertainment reporter Jeanne Wolf told CNN. Scott was often seen sporting a frayed, faded red ball cap on the movie sets and at red carpet premieres. The ball cap, Wolf said, was his trademark. Time: Top 7 Tony Scott movie moments .

"(CNN) -- ""Budapest"" rolls off the tongue pretty easily, and the Hungarian capital itself feels as if it's been around for a long time. But Budapest is a relatively recent construct -- the result of an 1873 merger between two distinct cities: Buda on the western bank of the Danube and Pest on the bank opposite. The result, Budapest, sounds so much more natural than other twin cities -- Minneapolis/St. Paul or Dallas/Fort Worth -- it's difficult to imagine that the alternative ""Pestbuda"" was floated seriously at the time. Although they've been populated for centuries, Pest and Buda have developed so separately that the first bridge spanning the Danube, the imposing Chain Bridge, wasn't built until 1849. Their distinctiveness continues to this day. View from the hills . Built on a series of hills, Buda is the site of a grand Hapsburg palace and has a detached, imperial air of settled wealth. In contrast, populous Pest -- as flat as a prairie -- is busy, buzzing and bourgeois, with an assortment of bars, cafés and gourmet restaurants. Buda offers sweeping panoramas. Most visitors are content with the view across to Pest from the Fisherman's Bastion on Castle Hill and ignore the less accessible Gellért Hill just to the south. More: 11 things to know before visiting Hungary . Yet here the ramparts of the old Citadella fortress (Citadella sétány 1; +36 1 279-1963; free entry) provide equally stunning vistas over the Danube. It's in the hiking network of the Buda Hills, where city residents come to picnic and ramble through the woods. During weekdays, you can walk for hours without seeing another human being. Kids' railway . Hills hide the Children's Railway (Szechenyi-hegyi Gyermekvasut; +36 1 397 5394; $5.40 adult, $2.70 child; closed Monday) a narrow-gauge line operated entirely by 10-to-14 year olds as ticket sellers, announcers and conductors -- only the drivers are adults. The line runs for 45 minutes through 11 kilometers of forest landscape with seven stops in-between. When night falls, Buda goes to sleep and Pest wakes up. Whether you prefer the opulence of the Opera House, one of Europe's finest, or the conviviality of the city's legendary ruin pubs, you want to be on the Pest side of the river after dark. Pest has been a hotbed of Hungarian national pride to counter the Austrian Hapsburg court reigning from Castle Hill. Buda may have the palace, but Pest houses the Hungarian parliament (1-3 Kossuth tér; +36 1 441 4000; daily tours in English April-October, $7.80 EU citizens, $3.90 others), a dazzling neo-Gothic building whose superlative interior is more than a match for its exterior. Spa wars . Pest is as practical and business-oriented as Buda is aloof and superior. Buda has thermal spas, such as the Gellért or Rudas Baths, built by the old ruling elites. Pest has an open-air people's pool: the neo-baroque Széchenyi Baths complex where you can still find old men playing chess, half immersed in the water. (See Spasbudapest.com for complete spa information.) Pest's bustle is best reflected in its most well-known shopping artery: Váci utca. It suffered during the Communist era but the street has regained its ritzy reputation. More: 8 must-see Budapest buildings . Fittingly, Buda has the Wolf's Meadow cemetery, where famous Hungarians such as classical composer Béla Bartók and conductor Georg Solti are buried in extravagant tombs. Pest, on the other hand, has the vitality and life force associated with the fiery Magyar temperament -- nowhere more evident than in the former city's culinary culture. Café cultured . In Vörösmarty square you can find one of Europe's monuments to confectionary brilliance: the café founded by Emil Gerbeaud (Café Gerbeaud, 7-8 Vörösmarty tér, +36 1 429 9000) in 1885, complete with over-elaborate ceilings and chandeliers. Not far away, the renovated art nouveau decor of the Gerlóczy Café (Gerlóczy u. 1; +36 1 501 4000) gives traditional Hungarian dishes a modern makeover. Further out, at the edges of the seventh district, the fin-de-siècle elegance of New York Café (part of the Hotel Boscolo Budapest; 9-11 Erzsébet körút, +36 1 886 6167) has to be seen to be believed. Some tourists do just that -- constantly snapping diners from the gallery above. ""Visit Buda but stay in Pest"" is the advice every Budapest visitor is given. But in fact the once-separate cities have such distinct characters you should spend as much time exploring each. It's the only way to do them justice.

"(CNN) -- After ceding the smartphone and tablet size war to competitors like Samsung for the past few years, it appears Apple had finally decided that bigger is better. The next iPad will be Apple's biggest ever, with a whopping 12.9-inch display screen, according to a report Tuesday from Bloomberg. That would be a huge leap from the current 9.7-inch iPad Air screen. And the report comes as Apple prepares to release not one, but two, new, bigger iPhones. Multiple reports have said the company plans to announce iPhones with displays of 4.7 and 5.5 inches. That's compared to the 4-inch display on the iPhone 5S, and would put them more in line with their chief rival, Samsung, which has put a dent in the iPhone's dominance with devices in their Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lines. So, what's with the super-sizing out of Cupertino? J.P. Gowndner, an analyst with Forrester Research, says bigger smartphones are a natural response to the way people have begun to use them. ""As our digital lives become deeper, we're spending a lot less time speaking on phones and more time using smartphones as tools -- for communications, yes, but for paying our bills, finding the nearest ATM, looking up sports scores, taking photos, navigating around town, and other activities,"" he said. ""With more digital activity and less minutes spent on voice calls, it's only natural that phones should grow larger."" In recent years, Apple has watched as competitors managed to chip away at its smartphone dominance by offering an array of products at different prices and sizes while Apple stuck with a single flagship phone. Last year's iPhone 5S and 5C marked the first time Apple offered more than one new version of its phone. Both have 4-inch screens. Meanwhile, Samsung's flagship Galaxy S5 has a 5.1-inch display and the company's Galaxy Note III has a whopping 5.7-inch screen. As phones grow, Gowndner said, it only makes sense for tablets to do the same. ""Seven- or 8-inch tablets are popular today, but if I have a 5- or 6-inch phone, I wouldn't want one,"" he said. ""Instead, larger screen sizes wedded with ever thinner, ever lighter materials means that I could have a 12.9-inch tablet that weighs no more than a 10-inch tablet used to weigh -- making it quite portable."" In addition to differentiating itself from the growing field of hybrid ""phablets,"" a bigger iPad screen could be a step toward the goal of making tablets more than just consumption and recreational devices. Analysts say they can see design, manufacturing, education as just a few areas in which a bigger display would be useful. But is bigger really better? Some in the mobile world have argued against that. Among them: Apple. ""You can hold it in one hand,"" Apple marketing vice president Phil Schiller said when introducing the 7.9-inch iPad Mini in 2012. Founder Steve Jobs was adamant until the end that a 3.5-inch screen was the perfect size for a smartphone screen. ""You can't get your hand around it,"" Jobs said in 2010, as rivals running Google's Android operating system began rolling out bigger phones. ""No one's going to buy that."" According to a 2013 study by mobile designer and author Steven Hoober, 59% of smartphone users operate their device with one hand, perhaps lending some credence to Jobs' argument. ""As with the iPad Mini -- which Steve Jobs said was a bad idea before he passed away -- a larger iPad would be a departure for Apple,"" Gowndner said. ""But it's a welcomed one: Market segmentation is important, and there are buyers who would benefit from a larger device. ""Tim Cook will continue to put his own imprint on Apple, and we'll see if the bets he makes succeed.""","A report says the next iPad will have a 12.9-inch display .

"Simferopol, Crimea (CNN) -- Is Russian President Vladimir Putin an opportunist, grabbing at chances to poke the West in the eye, or a clever strategist with the longer-term goal of restoring a greater Russia? Is he simply riding a tide of Russian patriotic fervor over Crimea? Is he a rational actor aware of the delicate balances within the international system, or as one observer put it, ""drunk on power"" and oblivious to sanctions? These are the questions preoccupying western governments and Russia's neighbors, after the swift annexation of Crimea and Russian military maneuvers close to the Ukrainian border. There were some tantalizing clues in Putin's pugnacious speech to the Duma this week. He described the fall of the Soviet Union as unfortunate -- because it had separated Russians. ""The Russian nation became one of the biggest, if not the biggest ethnic group in the world to be divided by borders,"" he said. ""It was only when Crimea ended up as part of a different country that Russia realized that it was not simply robbed, it was plundered."" He went on to say, ""if you compress the spring all the way to its limit, it will snap back hard."" Heady, populist rhetoric -- but it has propelled the Russian President to his highest approval rating -- 71% -- in recent years, according to the Russian Public Opinion Research Center. Putin said Russia had no intention of violating Ukraine's sovereignty (beyond the 5% of its territory it has absorbed this week.) ""Do not believe those who want you to fear Russia, shouting that other regions will follow Crimea,"" he told Ukrainians. But he then said this: ""It should be above all in Ukraine's own interest to ensure that these people's rights and interests are fully protected. This is the guarantee of Ukraine's state stability and territorial integrity."" In other words, if the Kremlin believes Russians are being discriminated against, Ukraine's independence is no longer assured. Those words will have echoed across parts of the former Soviet Union with large Russian populations: Moldova (10%), Lithuania (6%), Latvia (27%) and Estonia (25%). Will the Russian region of Transnistria in Moldova begin agitating for its own referendum? Will oblasts (regions) of eastern Ukraine demand their own vote? Transnistria is already beyond the control of the Moldovan government. Just as a statue of Lenin overlooks the main square in the Crimean capital, Simferopol, so another stands outside Transnistria's regional assembly in Tiraspol. In a 2006 referendum more than 95% of voters said they wanted to be reunited with Russia. The assumption at NATO headquarters is that Putin won't stop at Crimea. Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen described the annexation of Crimea as ""21st century revisionism, attempts to turn back the clock, to draw new dividing lines on our map, to monopolize markets, subdue populations."" NATO has already stepped up air policing over the Baltic states -- all members of the Alliance. Nor does the White House see Crimea as Putin's end-game. In imposing sanctions against figures close to Putin, President Obama stressed Thursday that further Russian incursions would trigger a third round of sanctions targeting key sectors of the Russian economy. One of Putin's reasons for ignoring the warnings so far is history, as he made clear in front of the Duma. On Kosovo, NATO expansion, Libya and other issues, he said, the West had lied to and deceived Russia. He didn't use the word payback, but he didn't need to. Gradually, pro-Western governments have taken power around Russia, across the Baltics, now in Ukraine -- feeding the age-old Russian fear of encirlement. Indeed Putin asked the Duma this week: what if Sevastopol in Crimea -- with its glorious place in Russian military history -- had become a NATO base within Ukraine? A line had to be drawn. But that line has only hastened the signing of Ukraine's association agreement with the European Union. In signing the agreement Friday, the President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, pointedly said it was a response to ""the popular yearning for a decent life as a nation, for a European way of life."" The subtext was that Putin's Russia was on the wrong side of history -- anti-democratic, corrupt, without values. Putin's clique . Another reason for Putin's embrace of high-octane nationalism, according to some analysts, is that he increasingly relies on a small inner circle, where there are few voices of caution or dissent. There was a sign of this when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met US Secretary of State John Kerry in London recently. U.S. officials were surprised that Lavrov -- despite his enormous experience -- had no mandate to negotiate or even discuss aspects of the crisis. Lavrov announced Friday that the President would personally supervize the reintegration of Crimea. Alexei Kudrin was known to speak his mind as Finance Minister from 2000-2011. He believes the consequences of sanctions and market anxiety may cost Russia $200 billion this year in capital flight. The ruble has already lost 10% of its value this year and the credit rating agency Fitch's said Friday that ""Since U.S. and EU banks and investors may well be reluctant to lend to Russia under the current circumstances, the economy may slow further and the private sector may require official support."" Economists now expect the Russian economy to stagnate and perhaps slide into recession. That hurts people closest to the Russian President, the billionaires who control large chunks of the Russian economy. Major companies like Metalloinvest and state banks like VTB need access to capital markets. Will Putin feel their pain, or must the oligarchs also make patriotic sacrifices? Another unknown is whether the Kremlin feels the West has the stomach for serious, lasting sanctions. After the Russian incursion into Georgia in 2008, when South Ossetia was essentially annexed, there was brief and mild retribution. The list of individuals sanctioned by the U.S. and European Union this time round may make a greater impact. But the avenues for dialogue - through NATO, the European Union, the G8, the United Nations -- are closing down. ""Business as usual,"" says NATO chief Rasmussen, ""is not an option."" Perhaps the biggest question is whether Putin accepts that Russia in the 21st century must be fully integrated into the international economy -- as a member of the World Trade Organization, with a convertible currency and a rule of law that allows and encourages companies to do business there. Or does he believe Russia is strong enough to stand aloof in the knowledge that the world (and especially Europe) can't do without its oil, gas and minerals? Similarly, does he see the value of international co-operation on Iran's nuclear program or Syria? Russia has no desire to see a nuclear-armed Iran, nor Syria taken over by jihadist militants. But co-operation with the West does not follow. Despite the fact that his ""cashiers"" are now sanctioned, and his attempts to prevent Ukraine from drifting westward have backfired, Putin's muscular defiance -- so popular at home and in Crimea -- portrays the West as Russia's natural adversary, not its potential partner.","Russian President approval ratings are at highest in recent years .
Analysts are asking if he is a rational actor, or ""drunk on power""
Assumption at NATO headquarters is that Putin won't stop at Crimea .
Russian businesses will suffer as Putin portrays West as adversary not potential partner ."
"(CNN) -- Ukrainians are a lot less pro-Russian than separatists there would like the world to believe, even in regions along the border with Russia which are supposedly voting overwhelmingly to declare independence from Ukraine, a new poll for CNN suggests. The people of Ukraine feel much more loyal to Europe than to Russia, and a clear majority back economic sanctions against Russia, according to the poll of 1,000 people across the country conducted in the past week. Two out of three (67%) people in Ukraine approve of economic sanctions against Russia, while one out of three (29%) disapproves, the poll by ComRes for CNN found. Ukrainians tend to see Russian President Vladimir Putin as dangerous and a strong leader, while they consider U.S. President Barack Obama friendly. More than half (56%) said they felt a stronger sense of loyalty to Europe than to Russia, while 19% said they felt more loyal to Russia and 22% said neither. Three percent said they didn't know. The results come a day after pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country said people there had voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Ukraine, in a referendum denounced by the United States and its European allies. Eastern promise? The CNN poll found that even in eastern Ukraine, a minority of people back an alliance with Russia. Just over a third (37%) of Ukrainians in three eastern regions favor an alliance with Russia, while 14% of the region backs an alliance with the European Union and about half (49%) say Ukraine would be better off if it did not ally with either, the poll found. ""Eastern Ukraine"" includes the regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, which are generally seen as among the most pro-Russian areas in the country. Donetsk and Luhansk held referendums on independence on Sunday, with an election official in Donetsk saying Monday the region had voted 90% in favor. Nationwide, a slight majority (54%) said it would be good for Ukraine to join the EU. More than eight out of 10 (82%) said it would be bad for the country to have Russian troops in Ukraine. And despite the crisis that has pitted Russia against the United States and European Union over the fate of the second-largest country in Europe, Ukrainians are optimistic about the future. Two out of three people said they were optimistic about the political future of the country (65%) and the same proportion (67%) said they were optimistic about its economic future. Putin vs. Obama . Nearly half (44%) of respondents to the CNN poll said Putin was a strong leader, compared to 27% who saw Obama that way. About a quarter (23%) said neither and six percent said they didn't know. Two-thirds (67%) described Putin as ""dangerous,"" while only 15% saw Obama that way. But Obama came out well ahead of Putin as ""friendly,"" with 47% applying the description to the U.S. President and only 14% saying it of Putin. About a third (34%) said neither was friendly, and five percent said they didn't know. Neither leader came across as especially reliable, with 32% choosing Obama, 19% choosing Putin and 45% saying neither. The findings, by the London-based agency ComRes for CNN, come from a nationally representative telephone poll of 1,000 Ukrainians conducted by telephone in Russian and Ukrainian from May 7-11. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. Ukraine's Donetsk region asking to join Russia, separatist leader says .","Even in the east, a minority backs an alliance with Russia .

"(CNN) -- The mother who made national headlines when she confronted a former Pennsylvania judge, sentenced for a scheme to make millions off unjustly incarcerating young people, said Sunday she feels that she got justice. ""It's justice in the sense that he is going to pay for what we've been dealing with for the last eight years,"" Sandy Fonzo told CNN's Don Lemon. ""True justice I don't think there could ever be. He'll never live the sentence that I'll live with for the rest of my life -- can't bring my son back,"" she said. Ciavarella sentenced to 28 years . Former Luzerne County Judge Mark Ciavarella was sentenced to 28 years in prison and ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution last week for his part in the so-called kids for cash scandal. Ciavarella was found guilty in February of 12 of 39 racketeering and fraud charges for accepting millions of dollars in bribes from friends who owned detention centers to which he sent juveniles. The case made national headlines when Ciavarella was confronted by Fonzo outside a courtroom after his conviction. Fonzo's 17-year-old son, Edward Kenzakowski, spent months in detention after Ciavarella sentenced him for possession of drug paraphernalia. According to Fonzo, her son, who had no prior record, was never able to recover and eventually took his own life. ""He was never the same,"" she told Lemon. ""He went in a young boy, a young, spirited boy, and came out a pent-up, angry man and it just escalated."" She said in February she came to the courthouse believing Ciavarella would be taken straight to jail. But when she found out he was going home and would not be sentenced until later, she was shocked and angered, and began shouting at Ciavarella. Fonzo's confrontation was captured by television cameras. ""Do you remember me?"" Fonzo screamed lunging toward Ciavarella, ""Do you remember my son?"" she screamed again. ""He's gone,"" she cried, ""He shot himself in the heart, you scumbag!""","Former juvenile judge Mark Ciavarella was sentenced to 28 years in prison .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- Aspiring entrepreneur Abigail Franklin began selling clothes from a truck because she was looking for a way to stay in one place. That might sound odd until you learn she is a wardrobe stylist based in Nashville who tours the world with musical acts. It was 2010, and she had just married her husband, a sound technician she met while touring with Bon Jovi, when she decided to set down roots. Given her two decades of experience dressing male performers including Prince and members of Creed, she set her sights on opening a menswear store. When she couldn't find a location that fit her budget, she went into business with Nashville fashion designer Kyah Hillis. Drawn to the opportunity to keep startup costs low, they decided to take a chance on mobile retail, which was catching on in Nashville after starting a few years earlier on the West Coast. People buy tacos and barbecue from retrofitted trucks and campers and some even live in them, so it was likely just a matter of time before entrepreneurs started using them to sell clothes, jewelry and shoes. ""We can bring our products to you instead of waiting for you to come to us,"" said Franklin in an interview in her truck last week, a former Snap-On-Tools truck from Indiana she found on Craigslist. It took about $25,000 to get ""The Trunk"" up and running in spring 2012, with Hill's dresses and jewelry on one side of the 10-by-5-foot retail space and Franklin's selection of men's hats and grooming products on the other. People follow the Trunk's movements on Twitter and on its website. On any given day, it could be a music festival, a tailgate, a restaurant parking lot or outside a Bon Jovi concert when the band plays in Nashville. Named so it could accommodate a rotating cast of products, brands or designers, Franklin sees it as a ""medicine chest"" of opportunities. ""It just made sense. There's less overhead, and we can usually cover it in one day,"" she said. ""I love the possibilities of the truck. We can use it to sell clothes or whatever we want."" Most people launch mobile boutiques as faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional brick and mortar retail, said Jeanine Romo, who launched Le Fashion Truck with business partner Stacey Steffe in Los Angeles in 2010. Usually, there's no lease involved and monthly expenses are lower than they would be to run a store. Before inventory, Le Fashion Truck's monthly costs run from $1,500 to $2,000 for generator, liability and auto insurance, cleaning supplies and storage rent, for starters. That pales in comparison to rent alone for a retail space, which could start at $7,000 in Los Angeles, Romo said. As budding entrepreneurs look for new ways to stand out from the crowd, interest in mobile retail appears to be growing. Romo and Steffe started the West Coast Mobile Retail Association in 2011 to unite and support mobile boutique owners. It now has 32 members, some of whom have taken active roles in proposing legislation and working with cities to develop regulations for mobile retail. In response to growing numbers of inquiries from outside the West Coast, the WCMRA expanded to become the American Mobile Retail Association, which has 60 members from across the country and new inquiries coming in each day, Romo said. ""It's just a new way of doing business. It's creative, it's interesting, it's the now,"" she said in a phone interview. Most of the boutiques carry women's clothing and accessories and gifts in the vein of what you might find on Etsy, but some trucks are expanding into shoes and sneakers, records, even flowers. But, it's labor intensive, physically and otherwise, the pair has learned. When they're not on their feet setting up and breaking down the 10-by-5-foot retail space, or checking the generator, they're looking for new places to show or ensuring their permits, licenses and knowledge of local codes are current. Recently, through WCMRA, they proposed new permit legislation. ""There's still no business plan template for this kind of business, so it's all happening on a case-by-case basis,"" Romo said. ""The rules are still being written and figured out and the owners of mobile boutiques are at the forefront of the action."" The trucks are also becoming springboards for online boutiques and occasionally an actual storefront. It cost Vanessa Lurie of Portland, Oregon, (known for its truck-friendly policies) about $2,000 to gut, paint and re-panel a 1969 Cardinal Deluxe trailer formerly used for hunting excursions and transform it into a two-rack vintage boutique with a tiny dressing corner in 2010. By July 2012 she had nearly enough capital to open a store in Portland by the same name, Wanderlust. Through the trailer, she learned how to run a retail business while generating revenue to invest in a real store. She worried at first that not having the novelty of the trailer would make it hard to distinguish herself from other vintage stores. But, she has found that having a permanent location makes it easier for her to build a loyal customer base that knows where to find her, she said. ""They're just really different experiences. People were so amazed by the trailer itself and the setup. You'd get into these really funny situations when people had to use the teeny dressing room,"" she said. Though she misses the ""intimacy"" of the trailer, she can carry more inventory now and become involved in the business community, she said. ""Now, it seems like I'm a little more established. People know where to find me, and I have a lot more regulars. I'm a business owner and people in the community embrace me for that."" Lurie, 30, still plans to use the trailer on a more selective basis, like festivals and fairs, of which Portland has a lot in the spring and summer. Franklin is also looking forward to spring in Nashville. Unlike its West Coast counterparts, who enjoy mobile retail-friendly weather most of the year, ""The Trunk"" had to hibernate for winter; it gets cold in Nashville, after all. When ""The Trunk"" reopens in 2013, Franklin plans to expand offerings for women since they make up the majority of customers, she said. Being at the mercy of inclement weather is one downside to mobile retail along with hoping customers will find you, she said. Brick and mortar stores rely on the same good fortune, of course. But a truck can pick up and leave if business isn't good. Follow Emanuella Grinberg on Twitter . Would you frequent a mobile retailer?

"(CNN) -- It's honeymooners' heaven and a surfer's dream. It's America's most remote capital and perhaps its most exotic. Home to hula skirts and palm trees and some of the world's most breathtaking beaches, Honolulu may well be a United States paradise. But paradise isn't cheap. The Hawaiian capital and the surrounding island of Oahu are among the most expensive places in the United States, and it can feel intimidating to find reasonably priced meals and activities as a budget-conscious tourist. Luckily, there are some monetary oases within this American paradise that will bring a smile to the heart (and wallet) of travelers on a budget. Take ""TheBus."" TheBus -- yes, it's actually called TheBus -- is Oahu's public transportation system, and it has stops throughout the island. One-way fares for adults are $2.50 and $1.25 for kids. (You can also get a four-day pass for $25.00 and a monthly pass for $60.00). TheBus is a great way to get around Oahu without busting the piggy bank on a rental car. Plus, because it's the driver's responsibility to worry about traffic, all tourists have to do is soak in the sights. To luau or not to luau? Your Hawaii tips . Taste Hawaiian cuisine. No trip to Oahu is complete without some native Hawaiian fare like kalua pork (smoked pork slow-cooked underground), lomi lomi salmon (fresh tomato and salmon salad), chicken long rice (chicken broth with glass noodles) and poi (mashed taro). Haili's Hawaiian Foods -- winner of the Healthy Plate Lunch Contest run by Hawaii's Department of Health -- offers a variety of native Hawaiian dishes for under $10. The family-run restaurant has been in business since the 1950s, and the sisters who currently run it are happy to answer questions about dishes with an enthusiastic smile. Haili's Hawaiian Foods is a short 20-minute bus ride from Waikiki on the 13 bus; the restaurant is closed on Mondays. To sample some of the best short ribs on the island, visit another family-run local favorite, Helena's Hawaiian Food, which has been around since 1946 and was featured on the Travel Channel's ""Man v. Food."" Expect a line. The B or 2 buses go to Helena's from Waikiki, and the ride takes about 40 minutes. It's also closed on Mondays. Heavenly Hawaii: Dos and don'ts . Climb Diamond Head. Work off that Kalua pig by climbing Diamond Head crater. One of the most iconic sites on Oahu, it was formed about 300,000 years ago after a volcanic eruption. The trail to the summit was built in 1908 and used by the military to defend Oahu from invaders, but today, guests can climb it to see some of the most spectacular views of the island. Trekkers should allow 1Â½-2 hours for the climb and should wear comfortable shoes. Some parts of the ascent can be strenuous, and near the summit, there is a 225-foot narrow tunnel; those suffering from claustrophobia should ask for the alternate route to the top. The walk to the base from Waikiki Beach takes about an hour. Diamond Head is also accessible via a short ride on the 22, 23 and 24 buses from Waikiki. Cost of admission is $1.00 for pedestrians. Pick up souvenirs at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet. Take the 20 or 42 bus from downtown Honolulu to the Aloha Stadium where a huge swap meet -- kind of like a flea market -- takes place Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Here, everything from macadamia nuts to Hawaiian shirts and local crafts to junk that residents are trying to unload from their attics are sold at prices well below what's to be found in Waikiki. While some selling their wares at the swap meet are regular vendors offering deals on beach towels or souvenir magnets, be sure to check out locals selling used items on blankets near their cars, which may be more unique. Entrance to the swap meet is $1.00, and the best time to arrive is between 9 and 10 o'clock in the morning. Visit Pearl Harbor. Don't miss the opportunity to pay your respects to those who died at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The mood is a somber, peaceful contrast to the frenetic activity of Waikiki, and the museum offers a unique opportunity to learn about the Pearl Harbor attack from personal accounts of people who were there. While there is a charge to tour some areas of Pearl Harbor, many of the most moving parts of this historic site are free. There is no charge to visit the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument or to tour the USS Arizona. Note: Tours of the USS Arizona must be reserved. To reserve online there is a $1.50 reservation fee per ticket. It is not uncommon for tours to be booked solid several days in advance, though some tickets may be available up until noon on the same day of the tour. The 20, 40, 40A, 42 and 62 buses from Waikiki all make stops at Pearl Harbor; the ride takes about an hour. Eat shave ice. No visit to Hawaii is complete without an afternoon shave ice. This Hawaiian treat is somewhat like a snow cone, only with smaller ice slivers that hold syrup better. For a really authentic incarnation of this treat, ask for a splash of Li Hing powder on top -- a kind of sweet and sour topping made from dried plums -- or condensed milk. Azuki beans (sweet red beans) and ice cream are also delicious accompaniments. While it's sure to be delectable just about anywhere on the island, San Lorenzo Shave Ice in Haleiwa is particularly yummy. Expect to spend $4 to $6, depending on size, for your sugary treat. Cheer as surfer dudes conquer the Banzai Pipeline. Oahu is a surfer's paradise and home to some of the most exhilarating -- and dangerous -- waves in the world. Here, it's not unusual to see daring surfers sliding underneath curling waves of the variety normally reserved for magazine covers and ""Blue Crush."" Surfers ride waves all day, though they're usually most impressive before 11 a.m. Located on the less developed north side of Oahu, the Pipeline is near the Mokule'ia Beach Park (coming up next). The 52 bus from Honolulu goes to the Pipeline; the ride takes a little over two hours. To get to Mokule'ia Beach Park from the Pipeline, take the 52 bus back toward Honolulu for approximately 15 minutes. Get lost in awe at ""Lost"" locations. Most of the hit television series ""Lost"" was filmed on Oahu and fans can visit everywhere from the mental institution where Hurley lived to the home of the mysterious Smoke Monster. Many of these sites are free: For a quick infusion of ""Lost"" mystique, visit the Hawaii Convention Center in downtown Honolulu to see where the cast filmed scenes that supposedly took place in the Sydney Airport. For the quintessential ""Lost"" experience, visit the site of the fictional Flight 815 crash. Mokule'ia Beach Park, the filming site for most of season one, is on the north shore of Oahu, and a great place to visit along with the Banzai Pipeline. The north side of Oahu is less developed as a tourist destination than the south side where Waikiki is, so it's not unusual for the beach to be empty (though don't be surprised to see a sea turtle napping on the shore). Beware that the intense surf on Oahu's northern beaches often makes swimming dangerous, and no lifeguards are on duty. By bus, take the 52 to the Wahiawa Transit Center and transfer onto the 55. Get off at the Papailoa Road stop on Kamehameha Highway. Make a left onto Papailoa Road and walk about five minutes to the public access point for the ""Lost"" beach. Tour the Dole Plantation. It opened as a fruit stand in 1950, but today, the Dole Plantation is a well-trodden tourist attraction that pays homage to one of the island's most iconic foods: the pineapple. Access to many parts of the Dole Plantation are free, including a garden where children can roam and see different varieties of pineapple growing. For a bit more of a splurge, the Plantation Garden Tour is $5 for adults and $4.25 for children, and access to the world's largest maze -- complete with a pineapple at its center -- is $6 for adults and $4 for children. A ride aboard the 20-minute Pineapple Express train is a little steeper, costing $8 for adults and $6 for children. If the weather's hot, be sure to indulge in the world-famous pineapple frozen treat known as the DoleWhip before leaving ($4.25). To get to the Dole Plantation, take bus 8, 19, 20, 47 or 58 from Waikiki and transfer onto the 52 at Ala Moana Shopping Center; ride time is approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes. Slurp some noodles. After a hard day of touring, a hearty meal is always needed. Marukame Udon, located right in Waikiki, is a Japanese cafeteria-style restaurant known for its homemade udon noodles -- a kind of thick, chewy spaghetti -- and the line out the door. Many of the noodle dishes cost under $5 and, for an extra splurge, individual pieces of tempura -- deep-fried shrimp or vegetables -- are available for about $1.50. (Note: Marukame Udon does not take credit cards). Don't be intimidated: The line moves quickly, and the food is worth standing outside for. Have you been to Oahu?

"(CNN) -- Lunesta may help you doze off at night, but it's the morning after that has officials concerned -- which is why on Thursday they halved the recommended dosage for the well-known sleep aid. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cited data showing that a person may be less alert and do things such as driving less safely the day after taking Lunesta. In particular, the federal agency pointed to one study of 91 healthy adults between the ages of 25 and 40, some of whom were given 3 mg of Lunesta, while the others got a placebo, or inactive pill. Men and women who took the active drug had ""severe next-morning psychomotor and memory impairment"" some 7Â½ hours later, as well as ""impairment to driving skills, memory and coordination as long as 11 hours after the drug is taken,"" according to an FDA news release. As a result, the FDA decided to decrease the recommended starting dose of Eszopiclone, as sold by Sunovion under the brand name Lunesta, from 2 mg to 1 mg. The federal agency noted that health care professionals could increase the dosage as high as 3 mg while warning of the consequences. ""To help ensure patient safety, health care professionals should prescribe, and patients should take, the lowest dose of a sleep medicine that effectively treats their insomnia,"" said Dr. Ellis Unger, a drug evaluation director at the FDA. Sunovion, the company that makes and markets Lunesta, did not immediately respond Thursday to CNN requests for comment on the recommended dosage change. According to the product's website, Lunesta is ""the No. 1 prescribed branded sleep aid,"" with more than 31 million prescriptions for the drug written. The same site states that ""more than 30 studies"" have shown Lunesta ""to be effective in many different types of insomnia patients,"" adding that ""there are no restrictions on duration for taking Lunesta.""","FDA: The recommended starting dose for Lunesta should be 1 mg, not 2 mg .

"(CNN) -- Tennis hero, inspiring role model for African Americans, social activist and high-profile campaigner for the HIV and AIDS communities, Arthur Ashe died in 1993, but it is a measure of his influence that 20 years on his legacy burns as brightly as ever. The main stadium court at Flushing Meadows, where the U.S. Open is staged, is named in his honor, a striking statue of Ashe adorns the grounds, while the Arthur Ashe Kids' Day is a glittering annual bash that kick starts the fortnight for the final grand slam of the season. Michelle Obama was the guest of honor this year. His widow Jeanne Moutoussamy Ashe has made it her life's work to ensure her late husband's memory is preserved for generations and the presidential endorsement is the icing on the cake. ""It makes me very proud that Arthur has his name raised up for kids who didn't have a clue who he is,"" she told CNN's Open Court program. ""It was such a great honor. I'm born and raised on the south side of Chicago, as is Mrs Obama, so to be sitting here next to her with her daughters was just great fun. ""And that she's so supportive of the Arthur Ashe Learning Center and so supportive of Arthur's legacy. ""I don't think we could have asked for a better situation that day, it was just wonderful."" Moutoussamy Ashe was sharing her experiences with former American Davis Cup star James Blake, who has recently retired from the ATP Tour. Blake told her that Ashe has been his idol and inspiration growing up. ""Being an African American playing tennis, his impact on me was great and I wanted to follow in his footsteps, being someone that went to college and was educated and had such a great influence on the world,"" he said. The impact that Blake talks about went far beyond the narrow confines of professional sport. Ashe once famously said ""I don't want to be remembered for my tennis accomplishments"" and Moutoussamy Ashe has done her level best to promote his wish. ""The game of tennis really just gave him a platform to speak about the issues that he cared so much about,"" she said. ""I think he was a role model for a whole lot of kids which is why his legacy is so important to promote today. ""We don't want a whole generation of kids today and generations to come to not know that he was more than a tennis player."" Born in 1943, Ashe was brought up in the segregated South in Richmond, Virginia and first tested his tennis skills on a blacks only playground in the city. He developed his talent in high school and earned a tennis scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1963, that year becoming the first African American to represent the United States in the Davis Cup. A member of the Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC), Ashe was eventually required to do military service and spent three years in the United States Military Academy at West Point, rising to the rank of second lieutenant. Ashe was still a serving officer when he won his first grand slam title at the 1968 U.S. Open, the first of the Open Era when professionals were also allowed to compete. ""He wasn't just the first African American male to win the U.S. Open but he actually was the first American period to win the U.S. Open because the U.S. Open didn't begin until 1968,"" Moutoussamy Ashe emphasizes. Ashe was discharged from the Army in 1969 and after winning his second grand slam crown at the 1970 Australian Open turned professional. A prominent supporter of the American civil rights movement, Ashe's political principles were tested when he was denied a visa by the apartheid government of South Africa to compete in their national open later that year. Ashe campaigned for South Africa to be excluded from the International Tennis Federation but although his demands were not met, he was eventually allowed a visa to compete in the 1973 South African Open, the first black male to do so. Ashe continued to speak out against the apartheid regime and after Nelson Mandela was released having served 27 years in prison, the tennis star returned to South Africa in 1991 as a member of a 31-strong delegation to observe the profound political changes in the country. He met Mandela several times and modestly observed: ""Compared to Mandela's sacrifice, my own life has been one almost of self-indulgence. When I think of him, my own political efforts seem puny."" But others would disagree. Andrew Young, the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, once famously said of Ashe: ""He took the burden of race and wore it as a cloak of dignity."" Young, a pastor turned leading politician, presided over Ashe's wedding to Jeanne in 1977 after they had met at a charity event just six months previously where Moutoussamy Ashe was attending as a working photographer. Ashe was by then a three-time grand slam singles champion having shocked top seed Jimmy Connors in a epic 1975 Wimbledon final, but it was to prove his last as injury and eventual illness took their toll. The world was shocked in 1979 when the super-fit Ashe suffered a heart attack and underwent a bypass operation. He was set to return to the tennis tour when further complications arose and he was forced to announce his retirement, doing it in typically fastidious fashion. ""He had about 30 letters that he had written individually to people, contracts that he had, promises and commitments he had to people, he just wrote them personally and said 'I'm retiring and I want you to be the first to know,'"" recalled Moutoussamy Ashe. In retirement, he took over as captain of the United States Davis Cup team, but in 1983 he had to undergo a second round of heart surgery in New York. It was during his operation that Ashe is believed to have contracted the HIV virus from infected blood transfusions. He learned of the diagnosis in 1988 after another health scare, but for the sake of their adopted two-year old daughter Camera, Ashe and his wife kept the illness private. Only in 1992 was he forced to go public and true to his ideals began campaigning to debunk myths about AIDS and the way it is contracted. He founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of Aids to build on the work of an institute he had set up to promote public health. Ashe completed his memoir Days of Grace, finished shortly before his death on February 6, 1993 from AIDS-related pneumonia. For Blake the book was an inspiration. ""As soon as I read Days of Grace it has always been my answer to what's your favorite book of all time,"" he told Moutoussamy Ashe. Young officiated at Ashe's funeral in Richmond, which was attended by thousands of mourners. He was buried alongside his mother, Mattie, who died in 1950 when he was just six years of age. Later in the year that he died, Ashe was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton. It was the first of a string of high profile honors in recognition of a truly remarkable man, but for his widow, who has carried his torch now for so many years, it is his impact on communities and the younger generation which is so important. ""I think if Arthur were here today, he would promote tennis on a grass roots level, drawing that metaphor that tennis not just a sport but more importantly a profession that might be able to get you a college scholarship to get you through school,"" she said. Others like Blake and Mal Washington followed in Ashe's footsteps on the male side of the men's game, but Moutoussamy Ashe is equally delighted by the impact the Williams' sisters have had on African American sport. ""Venus and Serena, I'm so proud of what they are both doing. Venus has her challenges yet she's moving her life forward and still stays very involved in the game of tennis whenever she can. ""Serena has been I think on top form, not just in tennis but as a person during this particular U.S. Open,"" she added, reflecting on the World No.1's 17th grand slam crown. Moutoussamy Ashe is hoping the Arthur Ashe Learning Center, which contains a wealth of her own photographs and memorabilia collected over his life, can find a permanent home. ""It's really important that not just today's generation but generations to come understand him as more than just an athlete, as more than just a patient, as more than just a student and a coach. ""That they'll understand the importance of being a well-rounded human being, that you might not be a great champion but if you're a well-rounded human being then you can do just about anything to succeed in life."" Ashe himself is the perfect example of that, battling his modest background and an undercurrent of prejudice to achieve the highest honor that can be bestowed on an individual in the United States. ""Racism is not an excuse to not do the best you can,"" Ashe said and he stands eloquent testimony to the truth of his words.","Arthur Ashe won three grand slam titles .

"Lake Zakher, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- In a remote corner of the United Arab Emirates, a blue lake shimmers amid the sand dunes. It's not a mirage, but a man-made oasis -- an unintended byproduct of the UAE's water management practices, which has sprung from the desert in recent years. Opinion is divided over this unexpected phenomenon, known locally as Lake Zakher. Huw Roberts is a university lecturer who has been an avid birdwatcher in the Gulf region for nearly two decades. ""This is one of the best sites in the UAE for birds,"" he said. ""It's a good habitat for wintering birds and birds on passage."" To Roberts, Lake Zakher has reliably proved something of a birdwatcher's paradise, with herons, flamingos and stilts among the rich diversity of species drawn to this rare water source. He has been coming to the lake for seven years to photograph the birds, insects and reptiles and add them to WildlifeUAE -- his photographic inventory of nearly 600 species of the country's wildlife. But to others, like Brigitte Howarth, an ecologist at the UAE's Zayed University, Lake Zakher is an environmental calamity. ""This lake to me is a bit of an ecological disaster because we really don't understand how it's affecting all the various species that do live naturally within this environment,"" she said. ""If you suddenly create an artificial situation, where many other species benefit, it is the species that have been here for millions of years that then suffer."" Read more: Beauty and the beast - a camel pageant in the UAE . The lake is an industrial byproduct of the desalination system used to meet the UAE's water needs. With few sources of fresh water in the region, the country has relied on desalinating seawater for domestic use -- a technology that has been essential to the country's growth, according to advocates. ""Desalination started here 50 years ago,"" said Corrado Sommariva, president of the International Desalination Association. ""There wouldn't be any development of the industry or society if there was no desalination."" The waste water is treated and just over half reused for industrial purposes, according Mohamed Al Madfaei, executive director at the Abu Dhabi Environmental Agency. But the other 45% of recycled waste water was simply discharged at sea or released on to the land, where it had been pushing up groundwater levels, and eventually resulted in the creation of Lake Zakher. Watch: Oman banks on its history . Desalination has increased as the UAE's population has grown, bringing with it other unwanted environmental impacts. The process is energy-intensive, and releases brine into the surrounding ocean, which has the potential to harm marine life. As a result, the government is encouraging people to reduce consumption, and put excess water to better use. ""People can reduce their water consumption, be more wise when it comes to water use,"" said Al Madfaei. ""When washing your car, instead of using a hose, maybe use a bucket. When it comes to the agriculture sector... we are looking to reduce our consumption, and increasing the use of treated water in those areas as well."" It's an approach that will help improve the UAE's environmental sustainability, but could spell the end of the already shrinking Lake Zakher, to the dismay of Roberts and his fellow birdwatchers. ""I'd be very disappointed if Zakher Lake disappeared,"" said Roberts. ""I'm hoping it doesn't.""","A lake has emerged amid the sand dunes in the United Arab Emirates .
It is a result of recycled waste water dumped from the UAE's water management system .
It attracts a wide variety of wildlife, delighting birdwatchers .
But desert ecologists consider the lake an environmental disaster ."
"(CNN) -- Aaaand ... take 2! Not one to give up, director Quentin Tarantino has filed an amended lawsuit against the gossip website Gawker for linking to the leaked screenplay for his next movie, ""Hateful Eight."" Last month, a federal judge dismissed his original suit, ruling that Tarantino had failed to prove that Gawker's actions was direct copyright infringement. The judge, John F. Walter of the Central District of California, then gave Tarantino's lawyers until Thursday to refile. And so, they did. And they're seeking more than $1 million. Tarantino's lawyers are arguing that Gawker encouraged a reader to 'leak' a copy of the screenplay, downloaded it, and then made it available to the public by linking to it. ""Gawker has made a business of predatory journalism, violating people's rights to make a buck,"" the amended lawsuit says. ""This time they went too far."" How it all began . ""Hateful Eight"" is a Western that Tarantino said he was hoping to take on as his next project. It's in the same genre as his 2012 hit ""Django Unchained,"" a movie that won him an Oscar for writing and a Golden Globe for best screenplay. He told the gossip site Deadline that he'd given the script to only six people, including actors Michael Madsen, best known as the killer in Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs;"" and Tim Roth, for whom ""Reservoir Dogs"" was his breakthrough role. Somehow, the script leaked. It was posted through a site that lets users anonymously upload and download files. In January, Gawker linked to the website hosting the script. ""Here Is the Leaked Quentin Tarantino Hateful Eight Sript,"" the headline on the story read. Although Gawker didn't post the script to its own site, Tarantino's lawyers charged the script wouldn't have been widely accessible if Gawker hadn't linked to it. ""Rather than merely publishing a news story reporting that plaintiff's screenplay may have been circulating within certain limited Hollywood circles without his permission, Gawker crossed the journalistic line, first by requesting that a reader 'leak' an infringing copy directly to Gawker, then second, after obtaining a link to and itself directly downloading an infringing PDF copy, and then third, by promoting itself to the public as the first source to download and read the entire screenplay illegally and directing the public to do so."" Tarantino sued. What happened next . Gawker responded saying Tarantino's suit was without merit. It wasn't guilty of actual copyright infringement. The judge agreed. On April 22, he threw out the original suit, saying Tarantino's lawyers had failed to prove ""direct infringement."" Now, comes the amended suit. Tarantino's lawyers are claiming both direct and contributory infringement. What's happening now . The question before the judge now is this: Does a site that downloads copyrighted material violate the rights of an author? Whether the ""Hateful Eight"" project is indeed scrapped is unclear. Last last month,Tarantino held a three-hour reading of the script and told audience members he was working on changes to it. He said making the film is still possible. For now, though, there's the lawsuit to contend with. Lights, camera, (legal) action! CNN's Alan Duke, Gregory Wallace and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Last month, a federal judge dismissed his original suit .
The suit seeks more than $1 million .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- Hundreds of demonstrators were in the streets Thursday in locales around Iraq, inspired by uprisings elsewhere in the region as they railed against the government's inability to provide basic services and complained of food, water and power shortages, officials said. The biggest demonstration took place in al Hamza, a relatively poor town in a heavily Shiite region about 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Baghdad. Two Iraqi interior ministry officials -- who, per policy, did not speak by name due to security concerns -- estimated that that nearly 1,000 people participated. The protesters walked toward a local council building, trying to force their way in as they hurled rocks inside the compound and at police outside, the Iraqi Interior Ministry officials said. Some were heard shouting, ""We've had enough"" and ""Where are your promises."" Iraqi police opened fire, ostensibly to disperse the crowd, and wounded three protesters in the process, the officials said. Four others were hurt while skirmishing with police outside the council building. Eventually, tribal and civic leaders intervened to end the demonstration, the officials said. Some of the protesters carried items such as water tubes and oil lanterns to demonstrate a lack of basic services like water and reliable power. Abu Sajad, a protester, said that sewage had flooded the small town's streets after heavy rain in recent days, and he complained that ""the government hasn't done anything to solve it"" even though it happens every year. ""We've suffered a lot from bad services in the town,"" Fadhil Hussein, a 50-year-old protester, told CNN. ""One government comes and another leaves, and nothing has changed in this town for decades."" Dozens of protesters in Kut, part of another predominantly Shiite province about 110 kilometers south of Baghdad, Thursday demanded the resignation of Wasit's provincial governor, Latif Hamed, according to a Wasit police official and an Iraqi Interior Ministry official. These were the latest in a string of demonstrations around Iraq, mostly emphasizing the same themes -- low-quality public services and a dearth of basic commodities. That was the case Monday, when dozens of protesters took to the street in northern Baghdad's al-Husseinya district. A day earlier, nearly 200 Iraqis demonstrated in two locations in Baghdad to show solidarity with those in Egyptian rallying against their President Hosni Mubarak and to criticize their own leaders. They included about 100 people who gathered in Firdos Square in the city center, near where U.S. troops in 2004 pulled down a giant statue of former dictator Saddam Hussein. They referenced what was happening in Egypt, as well as their hope that their own government would take steps to improve Iraqis' security, increase basic services and pursue policies to create more jobs. Figures compiled by Iraq's Defense, Interior and Health ministries indicate that 259 people -- 159 civilians, 55 police and 45 soldiers -- were killed in January 2011. The figures also show that 363 people were wounded in January --178 civilians , 95 police and 90 soldiers. Meanwhile, Iraq's national unemployment rate is around 45%. ""We have suffered more than any other country in the past eight years, and it is time for Iraq's government to take serious steps to end our suffering,"" said one demonstrator, Qassim Harith. ""We are here to support our brothers in Egypt, but also to give a message to Iraqi politicians and to the Iraqi government that Iraqis are losing patience."" Elsewhere in Baghdad on Sunday, another 100 people rallied just outside the heavily fortified Green Zone that houses Iraqi government offices and the U.S. and British embassies. They, too, called for government to improve basic services and not to evacuate them from government buildings and institutions. Some carried a coffin draped in a black sheet that read ""The share of the Iraqi."" ""We sacrifice our blood and souls for Iraq,"" the protesters shouted. Iraqi security forces, from the army and police, sported machine guns as they surrounded the demonstrators. Some of the protesters said they were emboldened by the overthrow of Tunisia's long-time president, which began after Muhammad Al Bouazizi, a 26-year-old college graduate, set himself afire after a police officer seized the goods from his fruit stand. That popular uprising has been followed by anti-government demonstrations in Algeria, Yemen and Jordan as well as Egypt. ""Of course we have been inspired and what has happened because of a street vendor, who sparked the uprising in Tunis and now in Egypt,"" Hani Sabri, one Baghdad protester, told CNN.","Hundreds protest in al Hamza, an Iraqi town, over a lack of basic services and shortages .
7 are wounded in confrontations with police outside a council building, officials say .
Dozens also demonstrate in the central Iraqi city of Kut, according to officials .
These anti-government protests follow similar ones Sunday and Monday in Baghdad ."

"SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (CNN) -- The outbreak of war seemed like a joke to Jasmina, then just 19 years old. She dreamed of being an economist and says she played with her toddler son and baby daughter as if they were toys. Jasmina says she was raped repeatedly during the rule of Radovan Karadzic: ""Every day we were raped."" But in April 1992, the Serb soldiers took over her city of Bijeljina, in northeast Bosnia near the border with Serbia, and began to kill, torture and terrorize the Muslims there in a brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing. ""Whole families were disappearing during the night. Sometimes we could see their bodies in the gardens, sometimes not even that,"" Jasmina said. ""The men from my family were beaten up the first day. ... My mother just disappeared. I never found out what happened."" Paramilitaries loyal to Arkan, the Serbian ultranationalist later indicted for crimes against humanity, came to the home Jasmina shared with her husband and extended family to search for valuables and weapons. When they found no guns they started beating her husband, said Jasmina who asked CNN not to use her last name to protect her children. ""Then they started torturing me. I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I was totally naked and covered in blood, and my sister-in-law was also naked and covered in blood. ... I knew I had been raped, and my sister-in-law, too."" In a corner, she saw her mother-in-law, holding her children and crying. ""That same day we were locked in our house. That was the worst, the worst period of my whole life. That's when it started. ""Every day we were raped. Not only in the house -- they would also take us to the front line for the soldiers to torture us. Then again in the house, in front of the children,"" Jasmina said through a translator, remembering the 10 other women who were brutalized with her. ""I was in such a bad condition that sometimes I couldn't even recognize my own children. Even though I was in a very bad physical condition they had no mercy at all. They raped me every day. They took me to the soldiers and back to that house. ""The only conversation we had was when I was begging them to kill me. That's when they laughed. Their response was 'we don't need you dead.' "" Once at the front line, there were female soldiers who tortured her with a bottle and then slashed at her throat and wrist when it broke. Then the troops cut one of her breasts with a bayonet, said Jasmina, now looking older than her 35 years. ""It lasted for a year. Every day. ... Not all the women survived."" Tens of thousands of women were raped in Bosnia and the other parts of the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 1994 during the rule of Radovan Karadzic, according to estimates by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  See a timeline of Karadzic's rule » . Karadzic was captured this week after years on the run and now will face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The tribunal, set up to try war crimes suspects, established for the first time that rape was a crime against humanity and that rape was ""used by members of the Bosnian Serb armed forces as an instrument of terror."" For Jasmina, some relief came one day in 1993 when a familiar face, an older Serb who had been a friend of her parents, appeared at the house where she was being kept. Jasmina was told he had bought her as a prostitute but, once in a car with him, the man said he was saving her. ""I owe this to your parents,"" he said. He drove Jasmina and her children to the front lines, gave something to the Serb soldiers there and directed her toward the Bosnian position, saying, ""now you are free to go."" ""I was very weak. I weighed only 45 kilos [99 pounds]. I carried both my children for more than a kilometer to the Bosnian side."" Jasmina was safe but scarred. ""I felt ashamed. I wanted to die, to disappear somehow. I couldn't take care of my children; others did that. I just didn't have the strength or the will."" A new low came when doctors began to treat her in one of the refugee centers around the city of Tuzla. ""They discovered that I was pregnant, six months pregnant, and I didn't know that. It was too late for any abortion, but I kept saying I didn't want that child."" The gynecologist pleaded with Jasmina to have the child and give it up for adoption, saying it was too dangerous to try anything else. But that was no option for Jasmina. ""I didn't want to hear about that, about giving birth to that child at all."" Finally, medics said they could try to abort the child but it was a very risky operation that only one in 100 women would survive. ""I begged them to do it,"" Jasmina said, pausing to remember an 18-year-old girl who had the same operation on the same day as her and died. Jasmina herself continues to have gynecological health problems stemming from her abuse. Months later, her husband arrived at the same refugee center after managing to escape a camp in Serbia. A man he broke out with was killed by a mine. ""It was such a difficult moment for me. I wasn't even sure if I wanted him to be dead or alive. I knew that he knew what had happened to me, so it was very, very difficult for me,"" Jasmina said. ""I thought he was going to leave me and take my children because of everything that happened. But he told me he was not going to ask me about anything. And that he also went through terrible things himself, so he didn't want to discuss anything."" Yet still she says she cannot look her husband in the eye. Jasmina said she was unable to talk to the therapists in Tuzla and tried to kill herself in 1995, the first of three suicide attempts. ""I will never be OK,"" she said, adding that she believes God kept her alive for a reason. She now lives in a modestly furnished apartment in a tower block in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. She has been there since 2001 with her husband and children. Her dreams now are for her children. She believes it's crucial she give them some stability but says that's impossible when she doesn't know from day to day whether she will be evicted. She does not own the apartment, and all property must be returned to rightful owners under the terms of an annex to the U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the war. The same pact allows for the return of all refugees and displaced people -- more than half of the country's people left their homes during the war, according to the International Organization for Migration -- and the re-establishment of the mixed ethnic communities that had lived peacefully for centuries before the war. The Office of the High Representative for Bosnia-Herzegovina, an international body set up to oversee the implementation of the peace agreements, says almost all property rights have been restored. But it is impossible to say how many people have gone home and how many have sold their houses, leaving cities and towns like Bijeljina ""ethnically cleansed,"" as the warmongers had planned. A law enacted in September 2006 does include a section that says homes should be provided for victims of sexual torture during the war. It is not clear who should implement the act, and there is no agency making sure the law is enforced, according to the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees. Meanwhile, authorities say Jasmina should return to her mother-in-law's rebuilt house in Bijeljina. But she says she will never go back to the place where she lost 39 members of her family and where her abuse began. It is a fear shared by other women, according to Alisa Muratcaus, the president of the Association of Concentration Camp Survivors -- Canton Sarajevo -- a group that offers classes and other support to Jasmina and 1,200 other women across the capital, including 150 victims of mass rape. ""Many of our members must deal with the realities of return. Not all members are able psychologically to return to regions in which they suffered such extreme human rights abuses,"" she said. ""No one raped woman has returned to their pre-war houses, since it is immoral and inhuman to request their return while the war criminals who tortured them are still free and live in these regions."" The Sarajevo municipality that owns Jasmina's apartment says that it does not plan to evict her and that any such directive would come from the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees. Saliha Djuderija, head of the Ministry's Department of Human Rights, said she was aware of victims who could not face returning to the places where they were tortured and was working on a solution. In the past couple of years, between 15 and 20 women have been given somewhere to live, but lack of funding is restricting the help that can be given. Priority was given to women who testified against their attackers, and Jasmina is not in that group, as her case is still unsolved. But if her future is in doubt, Jasmina's mind is made up. ""I'm not going to take my children to Bijeljina. I told my children when I die, don't take my bones to Bijeljina. I don't want to hear about Bijeljina. It doesn't exist for me,"" she said, flashing anger for the first time in a lengthy interview.

"(CNN) -- The United Nations official overseeing efforts to help Iraq's many displaced people said Monday the country could be at a turning point. ""This new government represents an enormous opportunity for Iraq, but also for our work,"" said Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, on his first visit to Iraq since the country formed a new government in December. ""I hope today we are marking the beginning of the end of the displacement chapter in Iraq."" There are 196,000 Iraqis registered as refugees with UNHCR, mainly in neighboring Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, the agency said in a news release. The UNHCR also ""estimates there are about 1.3 million internally displaced Iraqis, and some 500,000 of them living in extremely precarious conditions."" Guterres met with top Iraqi leaders, including President Jalal Talabani, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and Minister of Foreign Affairs Hoshyar Zebari. He proposed ""a government-led national plan of action"" to create the conditions that would allow Iraqis to return home, the UNHCR said. But Guterres stressed that returning to Iraq should be voluntary. ""To force people to return home against their will where insecurity prevails is unacceptable,"" Guterres said. The UNHCR said it was a reference to recent deportations of Iraqis from a number of European countries. Sweden last week defended its decision to deport 26 Iraqi asylum-seekers. The country said the European Court of Human Rights supports a Swedish immigration court's ruling that an asylum-seeker from Iraq would have to show an individual threat directed toward him or her. The UNHCR said several of the men deported from Sweden were from Iraq's volatile provinces -- Baghdad, Diyala, Salaheddin, Nineveh and Kirkuk. Last year, western European countries deported more than 400 Iraqis, according to the UNHCR. In June, the UNHCR announced that a milestone had been reached, with 100,000 Iraqi refugees approved for resettlement.","The U.N. high commissioner for refugees meets with top Iraqi officials .

"(CNN) -- The parents of two former schoolmates of Kendrick Johnson's have filed a $5 million slander and libel lawsuit in federal court against the publisher of Ebony magazine and writer Frederic Rosen. The lawsuit, dated Wednesday, claims that stories written by Rosen and published in Ebony magazine and on Ebony.com imply that the brothers played a part in Johnson's death and their father was involved in a conspiracy to cover it up. The claim that the brothers played any part in the death ""is completely untrue,"" according to the lawsuit. Johnson, 17, was found dead in the center of a rolled-up gym mat at Lowndes High School in Valdosta, Georgia, in January 2013. The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office determined that his death was an accident and closed its investigation in May 2013. Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson believe that their son was beaten to death and that investigators have covered up his murder. The U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation into Johnson's death and into the local investigation in October. The federal investigation is pending. Rosen's reporting on Johnson's death has been removed from Ebony.com . Johnson Publishing Inc. and Rosen declined to comment on the lawsuit.

"(CNN) -- Knowledge is said to be power. But as parents living in an information-driven age, we feel compelled to grasp all of the facts that bombard us. We are hyperinformed and ultraconscientious. We surf the Web, we read the books, we poll our friends. Yet in accumulating new insights, we are often left feeling confused and uncertain. The most vexing parenting decision my husband and I have faced thus far was whether to circumcise our son. Religious tradition was not a factor for us, as non-Jews, so instead we searched our consciences, weighing myriad factors such as aesthetics, tradition, hygiene, future sexual pleasure, and self-esteem -- lofty concepts indeed to contemplate for the unnamed bulge in my tummy, but contemplate them we did. This is why one evening, while bathing my 5-year-old son, I was thrown into a bubbly contemplative haze as he looked down at himself and shouted, ""I hate my foreskin!"" This was certainly not a sentence I ever imagined coming out of his mouth, but there it was. (And yes, he knows the actual word.) He slid the skin on top of his penis to make himself appear circumcised. Had we made the wrong decision? Some families do to their son whatever was done to the child's father so father and son will look alike. In our case, my husband's father was not circumcised due to a premature birth, and my husband was. My husband never felt particularly disturbed that he and his father were different in that area, so again, we were on our own. Empowered Patient: Should teens make own circumcision decision? Our Los Angeles pediatrician, for whom we have great respect, Dr. Kimberly Klausner, had been very neutral on the subject. She told us that about half of the boys in her Beverly Hills practice were circumcised. She reiterated the American Academy of Pediatrics statement of 1999, which states: ""Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision; however, these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."" Also worth noting is that not all health insurance companies cover routine circumcision. So religiously, cosmetically, and medically, there seemed to be no compelling reason for us to circumcise. At that point, I was at a loss -- no, not penis envy, but I had never seen an uncircumcised penis. Yet to circumcise simply because that was familiar to me seemed unfair to my son. My husband, in weighing the arguments, kept coming back to an encounter we had with Dr. Paul Fleiss, one of the pediatricians that we had initially interviewed when choosing a doctor years before. Fleiss wrote the book, ""What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Circumcision."" He is the country's leading pediatric advocate for not circumcising. His writings stressed the significance of foreskin in sexual pleasure, pointing out that ""the foreskin is an organ"" that contains ""a rich concentration of blood vessels and nerve endings."" As I considered that, my mind flashed to my liberal arts college's Women's Studies classes' literature about female circumcision being used in some countries for the precise reason of decreasing sexual pleasure. We would never in a million years consider circumcising a girl, so why should we do so to our son? We chose not to. Until the bubble bath incident, I had been comfortable with our decision, even secretly proud of it. I had a small moment of panic in 2006 when a National Institutes of Health AIDS study discussing circumcision as a significant factor in AIDS prevention in Africa was reported in The New York Times. I hoped the medical community wasn't going to change its mind, as by then my son was already 2, his foreskin intact. When he was 4, I noticed he very often he retracted his foreskin, and once while so doing said, ""Look, Mommy, like Sam."" Sam was a circumcised friend whom he had seen while changing clothes. I realized that most of the boys my son had seen naked -- cousins and friends at preschool -- looked different. Most were circumcised, including his father. Why, I wondered, were all these other boys circumcised? I decided to informally poll a few moms to find out how they decided. Hilary, in her work as a journalist, had seen an inadequately skilled first-year resident perform the procedure. She vowed that should she ever have sons, she would not circumcise. Years later, her Jewish husband told her that ""he wanted his son to have the chance to be Jewish."" Hilary deferred to that. She chose a mohel who had circumcised 10,000 boys to do the procedure. Yet she said she had to leave the house during the bris. Hilary said when she read about the NIH AIDS study in 2006, she was delighted to learn there could be additional public health benefits to circumcision. Liza told me that she regrets having her son circumcised. ""It was hard for us to justify doing it other than that it was something that he (my husband) and I understood."" Her son's circumcision was botched. The doctor had trouble with the clamp in the procedure, and, at 3 months old, her son had to have surgery by a urologist in order to be re-circumcised. Another friend, Alison, said, ""I always said that the penis was his (her husband's) department. He wanted our son to look like him. But I am really glad my son was circumcised. It is hard enough to get him to wash at all, so if there were one more layer to it, I can't imagine."" Finally, I asked Klausner again, as I knew she recently had her own son. She told me: ""I had him circumcised for religious reasons, in a very traditional service. I felt very uncomfortable about it, but it was a faith-based decision, not a rational, medical one. If it were not part of my faith, I don't think I would do it."" Back to the bubble bath: After my son stopped screaming I told him that Mommy and Daddy had made the best decision about his body they could, because he was too little to ask. ""We didn't want them to cut your body when you were a tiny baby,"" I explained. Then, I cringed imagining him at the pool asking some unsuspecting circumcised boy why his parents would let them cut his body when he was a tiny baby. Confronting our circumcision decision over and over has been humbling. My one conclusion: In parenting, and in life, there is never a clear answer. Most big decisions are based in faith, be it religious faith or faith in ourselves. If we have either of those as parents, then no matter which way the trend swings, or what the studies prove over time, we can, at the very least, live with the knowledge that we did what we thought was the best for our children. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lee Rose Emery.","Couple considered religion, medicine and aesthetics in circumcision decision .

"(CNN) -- By now, you likely know David Seidler, who won an Oscar on Sunday for best original screenplay for ""The King's Speech,"" was a stutterer just like King George VI, whose battle with the speech disorder is portrayed in the film. What you might not know is that Seidler, 73, suffered from cancer, just like the king did. But unlike his majesty, Seidler survived the cancer, and he says he did so because he used the same vivid imagination he employed to write his award-winning script. Seidler says he visualized his cancer away. ""I know it sounds awfully Southern California and woo-woo,"" he admits when he describes the visualization techniques he used when his bladder cancer was diagnosed nearly six years ago. ""But that's what happened."" Seidler says when he found out his cancer had returned, he visualized a ""lovely, clean healthy bladder"" for two weeks, and the cancer disappeared. He's been cancer-free for more than five years. Whether you can imagine away cancer, or any other disease, has been hotly debated for years. One camp of doctors will tell you that they've seen patients do it, and that a whole host of studies supports the mind-body connection. Other doctors, just as well-respected, will tell you the notion is preposterous, and there's not a single study to prove it really works. Seidler isn't concerned about studies. He says all he knows is that for him, visualization worked. ""Mucus and salty tears"" ""When I was first diagnosed in 2005, I was rather upset, of course,"" Seidler says in a telephone interview from his home in Malibu, California.  ""After three to four days of producing a lot of mucus and salty tears, I knew prolonged grief was bad for the autoimmune system, and the autoimmune system was the only buddy I had in fighting cancer."" Seidler said that's when he decided to sit down and write the screenplay for ""The King's Speech,"" which had been simmering in his brain for many years. ""I thought, if I throw myself into the creative process, I can't be sitting around feeling sorry for myself,"" he says. After consulting with California urologist Dr. Dino DeConcini, Seidler decided not to have chemotherapy or have all or part of his bladder removed, common treatments for bladder cancer. Instead, he opted for surgery to remove just the cancer itself, and he took supplements meant to enhance his immune system. ""For years, whenever I walked down the stairs I rattled like a pair of maracas, I had so many pills in me,"" he says. Despite his best efforts, the cancer came back within months. Seidler was forced to rethink his decision not to have chemotherapy or bladder surgery. Envisioning ""a nice, cream-colored unblemished bladder"" As his doctor booked an appointment for surgery two weeks later, Seidler commiserated with his soon-to-be-ex-wife, and it was a comment from her that gave him the idea to try to visualize his cancer disappearing. ""She said, 'Well, what happens if in two weeks they go in and there's no cancer?' "" he remembers. ""I thought to myself that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. This woman's in total denial."" But later, reflecting upon her comments, Seidler thought perhaps she might be on to something -- perhaps it would be possible for his cancer to just disappear while he waited for surgery. Figuring he had nothing to lose, for the next two weeks he imagined a clean bladder. ""I spent hours visualizing a nice, cream-colored unblemished bladder lining, and then I went in for the operation, and a week later the doctor called me and his voice was very strange,"" Seidler remembers. ""He said, 'I don't know how to explain it, but there's no cancer there.' He says the doctor was so confounded he sent the tissue from the presurgical biopsy to four different labs, and all confirmed they were cancerous. Seidler says the doctor couldn't explain how it had happened. But Seidler could. He says he believes the supplements and visualizations were behind what his doctor called a ""spontaneous remission"" -- plus a change in his way of thinking. He stopped feeling sorry for himself because of his cancer and his impending divorce. ""I was very grief-stricken,"" he remembers. ""It was a 30-year marriage, and in my grief, I could tell I was getting sicker. I decided to just change my head around."" ""The mind has the power to heal"" While Seidler says he knows his unorthodox recovery techniques sound ""woo-woo"" to some ears, they sound ""like science"" to Dr. Christiane Northrup, a best-selling author who's written extensively on the mind-body connection. ""This doesn't sound woo-woo to me,"" she says. ""The mind has the power to heal."" She says by moving himself ""from fear and abject terror into action,"" Seidler changed his body's chemistry. ""Fear increases cortisol and epinephrine in the body, which over time lower immunity,"" she says. High levels of the two stress hormones lead to cellular inflammation, which is the way cancer begins, Northrup says. Taking action, as Seidler eventually did, decreases the hormones. ""Hope is actually a biochemical reaction in the body,"" she says. Dr. Bernie Siegel, author of ""Love, Medicine & Miracles,"" says it's the same way an athlete uses visualization to improve performance. ""When an athlete visualizes success, their body really is experiencing success. When you imagine something, your body really feels like it's happening,"" says Siegel, a retired clinical assistant professor of surgery at Yale Medical School. But Dr. Marcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, calls the mind-body connection a ""new religion"" that encourages false hope. ""There is something so biologically implausible that your attitude is going to cure a disease,"" says Angell, a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""There's a tremendous arrogance to imagine that your mind is all that powerful."" She says stories like Seidler's are just that -- only stories and not proof that the mind-body connection is real. Some other part of the patient's treatment plan likely explains success against the disease, or in other cases, the success is temporary and part of the natural course of the disease. For example, she says bladder cancer often returns. ""You beat it down, and it comes back, and you beat it down, and it comes back,"" she says. ""If [Seidler] had bladder cancer, this may very well not be the end of the story."" More heart attacks on Mondays . While Angell points out there are no large-scale studies showing visualization can treat disease, there are studies that seem to indicate what happens in your mind has an effect on your body. For example, several studies have shown heart attacks occur more often on Mondays, presumably because people are under increased stress returning to work after the weekend. Another set of studies shows how you perceive yourself affects your health. In research done by the Yale School of Public Health and the National Institute of Aging, young people who had positive perceptions about aging were less likely to have a heart attack or stroke when they grew older. In another study by researchers at Yale and Miami University, middle aged and elderly people lived seven years longer if they had a positive perception about aging. In 2008, Harvard researchers published a study where they told a group of hotel chambermaids their daily cleaning activities counted as exercise and were equivalent to working out at a gym. A month later, these chambermaids had lost weight and lowered their blood pressure without changing anything, yet chambermaids who weren't told about the benefits of their daily work had no such changes. ""It's so damned obvious that your attitude effects survival,"" says Siegel, the retired Yale surgeon. But Angell disagrees. To her, these studies show very little. ""It's a huge leap from these studies to saying you can imagine your way out of cancer,"" she says. A visualization guide . Whether you're convinced of the effects of visualization or not, Northrup says there's no harm in trying them, as long as you realize that like any other treatment, visualization might not work. There's no definitive guide to visualization, but Siegel, who's instructed his patients in imaging for many years, has a few suggestions. First, he says to draw a picture of four things: yourself, your health problem, your treatment and your body eliminating your problem. These pictures might tell you what sort of imagery would work best for you. For example, when one of Siegel's patients drew her disease as 10 cancer cells next to one white blood cell, he suggested she visualize her body making more white blood cells. Second, he says to know yourself. One religious patient of his had been visualizing dogs attacking and eating up her cancer, which didn't work, so instead she pictured her tumor as a block of ice and God's light melting it away, which he says was more effective. Third, he suggests not visualizing anything violent, since most of us aren't violent by nature. ""Children don't mind being violent, and they'll visualize blasting away cancer, and that's fine, but most adults don't like to kill, so that's not an image they're comfortable with,"" he says. He remembers one patient who was a Quaker and a pacifist, and quickly rejected any notion of ""killing"" or ""beating"" cancer. Instead, he pictured white blood cells carrying cancer cells away, and he beat his cancer.","Seidler, 73, who just won an Oscar, was told he had bladder cancer .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the Secret Service, there is pre-Kennedy and post-Kennedy. The shots fired by Lee Harvey Oswald that killed President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, set in motion a series of reforms to the Secret Service, the agency in charge of protecting America's most powerful leaders. In the 50 years since the assassination of America's 35th president, the Secret Service force has increased nearly tenfold and its budget grown by roughly 58% a year. The organization that exists today has 3,400 agents and budget of $1.6 billion, a significant increase from the 350 agents and budget of $5.5 million in 1963, according to Secret Service spokesman Special Agent Brian Leary. ""As the threats change, the Secret Service has changed,"" Leary said. The Warren Commission, established after the Kennedy assassination, created the ""intelligence division"" designed to expand and improve relations with other agencies, including state and local law enforcement and mental health institutions, and the ""technical security division"" that assesses the security of an environment, including air quality and fire safety. In the 1970s the organization expanded to include a counter-sniper unit and counter-assault teams. 50 years on, nation pauses to remember Kennedy's death . The uncovered limousine that Kennedy rode through Dallas a half-century ago is hard to imagine in today. According to former agent Jerry Blaine, who co-wrote ""The Kennedy Detail"" and was with the former president when he was shot, Kennedy chafed at the close proximity of his protective detail and was quoted saying ""Have the Ivy League charlatans drop back to the follow-up car ... we've got an election coming up. The whole point is for me to be accessible to the people."" Today, President Barack Obama is transported in a limousine known as ""The Beast,"" which could be described as an armored safe on wheels. Its doors alone weigh as much as those on a Boeing 757, according to a Discovery Channel special on the Secret Service. Obama has called the car ""a fortified limousine"" and while in Tanzania earlier this year contrasted the current state of presidential travel with that of Robert F. Kennedy, who visited the country while he was a U.S. senator in 1966. JFK assassination a collective memory for American children . ""It was a little different back then. Kennedy and his wife, Ethel, rode in the back of an open truck,"" Obama said at the state house in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania in July. ""The Secret Service has me and Michelle inside a fortified limousine. We call it 'The Beast.' As Kennedy's truck made its way through the crowds, he picked up two boys and let them ride alongside them. The Secret Service doesn't let me do these things."" Leary also pointed to other present-day protocols, including covered arrivals and departures, extensive use of magnetometers and separation from the media, many of which were instituted after the March 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan and designed to increase the safety of America's presidents. For agents who receive months of extensive training, historic events like those targeted attacks on Kennedy and Reagan serve as moments from which to learn. Leary said agents ""learn from all incidents"" to improve upon protective operations, which extend beyond the commander in chief. 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination . Former presidents, their spouses and children were added to the protected list in 1965, major candidates and their spouses in 1968, foreign heads of state in 1971 and the coordination of special events like inaugurations in 1998. The extensive vetting process of presidential site visits, known as ""advance,"" has also grown. Leary described the advance protocols as ""comprehensive"" and said they include close cooperation with state and local officials surrounding everything from the president's arrival at the airport to the motorcade route. It's a process, about which the president references, most recently, at least publicly, at a June fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Miami Beach. ""Opening up your house is a big deal on any occasion. When you've got Secret Service and everybody else running around, moving furniture, potentially bumping into that painting that's probably worth a lot of money ... that makes you more stressed,"" Obama told Democratic donors. ""So can you all please move away from the painting? Just wanted to make that point."" And just as often, a more serious tone from the president about his protection is expressed. ""As president, I get to meet and work with a lot of extraordinary law enforcement officers every single day, from men and women who protect me and my family -- the folks in the Secret Service -- to local police who help out on motorcades in events around the country,"" Obama said at a Top Cops ceremony at the White House in May. ""I'm incredibly grateful that all these law enforcement officers are doing such outstanding work. 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view .","The assassination of JFK set in motion a series of reforms to the Secret Service .

"Washington (CNN) -- The world's military shopping list is being exposed through the WikiLeaks publications. State-of-the-art missiles and American military helicopters are a frequent topic of discussion in the diplomatic cables posted online Sunday by WikiLeaks. The documents show a keen interest in what weaponry Iran has and how to defend against it. One cable found that the United States' planned missile defense system gives the public in Europe ""a false sense of security."" The crown prince of Bahrain, in another cable, seems to support U.S. missile defense systems aimed at Iran. The crown prince said, according to the cable, ""he would like to help further integrate the Gulf states into [the Regional Integrated Air and Missile Defense] project because it would not be enough without everyone's participation."" But the United Arab Emirates' concern about Iran was clearly the most frank. Citing Iran's refusal to scale back its nuclear program and noting that ""there are changes in the region that concern us,"" the chief of staff of the UAE's armed forces told an American ambassador he wanted the U.S. government to deploy between four and five Patriot batteries to the UAE during calendar year 2009, fearful that an Israeli strike on Iran would result in a retaliatory attack on other countries by Iran. America's state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles also garnered a great deal of attention. One cable said Turkey ""requested the sale of armed MQ-9/Reaper UAVs, which will be a challenge to fulfill."" The UAE also wanted UAVs, in particular American Predators, to protect themselves against Iran. One cable said Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who is the apparent crown prince as well as deputy supreme commander of the nation's armed forces, ""again asked about the status of the UAE request to acquire Predator B."" The U.S. general he was meeting with, the cable said, told the prince that the request was being considered. The prince reportedly told the general, ""We are patient,"" but added, ""I hope the Iranians give us time; they are aggressive and are moving fast."" As might be expected, there also is frank discussion in the cables of the diplomatic balancing act that the United States performs with its Arab allies and Israel. An example is the discussion in a meeting between U.S. and Israeli military officials. ""The GOI [government of Israel] continued to express concern over the F-15 sale to Saudi Arabia,"" one cable said. ""The GOI expressed additional concerns about stationing these new aircraft at Tabuk airfield in the northwest corner of Saudi Arabia -- close to the Israeli border."" At the same meeting, the Israelis complained about the sale to Jordan of air-to-air missiles that could pose a threat to Israeli warplanes. The Americans assured the Israelis that new missiles had no greater capabilities than the older version. The cables indicate that U.S. helicopters are in demand by many countries. Yemen, according to one cable, asked Gen. David Petraeus for 12 armed helicopters. The cable said the issue of helicopters was a ""topic that [Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh] would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour-and-half-long meeting."" Turkey not only wants to buy U.S.-designed military helicopters, it wants to build them, too. One cable spelled out a deal that Turkey's leadership was trying to nail down to buy 16 Super Cobra helicopter gunships. The same cable said Turkey wants to buy an international version of the Black Hawk helicopter and wants such copters built in Turkey as well. The company that builds Black Hawks ""guarantees that it would build in Turkey -- for sale outside of Turkey -- one Blackhawk (sic) for each one the GOT (government of Turkey) builds and buys for itself; this is a boon of hundreds of millions of dollars for the Turkish economy,"" the cable said. Not all the discussions revolve other countries buying American weapons systems. Another cable spells out the crown prince of the UAE's ""interest in exploring selling the UAE's 'gyrocopter' [a helicopter-supported UAV co-developed with Austrian company Schiebel] to the U.S. Air Force."" A note from the person who wrote that cable said the United States would be exploring that possibility. Other cables discuss weapons sales between other countries. A message to the U.S. Embassy in Paris notes U.S. anger over a French company's sales to China. ""We have information the French firm Sofradir and its subsidiary ULIS continue to sell cooled and uncooled infrared detectors to a Chinese firm for incorporation into thermal imaging systems. We believe the Chinese firm, Zhejiang Dali Technology Company Ltd., is actively selling its thermal imaging systems to Iranian defense entities."" The cable asks that the French government stop the sales immediately.","Leaked State Department cables show interest in missile defense and UAVs .

"(CNN) -- Here at an international gathering of Japan specialists currently underway in Ljubljana, Slovenia, the actions of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in honoring his country's war criminals have come in for sharp criticism. Nobody attending the European Association of Japanese Studies conference seems surprised, but I have yet to meet anyone who thinks Abe has done Japan any favors. One attendee suggests that, in sending a personal message to a ceremony commemorating Japan's war criminals, Abe has yet again handed a strategic gift to China and South Korea, while making Japan look churlish about its war responsibility. Another said that if Chancellor Angela Merkel made a similar gesture repudiating the verdicts against Nazi war criminals at Nuremburg, her political career would end and Germany would face strong condemnation and isolation in Europe. So yet again Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has scored an own goal on history through sending a message to the ceremony, held at the sacred site of Koya-san in the mountains of Wakayama in April this year. 'Foundation of the fatherland' The site is the heartland of the Shingon sect of Buddhism and is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. The ceremony is held annually at the Okunoin cemetery, where there is a statue inscribed with the names of 1,180 war criminals, including the 14 Class-A war criminals enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo. The statue was erected 20 years ago with the explicit objective of restoring the honor of these war criminals and honoring their sacrifice ""for the foundation of the fatherland."" An inscription on the statue decries the punishment of war criminals by the Allied powers as ""a harsh and retaliatory trial never before seen in the world."" Abe's message was read out at the ceremony on April 29 this year, but only came to light this week. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press conference that the message was not sent in Abe's capacity as prime minister, and as such the government would not comment on it. According to Japanese newspaper the Asahi Shimbun, Abe's message stated: . ""I would like to sincerely express my feelings of remembrance to the spirit of the Showa era martyrs who staked their souls to become the foundation of their nation so that Japan could achieve the peace and prosperity of today."" Defenders of Japan's wartime conduct commonly use the phrase ""Showa era martyrs"" -- which refers to the period of Japanese history corresponding to the 1926-89 reign of Emperor Hirohito -- to refer to the war criminals. This is how they are described at the Yushukan Museum on the grounds of Yasukuni Shrine, the talismanic site for those who seek to glorify Japan's devastating war of imperial aggression in Asia from 1931 to 1945. It is not the first time Abe has sent a message for the Koya-san ceremony. Last year, he wrote: ""I want to establish the existence of a new Japan that would not be an embarrassment to the spirit of the war dead."" Perhaps, but many living Japanese are embarrassed by his efforts to burnish Japan's wartime record. 'Disingenuous' excuse . Abe's spokesman said that his statement, and offerings at Yasukuni Shrine twice this year, were made in his private capacity. Apparently Abe is under the illusion that he can call a timeout as Japan's political leader whenever it suits him. This is disingenuous, but a dubious sleight of hand that Japan's leaders often invoke when trampling on the dignity of Japan's wartime victims. World leaders don't get to declare timeouts. Although most Japanese don't share Abe's enthusiasm for Japan in jackboots, Brand Japan suffers from Abe's revisionist views because he is the nation's leader 24/7 and the world scrutinizes all of his words and gestures. By showing a lack of contrition about the horrific suffering Japan inflicted on much of the rest of Asia, Abe has inflamed tensions with China and South Korea, and left Japan even more isolated. Tokyo's friends in Washington cringe every time Abe lets loose one of his boomeranging salvos on history. Like most Japanese they wonder why Abe can't just stick to Abenomics and leave history to the historians. There are good reasons why Japanese are proud of what Japan has accomplished since 1945 in promoting peace and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific. But by trying to rehabilitate an era when Japan ran amok in Asia, Abe keeps everyone's focus on Japan's embarrassing 20th century misadventures. Abe insists that his door is ""always open"" for dialogue with China and South Korea, but his knack for slamming it in their faces by trying to airbrush the past keeps Japan isolated in northeast Asia. What is he thinking? Why would Abe make such a gesture, given the predictable consequences for Japan's regional relations? It is not just myopia that explains Abe's blunders. Abe is waging a culture war to redefine Japanese national identity, one that he thinks is way too masochistic. He wants to nurture pride and patriotism among Japanese and, for him, that means revising history. Abe is a true believer and his gestures are a message to his political base that he has not given up the fight to overturn the postwar order imposed by the US, including what he views as the unjust verdicts handed down by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, aka the Tokyo Trials. Earlier this year he caved into US pressure to pledge he would not overturn the 1993 Kono Statement in which Japan acknowledges its responsibility for the comfort women system, having earlier made noises that he might do so. Washington is eager to get its two Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, talking again, but this been difficult because Abe's revisionist views on history deeply offend Koreans. Abe's reassurances about the Kono Statement was the minimum necessary to convince President Park Geun-hye to agree to meet with Abe and President Barack Obama in the Netherlands on the sidelines of a nuclear proliferation summit. Chilly reception . But Abe's minor concession got a chilly reception in Seoul. He is known there for his apologist views about the comfort women system and quibbling about the level of coercion used in recruiting tens of thousands of young women to serve as wartime sex slaves for the Japanese armed forces. Moreover, a month after signaling he would not repudiate the Kono Statement, Abe sent his message praising the war criminals. And his supporters in the Diet proceeded with an investigation of the comfort women system aimed at discrediting the Kono Statement, a damaging hit-and-run attack aimed at sowing doubts among Japanese who are showing signs of perpetrator's fatigue and the burdens of war responsibility. The attack was also red meat for Abe's reactionary base. Abe's defiant and unrepentant attitudes towards history are unlikely to change enough to satisfy the neighbors. But will they continue to cold shoulder Japan? President Park is under a lot of U.S. pressure to get over the past so that plans to jump-start a strategic dialogue next month might proceed. But a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the November APEC summit in Beijing now looks more difficult due to Abe's actions, which ensure that Japan's wartime past continues to cast a long shadow into the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Kingston.","Japan's PM Shinzo Abe has drawn criticism for a message honoring war criminals .

"London (CNN) -- One of the first questions many people ask when they start a new job is: what type of car will I get? However, Pope Francis -- known to opt for public transport in his home town of Buenos Aires -- refused the car that had been prepared for him after his election on Wednesday. Instead of traveling from the Sistine Chapel to the Santa Marta residence in a car carrying the license plate SCV1 (Vatican City 1), he jumped on the bus alongside the other cardinals. If the demands of the pontificate prove too exacting for Vatican bus schedules, however, he is unlikely to be disappointed by the vehicles on offer. For when Janis Joplin sang ""Lord won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz"" she probably didn't realise that the man Roman Catholics consider to be God's representative on Earth had already had his request granted many times. The pope didn't actually travel in a car for state visits until 1930 when Pius XI became the first ever recipient of a Mercedes-Benz state car. The Nurburg 460 Pullman was custom-built with silk carpets and a dove motif embossed on the roof lining. The pope clearly liked the idea of becoming motorized as he apparently took it for an hour-long test drive around the Vatican gardens. Since then he's had a string of Mercedes including a 300D in 1960, a 600 Pullman Landaulet in 1965 and a 300SEL in the 1970s. But although the pope uses Mercedes on home turf, his transport isn't restricted solely to the German car maker's products. When the Pope goes to different countries his hosts submit the details of his proposed transport. If these meet the Vatican's strict security criteria they're given the go-ahead. If it doesn't the Vatican supplies its own vehicle. The pope hasn't always been motorized on state visits. Until 1978, his primary mode of transport for meeting his public was the sedia gestatoria, a glorified sedan chair carried on the shoulders of various papal attendants. Obviously this had certain limitations, both in how far and how fast he could travel. It fell out of favor when the reign of Pope Paul VI ended in 1978. The early days of motorized papal transport were far removed from the Mercedes vehicles he currently drives. When John Paul II made his first visit to his home country of Poland in 1979 he was transported on a lightly modified Polish FSC Star flat-bed truck. Then in 1980 Mercedes was commissioned to build a bespoke model. It chose the 230G and a model christened the Popemobile was readied in time for the pope to use for his first trip to Germany. The bulletproof glass came following the assassination attempt on John Paul II in 1981. But in 1982, on his visit to Spain he was back in an open vehicle, a specially converted version of the popular SEAT Panda. This open-air vehicle had a simple grab handle so the pope could stand up and wave to his followers. Equally rudimentary was the Leyland Motors truck supplied for the pope's 1982 visit to the UK. Such was the determination of the British authorities not to lose a Pope on their watch this armored beast was the heaviest Popemobile ever at 24 tons. Since 2007, Benedict XVI has primarily used either a Mercedes G500 or smaller ML430 SUV. But these aren't off-the-shelf SUVs. In Popemobile spec the G500 features a fold-down windscreen along with the pope's traditional Mystic White paint. In less secure situations, the pope has another modified G-Class. This has the more familiar plexiglass dome which protects the pontiff from adverse weather while ensuring he remains visible to his flock. At 8mm thick, the glass is also bulletproof. But being encased in glass presents its own problems, principally overheating, so a powerful air-conditioning system was quickly added. This prevents the pope getting uncomfortably hot when the sun is shining but also ensures the glass doesn't steam up in high humidity. Spotlights have also been installed in the sides, floor and roof compartment so direct and indirect illumination makes His Holiness more visible when darkness falls. Security too has reached new levels. The glass has been made bomb proof so it can withstand explosions, the side panels are armored for the same reason and the underneath of the vehicle is blast-proof. Should the worst happen and the pope come under attack, his compartment has its own oxygen supply. The pope enters his compartment through a door in the back. He then sits in a bespoke chair made from white leather with gold trim. This employs a system of hydraulic lifts that raise him up so he can be seen more easily. It also means that most people won't be able to see the two papal aides who occupy two chairs in front of the pope's. The front seats of the Popemobile are occupied by a security guard and obviously, the driver. Although it's had a lot of extra weight built into it, the engine has been uprated. It means this particular G-Class can hit 160mph even if it only spends most of its life doing a much more sedate 6mph. All this capability doesn't come cheap though: it's estimated the current Popemobile costs about $565,000. The high cost presents a challenge to host nations, especially impoverished ones. For his 1995 visit to the Philippines, local car maker Francisco Motors produced a Popemobile based on a 4x4. As it had to be built with bomb and bulletproof parts the local faithful contributed to the extra cost. When John Paul died in 2005, this Popemobile was put on display in a Philippine church and became a pilgrimage destination for the country's Catholics who couldn't afford to go to the Vatican for the burial ceremony. It's probably the only time a car built in the Philippines has ever been worshipped.","Popes have used a string of Mercedes-Benz vehicles since 1930 .

"(CNN) -- Their job is capturing the most horrifying images on Earth -- keeping their eyes open, where others must look away. These are the people who lug cameras into the darkest depths of humanity. Places too gruesome, heartbreaking, and dangerous for the average person to stomach. They return offering us a small window into someone else's hell. And sometimes they don't return at all. The death of war photographer Anja Niedringhaus, while covering Afghanistan's elections, made her the 32nd Associated Press staffer to lose their life on the job. The 48-year-old Pulitzer Prize-winning German journalist was shot dead by an Afghan policeman, while sitting in a car waiting to pass through a checkpoint. She had worked in the region over 20 years. Tragic Taro . It's almost 70 years since the first female war photographer died in this line of work, and though few will know her name, many will recognize her famous lover. Gerda Taro was 26-years-old when she died covering the Spanish Civil War in 1937. The bubbly, bold photographer supposedly left the trenches that day only because her film ran out, elated with the fantastic images she thought she'd captured. But the car she was traveling home in collided with an out-of-control tank, crushing her. Taro's photographs that day were never found. Capa's loss . The man waiting for her was Robert Capa, arguably the most famous war photographer of the 20th century, known for his haunting images of soldiers emerging from the sea during the D-Day landings. When he heard the news of Taro's death, Capa was ""utterly devastated,"" said Jane Rogoyska, author of new book ""Gerda Taro: Inventing Robert Capa."" ""When he got the call he just kind of collapsed. And for the next few weeks he was just distraught. They were soul mates in many ways."" Love in a time of war . Their relationship began in Paris three years earlier. Both were penniless Jewish emigrants fleeing persecution -- he from Hungary, she from Germany. They changed their names and invented new lives for themselves as photographers -- Capa teaching Taro how to take pictures, and she making the disheveled young man presentable to employers. ""They were both incredibly attractive, very charming, very charismatic people,"" said Rogoyska. ""They really had nothing but their talent and wits to survive on. And I think their bravery partly came from their youth."" Action shot . With that bravery, came risks. ""If your photographs aren't good enough, you're not close enough,"" Capa famously once said, and after Taro's death he felt responsible not just having introduced her to photography, but for not protecting her on the day she died. ""Taro, like Capa, had a reputation for getting close to the action,"" said Rogoyska. ""They both had a policy of really trying to engage with what it was like to experience war -- whether it was civilians or the front line. That was quite a modern idea, so they were really quite striking pictures."" Indeed, gaze across Taro's images and you'll find soldiers huddled in trenches writing letters to loved ones, or bloodied air raid victims being carried away on stretchers, their pained expressions hauntingly close. Adrenalin junkies? On the day she died, Taro was exhilarated, fearlessly holding her camera aloft to get the best shots, according to Ted Allan, the Canadian reporter traveling with her at the time. What drives war photographers to risk their lives for an image? ""The idea that all war correspondents are adrenaline junkies is a clichÃ©,"" said Kate Brooks, an American photojournalist who covered the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ""Journalists are generally driven by something much deeper,"" she said, adding: ""Documentation is vital for the sake of collective memory, accountability and understanding."" The Mexican Suitcases . The discovery of a ""Mexican Suitcase"" containing thousands of negatives belonging to Taro, Capa, and fellow photographer David Seymour (known as ""Chim) a few years ago, revealed just how prolific their war coverage was. Many photographs attributed to Capa have now been identified as Taro's. ""Taro's work was, until quite recently, largely overlooked in history,"" said Brooks, author of ""In the Light of Darkness: A Photographer's Journey after 9/11."" ""She had no one to carry on her legacy after Capa died -- she didn't have children and her family were killed in the Holocaust. Then World War Two eclipsed the Spanish Civil War and Taro's communist sympathies further obscured her memory in the McCarthy era."" We'll never know what might have become of Taro's career, had she survived. But her window into a momentous moment in history, forever frozen in black and white, remain.

"(CNN) -- Boisterous and uninhibited on screen, comedic actor Kevin Hart has quietly risen to the top in Hollywood. Five years ago, Hart was best known as a comedian on the cusp of a breakthrough; now he's dominating the comedy stage and the screen. His January film release, ""Ride Along,"" opened at No. 1, and there are high expectations for his next movie, ""Think Like a Man Too,"" coming out Friday. With a devoted fan base and an unrepentant work ethic, the 33-year-old has quietly transformed into a burgeoning powerhouse. How exactly did he do it? Let's recount: . 1. Persistence . Like with most entertainers, Hart is familiar with the valleys that come before finding fame. The Philadelphia native and one-time shoe salesman initially began performing in the late '90s under the name ""Lil Kev the Bastard,"" but the comedy career he was angling for suffered from a slow start. Instead of dropping out for good, Hart worked with a mentor and re-evaluated his position: He started performing under his own name and began to hit with his brand of loud, physical comedy that drew from personal stories. While doing stand-up, he also branched out into acting, landing roles in Judd Apatow productions such as ""Undeclared"" (2002) and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005). His 2004 TV series, ""The Big House,"" didn't take off, but no matter -- his satiric take on reality TV, BET's ""Real Husbands of Hollywood,"" has been picked up for a third season. ""The one thing about the business of entertainment is that you have to learn patience,"" Hart told Entertainment Weekly in 2011 after the independent release of his comedy tour, ""Laugh at My Pain,"" did surprisingly well at the box office. ""The thing with patience is your time will come, there's just no telling when. Your job is to be ready when the time comes."" 2. Authenticity . A huge part of Hart's appeal is his willingness to mine his own fears and foibles for comedy gold, a practice that made ""Laugh at My Pain"" and the 2013 top performer that followed, ""Let Me Explain,"" major moneymakers. His father's struggle with addiction, his divorce and (especially) his short stature are all topics that Hart unabashedly broaches in his routines with a quick and sharp wit. ""His comedy comes from such a real place,"" Hart's frequent co-star, Seth Rogen, told Rolling Stone. ""And he's funny as hell."" 3. Versatility . What's made Hart such an inescapable presence is his ability to mix up his repertoire. He's become a master of stand-up comedy, executive-produces and stars in a spoof comedy series, can host an MTV awards show and is a natural with the raunchy comedy of Apatow's universe. And on the other hand, he can also slip into the family-friendly world of ABC's ""Modern Family"" with ease. (Yes, that was Hart guest-starring as the Dunphys' neighbor, Andre, in 2011 and 2012.) From the 2012 rom-com release ""The Five-Year Engagement"" to the 2013 sports flick ""Grudge Match"" with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, there aren't many worlds that Hart can't inhabit. 4. Cultivating an audience . With more than 10 million followers on Twitter and an eagerness to connect with his fans, Hart is the antithesis of the unreachable A-lister. This is a guy who was named Forbes' sixth-highest earning comedian of 2013 -- but still promises to make surprise appearances at local movie theaters. That's the kind of intimacy that could make fans stick around for the long haul. 5. No breaks . By his own admission, Hart is industrious. But you don't need to hear him say it -- he often uses the phrase, ""Everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to do the work!"" -- to know that's true. Once his 2014 raft of movies is done -- which include ""Ride Along,"" ""About Last Night"" and now ""Think Like a Man Too"" -- Hart has at least another five projects in the works through 2016.

DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, was developed by the National Institutes of Health for people with high blood pressure. But it is also effective in lowering cholesterol and reducing your risk for heart disease, stroke, kidney stones and diabetes, its website states. Unlike many diet plans, DASH doesn't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods. Its focus is on limiting your daily sodium intake. The meal plan has three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes. ""It certainly looked like an all-star to our panel of experts,"" U.S. News & World Report wrote. ""Though obscure, it beat out a field full of better-known diets.""

"(CNN) -- The publication of a report into child abuse in the northern town of Rotherham, England has shocked Britain to the core. The report, by Professor Alexis Jay, gives a ""conservative estimate"" of 1,400 children being sexually assaulted over a 16-year period. They were beaten, kidnapped, raped and trafficked. Some victims were as young as 11. How could it happen here, in a modern country that professes to care for the vulnerable? The horrors in Rotherham first came to light in 2010, when five men were jailed for sexual offenses against underage girls. A journalist's investigation into the wider scale of abuse prompted the local council to conduct its own report -- and it's the staggering numbers revealed in Jay's findings that have caught the public's attention. Many of the headlines have focused on the racial makeup of the culprits, who were overwhelmingly Asian males. The report concludes that elected council officials were reluctant to talk directly to the Pakistani community about the problem and that some staff were frightened of being labeled ""racist"" for doing so. All of which confirms the assertion from the British right wing that a climate of ""political correctness"" permitted the abuse to go on. It's impossible not to infer that children could have been rescued had quaint notions of ""racial sensitivity"" been put aside. The inquiry heard that influential elected Pakistani councilors acted as ""barriers of communication."" But a focus on political correctness should not distract from the wider, institutional betrayal of children by police, social services and local politicians. The scale of which was staggering and the neglect sometimes willful. Professor Jay states that ""nobody could say 'we didn't know' "" The crimes were committed in the open. The report explained how the grooming of victims (from all racial backgrounds) occurred: ""Schools raised the alert over the years about children as young as 11, 12 and 13 being picked up outside schools by cars and taxis, given presents and mobile phones and taken to meet large numbers of unknown males in Rotherham, other local towns and cities, and further afield."" The girls often believed their rapists were boyfriends, men of relative wealth and sophistication, who gave them gifts and introduced them to others. These crimes were often reported. Some police officers, according to Jay, treated the accusers with ""contempt."" This was likely because they were children being held in care by the local authority, meaning that they were separated from their parents and typically living in homes provided by the taxpayers. Their claims were either disbelieved or the encounters possibly dismissed as typical behavior for someone of their social status. On one occasion, a police officer said that a 12-year-old having sex with five adults shouldn't be categorized as sexual abuse because it was ""100% consensual in every incident"" (this advice was overruled). I don't need to spell out that British law sees things very differently. When crimes were reported, cases were gathered and reports filed to the council's staff and elected officials. The scale was such that they were often greeted with disbelief. Three summaries were written in total by justice officials. All three were largely ignored by the police and the council. When the scandal first went public in 2010, the leader of Rotherham's children's services resigned. Just two years later, the opposition Labour Party endorsed him for its candidate to be elected Police and Crime Commissioner for South Yorkshire. The leader of the party, Ed Miliband, posed with him in an election photo. He won the election and there are now demands -- including from Labour -- for him to resign. Thus far, he has refused. It's impossible to make sense of this story. The barbarity is so enormous, so terrible. There is also the frightening possibility that those responsible for failing to defend the children will not see justice. The report does not name names and it's likely that the social workers and council staff who were so obviously negligent have moved on to jobs in other areas, spreading their incompetence across the country. While some observers wish to pin the problem on political correctness and others on under-funding, a more simple truth emerges. Individuals did not do their jobs. In some cases they looked the other way. And it's just possible that they will get away with it. They are shielded by political self-delusion. Rotherham council announced the report's findings with the following assertion: ""Services to protect young people at risk from child sexual exploitation in Rotherham are stronger and better co-ordinated across agencies today than ever before, an independent review has found."" This is a stretch, to say the least. Professor Jay did indicate that services have improved at the council but added that it remains understaffed and the long-term victim support inadequate. Importantly, criminal convictions are still woefully low -- a continuing failure by the police. Britain has a number of problems to face up to. One is a hidden history of child abuse, most dramatically brought to light by the revelations that the late children's entertainer and radio host Jimmy Savile (a friend to the rich and powerful) used his position to exploit the vulnerable. Another problem is that our public services can operate poorly and by their own standards. Our welfare state is generous and -- including in Rotherham -- boasts excellent staffs doing fantastic work. But it also employs, even provides cover for, individuals who are negligent. A full public inquiry must be held into what happened in Rotherham, a scandal that repeats much of what has also happened in Rochdale, Derby and Oxford and which is almost certainly taking place today. That is the only effective way to expose those responsible, and to shed light on the Dickensian nightmare playing out in modern Britain.","Tim Stanley: Report about sex abuse of 1,400 children shocked Britain.

"(CNN) -- One of the most powerful experiences in life is to have deep, meaningful connection. Without it we are empty. Each message I received about my struggle with psoriasis was a new connection that brought with it a tapestry of fulfillment, gratitude and inspiration for me. Thank you. Many of you have asked me about diet. For me, it was, the most long-term solution to heal my severe psoriasis then, requiring the toughest self-discipline and a team of cheerleaders. Here's what I did, with what I learned at the clinic in South Africa, and my mother, Yasmin's help. Mum and I also used the book ""Healing Psoriasis: The Natural Alternative"" by Dr. John O.A. Pagano to help explain diet in more detail and the science of natural healing. Stuff I did not eat: Sugar, coffee, tea, soda, red meat (except for lamb), shellfish, oranges (I had very little citrus at all), ""hot"" spices, pumpkin, onions, garlic, tomato, mushrooms, eggplant, peppers, chili, paprika, cheese, white rice, white flour, bread, eggs, butter, cookies, chocolate, alcohol, tobacco, cranberries, blueberries, plums, strawberries, cream, lentils, peas, white potatoes, yeast. Stuff I could eat: Brown rice or wild rice, plain chicken or lamb, honey, apple, melon, banana, leafy green salads (no dressing), plain low-fat yogurt, celery, spinach, broccoli, corn, sweet potato pear, papaya, apricot, grilled fish, turkey, wholegrain muffin or bagel, bran, almonds, low-fat milk, wholegrain pasta. Loads of water. Mum and I devised some menus like this: . Breakfast: Lemon in hot water, high fiber cereals/bran and milk, papaya, low fat yogurt, chamomile tea, occasional eggs. Lunch and dinner: Stir-fry vegetables (celery, carrots, French beans, corn, cabbage, broccoli) in one desert spoon of olive oil along with fresh herbs, like basil, rosemary, oregano and fresh coriander, salt and pepper to taste. Chopped nuts. Apricots, honey; . Grilled lamb with salt, pepper and honey -- white sauce over it, (made with wholewheat flour, milk and seasoning). Plain grilled chicken with olive oil, salt and pepper plus honey; fresh chicken soup; grilled turkey breast; roasted duck (white meat only); wholegrain pasta in white sauce; grilled fish (trout or sole or mackerel); vegetable lasagna. All foods served with leafy green salads and with vegetable sides such as asparagus with low fat margarine, steamed cauliflower with beans, broccoli and carrots, corn or sweet potato. Sweet tooth: Baked bananas, stewed apple or pear, plain low fat yogurt with fruit, pomegranate, dates, cantaloupe, fruit salad, whole grain, apricots and prunes. Drinks: Diluted apple juice, melon juice, low fat milk, and water. Munchies: Carrots, salad, pear, apple, avocado, sunflower seeds, Barvita biscuits, snack bars that are oatmeal (no preservatives or coloring or flavoring). Vitamins: B12, CoQ10, Folic acid, Zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin D . Exercise: I worked out for at least 1-2 hours a day. Steam: I drank two liters of cooled American yellow saffron tea while sweating in the steam room for at least 30-60 minutes a day. I would go in and out repeatedly so-as not to overheat. I would rest and eat bananas afterwards (which contain potassium). Meditation: At the clinic in South Africa, I learned how to do deep relaxation and creative visualization. Three times a day I lay on the floor of my bedroom for at least 30 minutes and meditated. I imagined myself windsurfing in a bikini with the naked sun on my clear skin. I imagined making a deal with my psoriasis, I would maintain the diet, and it, in turn would go away. I visualized that all the time. I used naturally based topical creams from the Meyer Zall clinic to help sooth my skin. The clinic is now closed. Remission . This worked for me back then and put me in remission for about 10 years, where I could eat anything I wanted and live completely normally. I have suffered recently from significant flare-ups that are stress induced (need to handle stress better ...). I needed a ""quick fix"" and first was on Enbrel injections, then Methotrexate and now Humira, a biologic drug, which is currently helping. There is clearly a place for medication like this in healing, but my experience with diet forces me to believe that is a longer term, side effect-free solution. There is much debate in the value of food: which are immune boosters, what is more or less acidic, what is toxic for certain illnesses, is gluten-free the way to go; can food only provide cures? There is no one size fits all. The only universal truth in all this, for me, is maintaining a positive attitude no matter how hard it is, with the love and support of friends and family. Once again, thank you. For more information on psoriasis, Verjee suggests visiting the National Psoriasis Foundation (U.S), Psoriasis Association (UK) or Africa Psoriasis Organization (Kenya).

"(CNN) -- At 14 feet long and 2,300 pounds, it's only fitting that Katharine is heading for the land where everything is bigger. This massive great white shark was most recently spotted 100 miles off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico, headed toward Texas. And as of June 5, another great white, Betsy, was about 140 miles west of Sarasota, Florida. In August, researchers from the nonprofit group Ocearch tagged Katharine off Massachusetts' Cape Cod, along with the 14-foot long, 2,300-pound shark Betsy. Every time the sharks surface, their tags send signals to a satellite that can then pinpoint their locations, which can be viewed in near real time on the Ocearch website. So far, each of these sharks has traveled over 1,400 miles. It is estimated that Katharine will be past the mouth of the Mississippi River in a week and will enter the waters off Texas not long afterward if she keeps to her current course. A researcher says the sharks' paths are surprising for this time of year. ""Every track is giving us new information and going contrary to all the assumptions that we were going on,"" Dr. Robert Heuter, director of Mote Marine Laboratory's center for shark research, told the Houston Chronicle. ""Having (sharks) in the Gulf is something we thought happened in the wintertime."" These huge sharks' irregular behavior comes on the heels of the catch of a rare goblin shark in Florida in May and the closing of an Alabama beach because of a ""swarm"" of sharks this month. Fortunately for the Lone Star State, scientists will be able to track Katharine as she approaches and keep tabs on her and Betsy for a long time to come. According to Heuter, ""These tags can last as many as five years. It gives us a completely different perspective from the older tags."" Perhaps the tags will prove more helpful than the researchers in Cape Cod could have predicted, ensuring that Katharine's Texan size is all that she is remembered for.

"(CNN) -- Hurricane Arthur -- or what's left of it -- has rained on many an Independence Day parade, if they weren't canceled ahead of time. But what the first named storm of this hurricane season hasn't done, it appears, is cause significant damage. As of 11 p.m. ET, Arthur was churning deep into the Atlantic Ocean about 75 miles east-southeast of the Cape Cod town of Chatham, according to the National Hurricane Center. It is still technically a hurricane, with sustained winds of 75 mph, and Nantucket and Cape Cod face tropical storm warnings. But Arthur wasn't expected to live up to dire predictions for the East Coast. The center of Arthur is forecast to pass over or near western Nova Scotia early Saturday. By then, the system should be no more than a ""post-tropical cyclone,"" meaning it will feature rain and little else. While the wind won't pack as much wallop for the Northeast, that doesn't mean Arthur didn't have an impact -- especially on those who wanted to both go outside and stay dry over the holiday. Americans from New York to far northeast Maine are experiencing, or could soon experience, drenching rains tied to the outskirts of the Category 1 storm. This is after a number of moves, such as the hasty rescheduling of Boston's Independence Day celebration to one day early, done ahead of the system. The good news is that Arthur wasn't the type of holiday guest that hung around long. The Miami-based hurricane center noted that the storm was speeding along to the northeast -- meaning it is heading farther out to sea -- at a 31 mph clip. That is motoring along by hurricane standards, especially for one that was stalled in the Atlantic just a few days ago. Arthur nonetheless managed to dampen some spirits as it raced along. On Friday afternoon, for instance, southeast Massachusetts got lashed by round after round of pounding rains that left some roads covered with water. ""Arthur does not like us right now,"" a soaked but smiling Adam Morales of Fairhaven told CNN affiliate WCVB. ""I don't know (how) we disappointed him, but it's OK. I don't mind it."" Number of North Carolinians without power plummets . The state that was supposed to bear the brunt of Arthur's wrath was North Carolina. It did indeed get hit, though it was more a glancing blow than a knockout punch. But not everyone knew that would be the case at 11:15 p.m. Thursday, when Arthur roared ashore between Cape Lookout and Beaufort with 100-mph winds. Robin Nelson's house in Newport -- right across the Newport River Sound from Beaufort, and in the path of the eye wall -- clattered and rumbled. In the distance, she heard the whirring hum of storm gusts and snapping of tree limbs. ""It's howling pretty good here,"" she said late Thursday. ""You can hear it coming across the sound."" Around 9:30 a.m. Friday, Gov. Pat McCrory said 44,000 people in his state were without power due to the storm. A CNN tabulation around this time found about 18,500 customers, which could translate to households or businesses, without electricity. Utility companies were able to make significant inroads in getting people's lights back on as the day wore on. By 2:30 p.m., there were around 5,000 customers without power in the state. Later in the afternoon, McCrory followed up by noting that Arthur had ""minimal impact"" on coastal communities -- with one plus being that it moved out in time for the holiday and the upcoming weekend. The Outer Banks forecast called for sunny skies and high temperatures in the 80s. Brad Doerr knows it could have been a lot worse, even with one window lost and water up to the door of the Dairy Queen restaurant in Avon that he runs. ""Emily blew a lot harder than this one,"" Doerr told CNN affiliate WAVY, referring to 1993's far more powerful Hurricane Emily. ""This one we were really fortunate."" Concerns about rip currents . Track the storm . Though it has moved on, the hurricane leaves deadly danger lurking under its coattails: possible rip currents. The weather service calls the spurts of back-flowing water, which can drag a swimmer from the shore and out to sea, the worst danger at the beach. In 2009, tropical storms killed six people. All of them drowned in high waves or rip currents, the National Weather Service said. And it doesn't matter if the storm has already passed, it can sprout them from long distances. They're hard to see and snatch bathers without warning. Sherman Lee Criner is an iron man triathlete and confident he could swim out of a rip current if he had to. ""Even so, I'm not going to get out in the water,"" he said. It would be a dumb thing to do, especially in front of the children traveling with him. ""Of course, I'm not going to let the kids out there,"" he said. Criner was vacationing in Arthur's bull's eye on Emerald Isle with his son, daughter and niece. He didn't plan for the group to be in the storm's path. He asked his two children and niece where they wanted to spend the holidays; they voted for the beach, and he granted the wish. He thought of canceling the trip as the storm brewed but decided against it. ""It's a doable storm,"" Criner said. See Images as CNN crews cover Hurricane Arthur .

"Barcelona (CNN) -- What does an acclaimed chef do for an encore after he's closed the best restaurant in the world? For Ferran Adria, former head chef of Spain's elBulli, it's creating a new menu of big ideas. Called the elBulli Foundation, Adria's new umbrella enterprise will encompass everything from an Internet search engine of gastronomy to a food laboratory to a huge visitor center. All of this is necessary, he says, to explain his theories not just about cooking but about creativity writ large. ""Here you will eat knowledge,"" says the great chef of his elBulli Foundation. More like a physicist or philosopher than a chef, Adria says he's come up with a ""theory of everything"" -- a model to unlock creativity in any walk of life. Dali in the kitchen . ""This is not about cooking. It's about creativity,"" he says, speaking through a translator while walking through the building that will house his new operation, an abandoned textile factory, in Barcelona, home to great Catalan innovators such as architect Antoni Gaudi and surrealist paint Salvador Dali . The elBulli Foundation will spawn a research laboratory, BulliPedia (an online encyclopedia of food) and massive open online courses to teach gastronomy and creativity. ""I am a cook but no one else is thinking these things,"" he says. He believes Bullipedia will become the most disruptive Internet venture since Wikipedia. Adria tends to speak of himself as ""we."" It's his way of recognizing his collaborators, some of who have gone on to create their own great restaurants. ""We have thought many times that we are crazy,"" he says. ""If that is so then we must be changing many things."" With the passion of the self-taught, Adria speaks with his hands as much as his mouth, kneading the air as if it were pastry, pinching fingers together to make points as if adding salt. It's all in the recipe . Any business, skill or art can be improved with a touch of elBulli magic, he suggests. ""The aim of this project is to show people they can be creative ... to be creative about any process,"" says Adria, waving his arms so vigorously you're glad he's not wielding a kitchen knife. Adria, 52, is a native of Catalonia. He joined the army at 19 and became a cook. He was hired to the kitchen staff of elBulli restaurant at 22, working in the little restaurant on the beach at Roses on the Costa Brava north of Barcelona. Rising to head chef, he was recognized as an innovator, leading elBulli to a record five wins in the ""world's best restaurant"" awards. A pioneer in molecular gastronomy, Adria liberated new tastes and developed new methods such as nitrogen-infused foams. Despite holding three Michelin stars -- menu items included frozen whisky sour candy and tobacco-flavored blackberries -- elBulli closed in July 2011. During a two-hour tour of his enormous new space, Adria explains the creative force that drove him to lead the world's best restaurant, only to close it after 25 years. A polymath and control freak, Adria's new kitchen of ideas features hundreds of meters of foam pinboards with ideas big and small sketched on them. There's also a scale model of the huge visitor center he plans for the coast next to the now-closed elBulli restaurant. Articles about Google founder Larry Page are pinned to one board. Another has diagrams of cuts of meat from a pig. Truffle ice cream . A sprawling library houses every recipe ever cooked at elBulli and an archive of food and recipes going back to the 15th century. ""In 1768 there was black truffle ice cream,"" says the man who created liquid olives. ""If you think I do crazy things, that's even more amazing. The things that were done many years ago were so far ahead of their time."" Adria is planning what he says will be the first exhibition of its kind about the creative process, set for an October opening at Telefonica exhibition space in Madrid. The ""InvestigaciÃ³n y del MÃ©todo CientÃ­fico"" will be an examination of the scientific methods behind elBulli. At the center of the exhibition is a Creativity Map, a sort of astrological chart outlining the process that takes an idea through trial and error to finished product. ""Everything is in the map,"" he says, explaining how the broad chart can provide the answer to almost anything. Adria is free with his advice and major institutions around the world seek his input. He lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It's how he tells 'em . Some of his truisms may sound so simple as to be half-baked, but there's a driving force behind his seeming madness: deconstruct everything. A few beauties from the Adria lexion: . ""A fried egg is chemistry."" ""Eating with chopsticks is more sensual so we made (elBulli) chopsticks."" ""People ask me how I get my ideas ... if you go to the toilet with a magazine you are thinking."" Critics have called his food pretentious, even dangerous to consume. But the fans of haute cuisine love him. The big question, of course, is when is Adria going to cook again? His answer will disappoint many. Adria says he turned away two million potential reservations for elBulli in its final year. He now plans to serve only 20 meals a year: 10 paid and 10 free. Right now he's focused on solving bigger questions: ""What type of information do we need about ravioli so that it becomes knowledge?""","Former head chef of Spain's elBulli, is launching a new venture .

""Everybody wants to have a picture of themself in front of something, no matter what that something is."" The majority of the most interesting travel shots are not the proof-of-visit variety. -- Avoid shooting in the middle of the day. ""You want to try to take your photos within say, two hours of sunrise or sunset,"" Arndt said. There are exceptions to every rule, but these hours tend to yield the best shots in most situations. -- A little familiarity with your camera goes a long way. You don't need to master every setting and the science behind it, but definitely ""experiment a little bit before you go somewhere.""

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid, the kings of Europe, will take on a team living one of the greatest fairytale stories in Bulgarian football history. Ludogorets Razgrad, which clinched its place in the group stage of the Champions League for the first time following a dramatic penalty shootout playoff victory, will travel to the Santiago Bernabeu stadium to face the defending champion. Real, which defeated city rival Atletico 4-1 in Lisbon last year to win ""La Decima"" -- it's 10th title -- is attempting to become the first team to successfully defend the Champions League. Ludogorets will also face five-time champion Liverpool -- back in the Champions League after a five-year absence -- as well as Swiss side FC Basel in Group A. Ludogorets defeated Romanian side Steaua Bucharest thanks to two penalty saves from stand-in goalkeeper Cosmin MoÅ£i. MoÅ£i , a defender, went in goal for the shootout after goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov was sent off with one minute of extra time remaining and made himself a hero. Surprisingly Liverpool have won all three of their European Cup matches against 10-time champion Real and have never even conceded a goal against them. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich will face Manchester City in a repeat of last season's group stage contests. Munich produced a fine performance to win 3-1 in Manchester but was stunned by the English club at the Allianz Arena, losing 3-2 in the return fixture. ""We're coming up against familiar teams here,"" Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer told his club's website. ""They're not easy opponents by any means, but we know from last year where we stand and can use that going in."" Bayern and City will also have to negotiate tricky ties against Roma and CSKA Moscow if they are to progress. In Group F, Zlatan Ibrahimovic will face two of his former clubs after Paris Saint-Germain was drawn alongside Barcelona and Ajax. PSG, beaten in the round of 16 by Chelsea last season, will also have to take on Cypriot side Apoel Nicosia. ""These are games where every team has the right to dream,"" Barcelona's director of sport, former Spanish international keeper Andoni Zubizarreta, told the club website. ""We have our dreams, and they all have their own."" It's a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu for Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund after the two teams were drawn together for a third consecutive season. Dortmund, which was narrowly beaten by Real Madrid in last year's quarterfinal, triumphed against Arsene Wenger's side in London but was topped at home by ""the Gunners."" Turkish side Galatasaray, which reached the second round last time around, will also provide a stern test, with Belgian club Anderlecht completing the line-up. Atletico Madrid, which lost last year's final in extra time, will face Italian champion Juventus, Olympiacos and Swedish side Malmo in Group A. Juventus crashed out in the group stage last season. Olympiacos was beaten by Manchester United in the last-16 during the previous edition while Malmo is making its first appearance in the group stage. In Group C, Benfica, which has not won the competition since 1962, takes on Zenit Saint Petersburg, Bayer Leverkusen and Radamel Falcao's Monaco. Chelsea, the 2012 champion, will be confident of making it through Group G after being drawn against Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Slovenian champion Maribor. Athletic Bilbao's reward for defeating Napoli in the playoff are games against Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk and BATE Borisov. Champions League draw: .

"(CNN) -- We've all been there: reached for our food in the office refrigerator, only to recoil from the stench from the crammed containers of decomposing food. When a worker at an AT&T building in San Jose, California, took it upon herself to clean out an office refrigerator during her lunch hour Tuesday, the smell from the moldy food was so noxious that it sent seven of her co-workers to the hospital and prompted the evacuation of all 325 people in the building. ""It was like a brick wall hit you,"" employee Robin Leetieh told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. ""Stopped you immediately."" The refrigerator had been unplugged for some time and moved into a conference room for cleaning. When the woman tried to scrub down the mess, the stench from the cleaning chemicals combined with the rotting food. ""It caused some to vomit, some to just get nauseous. And it, for us, activated a hazardous incident,"" Capt. Barry Stallard of the San Jose fire department told the television station. Another office worker tried to cover up the odor -- and made matters worse. ""Someone also took some spray and tried to deodorize the air,"" Stallard said. ""And it turned out that was spot cleaner, not a deodorant. So it made people very sick."" Firefighters set up a triage area in the building's parking lot. In all, 28 workers reported feeling sick. Seven were taken to hospitals for evaluation. Not among them: the woman who volunteered to clean the fridge. She suffers from allergies, firefighters said, and had had nasal surgery. She didn't smell a thing.","AT&T worker cleans out refrigerator filled with rotting food, forcing office evacuation .

"(CNN) -- When doctors had to remove Aaron Loy's lower legs in November after he contracted meningococcal disease, his parents hoped students at his university would receive protection against it. So far, they're still waiting. Loy, a promising lacrosse and soccer player at the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), was the victim of an outbreak of meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis. Meanwhile, across the country at Princeton, eight cases of meningitis B were reported last year. Princeton was given special permission to use a new vaccine. Four meningococcal disease cases were reported at UCSB, but the vaccine is not being used there. Some of the UCSB cases were caused by type B bacteria, the same strain as at Princeton, although officials found no link between the two outbreaks. European, Canadian and Australian students have access to a meningitis B vaccine called Bexsero, but the Food and Drug Administration still hasn't approved it for routine use in the United States. Loy's parents hope that will change. ""It's absolutely devastating to have Aaron, in the prime of his life, be stricken"" with the disease, Mike Loy said previously. ""We hope that Aaron's horrific illness brings increased awareness and rapid approval by the FDA of the vaccine"" for the type B strain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a team of scientists to study the outbreak in California in December. It recently amended a letter it wrote to the FDA to get special permission to use the unlicensed vaccine to include UCSB students, but permission has not yet been granted. ""You don't go online and order 10,000 doses and get next-day delivery of this vaccine,"" said Dr. Tom Clark, chief of the CDC's meningitis branch. ""It takes time."" Fortunately, he said, a meningitis B outbreak moves more slowly than others. ""It smolders. You have a bit more time to get everything in place."" 8th case of meningitis confirmed at Princeton . In December, the FDA agreed to the CDC's request to give Princeton special permission to bring the vaccine over from Europe to protect its students. The CDC had been carefully monitoring the Princeton cases since the first couple of students had been diagnosed about nine months before. Meningitis B outbreaks are rare but can be deadly, according to the CDC. In 2012, there were 480 cases of bacterial meningitis; some 160 of those were group B, the agency said. There's an approved vaccine for other types of meningitis. There is none for group B, which is the one the CDC describes as ""pack(ing) the most powerful punch."" College dorms are perfect breeding grounds for an outbreak. This infection of the protective tissue around the spinal cord and brain called the meninges can spread when someone coughs or sneezes. It can spread if people forget to wash their hands or belongings, or through sharing a glass or a kiss. Excessive alcohol use leaves people susceptible to it. And it's tricky, because students who get sick with it may think they merely have flu. Patients experience flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, stiff necks, vomiting and delirium. But if the bacteria spreads to the meninges, patients can suffer hearing loss, permanent neurological damage, and even death. Novartis, the Swiss company that makes the group B vaccine, declined CNN's interview request, but confirmed it is working with the FDA for approval. A press release on its website from December said: ""Over the last few weeks, we have been working closely with officials at Princeton and the CDC to put in place a timely and decisive response to the outbreak. This situation serves as a reminder that MenB can strike anyone at any time."" Novartis successfully tested the vaccine on almost 8,000 infants, children, adolescents and adults. That qualified the vaccine for a license in European Union last January. Australia approved it in August, and Canada in December. In an e-mail to CNN, the FDA explained it is kept from legally ""discussing investigational drug applications."" However, the fact that the vaccine hasn't been approved yet has been criticized by at least one former FDA scientist. ""The FDA's demands are excessive,"" said Dr. Henry Miller, the Robert Wesson Fellow in Scientific Philosophy and Public Policy at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. Miller spent 15 years at the FDA and founded its office of biotechnology. He has written extensively about his belief that the FDA has gotten ""fanatically risk-averse."" In the past five years, the FDA has approved only a couple of new vaccines on average every year. But a 2012 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the FDA review time is comparatively faster than Europe's or Canada's. Miller believes the California students could have been vaccinated by now if the FDA had granted accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means the FDA would temporarily allow U.S. use of the vaccine without this extra step involving the CDC letter requesting special permission. Accelerated approval, he said, still leaves the FDA a legal mechanism to withdraw the vaccine. Meningitis outbreak: California students wait for vaccine . ""The FDA should have negotiated in good faith for reciprocity with their foreign counterparts,"" Miller said. Dr. David Gortler, a former FDA senior medical officer and FDA regulatory expert, said vaccine approvals generally require special caution. ""When our FDA gives its approval to a drug, this is the gold standard for drug approval in the world,"" said Gortler, who is now an associate professor of pharmacology and medicine at Georgetown University. If a drug is going to be approved in the United States, he said, there should be ""no room for doubt of its clear safety and efficacy."" Gortler points to the 1960's Thalidomide scandal as the primary example of why the FDA's strict standards are essential. The morning sickness drug had been approved in the United Kingdom and in Europe, but pregnant women who took Thalidomide had babies with severe birth defects. In the FDA's careful review of the drug, medical officer Dr. Frances Kelsey discovered Thalidomide had never been tested on pregnant animals. Her discovery and her agency's refusal to approve it averted a major public health catastrophe in America. The FDA's drug and vaccine approval process is exhaustive. Pharmaceutical companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on testing that can take several years. Scientists must prove vaccines are safe and effective in the lab, in animal tests, and then in larger and larger groups of humans. The companies send the FDA test results throughout the testing phase. Before digital records, Gortler said it took more than one loaded 18-wheeler of paperwork for the FDA review. ""It's not an easy process to review such voluminous amounts of data, while simultaneously being mindful to enforce the heavy federal regulations concerning new drug approval in the USA,"" Gortler said. The FDA is still reviewing the results for the meningitis B vaccine. Novartis, meanwhile, said on its website it is ""committed to continuing the dialogue with the FDA to find a licensure pathway to bring a MenB vaccine to the U.S. to fulfill this unmet public health need for the future.""","A meningitis B outbreak hit students at Princeton and UCSB .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio appeals court Wednesday overturned hate-crime convictions of 16 Amish men and women in connection with a spate of beard- and hair-cutting attacks on members of their faith, according to court documents. The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati found that the jury in the original case was given incorrect instructions on how to deliberate the role of religion in the attacks, the documents say. The leader of a breakaway Amish community, Samuel Mullet Sr., and 15 of his followers were found guilty in 2012 in connection with what authorities said were the religiously motivated attacks on several Amish people. Mullet and others were convicted of conspiracy to violate a federal hate-crime law. Prosecutors said Mullet's followers, at his instruction, shaved the beards and cut the hair of Amish people who had left his group over various religious disagreements. Five attacks happened in four eastern Ohio counties between September and November 2011. ""No one questions that the assaults occurred, and only a few defendants question their participation in them. The central issue at trial was whether the defendants committed the assaults 'because of' the religion of the victims,"" according to decision. Two of the three judges on the appeals panel found that ""when all is said and done, considerable evidence supported the defendants' theory that interpersonal and intra-family disagreements, not the victims' religious beliefs, sparked the attacks,"" according to the documents. Mullet was sentenced to 15 years in prison for the crimes. Four of his followers were sentenced to seven years, three received five-year sentences, two were sentenced to two years and six were sentenced to a year and a day, according to the Justice department. The jury also had convicted various defendants with separate assaults, and Mullet with concealing or attempting to conceal evidence, including a camera and pictures of the attacks, the U.S. attorney's office said. Those charges, which were not part of the appeal, still stand. It is unclear if any defendants will be released as a result of the overturned hate crime convictions. U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach released a statement following the decision. ""We respectfully disagree with the two judges who reversed the defendants' hate crime convictions based on a jury instruction,"" the statement said. ""We remain in awe of the courage of the victims in this case, who were subject to violent attacks by the defendants. We are reviewing the opinion and considering our options."" Usually, the Amish resolve disputes without involving law enforcement, but some Amish members reported the beard-cutting incidents to police. Mullet's group, which had broken away from a larger Amish community, is made up primarily of his relatives living on and around an 800-acre compound in a remote valley outside Bergholz, Ohio. To the Amish, a beard is a significant symbol of faith and manhood, and the way Amish women wear their hair also is a symbol of faith. Calls to defense attorney Wendi Overmyer by CNN were not immediately returned. CNN's Tricia Escobedo, Jason Hanna and Mallory Simon contributed to this report.","Appeals court overturned hate crime convictions of 16 Amish men and women Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Sara Lugger was skeptical as she placed her first $5 bet. But she realized that all she had to lose was weight -- and a few bucks if the money didn't motivate her to get in shape. A friend's success had inspired Lugger to join DietBet, a website that hosts private and public games where people can bet on their own weight loss. Each game sets a goal, such as losing 4% of your body weight, and users who reach that goal split the pot. Lugger was 34 and weighed 342 pounds. She had struggled with obesity most of her life. In the ninth grade, she was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis, and doctors put her on prednisone. The steroid made it difficult for her to maintain a normal weight. But in 2004, Lugger had surgery to fix the colitis. ""From there on out, I couldn't blame anything but my poor habits."" Shortly after her birthday in February 2013, Lugger decided that reaching 350 pounds would be ""unacceptable."" The Oxford, Michigan, resident realized that her weight was holding her back from doing the things she wanted to do. She had been the heaviest person in her college classes, where she studied to become a physical therapist. And although family and friends never said anything outright, she noticed they didn't exactly try to set her up on dates. She avoided social situations and outdoor activities that might call attention to her size, and she worried about traveling because fitting in an airplane seat was difficult. ""For weeks before I flew, that would be on my mind,"" she said. After signing up for DietBet, Lugger made a plan. She threw out all the junk food in her house. She decided she would wake up 30 minutes early every morning to work out on her elliptical machine. Then, at lunch, she would use the physical therapy equipment at her office to strength train. That way, if she wanted to go out with friends in the evening, she wouldn't miss a workout. upwave: Don't miss a workout with the one-minute workout challenge . ""I have never seen her so driven and persistent on a goal,"" her friend Travis Summerville said. ""I don't know where that came from, but she chose a simple exercise regimen and diet style that worked well for her, and she just kept at it consistently."" Lugger traded her morning bowl of cereal for a protein shake. She stopped frequenting fast-food places and instead used Pinterest to find lighter fare to cook at home. She now keeps to a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet. ""I'm kind of an all-or-nothing person,"" she said. ""I can't (just) lean into things, or it doesn't happen."" Losing weight did happen. Lugger loved the support she found from her group on DietBet and signed up for two more games after the first one ended. Over time, she upped her bets to $10 and then $50 as she gained confidence -- and lost 140 pounds. Lugger's friend Christie Williams has also lost 60 pounds using the site. Looking back, Williams is amazed at how heavy she and Lugger once were. But what she's always loved about her friend is still there, Williams says. ""I don't believe Sara has changed as a person. She still laughs loud, dances crazy and screams at the wrong parts in horror movies. What has changed is the activities we do. It's not always takeout pizza and two movies. We'll go walk a couple of miles or play ""Just Dance"" before we go out to eat."" The friends are training for an upcoming 5K and helping each other maintain their slimmer figures. ""We are holding each other accountable,"" Williams said. ""My biggest fear was (Lugger) having a heart attack at age 45. That fear is gone, and I don't want it back. ... It's never going to be easy, but it will be easier than losing her at a young age."" Overall, Lugger has won more than $330 on DietBet. She's also won a new outlook on life. Lugger used to tell her friends -- and herself -- that she didn't like basketball because she knew she wouldn't fit into the arena seats. Now she's a Detroit Pistons fan. ""Turns out, I really like basketball,"" she said with a laugh. Lugger is also traveling more. And shopping. She loves dressing in clothes she feels express her style instead of trying to hide in the background. ""I'm finding me more, and that's a really neat thing.""","At her heaviest, Sara Lugger weighed 342 pounds .

"(CNN) -- It looks like there will not be a shortage of iPhone 5s this holiday season, with plenty of the devices for all carriers in stock at stores around the U.S. Analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray said in a note to investors Thursday that Apple Stores have enough phones physically in stock that ""consumers can walk into an Apple Store and walk out with a phone."" The iPhone 5 went on sale September 14, selling 5 million units over its first weekend. The device has been plagued by rumors of supply chain problems since then. There were labor strikes at the Foxconn plant where the phones are manufactured, and Foxconn chairman Terry Gou said the devices were not easy to make and that, ""We are falling short of meeting the huge demand."" If Munster's conclusions are correct, Apple and its supply chain partners have overcome those problems in time for the December rush. Munster conducted a survey of 20 Apple Stores to check on their stocks of Verizon, Sprint and AT&T iPhone 5s, and AppleInsider said it confirmed the availability with local Apple Stores. Earlier in the month, Piper Jaffray called 70 Apple Stores and concluded that there were lower supplies of AT&T and Verizon iPhone 5s, though Sprint models were increasingly available. The firm also conducted a poll earlier this month and found that demand for the device was strong in the U.S., with 55% of people planning to buy a smartphone choosing an iPhone 5 over rival devices. Apple isn't the only smartphone manufacturer to struggle with supplies recently. Google's Nexus 4 Android handset sold out in one day when it went on sale November 13 in Australia, the UK and United States. But on Tuesday, the company announced a new wave of devices were in stock and available for purchase. Google is not releasing sales numbers for the Nexus 4. Samsung's Galaxy S III has also been selling fast across the U.S. According to Strategy Analytics, the Galaxy S III was the top selling smartphone in the world in the third quarter of 2012, knocking the iPhone out of the top spot for the first time in years. The iPhone 5 wasn't yet on sale, so the race for top smartphone of 2013 is still up in the air.","Apple Stores have healthy supplies of iPhone 5s, analysts say .

"(CNN) -- Even hardened race fans, accustomed to witnessing spectacular crashes, were stunned to see the shattered body of 20-year-old race car driver Kevin Ward Jr. sprawled on a New York dirt track Saturday night. He had been run over and killed by a car driven by Tony Stewart, one of the most famous, charismatic and controversial drivers on the $3 billion-per-year NASCAR race circuit. Much of the public's interest in Stewart undoubtedly derives, not only from his winning record but also from his tough guy, bad boy image reminiscent of the sport's early rough-and-tumble days. That image will certainly be one of the things authorities in New York will be looking at when trying to decide whether to close this case as a tragic accident or to press forward with criminal charges. The preliminary signals from the Ontario County Sheriff's Office would indicate a favorable outcome for Stewart. Sheriff Philip Povero has announced that the Ward tragedy is viewed as an ""on track crash,"" and that to date there was no evidence of ""criminal intent."" The sheriff did hedge a bit by saying that the ""investigation was continuing."" The sheriff has undoubtedly been carefully reviewing the amateur video of the crash. It depicts Stewart's car in close proximity to Ward's car coming out of Turn 2 in the race. Ward's car then appears to be pushed into the outside wall, forcing his car out of the race. Ward then appears to exit his vehicle angrily and charges on to the racetrack, pointing in the direction of Stewart's and other drivers' swiftly approaching cars. In graphic and stunning video footage, young Ward is hit, apparently by the right rear tire of Stewart's vehicle, causing him to be dragged down the track to his death. We can expect that Povero will continue his investigation by interviewing witnesses and undoubtedly obtaining copies of other videos taken from different angles. He will likely consult with experts in racing. His key questions: 1. Was Ward's decision to stand in the track, so close to moving vehicles unusual? 2. Should Stewart, knowing he may have struck Ward's car, have anticipated a problem when approaching the turn as a ""yellow flag"" had been thrown warning drivers to proceed cautiously as an accident or debris ahead was likely? Povero will be working in close conjunction with the Ontario County District Attorney, R. Michael Tantillo, a seven-term veteran of criminal investigations and trials. Tantillo supervises a staff of about 10 attorneys that serves a county with a population of about 107,000 residents. New York, on average, prosecutes 5% of vehicular accident death cases as criminal matters. Most cases are viewed as tragic accidents caused by either driver or pedestrian negligence. Cases prosecuted criminally usually involve charges of drunken or drugged driving. So far no allegations of intoxicated driving have emerged in the Stewart/Ward investigation. In this case it will be impossible to know what was going through Stewart's mind as he approached the Ward vehicle under the warning of a yellow flag. To prosecute this case as an intentional murder or even as a more serious form of manslaughter, there would have to be proof that Stewart ""intentionally"" aimed his car at Ward seeking to kill or injure him seriously. Stewart's intent here is impossible to prove regardless of his bad boy reputation unless he were to confess to an intentional murder. I think it's safe to say that is not going to happen. Prosecutors will next examine whether Stewart operated his vehicle with ""depraved indifference,"" ""recklessness"" or ""criminal negligence"" at the track that night. Evidence of such conduct would be necessary to support any nonintentional murder, manslaughter or criminally negligent homicide charge. The evidence supporting criminal charges is conspicuously absent given what we now know about the case. Ward recklessly choose to walk into an active and highly dangerous racetrack exposing himself to injury or death. An experienced professional driver such as Stewart had a right to expect that his fellow drivers would conduct themselves in a safe and professional manner during the race. Collisions are a common part of the race scene, and one would expect a driver in Ward's vulnerable position to get off the track and out of harm's way immediately. Stewart was, no doubt, shocked to see Ward in the roadway pointing in his direction as he approached the turn again. In fact, Stewart's car appears to fishtail slightly, indicating an attempt to avoid contact with Ward. In determining whether Stewart's conduct was reckless or criminally negligent, the conduct of the other drivers in the race will be examined. They appear to be proceeding at a similar speed as Stewart under the yellow flag warning. They too were probably surprised to see Ward positioned in such a dangerous place. The evidence supporting criminal charges is just not here. In the end, all signs point to a red flag for any criminal charges against Stewart in this tragic accident arising from America's most popular summer sport.","NASCAR driver Tony Stewart's car hit and killed driver Kevin Ward Jr. during race .

"(CNN) -- Sarah McLachlan, the Grammy Award winning singer and songwriter whose ballads helped so many of us through heartache, breakups and loss, was barely out of her teenage years when her first album was released back in 1988. Now, she's a 46-year-old divorced mom of two girls touring the country to promote her seventh full-length solo album, called ""Shine On."" ""I'm a whole hell of a lot older,"" she joked, when I asked her, during a casual conversation at CNN's studios earlier this week, how much her life has changed. McLachlan credits her success in the '90s, fueled by memorable hits such as ""I Will Remember You"" and ""Angel,"" with allowing her to take time off, have children and be a full-time parent. Her girls, now ages 7 and 12, have traveled on tour with her since they were babies. ""They're the great leveler because they couldn't care less what it is that I do for a living,"" she said with a laugh. The three-time Grammy Award winner and Canadian-born singer didn't quite set out on her career to empower women, but that's what she's done. She spearheaded the Lilith Fair, a concert tour comprised of only female artists and female-led bands in the late 1990s and again in 2010, which raised millions for charities. During our mom-to-mom chat, we talked about her biggest worries as a parent, what she admires about the singer Lorde and why her sex life is thriving. The video above and this transcript of our conversation have been edited for length and clarity: . Kelly: What do you worry about most as a parent? Sarah: Well, social media. I think Facebook is a really dangerous tool in the hands of kids. I really don't think they should be allowed on it until they're 18 or 20 years old because it's a weapon, basically. It's also a great tool but if you're not psychologically evolved enough and aware and empathetic to other people's issues. That concerns me a lot, which is part and parcel why (my daughters) are on computers because they have them at school but I really limit the time they're on them and I say, ""Let's go live in the real world. Let's go play. If you want to talk to your friends, bring them over to the house or go over to their houses and actually play."" I hear these kids hang out at each other's houses and they just ... Kelly: They're all sitting on their phones ... Sarah: I am the biggest jerk on the planet because (my older daughter is) one of the only kids that doesn't have the iTouch or whatever. I say, ""You know what honey, when you are out there in the world and I don't know where you are and we have to stay in contact then you can have one. Right now, I'm a car service. I drive you everywhere and I pick you up from wherever you go."" Kelly: You have commented about performers such as Lorde who posted unretouched photos of herself, basically saying here I am, flaws are OK. How important do you think that is for our girls? Sarah: I think it's imperative because when I grew up, I don't think I even knew ""Vogue"" magazine or any of that stuff. I didn't have any issues with my body. I wasn't overweight, I wasn't skinny. I have a fast metabolism but I just eat and I wear the clothes I wear and I never really even gave it much of a thought. There's just so much pressure on these girls these days. They're looking at all the different teen stars who are wearing hardly anything. Kelly: How important do you think female role models are? Sarah: I think they're imperative. ... Someone like Malala Yousafzai speaking out for girls' education, getting shot and then not dying but rising up and becoming an international superstar and an international heroine. Those kinds of examples of strength, and strength of beliefs and just standing up for what you believe in and not backing down, I think are so imperative. Kelly: Where do you think we are when it comes to the state of women in our world, in our society? Sarah:  There's still a glass ceiling. I think we've come a long way. There are way more women in powerful positions (as) CEOs. There's still a huge discrepancy between how many women are in power in companies and how many men, and inequality in pay ... but we're making strides, absolutely. But now there's this whole thing of having it all. There's no such thing as having it all. There's no such thing as balancing it all. It's a tricky, slippery slope. It's a tightrope that we walk every day and some days we do it really well, and other days we fail miserably at it. Kelly: So let's talk about sex, shall we. (Sarah revealed in a recent interview that she's had more sex this year in her new relationship than she's had in her life, so I had to ask her about that!) Sarah. Oh OK. Kelly: I know we just met but you mentioned in an interview that that part of your life seems to be thriving in your relationship with former NHL player Geoff Courtnall. Sarah: I mean, yeah, there was a long dry spell of a number of years where I didn't date, didn't have a partner, so I was just on my own, with my girls, and yeah I met Geoff. Kelly: Many women in the latter half of their 40s are not necessarily enjoying that same kind of experience. Sarah: No, and it was sort of like a resurgence for me, for sure, because I didn't have sex for years and then all of a sudden, you sort of think, everybody says, what is it, you don't use it you lose it, right, and I thought, oh no, it came back, really quickly. (She laughs.) Kelly: Better than ever. Sarah: Better than ever. Kelly: I have to stop because I am being obnoxious and embarrassing. You have experienced so many things -- obviously your divorce, you left your original management company, a new relationship, raising your children ... Sarah: Lost my dad. Kelly: ""Shine On"" is about all of that, right? Sarah: It's about going through your 40s and all the changes. We don't get to that point in our lives unscathed. We're losing our family members. I lost my brother last November to bowel cancer so there are so many big changes that happen in our 40s, and it's sort of that tipping point of I'm in the second half of my life. To a certain degree I get to choose what this is going to look like. How do I want it to look? And it's sort of a reassessing of everything and I thought I'm so lucky, I'm so blessed. I have so many amazing things that have happened to me. I have my health, I have my kids' health, I have great friends and family. I just want to suck the marrow out of every day that I have left because you just don't know. You don't know when your time is and I want every day to count. Kelly: Absolutely and also important to you, The Sarah McLachlan School of Music for at risk and underserved kids in your community. How important is it to give back? Sarah: To give of yourself, it's like a drug. And when I did Lilith, I made a lot of money and I thought, what am I going to do? I don't live a crazy lifestyle. I have all this extra money. I want to do something important with it. ... We gave over $7 million to charity through Lilith over the three years and so I started the music school because I looked around in Vancouver and thought what do we need? What do kids need? What did I need? I needed music and there are a lot of kids that don't have music in schools anymore. I guess it's the first thing that gets cut from funding. And so we started a small project. It was about 200 kids and now we have over 700 this year. We're going to have over 1,000 kids in the program starting next year 13 years in. Kelly: A tour, a new album, how do you top this, Sarah McLachlan? And what is next? Sarah: I have no idea. Like my kids, I live in the moment. I can't help it. I have a very hard time looking forward, and thinking about what's coming next. I'm just enjoying every moment.

"(CNN) -- Raising the minimum wage continues to be a top Democratic economic priority, insisting that higher pay is critical to helping lift the working poor out of poverty. Some members of Congress put their money where their mouth is. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio is one Democratic lawmaker who took the ""live the wage challenge"" -- to live on pay of $7.25 per hour for one week. The effort promoted by Americans United for Change, an advocacy group funded in large part by labor unions, was established to mark the fifth anniversary of the last federal increase in the minimum wage. Its generic calculation estimates those earners, after housing and bills, have $77 for the week for food, gas, entertainment and emergencies. A family of five and $154 . Ryan and his wife, who did the late July challenge with him, had $154 for his family of two pre-teen children and a newborn. President Barack Obama and Democrats in Congress have advocated lifting the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour. But many Republicans oppose that, saying that it would cause economic hardship for businesses and lead to job loss or stalled employment growth. As the challenge began, Ryan, whose congressional salary pays him 11.6 times the minimum wage, said he was ""nervous about the whole thing."" But he knew that if he ran out of money before the end of seven days, the only consequence would be losing the challenge. He would be able to dip into his bank account and buy things he needed. An early obstacle . So why even do it? ""Because the alternative is to look the other way,"" he said. About 22% of his constituents in his Akron district live on the minimum wage. So with $154 in his pocket, he ran into his first roadblock by noon on the first day -- the unexpected kind of expense that can throw a low-wage worker's budget into a tail spin. His wife, who is at their home in Ohio, said their newborn needed Vitamin D drops and some other incidentals that cost about $25. ""A few hours in and we're already recognizing the challenges,"" he said in his office on Capitol Hill. Anticipating his weekend ahead, Ryan said he was going to have buy hamburger meat and not steak, sardines instead of salmon. Or forgo meat altogether for rice and beans. He and his wife planned out their meals and their grocery list and clipped coupons. Also out for the weekend -- a family trip to the drive-in. ""We're probably going to have to stay home and rent a movie,"" he said. Can't afford it . Back home, the Ryan family didn't even do that. His kids stepped in and told him they couldn't afford it. What they did do is eat a lot of pancakes and ""lucked out"" one night, not having to pay for dinner by going to a friend's picnic. But summer camp for his 10-year-old daughter busted their budget. With two days to go in the challenge, it was time for him to travel back to Washington (a cost not included in the rules). Ryan had a little more than $4 left. He spent his last few dollars on trail mix from the convenience store in the basement of a House office building. Actually, it cost a bit more than what he had left so he had to dig into his pre-challenge pocket to pay the difference. 'We didn't make it but it was a great experience,"" he said. Gubernatorial candidate goes homeless to prove point . Ryan said he was, to a small extent, able to understand the challenges of living on the minimum wage. He admitted that he and his family were going to eat even if they don't meet the challenge and that many families go to the food bank or just don't eat if they run out before the next paycheck. But he said he learned valuable lessons. A curveball . ""One little small curveball can really throw you for a loop. Then you have stress. And ... stress makes you sick, then it drives up health care costs,"" he said. ""It really drove the point home to me that all of these things are interconnected and if we don't start approaching our economy, our health policies, our food policies as ... interconnected, we're never going to solve the problem."" Ryan logged his journey on his Facebook page. It led to a discussion that included more than 600 comments. Many of them from low-wage workers who say he could never understand what they go through. Here's one comment by Eric M. Chaffin: ""Really and this is who is an appointed Congressman. The audacity to post this is out of my realm of belief. So sorry you had to eat trail mix to get through one afternoon. Thank GOD you and your family didnt have to survive on Ramen Noodles, Bologna, and Mac and Cheese like so many of us out there week to week. Smh."" That's the point . And Amanda Callaway wrote, ""Trying paying rent and bills and feed your family and put gas in a very unreliable car because you can't afford anything reliable then when it breaks down and you got to pick what bill wont get paid so you can fix your car."" Ryan's response: ""You are talking about the minimum wage right now."" And that's the point, he said. ""There is no way my wife and I could simulate the stress levels and decision making that has to go into living on a minimum wage,"" he said. ""Our job (in Congress) is to go understand to the best we can what our constituents need and I'm not going to apologize for that,"" he said.","Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio took the minimum wage challenge .

"(CNN) -- Some travelers never stray from giant hotel chains, preferring familiarity and the reassuring presence of a pants press. For those willing to throw their loyalty points to the wind and spend a few extra dollars, there's the world of boutique hotels. The ""boutique"" concept has become overused in recent years. Some hoteliers think funky wallpaper, scatter cushions and an in-room iPod dock are enough to justify the label. Europe's latest crop of high end boutiques are a far cry from this, bridging historical architecture with cutting-edge design to create destinations that are as much an attraction as the surrounding landmarks. These are hotels that exude so much style, their customers won't care where the pants press is. Here are some of the best celebrating their first summer: . Chiltern Firehouse (London) The 26-room Chiltern, which opened in spring, is the first property outside the United States for Andre Balazs, the man behind L.A.'s Chateau Marmont and The Mercer in New York. Located in a former fire station in London's Marylebone district, the hotel's Firehouse's restaurant attracts celebs like Robert Pattinson and Lindsay Lohan. It also attracts an occasional crowd of paparazzi photographers outside. The kitchen is equally star-studded, with Nuno Mendes of Portugal's Michelin-starred Viajante supplying the dishes. Good for visiting: The clothing boutiques in nearby Marylebone High Street frequented by the same Hollywood stars staying at the hotel. Chiltern Firehouse, 1 Chiltern St., Marylebone, London; +44 20 7073 7676 . Miss Clara Hotel (Stockholm) With 92 rooms decked out in neutral hues, along with arched windows, marble baths and parquet floors, Miss Clara breathes life into a former girls' school while retaining the building's art nouveau features. Open since spring, the hotel has a brasserie-style restaurant that combines Nordic cuisine with plates such as pulled Moroccan lamb with harissa yogurt. Good for visiting: The city's new Abba museum, on the island of Djurgarden. Miss Clara Hotel, Sveavagen 48, Stockholm; +46 8 440 67 00 . Hotel Vernet (Paris) It's hard to stand out in Paris, but the sleek modern design features of the 50-room Hotel Vernet in the city's 8th arrondissement does its best to make a statement. There are walls of woven copper thread and abstract-patterned carpets, all under a classic French glass roof. The hotel features a resident DJ, but the real attraction are bathrooms fitted with Carrrara-marble basins, brass taps and glass mosaics. Good for visiting: The ritzy shops of the Champs Elysees, just a champagne bottle's throw away. Hotel Vernet, 25 Rue Vernet, Paris; +33 1 44 31 98 00 . Cromlix House Hotel (Dunblane, Scotland) Scottish tennis player Andy Murray is behind this extensive renovation near his hometown, which opened in April to almost as much applause as his long-overdue 2013 Wimbledon victory. The 34-acre grounds include tennis courts (of course) and host activities such as archery and a mini Highland games. There's also a farm-to-table restaurant, conservatory, chapel and loch. The 15-bedroom Victorian Perthshire mansion is packed with Scottish antiques. Good for visiting: Leighton Library -- Scotland's oldest private book collection open to the public.

OD Port Portals (Mallorca, Spain) Whitewashed rooms, a 1960s glam ambiance and an inviting pool area welcome guests at OD Port Portals, a 77-room hotel opened in April in Puerto Portals, western Mallorca. Junior suite guests receive either a Smart Cabriolet car (for use during their stay) or a driver, making it easy to trail the jet-set crowd in this affluent port town. Food in the restaurant is eclectic and health conscious. Good for visiting: Costa d'en Blanes beach or the nine-hole Bendinat Royal Golf course. OD Port Portals, Calle Tomas Blanes Tolosa, 4, Mallorca, Spain; +34 971 675 956 . Praia Verde Boutique Hotel (Castro Marim, Portugal) Opened in April, this low-slung 40-suite hotel surrounded by pine forest on Portugal's eastern Algarve coastline is set up for long stays. Guests bunk in cozy rooms but each suite has its own kitchenette with fridge and stove, plus a balcony to soak in the view of salt flats and white-sand beaches. Artisan groceries are available on site from a grocery store linked to the hotel's family-style A Terra restaurant. Good for visiting: The National Forest and the traditional Portuguese town of Cacela Velha. Praia Verde Boutique, Castro Marim, Portugal; +351 281 530 600 . Hotel Son Ametler (Mallorca, Spain) Another new venture on the Balearic island of Mallorca, this hotel is located away from the main tourist towns, in the foothills of the Tramuntana mountains. Surrounded by olive, fig and lemon trees, there's a farmhouse feel to Son Amelter, but accommodations in the eight-room restored manor is far from rustic. There's an outdoor pool with sweeping views of the countryside, Mallorquin stone in the rooms and Italian stucco walls in the bathrooms. Dinner is served al fresco three nights each week.

Lake Geneva Hotel (Versoix, Switzerland) It may only have three stars, but the Lake Geneva Hotel substitutes internal luxury for external dazzle. The 103 rooms are stylish enough, with muted hues highlighted by a pop of orange color. Then there's the views. Stellar vistas across the lake and Swiss Alps can be enjoyed from window seats in many of the rooms and suites, or from the terrace of the hotel's O'Five Mediterranean restaurant. Good for visiting: Near the Versoix railway station, the hotel is a handy weekend escape from Zurich and is close to beaches, equestrian centers and the Favarger chocolate factory.

"(CNN) -- In between taking care of their families, working and trying to keep up with everyday life, many Americans have caught at least a couple stories about Syria. Many probably know that clashes between government forces and protesters who want the country's president to relinquish power have become increasingly bloody over the past several months. Much of that violence has been represented in online videos, ostensibly that Syrians have posted, suggesting the slaughter of children and families. It's horrible. No one would argue anything else. But there is violence in many corners of the world. Why should what's happening in Syria be especially important to Americans? It's clear a lot of people think it's not. Several readers reacted to Tuesday's top story on CNN about Syria by commenting: ""Zzzzzz not our problem"" and ""Anyone surprised? *yawn*."" ""We are afraid to ask this question -- 'Why care?' -- because it's like saying we don't mind that there's a humanitarian crisis happening or that people are suffering,"" said Hillary Mann Leverett, a Washington-based professor, blogger and one of the nation's foremost Middle East and Syria experts. She is a former National Security Council adviser to President George W. Bush and has interviewed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad for a book about Syria authored by her husband, Flynt Leverett, also a Middle East expert. ""People have to know it's allowed to take a discussion beyond the human suffering,"" she said. ""There are huge, practical consequences for the United States when it comes to Syria."" Like what? CNN asked Hillary Mann Leverett; Joseph Holliday, a former U.S. soldier turned foreign policy analyst; and Robert Zarate, a geopolitical strategist with Capitol Hill experience, to explain why Americans should care about Syria. 1. Geography. Think of Syria as the Middle East's core. When it's weak and destabilized, the body is susceptible to serious injury. Violence in Syria could easily spill into bordering Iraq, where the United States recently ended a war that ran from March 2003 to December 2011 and where U.S. troops and American civilians still work. Beyond Iraq, Turkey, a U.S. ally, borders Syria as do Jordan and Lebanon. If Lebanon is shaken too badly by conflict in Syria, Lebanon could fall into a civil war as it did decades ago, Holliday said. That kind of conflict would spark yet another serious political and diplomatic problem that the United States would inevitably have to address. 2. Al Qaeda. The United States' No. 1 enemy would appreciate another failed state from which to operate in the Middle East. 3. Iran. Syria supports Iran. Iran has had a contentious relationship with the United States for decades. Remember Bush's ""Axis of Evil""? That trifecta was Iran, North Korea and Iraq. ""Syria is Iran's arm in the Middle East,"" Zarate said. ""Iran has used Syria as a staging ground to train and support militants who have crossed into Iraq to hurt our troops and to train for other terrorist activities."" Each expert CNN spoke with pointed out that Iran has a nuclear program. Whether it has capabilities for nuclear weapons is something the United States and most of the world doesn't know. 4. Oil prices. Though Syria produces far less oil than Libya, for example, violence in Syria could affect global oil speculation and prices, Leverett said. Ultimately, that affects how much American consumers pay at the pump. 5. The economy, stupid. Leverett and Zarate note that many in the United States may not think about the Iraq war now, but they say it's important not to forget that war cost an estimated $1 trillion. Whether one supports or opposes military intervention in Syria, the costs incurred by any approach will affect the American economy. 6. Global reputation. ""People around the world are looking for some kind of consistency in our foreign policy, and we've been criticized for not having that, not having anything close to consistency during the Arab Spring,"" Zarate said. The United States intervened, with NATO leading the way, in Libya. In 2011, Washington supported, at least in words, the Egyptians in their revolt against then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, he said. Each time, the United States argued that those actions were in accordance with America's national values, he said, and its responsibility as a global leader to defend democratic principles.","Experts: Beyond human suffering, Syria has practical implications for Americans .

"(CNN) -- A federal court has granted a stay of execution for white supremacist serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin, hours before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection in Missouri. Franklin is on death row for the 1977 murder of Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in St. Louis. He's been blamed for a total of 22 killings between 1977 and 1980 in a bid to start a race war. He is challenging Missouri's decision to use the drug pentobarbital in its lethal injection protocol, arguing it would violate the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey granted a stay on Tuesday, finding Franklin's lawyers showed the use of pentobarbital carried ""a high risk of contamination and prolonged, unnecessary pain beyond that which is required to achieve death."" An intimate discussion with a serial killer . ""Given the irreversible nature of the death penalty and plaintiffs' medical evidence and allegations, a stay is necessary to ensure that the defendants' last act against Franklin is not permanent, irremediable cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment,"" Laughrey wrote. Another federal judge granted a second stay Tuesday, based on a separate defense petition contesting Franklin's competency. ""The Court concludes that a stay of execution is required to permit a meaningful review,"" U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson wrote. The state is appealing both stays to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Defense attorney Jennifer Herndon said that she expects that court will rule within the next day. The execution warrant window is 24 hours, meaning that if the court rules against the stays, Franklin could still be put to death on Wednesday. ""We're hoping the stays stay in place,"" Herndon said, adding that she would be surprised if both were vacated. Franklin had been scheduled to be put to death shortly after 12 a.m. Wednesday (1 a.m. ET) at the state prison in Bonne Terre, Missouri, about 60 miles south of St. Louis. But Missouri and other states that conduct executions have had to scramble for new drugs after European-based manufacturers banned American prisons from using their drugs in executions. Missouri had planned to use propofol, the surgical anaesthetic made infamous by the death of pop star Michael Jackson. But Gov. Jay Nixon reversed that decision after being warned the European Union -- whose members forbid capital punishment -- might halt shipments of the drug, leading to shortages for medical purposes. In October, the state announced it would use pentobarbital, which would be provided by an unnamed compounding pharmacy. Franklin's lawyers argued that would raise the risk of contamination and a painful death. Nixon denied clemency for Franklin on Monday, arguing Franklin had committed ""merciless acts of violence, fueled by hate."" In addition to the killings, Franklin admitted to the attempted assassinations of Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt in 1978 and civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in 1980. Flynt, who was paralyzed by Franklin's bullet, has called for clemency for Franklin, saying ""the government has no business at all being in the business of killing people."" States scramble for lethal injection drugs . CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","NEW: Another judge grants a second stay on a separate defense appeal .

"(CNN) -- At the foundation of many business empires is a well-stocked library. From Warren Buffet to Donald Trump and Bill Gates, the world's best business brains have been inspired and transformed by books that not only address the business of making money, but of managing time, ethics and morality in business. Strategizing supply chains, intelligent design, smart investment decisions and the power of positive thinking are just some of the critical business skills that top businesspeople have gained from reading books - in some cases lent to them by other business leaders. Business genius, it seems, doesn't come fully formed but is learned, not just from one's own experience, but the experience of others.

"(CNN) -- The National Labor Relations Board's general counsel said Wednesday that McDonald's is an employer. This might not seem like surprising news, but the NLRB directive has the potential to shake up an industry that profits handsomely by shifting responsibility for workers onto franchisees. Before, if there were a labor violation in a restaurant, McDonald's could just say: ""Well, take it with up with the franchise boss. It's not our problem."" The fast-food industry's modern-day sharecropping model often results in wage theft and unfair labor practices, but -- with corporate parents skirting responsibility for conditions they actually control -- leaves low-wage workers holding the bag. This is also common practice in other contracted sectors like agriculture, janitorial, garment and construction. Across our economy, some version of corporate outsourcing, like franchising, is increasingly the norm. Other methods of outsourcing are multiple layers of contractors, using staffing or temp firms to supply workers, and misclassifying employees as independent contractors. The companies thus distance themselves from the labor aspects of their businesses and in so doing, attempt to skip their accountability for front-line workers elsewhere. While this restructuring of employment arrangements may be the reality of work today, it doesn't have to -- and should not -- spell the end of living wage jobs or business responsibility for the work and workers these corporate giants control. Placing responsibility where it should lie, as the general counsel's decision does, is an essential ingredient of a sustainable economy in which people who work for a living can earn a decent living. Fast-food jobs are not simply rites of passage for teens, they are real jobs families rely on to get by. Seventy percent of fast food workers are adults 20 or older, more than a quarter are raising kids, and one-third have post-high-school education. Yet, despite industry growth and rising profits, fast-food jobs are among the country's lowest-paying. Average front-line hourly pay is $8.69, with many jobs paying at or near minimum wage. Many fast-food workers get only part-time hours even though they need full-time work. Roughly 87% receive no employer-provided health benefits, and more than half of the families of front-line workers must rely on taxpayer-funded safety net programs to make ends meet. These conditions have fueled fast-food worker strikes in every corner of the country and protests around the globe. Earlier this year, workers in Michigan, New York and California filed class action lawsuits against McDonald's Corp. and its franchisees, seeking back pay for alleged wage theft. These lawsuits name McDonald's as a defendant because of strong evidence that it exerts substantial control over the operations of the franchise restaurants, leaving them little room to make decisions. In particular, the fast-food giant owns all real estate in its franchised restaurants and charges high rents and royalty fees. It imposes take-it-or-leave-it franchise agreements on franchisees, among other things, requiring them to install company-supplied computer software that tracks data about sales, inventory, and labor costs. These tight controls and oversight can make it difficult for franchisees to run profitably: A 2007 franchiser-commissioned study found that franchisees had higher default rates on Small Business Administration loans than non-franchisees. When companies like McDonald's intervene to such an extent in operations, they should be held responsible along with their franchisees for operations that are not above board. But too many of these corporate parents evade responsibility. Holding lead companies like McDonald's accountable will not portend the death of franchising, as the International Franchise Association argues. It simply means that corporations that exercise sufficient control over franchised operations cannot feign ignorance or disclaim responsibility for franchisees' illegal acts, especially when those acts flow from the business model the lead company imposes. The more realistic and balanced arrangement for all stakeholders -- the corporate parent, franchisee, front-line workers, consumers and the economy overall -- requires that McDonald's and other outsourcers ensure that their franchised operations operate as law-abiding businesses that treat workers fairly. At its most basic level, such accountability means ensuring that franchisees understand what the law requires. But it also means that when a franchisee cheats workers of wages they have earned, the workers should have recourse against the corporate parent as well. Too much is at stake for our economy and our society to allow companies like McDonald's to use franchise and outsourcing agreements that seek to maximize control and profits for them, while absolving them of responsibility for workers and their livelihoods. In holding McDonald's jointly liable with its franchisees, the general counsel's decision seeks to put an end to this charade.","NLRB just ruled McDonald's is an employer and must take responsibility for workers .

"(CNN) -- The argument between government leaders over how to handle and where to house the influx of migrant children from Central America is playing out across a couple of blocks in downtown Atlanta. At the gold-domed state Capitol, Gov. Nathan Deal is complaining that the Obama administration didn't tell officials it was sending more than 1,000 children to Georgia. At Atlanta City Hall, Mayor Kasim Reed says his city would provide a ""safe haven"" for the children. More than 50,000 unaccompanied children have been detained so far this year as they've tried to cross the U.S. southern border. Federal authorities say the rate of apprehension has slowed in recent weeks. The Department of Health and Human Services is charged with finding suitable facilities to house the children while they wait for an immigration hearing or to be reunited with family. Some state and local governments, community organizations and churches across the country have taken children in but some governments are asking not to be considered as a landing place for the kids. Or in Deal's case, complaining about not being told about it. Republican Deal wrote to President Barack Obama last week asking for the federal government to stem the flow of the children to the state saying it was ""unconscionable that your administration"" failed to inform state officials that 1,154 of the kids had been sent there. ""Your administration continues to send refugees to Georgia, while at the same time many mayors and legislators from across the political spectrum have expressed their (and my) desire to reign in the influx of refugees to the state of Georgia. It is my hope that you and your administration will respect this request,"" Deal said in his letter. Reed's position was the opposite, saying Tuesday the minors would be welcomed in his city. ""I'm going to send a message in no uncertain terms to the extent that these children need a safe place, and a safe haven, (and) the city of Atlanta is going to be that,"" the mayor told reporters, according to CNN affiliate WSB. Deal softened his tone on Wednesday after meeting with a group of local Hispanic leaders. He said in a statement that he asked them for guidance and advice about how the state should respond and added the activists told him they thought most of the children in Georgia were placed with relatives. ""For the state to safeguard these children who are here now, we still need more information about their federal status and where they're staying. It goes without saying, these situations involve our public education, public health and public safety resources, and I'm concerned about additional burdens being placed on local taxpayers in Georgia,"" Deal said. ""But I made this pledge to the group: As a state we will let the federal process work. And during the time it takes to accomplish that, I'm sure Georgians will show their compassion toward these children who have undergone harrowing circumstances."" Deal's complaint was similar to one by Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, who said his state discovered the presence of migrant minors there through an online posting by HHS. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel's administration said over the weekend it's willing to house up to 1,000 children in city facilities. ""The influx of unaccompanied child migrants is a growing humanitarian crisis that we can no longer ignore,"" Emanuel said Sunday in a statement. ""While we have our own challenges at home, we cannot turn our backs on children that are fleeing dangerous conditions. We will do our part to ensure that these children are given access to services and treated fairly and humanely."" Rep. Luis GutiÃ©rrez, D-Illinois, a major proponent of immigration reform and someone who has strongly opposed calls for deporting the children after they are arrested, said he is proud to see Chicago ""lead by example"" in trying to find housing for some of the minors. ""Sometimes the greatness of our nation and our city are tested and how we treat children in danger is one of those tests,"" GutiÃ©rrez said in a statement. Earlier this month Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, another major Democratic supporter of the President, proposed two locations in the Bay State to temporarily house undocumented immigrant children, including a federal base on Cape Cod. That proposal has generated a controversy among some Massachusetts residents. These offers follow a dust-up between another Democratic ally, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, and the White House over the issue. O'Malley, who had criticized plans to deport many of the undocumented children, clashed with a senior White House official in a phone call after he asked some of the kids not be sent to a site in his state. ""What I said was that would not be the most inviting site in Maryland,"" O'Malley told CNN Senior White House Correspondent Jim Acosta. ""There are already hundreds of kids already located throughout Maryland."" O'Malley was referring to his phone conversation with White House Domestic Policy Director Cecilia Munoz. O'Malley also told CNN he was open to housing them in other sites in the state. White House mulls steps on immigration it can take on its own .

"(CNN) -- As Congress wrestles with legislation aimed at easing the southern border crisis, the White House is considering steps President Barack Obama can take on his own to address an immigration system widely viewed as broken and in need of reform. One potential option for executive action includes expanding a program allowing those brought to the United States illegally as children to stay without fear of deportation, if they meet certain criteria, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Other possible steps include granting some kind of legal status to the parents of U.S. citizens as well as allowing certain undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits, the sources said. Central American leaders to Obama: We're working on it . ""There are so many ways they could cut this pie and define and protect a class"" of undocumented immigrants, one source said. ""I think only now are they really trying to get into the details of what's possible from a legal perspective, a policy perspective and also what's possible from a political perspective."" More pressing, however, is how to respond to the current border troubles. Tens of thousands of migrant youth from Central America have streamed across the southern border this year, overwhelming related services and creating what most agree is a humanitarian crisis. Children at the border: Why now and what happens next? In the House, Speaker John Boehner told reporters on Tuesday that he believed ""there is sufficient support"" for the a $659 million measure aimed at bringing conservatives on board to pass a funding bill to address the matter. The new GOP plan is smaller than a roughly $1 billion package discussed last week, and significantly less than the $3.7 billion request sought by Obama. Congress is set to leave town at the end of the week for its August recess and some House Republicans are concerned about potential political fallout if they leave Washington without addressing the issue. But a group of conservatives remain dug in over cost. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid acknowledged Tuesday that Democrats could use the GOP border bill as a vehicle to add the Senate's comprehensive immigration reform legislation from last summer, which would negate any need for Obama to act on immigration more broadly. Obama weighs sending National Guard to border . But House and Senate GOP aides argued it would be almost impossible procedurally to marry the two bills. Boehner has made it clear the House will not take up the Senate measure. Due to congressional inaction on immigration reform in general, Obama had asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Secretary Security Jeh Johnson to look at steps he could take to ""fix as much of our immigration system as I can on my own."" In March, the administration announced Johnson would conduct a thorough review of the deportation process to find a more commonsense, humane approach to the practice. That review is now part of the discussions on what executive action the President may take. White House officials have indicated those actions could be significant and sweeping. ""The only question is what's the political blowback going to be?"" said a one source. Immigrants or refugees? A difference with political consequences .","Obama wants options for dealing with problems on his own .
Congress has yet to pass comprehensive immigration reform .

"(CNN) -- Marina Shifrin became an internet sensation earlier this week when she quit her job via a YouTube video that showed her dancing out of her company's office to Kayne West's hit song ""Gone."" The content writer worked at Next Media Animation, a Taiwanese company that produces news videos, and had become frustrated with the lack of creativity in her role. Her post has already been viewed more than 12 million times and just days later spawned a dancing video riposte from her former employer. See also: What can football managers teach you about leadership . In honor of Shifrin's humorous exit video, here's a list of some of the most memorable ways people have left their jobs. Don't hesitate to share any other great examples we may have missed in the comments section below. Resign with a cake . What nicer way to tell your boss ""I quit"" by baking them a cake -- especially if you're leaving to become a baker. That's what Stansted Airport border force worker, Chris Holmes did in April this year, painstakingly icing his parting message on to a tasty looking carrot cake made with coconut, pecans, sultanas and orange butter cream. Such a thoughtful resignation ensured Holmes left his colleagues on friendly terms. ""He leaves with our very best wishes,"" UK Border Force Assistant Director, Bill Form, told the BBC. Whether Holmes cake resignation was consumed by UK border staff or stored away in a chilled filing case for HR purposes remains unclear. Bid adieu with a brass band . A slightly more dramatic exit was delivered to bosses at the Providence Renaissance hotel in Rhode Island by worker Joey DeFrancesco. In a YouTube video from 2011, the disgruntled employee hands his resignation letter to a confused looking superior before being played out of the building by a brass band. ""I hated them, and they hated me,"" DeFrancesco later told HuffPost on the subject of the hotel's management. ""I knew I had to get one last shot at them."" See also: Best and worst TV bosses . Take the emergency exit . In 2010 unruly behavior pushed Jet Blue flight attendant Steven Slater quite literally out the door. After being rudely told where to go by a passenger who stood up too early once the plane had landed, Slater took to the in-flight intercom and, as widely reported, said ""I've been in this business 20 years. And that's it, I'm done."" He then grabbed a beer, ripped off his tie and launched the plane's emergency chute before sliding down to the runway and walking to the staff parking lot. A judge later gave Slater one year's probation for criminal mischief and reckless endangerment. The New York Times op-ed . Goldman Sachs executive director, Greg Smith, decided to leave his high-paying post at the U.S. investment bank in 2012 via a powerful op-ed in The New York Times. ""The corporate culture at Goldman Sachs has been transformed and deteriorated to the point where it became rotten to the core,"" he wrote. ""Clients are viewed as mere 'muppets' who can be fleeced through the investment bank's rapacious greed."" Smith's piece was visceral and highly critical of the banking giant, but he's not the only financial executive to use the printed press to announce a resignation. In 2008, Andrew Lahde took to the pages of the Financial Times to announce the dissolution of his company Lahde Capital Management. In the process, he tore through the likes of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG, with less than flattering words for their fellow staff. See also: There's no escaping robo-boss . In front of an entire nation . Long before the days of social media and YouTube, a public resignation was a trickier act to pull off -- but not if you're one of the UK's leading politicians. In his resignation speech to parliament, then deputy prime minister, Geoffrey Howe, ripped into his boss, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, chastising her for policies on Europe and an inhibiting style of government. See also: Can you land a job with 140 characters . Conservative party colleagues looked on stunned while Thatcher barely turned to acknowledge her long-time colleague. Across the aisle, opposition Labour politicians howled with laughter, whooping at the misfortune of the PM whose politics they despised so much. Only a few days later, Thatcher was ousted by her party and left Downing Street in tears.

"(CNN) -- Given their woeful defending of late you'd think Manchester United fans would want a decent center back to come to the club not another star forward -- albeit one of the world's best. After flying a banner of protest against the reign of former manager David Moyes last March, United fans have been at it again -- this time begging Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Old Trafford. During the first half of Real Madrid's league match at Villarreal on Saturday, a Manchester United supporters club flew a banner over the Estadio El Madrigal reading: ""Come Home Ronaldo."" The stunt, organized by a supporters group calling themselves ""United Real,"" adds to growing speculation about the future of the Portuguese who turns 30 next February. But Ronaldo was quick to dismiss rumors of a move. ""It's all speculation, speaking about my future,"" Ronaldo told Sky Sports. ""My future is Madrid. I'm happy. The season is going well and I'm not talking about my future, it doesn't make sense."" Ronaldo spent six seasons at United from 2003-2009 before moving to Los Blancos for a then world record fee of Â£80 million ($130 million). Back down on the pitch, Ronaldo scored in a 2-0 win over Villarreal as Real Madrid carried on their recent good form in the league while in Manchester, United bounced back from their calamitous 5-3 defeat to Leicester last weekend with a 2-1 win against West Ham United.","Man Utd supporters group fly a banner pleading with Ronaldo to return to Old Trafford .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea Handler has made a clean break from E!. Or at least we assume it was clean, since Handler's final ""Chelsea Lately"" episode Tuesday included one of her infamous celebrity-accompanied shower scenes. Over the past seven years of ""Chelsea Lately"" on the E! network, host Handler has roped two other stars -- friend Sandra Bullock and fellow late night host Conan O'Brien -- into having nude shower fights with her. The running gag was brought to a close on Tuesday as an indignant Ellen DeGeneres climbed into Handler's roomy shower set, fully clothed but wearing a shower cap, demanding answers as to why Handler never had her on the show. ""Is it because I'm a lesbian?"" DeGeneres asked Handler, who, per usual, was stark naked. ""No!"" Handler responded. ""I didn't even know you were a lesbian. I thought you were married to Ryan Seacrest."" You didn't think Handler would say goodbye to E! without landing another joke against the network's patron saint of celebrity news, did you? What we'll miss about 'Chelsea Lately' Throughout ""Chelsea Lately's"" eight-season run, Handler has commandeered an unabashedly salty late night show, which on a typical night included a ring of celebrity trash-talking comedians and a celebrity interview that ran more bawdy than promotional. Those irritated by the Justin Biebers and Kardashians of the world likely found a kindred spirit in Handler, who wasn't ashamed to have open contempt for some of her show's topics. (One of the rumored reasons for Handler's exit was that she just didn't want to talk about Bieber anymore.) It's no surprise that neither the pop star nor E!'s first family participated in Handler's farewell show Tuesday, but there wasn't a shortage of celebrity guests. Handler is known to run with a powerful crew that includes A-list actress Jennifer Aniston. On Tuesday, the former ""Friends"" star joined Sandra Bullock and Mary McCormack for a mock intervention (sit through it until the end; the surprise guest is worth it), and Miley Cyrus also showed up to perform a cover of Roy Orbison's ""It's Over."" Several more famous faces arrived to help sing Handler off the network, from Fergie and Gwen Stefani, to Gerard Butler, Selena Gomez, Dave Grohl and Alanis Morissette. Stefani, who accidentally called ""The Colbert Report"" the ""Colbore Report"" at the Emmys on Monday, poked fun at her mistake by introducing Handler as her ""good friend, Chelsea Hammer."" ""Goodbye to E!, it's time to move on,"" the stars sang in unison before instructing in classic Handler fashion, ""so roll yourself a joint, and have a drink."" On a more serious note, Handler did make some final remarks. ""I want to thank every single person who's shown up for me in the last seven years,"" Handler said. ""I never really got a good chance to be serious and say thank you, and I want you to know that I am grateful for this career."" Handler is moving on to Netflix from E!, where she's expected to produce some comedy specials and deliver a new talk show in early 2016. ""Thank you to my family, and mom I hope you're watching me,"" Handler said in her goodbye speech. ""I'll see you on Netflix!""","Chelsea Handler said goodbye to E! with the final episode of ""Chelsea Lately"" Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- When five-year-old Xiao Ge starts primary school in Guangzhou next year, she won't endure strict discipline and mountains of homework. Unlike the school life of most children in China, her days will be filled with art, music and creative learning at a private Waldorf school. Xiao is part of a fast-growing number of Chinese children whose parents are turning their backs on the state-run education system, which is based on rote learning and limited critical thinking. Instead, they are choosing independently-run schools that use the Waldorf, Montessori, or Reggio Emilia pedagogies. Despite a lack of regulation over these schools, parents prefer the humanistic approach of these classrooms and the perceived softer learning environment. ""Compared with studying under the public system, my daughter will get a healthier education and life here,"" says Xiao's mother, Lu Dan, when we met at the Hairong Waldorf School Xiao is attending in the southeastern city of Guangzhou. As we tour the school, headmaster Wei Yueling, casually dressed in a tweed jacket and sneakers, playfully grabs one of the students by the waist and spins her in the air, making other kids scream with laughter. At a state-run school, a similar scene of student-teacher bonding would be next to unthinkable. Global attention . China has undeniably gained the world's attention for outstanding academic performance. Shanghai's 15-year olds lead in mathematics, science and reading, as seen in the 2013 Pisa survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, rating the performance of children across 65 regions. Urban Chinese families are particularly invested in their children's education. Don Starr, a lecturer at Britain's Durham University, points out in a research paper that these families spend more than 30% of their household income on their children's education, compared to 2% in the UK. But the ""tiger mom, wolf dad"" approach to education is not without consequence. Chinese youth suffer higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem than their peers elsewhere. Last autumn, a 10-year-old boy in the city of Chengdu reportedly jumped 30 floors to his death after failing to write a 1,000-word letter of self-criticism demanded by his teacher. Perhaps in reaction to this phenomenon, China has seen a major expansion of alternative teaching establishments. These schools emphasize a holistic approach to education and use qualitative assessment methods, especially for kindergarten and primary school students. While there are no official figures for the current number of alternative schools in China, headmaster Wei estimates that some 40 schools and as many as 500 kindergartens operate across the country. His own primary school and three kindergartens in Guangzhou have about 300 students, each paying CNY40,000 (US$6,500) a year, with 300 more queuing to get in. Education for the whole family . For Lu Dan and her husband, their choice of school is about much more than their daughter's education. The Waldorf philosophy can be embraced by the whole family. With a focus on developing free-thinking and morally responsible individuals, the humanistic Waldorf concepts offer a sense of relief from the purely materialistic lifestyle that many of the country's new middle class have been caught up in. Two years ago, Lu attended a Waldorf workshop where she met Wei. She recalls becoming immediately captivated by the philosophy. ""It was like a calling, like realizing your destiny,"" Lu says. ""Waldorf became the start of a more relaxed and happier life."" One of the first things the family did was to get rid of their television and computer games, which immediately opened up plenty of time for ""real life and real play,"" says Lu. They are far from alone. Some 40 families have moved to the area where the school is, creating a community for like-minded people. Many parents volunteer for the school, which regularly hosts workshops on Waldorf education and related topics, often featuring experts from abroad. Headmaster Wei studied the Waldorf pedagogy in 2007, after which he left his nine-year career as a photographer to open his first kindergarten. He observes that many parents come to his school with a desire to change their lives, but not knowing how. ""I speak to parents who don't know how to play with their children anymore. They just put them in front of the television screen,"" he says. ""Often the father is working so much and comes home so late at night that the child hardly knows they live in the same apartment. After coming to our school they learn good ways to be with their children. They get more quality out of life. Waldorf is a therapeutic form of education that can help the whole family."" Doubts over authenticity . Some say, however, that alternative schools are proliferating out of control. There are few regulations around the growth of these private schools. The U.S.-based Montessori Foundation and the Association of Waldorf Schools both offer online courses for those interested in starting a school. Teacher education programs are also available involving at least one year of study. However, as the demand for these schools go up in China, some are hastily opened without a full understanding of the philosophy behind the brands. Gina Lofquist, the director of the Montessori education program at Xavier University in the U.S., sees the number of Montessori schools explode in China, but doubts that there are enough qualified teachers to fill the new classrooms. ""I've been to so-called Montessori preschools where there was not a trace of Montessori material,"" says Lofquist. ""Instead, they had a big flat screen television in the middle of the room, something that goes totally against our beliefs. There's no way to train enough teachers for all those new schools. A lot of money is being made from these franchises but the parents are not getting what they pay for."" The same situation can be seen at other private schools, including Waldorfs, according to several teachers and parents in Guangzhou and Hong Kong that we spoke with. Despite the growing interest in alternative education forms, most Chinese parents are still reluctant to hop on the bandwagon. The biggest fear is that opting out of the state-run system will lower their child's chances at passing the notorious ""gaokao,"" the national college entrance exam that determines which Chinese university a student will enter. Lu Ziwen, professor of English language at Central China Normal University and a member of the state English curriculum standard team, is far from convinced by alternative education. Less homework, he argues, is not the path to future success. ""Many parents think that you should not let the child lose at the starting line,"" he says, referring to a popular proverb. All this seems far removed from Xiao Ge who is happily playing on the swings in the school playground, unconcerned about future exams and career prospects. Instead, she is putting all her energy into being just a child.","Chinese parents seeking alternatives to rote learning in state-run schools for their young children .
Holistic education philosophies affect not only the student, but the student's family lifestyle as well .
Lack of regulation over new alternative schools may become a problem ."
"(CNN) -- Facebook will soon be using your Web browsing to help decide which advertisements you see. A new Facebook system will use your activity on other websites to send you what Facebook thinks are ads about your current interests. Advertisers will, in effect, be bidding to get their ads in front of you. Here's an example: Say a Facebook user visits a travel website and clicks on a page about a vacation package to Las Vegas. If an advertiser has bid on that kind of search, that user could then see ads for discounted trips to Vegas the next time they visit Facebook. ""By bidding on a specific impression rather than a larger group, advertisers are able to show people more relevant ads while also running more efficient and effective campaigns,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in a written statement. The site announced the new system, called Facebook Exchange, to marketers last week. It's expected to begin rolling out in the next couple of weeks. Real-time bidding is already widely used across the Internet. In a blog post, Mike Stiles of Atlanta-based social marketing company Vitrue compared the feature to Google's Ad Words, which pushes an advertiser's ad in front of users when they search for a keyword that advertiser has chosen. ""The underlying principle is that users want relevant ads, advertisers don't want to waste money on misguided ads, and Google wants both users and advertisers to be real happy so they'll come back again and again,"" he wrote. Currently, Facebook ads are targeted based on users' profiles and the companies or other pages they ""like."" Stiles writes that model will still be available for advertisers, but the new one should be more specific. Facebook noted that users will be able to opt out of Exchange by going to the site's About Ads page, by clicking on an ""X"" that appears on the ads themselves or by blocking cookies on their Web browser. The company statement said Facebook won't share any user data with the advertisers and that no advertising controls that users currently have will go away. How do you feel about Facebook targeting ads? Jim Anderson, Vitrue's chief operating officer, said the new system probably won't appear dramatically different to the typical Facebook user. ""It's not going to be discernible to most consumers,"" he said. ""Most people won't notice any difference or, to the degree they can discern a difference, it will be 'Wow ... this is more relevant to me.'' "" And while the ""real time"" nature of the new system will enhance relevance, it won't be perfect, according to Anderson. ""It's possible you might not be served an ad until after you took that trip to Vegas,"" he said, referring to the previous example. ""But without this kind of targeting, you might be served an ad for a trip to Miami, which you weren't considering anyway."" As Web giants like Facebook and Google get better at harvesting user activity, using Web searches for advertising is becoming increasingly popular. According to research firm International Data Corporation, more than $5 billion in online advertising is expected to go to real-time bidding ads in the United States in 2015. That's 27% of what's predicted to be spent, up from less than 10% last year. Facebook, of course, is increasingly under pressure to demonstrate a sustainable advertising model since its stock went public last month. Anderson predicts the site will continue to diversify how its ads work in the coming months. It's sometimes a tricky prospect. It was just revealed that Facebook settled a lawsuit last month by the state of California over its ""Sponsored Stories"" feature. According to reports, Facebook paid $10 million to charity after five users claimed the site broke California law when it used their posts in the feature without paying them.","Facebook Exchange will use Web browsing to target ads .

"HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- When Sean Dolan saw signs being carried by homeless people, he saw an opportunity. Timothy Edwards was homeless for years in Houston, Texas, until he started carrying ""Pimp This Bum"" signs. He and his father wanted to drive people to a Web site, so they created PimpThisBum.com as a marketing tool and gave a homeless man a sign with the Web site's address to hold while panhandling in Houston. Their idea worked. Visitors seeing the sign flocked to the site and in less than two months Dolan received $50,000 in donations and pledges through the site for the man, including a five-week alcohol treatment program donated by Sunray Treatment and Recovery based near Seattle, Washington.  Watch how 'Pimp this bum' saved man » . ""We knew that the same campaign with a sincere appeal and a Web site like helpthehomeless.com would be ignored,"" he said. ""We knew that if we insulted people's sensitivity or appealed to their humor ­ on a subject as sensitive as this we would get their attention."" Kevin Dolan, with more than two decades of marketing and sales experience and his son, Sean, a Web-savvy college student with a small video camera and a passion for volunteer work, got the site off the ground with the help of Timothy Dale Edwards. He has been homeless and living under a busy Houston overpass for more than four years. The Dolans' offer to Timothy Edwards would be a hard one for any homeless person to refuse: $100 cash per day guaranteed, perhaps even more if the campaign was successful. All Edwards had to do was carry a homemade sign advertising ""www.PimpThisBum.com"" while he panhandled each day. For Edwards and his friends it was effortless -- they already carried signs reading, ""Homeless, Please help"" or ""Hungry, Need a days work.""  Watch Edwards describe ""I went through detox"" » . And the Dolans promised monetary donations that came into the Web site would go straight to Edwards. Those who visit can help Edwards directly by donating specific items to him: a cup of coffee, a ham sandwich, a razor, a newspaper subscription or even laser hair removal, karate lessons or a college education. Edwards welcomes the task and insists he is not being exploited. For him, the donations are a welcome change in his life. For years drugs and alcohol were his coping mechanisms, he says. He was told his father left the family when he was only 2 years old, and he says he's always felt no one ever cared about him. But all that changed with the Dolans' offer. ""This is just crazy enough to work,"" Edwards said. ""I'm drinking myself to death under a bridge. I'm watching my friends die left and right, so what have I got to lose?"" Edwards said he has spent years learning whom to trust and how to survive on the street. He's learned where it's safe to sleep and how to panhandle when intersections ""are hittin'."" Edwards sometimes rides the city bus just to stay warm and gathers a group of homeless friends together to rent a motel room just to be able to take a shower. He says homeless life is ""boring, and ... mentally unstimulating,"" and he looks for ways to keep his brain ""active."" ""I try to read the paper. One lady came by and asked me if we needed something, so I said, 'Well, do you have a puzzle book?' Because we do crossword puzzles and Sudoku."" Edwards said. Looking back on how he got to this point is difficult. ""It's a pretty drawn-out story. I'd have to say it's probably mostly my fault. ... I made a lot of poor choices,"" Edwards said, his voice trailing. ""I was filthy. I just didn't feel human anymore."" With this new project, Edwards' said, his life has new meaning. The name of the Web site means little to him. The Dolans have received national attention for their first collaboration, but they also know the site's name is controversial. Edwards said he ""cracked up"" when Sean Dolan proposed the name for the Web site. Not everyone thinks it's funny. Homeless advocates and other critics argue the Dolans' project serves little more purpose than exploitation. Advocate Michael Faenva, who runs a shelter in Dallas, said, ""In the end, this isn't a good strategy to address the problem of homelessness. ... It's not a strategy that's likely to bring help to very many."" Life has changed for Edwards since he began holding that sign. His first step was to shave his beard, mustache and head. The act ""was a symbolic act of change, and embracing the change and moving on to a new stage in my life,"" Edwards said. His last drink was on March 10, before flying to Seattle accompanied by Sean Dolan to begin the comprehensive alcohol treatment program. He has completed the one-week ""detox"" program, and is now participating in five additional weeks of individual and group therapy classes. ""To everybody that thinks I am being exploited, I ask you to think again,"" Edwards said. Sean Dolan is adamant: ""Tim is now a friend."" He describes the relationship as ""one of the most meaningful friendships I've ever had."" Asked what does he say to the critics? ""I tell them to donate ... and get on the Web ... just watch the outflow of support for Tim."" Edwards spends his rehab ""free time"" each night participating in the Web site's chat room, which is full of supportive messages like, ""We love u Tim!,"" ""Hang in there,"" and ""Stay strong, people really do care."" Edwards has started a live nightly Webcast where he answers questions and thanks viewers for their interest and support. ""Rehab is a wonderful thing when you want it,"" Edwards told CNN during a Webcast. But it's also a lot of work. ""The hard part is the mental and psychological stuff, rediscovering myself, so to speak, getting in touch with my heart and my head, and trying to figure out how to deal with life."" Edwards also is getting a crash course on the Internet and hopes it will help him in applying for jobs. Edwards' newfound Internet outlet also gave him another surprise twist. One of the site's viewers happened to be a family member Edwards never knew. After being put in touch through the Web site's creators, Edwards learned that his father had not left the family as he thought, but instead had been searching for him for almost 35 years. Edwards said he is learning more about that side of the family, and family members near Kansas City, Missouri, have become involved in looking for new opportunities and living assistance for him when he leaves Seattle. Kevin Dolan said the project has not only opened new doors for Edwards but also for others like him. The Dolans recently started financial paperwork to create a nonprofit organization, and they hope to duplicate the ""PimpThisBum.com"" model in other cities. Two future ""participants"" have already been identified in Houston; one of them is a good friend of Edwards' named John. On March 28, Edwards will spend his 38th birthday in rehab. He calls the Dolans' project ""a blessing."" He hopes to complete his treatment successfully, secure a job and find a home. ""I'm tired of laying down,"" he said. ""I'm tired of giving up. ... This life is worth fighting for.""","Father-son team launch PimpThisBum.com as stunt to help homeless man .

"(CNN) -- TLC reality star Jill Duggar knocked out two firsts with one wedding. The 23-year-old daughter of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar -- the couple who star in the reality show ""19 Kids and Counting"" along with their massive brood -- had her first kiss on Saturday as she tied the knot for the first time. Jill's romance with her new husband, Derick Dillard, has been swift but old-fashioned. The two were introduced by Jill's dad, who connected with 25-year-old Derick while he was doing missionary work in Nepal. After starting their courtship in November, the couple announced their engagement in April. ""When my dad first introduced Derick and I, we spent hours texting, calling, and talking on Skype while 8,000 miles away from each other. And when we finally met in person in Nepal, we knew within days that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together,"" Jill Duggar told ABC News at the time. Because of their shared Christian faith, the couple didn't hold hands until they got engaged, and saved their first kiss for their wedding day. ""We're just really trying to keep our relationship focused not on the physical but really just more on communication and continuing to learn more about each other,"" Jill has said. ""We're saving our first kiss and things beyond that for our wedding."" And on June 21, Jill and Derick finally had the moment they'd been waiting for. In front of more than 1,000 guests at a church in Springdale, Arkansas, the couple said their ""I do's"" and shared their first lip-lock. Derick, who's whisking his new bride off to an undisclosed location for their honeymoon, told People magazine that he supported their courtship's lack of physical contact. ""You can really get to know each other on every level without the physical part of it,"" he said. ""I am the most blessed man to have Jill.""","Duggar married Derick Dillard .

"(CNN) -- I thought I could drink. I thought I could eat. I even thought I could sing. Then, Chinese New Year (CNY) 2013 happened. I didn't just lose my CNY cherry last year; it was ripped out of me, the flesh devoured and the stone spat back in my face. I wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to fall in love and snuggle up and giggle childishly -- like all first times should be. Instead I was shocked, slightly abashed and in just enough pain to hope I didn't have to do it again soon. CNY was, as far as I understood, an annual get together for families and loved ones to enjoy each other's company. So when my then girlfriend (now wife) suggested we go to her hometown to meet her extended family for the first time, I agreed -- with all the bouncy enthusiasm of a puppy being led to the vet. I was happy simply to be going somewhere, simply to be included, blissful in my ignorance of the anguish that awaited. What unfolded was an education in consumption that nearly matched in three days what I learned in four years as a Scottish university student. The CNY myth . If you do a little research into CNY, you'll be told it's a two-week period during which everyone goes home to honor their ancestors, worship deities and partake in superstitions and dragon dances that hark back centuries. Right. And Westerners celebrate Christmas by singing hymns, praising St Nicholas and distributing wealth and good cheer to the needy. It may go on in some places, for a short while, but for the most part, in most families, it's about drinking and eating far too much and trying not to disembowel each other over a Pictionary board. The real CNY -- at least my version of it -- is a similarly non-traditional tradition that revolves around food, arguments and of course baijiu, the sickly, sticky distilled spirit with more kick than a startled mule. It is this 100-proof (57% ABV) pungent, nasal-cavity-searing liquid that will forever tinge my memories of that first CNY experience. Baijiu or Bacchus? It started with a 15-hour train ride from Shenzhen to Jiujiang -- because we wanted to ""do it properly, like locals."" That's 225 million locals to be precise -- the number of people who traveled by train during 2013's CNY. It involved quantities of baijiu that don't make any sense to our numerically challenged brains. Eleven billion liters were consumed in China in 2012 -- that's one third of all spirits consumed worldwide -- and my new family seemed convinced they could help surpass that in 2013. The drinking of baijiu at CNY is a ceremonial affair that goes like this: there will be one uncle at the table who quietly designates himself the ""baijiu assassin"" -- empty baijiu glasses and sober people are his prey. His mission, he has decided, is to ensure no one can stand up from the table without stumbling and giggling. His weapon of choice is the toast, which works like this: he will stand, proffer his glass of baijiu toward another member, say something auspicious about health and fortune for the coming year, and then drink. The irony of that act has not yet been grasped, it seems. In order to acknowledge and accept the toast, the toastee must also stand and drink.

And if you're a ""yingguoren"" (Englishman) or other ""laowai"" (foreigner) introduced to the group for the first time, you'll often be the subject of these toasts. Body slams .

At one point, one of my new ""cousins,"" whose body mass was at least twice mine, decided to pay the ultimate respect by toasting me with three consecutive tumblers full of the stuff.

But I was no worse than one of my new cousins, who appeared to make the rookie mistake of confusing volume for tunefulness. Cousin number one, he of the three-glasses toast, revealed exactly why he was so ""respectful"" at dinner as he proceeded to dispossess me of loose change in a game of liar's dice.

"(CNN) -- When you think of potentially fatal threats at the beach, you probably think of sharks or riptides. You probably don't worry about the sand. But that unexpected killer has now claimed at least three lives in the United States this summer. Nine-year-old Isabel Grace Franks died at a Lincoln City, Oregon, beach on Friday, when a hole she was digging in the sand caved in and buried her, authorities said. ""We heard screaming,"" Tracey Dudley, who was staying at a nearby hotel, told CNN affiliate KATU.  ""At first we thought, you know, it was just kids. But it was like screaming and screaming and screaming."" ""Her and her siblings were digging a big hole in the sand,"" Lincoln City police Sgt. Brian Eskridge said. ""She was sitting inside, and the hole collapsed. We believe she was under the sand around five minutes."" Franks, her family and friends were visiting the beach from Sandy, Oregon. Police and firefighters dug her out. She was unconscious and not breathing. Emergency crews performed CPR on her and transported her to a hospital, where she was declared dead. Mourners left flowers, candles and notes near where she died. Before the emergency workers arrived, beachgoers had frantically tried to dig her out, but the sand kept collapsing back into the hole, Eskridge said. That's a common problem when someone gets buried at the beach, Tom Gill of the United States Lifesaving Association said Sunday. ""Once the sand starts collapsing, digging out becomes a technical rescue,"" Gill said. ""It's difficult because the sand keeps collapsing back into the hole, and the more people gathering around, the more difficult it is."" ""It's not unusual for kids to build holes and sandcastles in the sand, but a lot of people don't understand it can collapse,"" Eskridge said. ""It's difficult for people to understand how hard it is to get people out."" Dry sand weighs 100 pounds per square foot, and wet sand weighs 120 pounds per square foot, according to a 2004 study from the Mayo Clinic, entitled ""Accidental Burials in Sand: A Potentially Fatal Summertime Hazard."" ""Dry sand burial can totally engulf and compress a person... with no air pocket for breathing,"" the report said. ""Depending on the age and strength of the child, just 1 foot of sand may overwhelm respiratory and diaphragmatic force,"" But according to the Mayo study, airway obstruction is an even bigger concern than sand stifling lung and diaphragm expansion. ""Although accidental sand burial has its own set of clinical problems, clearing the airway is the main focus of treatment. Airway management at the scene of the incident may be crucial and lifesaving,"" the Mayo report said. The hole containing Franks was big enough for a crouching adult to fit in, witnesses told KATU. Gill said no national standards exist to restrict the depth of holes, though local jurisdictions often set their own rules. For example, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, the USLA's home base, beach visitors aren't supposed to dig holes deeper than knee-level, even for small children, Gill said. There's also no national database of fatal sand collapses, Gill said. They don't happen often, Gill said, ""but often enough that we try to make people aware."" Articles in scholarly journals over the past decade, including the Mayo report, have called for public health and safety officials to be more aware of sand dangers. In June 2007, the New England Journal of Medicine published a letter to the editor entitled ""Sudden Death from Collapsing Sand Holes,"" from Dr. Bradley Maron of Harvard Medical School. Maron counted ""52 documented fatal and nonfatal cases, occurring primarily in the past 10 years, in which persons were submerged after the collapse of a dry-sand hole excavated for recreational purposes."" He said 31 of those 52 people died, and ""the other 21 survived by virtue of timely rescue involving extrication from the sand; many of them required cardiopulmonary resuscitation, performed by a bystander."" Maron's study concluded that collapses were inadvertently triggered by a variety of circumstances, including digging, tunneling, jumping, or falling into the hole. Young children like Isabel Franks aren't the only age group at risk. The two sand-related fatalities earlier this summer were both grown men. A 49-year-old Virginia man died on the beach at North Carolina's Outer Banks on June 23, according to CNN affiliate WTVR. David Frasier of Fredericksburg, Virginia, had to be extracted from a hole approximately 5 to 6 feet deep. A bystander was unable to revive him. And on July 21, in Half Moon Bay, California, Adam Jay Pye was buried alive while tunneling under the sand, CNN affiliate KRON reported. Fire officials said Pye was standing in a 10-foot-deep pit when the sand rushed in around him. CNN's Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report .","Isabel Grace Franks, 9, died Friday, buried in sand at an Oregon beach .

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Julie Bonneau, an unemployed single mother, says a big support group helps her stay positive. EUGENE, Oregon (CNN) -- Julie Bonneau knew it was coming. ""There were five of us, including the owners. I did the books ... and I could see it was getting tight, money was. They just weren't making the money."" It was just before Christmas. ""They let me go, and they knew I was going to sink,"" the 42-year-old single mother recalled. ""Two weeks later, I lost my apartment. No money coming in, no money to pay rent."" For a couple of weeks, she lived in her van -- until it broke down. Now, she crashes on friends' couches, and her three children sleep at her ex-husband's apartment. ""I'm grateful because he was there to pick up the ball when I just couldn't do it anymore,"" Bonneau said. Wherever she goes, Bonneau keeps a packed but organized file: her road map for surviving recession. ""This is a sheet that tells me where free lunches are in the community so that my kids can eat for free,"" she said, holding the stack of papers and brochures. ""I try to stay up on that."" She keeps it handy, and not just to help with her needs. ""I try to carry it so that if I hear of somebody that is struggling, it is like, 'Wait, I know where you can find help.' I know I am not the only person that needs the help."" So does Sharri da Silva. She is the executive director of programs for the Relief Nursery in Eugene, a family-support organization that is being replicated across the state. In the first three months of 2009, it helped as many families as it did in all of 2008. ""And we served over 1,000 children last year,"" da Silva said at the Eugene facility. ""So that's telling you how drastic the increase is. There are newly needy families, and what I mean by that are families who have had jobs, who have had one- or two-parent incomes, who have had a home, might have even been small donors to the Relief Nursery or volunteered their time here. ""And now they are calling us, saying, 'I just lost my job, or my wife and I both lost our jobs, we're losing our home, and we don't even know what the best [support] system is -- so forget how to navigate it.' What we're finding in Oregon is that early childhood and family hunger is drastically increased."" Increased demand but diminished resources -- a cruel irony of the recession is that government and private funding sources are drying up. In the case of Relief Nursery, that means a waiting list of more than 200 families. ""Every single funding source that typically supports us is having a challenge right now,"" da Silva said. ""When we have people calling saying, 'My family doesn't have food' or 'I'm losing my house, and I don't know where to turn,' that is difficult if we can't help them."" Not that there are not some encouraging signs. The Relief Nursery, whose primary mission is helping children and families with a history of abuse and neglect, was trying to combat the hunger problem, only to have its mobile food bank recently destroyed by vandals. When word of the crime spread, there was a dramatic spike in good donations, and a library area inside its building has been converted for food storage. ""We've also started doing what we call a family fun and food night, which is once a month families come and gather and have a fun meal together,"" da Silva said. ""When we started this in January, the first time we held it, we had 30 families attend. And it's been growing as word had gotten out to our families. And last week we had over 170 families come."" Julie Bonneau's family is among them, often after she has spent another frustrating day hunting for work. ""It's really tough,"" she said of the job market in a state where the unemployment rate has doubled in the past year to more than 12 percent. ""I am finding that I am competing with -- that when you apply for a job, now you have 200 other people standing in the same line."" No room in the shelters, either. ""They are full. Everything is full."" Which makes her all the more grateful for the Relief Nursery safety net. Her son Gabriel, who will be 4 in October, comes for three hours a day, which means two meals and playing and activities time that are invaluable to a boy trying to overcome a speech impediment. Twice a week, Gabriel also gets speech therapy at the center. ""It is awesome,"" Bonneau said during a walk in the play area outside. ""I know they are safe. I know they are well taken care of. They support Gabriel. He's got a physical disability, but they meet his needs continuously. I don't have to worry about him being hurt. We have had some major challenges in our life, and I just call Relief Nursery."" Although the job search has been frustrating, Bonneau volunteers a few hours a week at her former employer, hoping that if business picks up some, she will be offered her old job back. And keeping busy, she says, helps her keep her spirits up. ""I have a big support group that encourages me and keeps me positive. I can't lose hope, because my kids will lose hope. I can't let that happen.""","Relief Nursery in Eugene, Oregon, is a family-support organization .

"(CNN) -- In Florida, one could coin a new term for black bears: Pets. Or maybe: Pests. Some have gotten into the habit, it seems, of visiting neighborhoods there, and on Thursday, one was caught literally hanging around -- in a Daytona Beach man's hammock. ""He got in the hammock like he was a tourist or something,"" homeowner Vincent James told CNN affiliate WESH. Usually, James is the one lounging on his back in the white rope mesh hanging between two trees. The bear enjoyed the respite enough to savor it. He -- or she -- stayed in the hammock for about 20 minutes, said photographer Rafael Torres, who snapped pictures of the bear from 60 feet away. Torres' presence did not seem to disturb the wild animal's repose. Residents say the bear has been scrounging for food in the neighborhood since Wednesday, ripping through garbage cans and knocking down bird feeders. Aw, isn't that cute? Torres and James may have enjoyed the visit by the large, furry character lumbering among the ranks of chirping birds and foraging squirrels on their lawns, but other Floridians haven't shared their glee. In April, a black bear attacked a woman in her garage and dragged her out onto the driveway. She claimed it was a posse of five bears that roughed her up, but authorities said it was only one. But there was a handful of black bears roaming the neighborhood at the time of the attack, they said. Don't feed the bears! Wildlife officials also discourage the warm, fuzzy feeling some residents have for the black bears, pointing to the dangers they pose. Wildlife law enforcement officers arrested an 81-year-old woman from Sebring in February for feeding loads of dog food to bears on her property. She dished out up to 18 bowls at a time to furry bunches gathered in her yard. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission warned her multiple times to stop, but she would not, for fear the animals would starve without her. Officers were afraid the bears would get hazardously close to humans, and they killed one bear that was frequenting her feedings. Once a bear feels too at home among people, relocating it doesn't help, the FWC said back then. It will keep coming back.","Homeowner Vincent James watches a black bear get comfortable in his hammock .

"(CNN) -- Year after year Americans ask: When will our economy get better? Injecting more capital into the economy should work -- in theory -- because capital fuels capitalism. Yet this capital sits unused on the balance sheets of corporations, and languishes inert in private equity funds. Davos 2013: Follow the action live on CNN.com . Capitalists seem uninterested in capitalism, even as eager entrepreneurs can't get financing. Businesses and investors sound like the Ancient Mariner, who complained, ""Water, water everywhere -- nor any drop to drink."" At the heart of this paradox is a doctrine of finance employing measures of profitability that guide capitalists away from investments that can create growth. Davos 2013: New year, same old problems? There are three types of innovations. The first are ""empowering"" innovations. These transform complicated, costly products that previously had been available only to a few people, into simpler, cheaper products available to many. The Ford Model T was an empowering innovation, as was the Sony transistor radio. Empowering innovations create jobs for people who build, distribute, sell and service these products. The second type are ""sustaining"" innovations. These replace old products with new. The Toyota Prius hybrid is marvelous -- yet every time a customer buys a Prius, a Camry is not sold. Sustaining innovations replace yesterday's products with today's products. They keep our economy vibrant -- and, in dollars, they account for the most innovation. But they have a zero-sum effect on jobs and capital. Defterios: Why Egypt's transition from its Arab Spring is so painful . The third type are ""efficiency"" innovations. These reduce the cost of making and distributing existing products and services - like Toyota's just-in-time manufacturing in carmaking and Geico in online insurance underwriting. Efficiency innovations almost always reduce the net number of jobs in an industry, allow the same amount of work (or more) to get done using fewer people. Efficiency innovations also emancipate capital for other uses. Without them, much of an economy's capital is held captive on balance sheets, tied up in inventory, working capital, and balance sheet reserves. Quest: U.S. economy to dominate Davos 2013 . Industries typically transition through these types of innovations. The early IBM mainframe computers were so expensive that only big companies could own them. But PCs were an empowering innovation that allowed many more people to own computers. Companies like Hewlett-Packard had to hire thousands of people to make and sell PCs. They then deployed workers to make better computers — sustaining innovations. Finally, the industry began to outsource its operations, becoming much more capital efficient. This reduced net employment within the industry, but freed capital that had been used in the supply chain. The dials on these three innovations are sensitive, but if set in a recurring circle -- with empowering innovations creating more jobs than efficiency innovations eliminate, and the capital that efficiency innovations liberate being invested back into empowering innovations -- the economy is a magnificent machine. The belt of circularity in America's economic engine, however, is broken. The 1982 recovery took the economy's usual 6 months to reach the prerecession peaks of performance. Getting back to the prior peak in the 1990 recession took 15 months. Our economic machine has been grinding for 65 months trying to hit prerecession levels — and it's not clear whether or how we're going to get there. The reason? In America, Japan and Europe, the dials have gone amok. Efficiency innovations are liberating capital, but that capital is being reinvested into still more efficiency innovations. Our economies are generating many fewer empowering innovations than in the past. U.S. thinker George Gilder brings a useful perspective to this puzzle. He teaches that we should be frugal with resources that are scarce and costly, but can waste resources that are abundant and cheap. When the Doctrine of New Finance emerged between the 1930s and 1950s, capital was scarce. We therefore focused on magnifying every dollar put into a company, to maximize revenue and profit per dollar of capital deployed. Executives came to use measures of efficiency that focused on the short term, investing in quick wins in sustaining and efficiency innovations instead of funding empowering innovations that pay off in five years, or often even longer. Read more: All you need to know to be a Davos delegate . The paradox explored in my book The Innovator's Dilemma is that successful companies can fail by making the ""right"" decisions in the wrong situations. We are in the capitalist's dilemma today. Investors continue applying doctrines that were appropriate when capital was scarce. But because today capital is abundant and the cost of capital today is essentially zero, the same rules are the wrong rules. It's as if our leaders in Washington are standing on a beach holding fire hoses full open, pouring more capital into an ocean of capital. We truly are awash in cheap capital -- which means that returns on long-term investments in empowering innovations will yield the same returns as short-term ones. Is there a solution? It's complicated, but I offer three ideas for discussion: . Change the metrics . We can use capital with abandon now, because it's abundant and cheap. But we can no longer waste education, subsidizing fields that offer few jobs. Optimizing return on capital will generate less growth than optimizing return on education. Change the politics . Both parties are wrong on taxing and distributing the capital of the wealthiest 1%. The Republicans are wrong in thinking that the rich create jobs. In reality many of the richest Americans have been investing in efficiency innovations rather than to create jobs. And the Democrats are wrong, because growth won't happen if they distribute the wealth of the wealthy to everyone else. Money will be spent buying sustaining innovations — replacing consumption with consumption, because there are few empowering products to buy. Change tax rates on capital gains . We should make capital gains regressive over time, based upon how long the capital is invested. Taxes on short-term investments should continue to be taxed at personal income rates. But the rate should be reduced the longer the investment is held — so that, for example, tax rates on investments held for five years might be zero — and rates on investments held for eight years might be negative. We must give the wealthiest an incentive to invest for the long term. This can create growth. . We face complicated problems, and mine is a simple model. But I hope it helps us understand that policies that were once right are now wrong, and that counterintuitive measures might actually work to turn our economies around. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Clayton Christensen.","Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen says we are now living in the capitalist's dilemma .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Jackie Gingrich, the first wife of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the mother of his two daughters, died Wednesday in Atlanta, according to the funeral home organizing her arrangements. She was 77. The Almon Funeral Home in Carrollton, Georgia, did not give her cause of death, but Gingrich had battled cancer for years. Jackie Gingrich never talked on camera about her marriage to the former speaker, which ended in 1980. Questions about their divorce have dogged her ex-husband for the past three decades, emerging again in late 2011 as he made a bid for the Republican nomination for president. Newt Gingrich married Marianne Ginther, a 28-year-old congressional staffer, six months after his divorce from Jackie was final. Jackie Gingrich was born Jacqueline May Battley on February 21, 1936, in Columbus, Georgia, the oldest of four children, the funeral home said. She earned a mathematics degree from Auburn College in just three years so her sister, Carol, could start college right after high school, it said. ""Strong in her belief in God, she credited prayer, as well as medicine, for saving her life numerous times,"" the home said. ""For decades, she served as a deacon and a volunteer at the First Baptist Church in Carrollton. She loved her church, her red hat ladies, bridge club, retired teachers lunch bunch and investment group."" Jackie Gingrich taught mathematics at high schools in South Georgia and retired around the time her grandchildren were born so she could spend more time with them, the funeral home said. She spent her last year at an Atlanta retirement home. ""Smart, spunky, determined, funny, a fighter -- she had sparkling blue eyes, a constant smile on her face and loved her family and friends. She was the first in her family to graduate from college and, at a time when math was considered by many to be a man's field, was often the only woman in her college math classes,"" the home said.

"(CNN) -- The fog has been lifted. There is no serious doubt left that Russia is ""now directly involved in the fighting"" in Ukraine, as Geoffrey Pyatt, U.S. Ambassador in Ukraine has said on Twitter. ""Russian supplied tanks, armored vehicles, artillery and multiple rocket launchers have been insufficient to defeat Ukraine' armed forces. So now an increasing number of Russian troops are intervening directly in fighting on Ukrainian territory. Russia has also sent its newest air defense systems including the SA-22 into eastern Ukraine,"" he wrote. This is the step from proxy war to war. It is also probably the end of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempts to prevent the worst through diplomacy. She spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin more than 30 times this year on the phone, much more often than any other Western leader. What Germany tried was to convince Putin to step back from war in eastern Ukraine by using carrots and sticks: Western economic sanctions on the one hand, and on the other the promise of a return to a close partnership with the West if Russia were to stop supporting separatists in Ukraine. For Berlin, which was in the lead in Western negotiations with Russia, the goal of the talks was to give Putin a face-saving exit option that wouldn't look like a defeat. But for Moscow, those talks were meant to achieve Russia's goal -- control over Ukraine. While Russia talked about ""federalization"", which was meant to give regions a veto over the country's core political decisions, Germany talked about ""decentralization,"" a system of administration that would leave the capital in control of Ukraine. Putin's choices . German tactics were built on Russian deniability of any direct involvement. The diplomatic game was based on the pretense that both sides were not much more than concerned neighbors, that Russia was not part of the conflict. But indirect involvement was not enough to hold territory in Ukraine. That's why Putin either had to accept defeat or to step up his efforts and end the pretense of Russian non-involvement. He chose the latter. Putin did so knowing that this would lead to more Western sanctions, more costs for Russia. But he may have gambled that the West would not massively increase sanctions, as the appetite for conflict with Russia is low in many European countries, especially in Western Europe. It is also possible that he may even be ready to accept economic divorce with the West. The West has tried everything to convince Putin to step back from the brink of open war in Ukraine. But it has not worked. The success of the Ukrainian army on the ground has forced Russia to make a choice between ending efforts to bring back Ukraine under Moscow's control -- or moving to open war. Putin had to leave the fog and make a move. The German approach now looks like a failure, but it was worth trying nevertheless. It might have worked. Diplomatic efforts may also have kept Russian involvement to a minimum in the last few months -- they may have caused Putin to keep a low profile, thus allowing Kiev to recover and win back territory. A pause in diplomacy . The West has no ""Plan B."" Merkel's carrot and stick approach had the great advantage of being ""sellable"" domestically: to her coalition partner in Germany, SPD, and in the EU to countries like France, Spain and Italy, which are much less concerned about Russian neo-imperialism than Germany or Poland. More robust tactics won't fly in Germany or in the wider EU. Anything that appears to raise the risk of direct military confrontation with Russia will be vetoed. The only possible option now is to increase sanctions. Diplomacy will take a pause. And every hope of a return to the way relations with Russia used to be will be buried. What is clear now is that Russia and Europe are heading towards a much less cordial relationship. The next few years are going to be characterized by a mix of confrontation and cooperation. The West's grand strategy of transforming Russia into a liberal democracy by weaving it into a web of interconnectedness has failed. By moving from proxy war to open war, by giving up pretense and deniability in Ukraine, Russia has very clearly made that point. Germany has taken the lead in the crisis because it has become a central player in Europe, and because it had a lot at stake. Its attempts to put the genie back in the bottle were ultimately unsuccessful. But in that process, Berlin has taken responsibility for Western relations with Russia. It should now take the lead on the long game as well: by building a new strategy that balances confrontation where necessary with cooperation where possible.","The U.S. this week said Russian forces were ""directly involved"" in fighting in Ukraine .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- In the latest stomach-churning food scandal to hit China, authorities have seized over 30,000 tons of chicken feet contaminated with hydrogen peroxide, according to state media. Thirty eight people have been arrested on charges of producing the tainted items, while 11 suspects remain at large. Images on Chinese news websites show large troughs filled with chicken feet soaking in what authorities say is hydrogen peroxide, a colorless chemical compound used for sterilization and bleaching. The chemical, which causes vomiting and other stomach problems if consumed, may have been used to give the chicken feet a whiter, cleaner appearance. A report by official news agency Xinhua said the tainted items were first discovered in Yongjia County in Zhejiang, eastern China. A subsequent investigation revealed hydrogen peroxide was being used in nine factories in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Guangdong, affecting several well-known brands of chicken feet sold in stores. 'I want to throw up' Chinese internet users are reacting with disdain and frustration. A top-rated comment on a microblog run by state television CCTV asks: ""Are there any Chinese foods left that are safe?"" Another fumes: ""From now on, don't tell us what we can't eat — please tell us what we can eat!"" One commenter says: ""Yesterday I ate a lot of these, now I want to throw up."" Chicken feet are popular in China, where they are often available as a packaged snack. However, this is not the first time the item has found itself at the center of a safety scare.

"(CNN) -- A preseason soccer match in Austria had to be abandoned after pro-Palestinian protesters invaded the pitch and started attacking players from Israeli team Maccabi Haifa. Clashes between a group of youths carrying Turkish and Palestinian flags and the Maccabi team broke out at the end of Wednesday's friendly game with French side Lille. War has been raging in the Middle East for more than two weeks now, with Hamas rockets being fired into Israel, which has responded with continued air strikes on Gaza and a ground incursion into Palestinian territory. The conflict has now claimed 732 Palestinian lives, many of them children according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while Israel has reported 35 deaths -- 32 of those soldiers. Resentment and anger spilled onto the football pitch in the Austrian town of Bischofshofen in the Tyrol region where Maccabi regularly spends a period training before its domestic campaign begins. A group of 20-25 flag-waving people had shown up for the match, according to Itamar Chizik, general manager of the team based in the northern Israeli city of Haifa. ""They were shouting all the game,"" Chizik told CNN. ""This is OK if they want to shout, if they want to demonstrate, but in the 85th minute they went onto the pitch directly to our players, no doubt to engage. ""It was a little bit using of force and then the police came and it took about 10 minutes before we succeeded to take all our players back to the dressing room. Nobody was injured. ""We came here for sport, for football. Our club is well known, we have in our club hundreds of Muslim players, in the A team we have five Muslim players as well as Jewish players and Christian players. ""We're not dealing with politics, we are a football team. In Haifa, we are living with peace with all religions. You can imagine by yourself the reason why (this group) was trying to spoil our camp. ""I believe most of them don't even know the reason they demonstrate for. But it is not our problem, we came to play football and that's it -- very clear, very simple."" Maccabi has twice made the group stages of the European Champions League, in 2002-03 and 2009-10, and has won the Israeli league 12 times. The team is scheduled to play two more matches before its 10-day stay in Austria ends on Sunday. Its domestic season starts in August. The Israeli Football Association told CNN it is still considering whether to ask European soccer's governing body UEFA to investigate, calling the incident one of ""pure violence."" ""We know UEFA are against any kind of political activity,"" said head of communications Shlomi Barzel. ""We are not against protest, it is OK if you come to the game to protest but it is different once they go down to the field. ""We hope this is something that won't happen again."" Chizik praised the reaction of local Austrians to the incident, many of whom apologized to him and the team, and said it was the first time it had encountered anything like this since heading to the region for its preseason preparations. And he also said no-one from Maccabi would be asking UEFA to investigate. ""The police here are doing their investigation, it is a local event -- nothing to do with football,"" he explained. ""We have very good relations with the Austrian teams and with the Austrian Football Association. ""It's not a question for football, it's a political question probably and we are not involved in politics at all. The policemen took care to investigate and do everything that should be done to make sure it doesn't happen again."" Maccabi is one of the big four clubs in Israel alongside Maccabi Tel Aviv, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Beitar Jerusalem. It has a reputation for being an inclusive club and Chizik said he was ""totally disappointed"" football and politics had been meshed together on Wednesday. ""Wherever we go in Europe or wherever we play, we never, never merge together politics and football,"" Chizik said. ""Never has any problem come out, we are all friends living together with peace. ""We are all proud Israelis and we do care what is happening in Israel, but we never mixed sports with politics and we are very happy and proud about it at our club. ""We never thought this event should come to sport or football but it is over."" CNN contacted the Palestinian Football Association, which said it was preparing an official response to the incident. French club Lille said in a statement: ""Although we regret and disapprove any form of violence, mainly those events that occasionally involve sports demonstrations, LOSC remains a football club and a sports entertainment company and it's not our duty to comment on political matters.""
