Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study . Fifty Shades of Grey, the best-selling tale of erotic romance, perpetuates the problem of violence against women, according to a new study. Reporting in the Journal of Women's Health, Dr Amy Bonomi concluded that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the novel, with the main female character, Anastasia, suffering harm as a result. About 25 per cent of women are victims of violence by intimate partners. ‘This book is perpetuating dangerous abuse standards and yet it's being cast as this romantic, erotic book for women,’ said Dr Bonomi, lead author of the study. ‘The erotic content could have been accomplished without the theme of abuse.’ The book is a best-seller in the US and the UK and in the last 12 months alone has netted author E L James a staggering £61.4million ($94.9million). The strong sales have propelled the London-based author into the pole position on Forbes' list of successful writers - leapfrogging rival James Patterson who trailed by £2.5million ($3.9million). The researchers, at Ohio State University, conducted a systematic analysis of the novel to clarify patterns consistent with Centres for Disease Control and Prevention definitions of intimate partner violence, and associated reactions known to occur in abused women. Anastasia suffers reactions consistent with those of abused women. She feels a constant sense of threat and loss of self-identity, changes her behaviours to keep peace in the relationship, and becomes disempowered and entrapped in the relationship. The news comes after it was revealed that since the release of Fifty Shades of Grey fire fighters have been called to more and more people who are handcuffed to their beds. London Fire Brigade alone said it had been called to 79 such incidents and urged people to 'always keep the keys handy'. Dr Amy Bonomi concluded that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the novel, with the main female character, Anastasia, suffering harm as a result . Third officer Dave Brown, said: 'Some . of the incidents our fire fighters are called out to could be prevented . with a little common sense. 'I . don't know whether it's the Fifty Shades effect, but the number of . incidents involving items like handcuffs seems to have gone up. 'I'm sure most people will be fifty shades of red by the time our crews arrive to free them.' Written by E.L. James and published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey has sold more than 70 million copies and set the record as the fastest-selling paperback of all time. A film based on the novel is now being made.","Researchers say that emotional and sexual abuse is pervasive in the book .

Angrily thwacking the ketchup bottle to coax out the stubborn sauce could soon be a distant memory, after scientists invented an edible non-stick coating. Applying just a thin layer of the tasteless substance – known as Liquiglide - to the inside of the bottle creates a slippery surface allowing the contents to slide straight out. The non-toxic lubricant can be used on both plastic and glass containers to ensure that consumers can enjoy every last drop of not only their favourite tomato sauce, but other sticky condiments as well, such as mustard and mayonnaise. Scroll down for video . Applying just a thin layer of the tasteless substance - known as Liquiglide - to the inside of the bottle creates a slippery surface allowing the contents to slide straight out . The ingenious Liquiglide Ketchup Bottle, created by engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, came third in the inaugural Visitor Vote for the Design Museum’s Designs of the Year 2013. According to the inventors, each year an estimated one million tonnes of condiments are thrown away globally because leftovers cannot be scraped from jars and bottles, with up to 15 per cent of a product remaining in its container.

They also claim that eliminating safety caps on squeeze bottles could save 50,000 tons of plastic a year. Not only does the product save waste and reduce the need for packaging, but it could stop your beer or cola going flat. The smoother surface created by coating the inside of cans and bottles for carbonated drinks with the substance, slows the release of carbon dioxide bubbles from a drink, keeping it fizzy for longer. The first consumer product with Liquiglide coating is expected to hit supermarket shelves by next year. Since June visitors have been voting for their favourite entries from the 99 nominations for Designs of the Year in a polling station at the exhibition. Other entries included The Shard, the London 2012 Olympic Cauldron and GOV.UK - a revolutionary website combining all of the UK’s government websites under one single domain – which was named official Design of the Year Winner 2013.

Sophie Lewis can now walk thanks to a pioneering operation that involves using magnets to lengthen bones . A teenager has been given pioneering treatment using magnets to slowly lengthen her right leg. Until recently Sophie Lewis, 17, struggled to walk because of a pelvic deformity and curved spine that has left her in crippling pain. But after becoming the youngest patient in the UK to undergo a new treatment, Miss Lewis is quickly gaining independence and recovering well. Surgeons have fitted a telescopic rod in her right thigh which will slowly lengthen and extend the limb by 6cm. The metal rod is controlled by magnets and Sophie must use a remote control at home to gradually lengthen her leg by 1mm each day. She will repeat the procedure 60 times, eventually adding 6cm to her leg to correct her deformity and the rod will be removed in a year’s time. Ms Lewis, who lives with optical assistant mother Karen, 43, electrician father Garry, 51, and younger brother Matthew, 13, explained the groundbreaking operation. She said that inside the rod is a magnetic gear, and when she hovers her magnet above her right kneecap, the magnets repel one another, which twists and pulls the rod apart to extend the leg by 1mm a day. Miss Lewis, from Grimsby in Lincolnshire, is so delighted with her progress and the work of doctors at Sheffield Children’s Hospital she now wants to study to become an orthopaedic surgeon. She said: 'I was worried and excited because I knew I was the youngest person to have this surgery but I had a lot of confidence in the surgeon. 'The doctors decided it was better for me to have this operation because I’m hoping to be a spinal surgeon so I’ll spend the majority of my time standing up. 'If they lengthen my leg it will mean the pain should subside everywhere else. 'I did want to be a dance teacher but then I got really interested in orthopaedic surgery and now I’d like to be a surgeon. 'We’ve been to conferences and met a few people who know about my condition but no one has seen anything like it. 'The doctors in Sheffield have been fantastic and I’m really glad they recommended me for this operation so I can beat the pain.' Until recently Miss Lewis took 13 painkillers a day because of her disability. She had a twisted sacrum - the large, triangular bone at the base of the spine - and was left with one hip almost touching her rib cage. The metal rod is controlled by magnets and Sophie uses a scanner at home to gradually lengthen her leg by 1mm each day. She will repeat the procedure 60 times, eventually adding 6cm to her leg to correct her deformity and the rod will be removed in a year¿s time . In addition to this, her legs were not aligned correctly and were tilted to the opposite side. She said: 'I've had to live with the pain gradually getting worse for years so when the operation came up, it completely changed my life. 'I've had problems since birth and I realised that I always had a short leg but did nothing about it. 'When I was 13, I had a 3D scan performed which then made me realise that my pelvis was deformed. 'The pain gradually got worse, and in my teenage years the pain has become as bad as ever. 'It was constant and was taking a toll on my breathing. Sometimes I physically couldn't take anymore. 'I had to give up doing P.E. in school in Year 8, and had to give up dancing.' Surgeons inserted the rod in a four-hour operation after breaking her upper leg bone but left just six tiny scars. The rod, called the Precise Intramedullary Limb Lengthening System, has been used in the U.S. but never before in someone so young. Just 330 of the operations have been carried out across the globe and only ten have been performed in the UK, all on adults. The procedure reduces pain and scarring and means the patient can be up and about quicker after surgery. Orthopaedic surgeon James Fernandes said: 'It’s been fantastic to be able to perform this operation on the youngest person so far. 'This new technology we’re using is very advanced. We are starting to be able to use this on patients who are younger and younger. 'Our centre is known internationally for its orthopaedic work. 'We advise and treat hundreds of children every year with limb abnormalities and are a major centre for training the next generation of paediatric orthopaedic surgeons. 'Hopefully now we can treat more children in this way reducing the pain and recovery time.'","Sophie Lewis, 17, .

Millions of British children are shunning vegetables and watching too much television, creating a  generation who will die younger than their parents will, researchers have warned. The majority of five to 15-year-olds – some 80 per cent – are not eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, according to the study. However half of children in this age group indulge in soft drinks, chocolates or sweets every day, researchers found. Warning: Researchers fear that the millions of children who shun vegetables and watch too much television will die younger than their parents will (file picture) Recommended: The researchers called for a return to traditional outdoor activities (file picture) The researchers called for a return to traditional outdoor activities as they revealed on a typical Saturday or Sunday a quarter of children aged two to 15 spend at least six hours being inactive. Simon Gillespie, chief executive of the British Heart Foundation which conducted the study with the University of Oxford, said the findings were ‘simply unacceptable’. ‘These figures are a warning that many of our children are in grave danger of developing coronary heart disease in the future if they continue to live the same lifestyle,’ he said. Bad habits: The majority of five to 15-year-olds are not eating the recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a day . Teenagers seem to be worse than younger age groups, with around two in five 13-year-olds – 39 per cent of girls and 43 per cent of boys – drinking a soft drink every day. Almost half of boys and over a third of girls aged 13 also go without breakfast, as do almost a third of 11-year-olds. This figure is even higher among 15-year-olds, with 57 per cent of girls and 38 per cent of boys going without breakfast. Most girls and boys aged 13 do not do the recommended one hour of physical activity a day, compared with 20 per cent of 11-year-olds. And almost three-quarters of 13-year-olds watch at least two hours of TV on a weekday, as do 60 per cent of 11-year-old girls and 64 per cent of 11-year-old boys. The rise of this unhealthy generation will leave Britain unable to compete with other countries, the Prime Minister has warned. Mr Gillespie told the Times: ‘The healthier a nation is, the more efficient it is.’ He said he has seen some cases of high cholesterol in teenagers that ‘you would expect to see in a stereotypical sedentary truck driver eating a cooked breakfast every day’. Deaths from heart disease have fallen sharply in recent years, but Mr Gillespie said: ‘We’ve got a generation growing up which will buck that trend and potentially they will be the generation that live less long than the generation above them. ‘It really is as stark as that. If that isn’t a wake-up call, then what is? ‘Our expectations of what childhood is have to change,’ he said.  ‘When I was a child the expectation was that you would be outside. It’s not a question of turning back the clock, it’s a question of regaining that balance. We almost have to reset what we regard as moderation — moderation is not cutting down from two burgers a day to one, it’s cutting down to two burgers a week.’ The notion of exercise regimes involving gyms or gruelling jogs may well be intimidating for many of us. But surely a brief walk should not be too much for even the most hardened of couch potatoes to tackle. Yet according to a study, millions across the country cannot be coaxed – with nearly one in ten adults not managing to walk for even five minutes in the month before. The figure, from researchers at the University of Bristol, includes walking to work. Their snapshot also found the amount of other exercise done – such as swimming, biking and gym sessions – was ‘shockingly low’. It revealed that just over 8 per cent of adults who were well enough to walk had not managed to clock up five continuous minutes in four weeks leading up to being questioned. In one of the most comprehensive studies of physical fitness levels to be carried out in England, experts analysed annual surveys of adults, in which they were asked how much they exercised in the previous four weeks. As well as the low figures on walking, 88 per cent had not been swimming, 90 per cent had not used a gym and 20 per cent had only done minimal amounts of physical activity.","Majority of children not eating recommended quantity of their 'five a day'

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 05:13 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:31 EST, 12 August 2013 . Experts have revealed that an increasing number of young people are developing a condition, unique to modern society, that they have dubbed 'Gameboy Back'. They say the modern phenomenon, which causes curvature of the spine and sometimes herniated (slipped) discs, is a result of children sitting hunched over games consoles and smartphones for hours on end. They do not however believe a ban on such devices is required. Instead more attention needs to be paid to correct posture, they said. 'Gameboy Back' is affecting increasing numbers of eight to 18-year-olds who spend extended periods of time hunched over a game or smartphone. The last time such a volume of problems was seen, was over 100 years ago when child labour was still common . Surgeons Piet van Loon and Andre Soeterbroek said the last time such symptoms were observed was more than 100 years ago, when child labour was common in Europe. The problem is particularly prevalent in eight to 18-year-olds. 'In those days, kids got weak back from child labour, now they're getting it from these devices,' Dr Soeterbook told The Irish Times. 'It makes no difference to the body whether you’re hunched over in a cigar factory or spending eight hours over an iPad.' He and Dr Van Loon are joint authors of an article in the Dutch medical magazine Medisch Contact, which alerts GPs to the trend. 'Essentially, it’s like growing bonsai trees: bone responds in the same way as wood,' said Dr van Loon. 'If you force it in a certain direction over a prolonged period, that’s how it ends up growing.' The surgeons said that the problem is not the devices themselves, and that the answer is not to ban them. Experts have likened the phenomenon to growing a bonsai tree. Dr van Loon said: 'Essentially, it¿s like growing bonsai trees: bone responds in the same way as wood. If you force it in a certain direction over a prolonged period, that¿s how it ends up growing' Instead, more attention needs to be paid to posture: particularly, good sitting habits. They explained that  attention to posture has almost disappeared the world over. Whats more, parents, physical education teachers and family doctors accept poor posture children and teenagers as normal, they added. The simplest test for Gameboy back is to have children bend over and touch their toes, making an 'n' shape. Those with curvature of the spine won’t be able to flex in the middle enough to touch their toes. Teenagers who sit for hours over a screen with head bowed, forcing the spine to curve outwards, can counter this by lying on their front and propping themselves on their elbows.","Dutch surgeons say increasing numbers of children aged between eight and 18 are visiting their GPs, complaining of a mystery back condition .

Absence really does make the heart grow fonder, as new research reveals Brits who work away from home actually have more sex with their partner. Couples who spend at least one night a month working away from home have a hotter sex life than those who share a bed every night, the study found. Seven out of 10 couples get frisky the night before one of them leaves on business and again when they get back (67 per cent). Romantic: Having a reunion after time apart can reinvigorate relationships, a survey reveals . More than half find being torn away from their lover and then reunited a turn-on (54 per cent), the study of 2,007 couples reveals. Eight out of 10 workers confess being away from the stresses and strains of home makes them more likely to get it on. And one in four admit they’re more likely to be in the mood because they have more energy after a night in bed alone. Couples who spend one to two nights away a month have sex 110 times. That’s nearly twice as much as those who stay away separately less than 12 times per year (average 56 times). A night away together also boosts the chances of romance, according to the report by boutique serviced apartments collection Blue Rainbow Aparthotels. Couples are nine times more likely to get intimate between the sheets when they’re away from home as they feel more relaxed, it shows (88 per cent). Kim McAllister, 29, a dental nurse from Penicuik, Scotland, said: 'My fiance is a recruitment consultant, so he spends one or two nights away every month. 'I’m always sad to see him go, so we usually make love before he goes away. 'Then I’m so refreshed when he gets back that I’m fired up and ready for more when he gets home.' Not so happy families: Sharing a bed every night does not necessarily mean that you will have more sex with your partner . Scottish lovers were the friskiest - seven out of 10 always get passionate to welcome their partner home (76 per cent). Manchester residents are less amorous, with only a third always having sex when reunited (33 per cent). Will Hannah, managing director of Blue Rainbow Aparthotels, said: “We’re over the moon that the environment in our serviced apartments makes our guests feel relaxed. 'If that means the end result is they get amorous when they return home, then that’s an added bonus.

There have been 61 murders in the city so far this year, and the horrific violence has prompted the once-friendly and seemingly safe area of Maxwell Park to take their safety into their own hands. The gunfire is so common, 'it's like, ""Oh, another shooting,""' Jan Hetherington, who has lived for 14 years in the Oakland neighborhood, which has sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay, told CBS News.

In another frightening incident, Pastor Gregg Brown, who moved to Maxwell Park nine years ago, said he was threatened at gunpoint right outside his Lutheran church.

A Los Angeles soccer team is being 'ethnically cleansed' as part of a strategy by the billionaire owner to Mexicanize it, a former employee has claimed. In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, former Chivas USA human resources director Cynthia Craig has alleged that a culture of harassment and discrimination caused her departure. The African-American claims she was forced out of her job in July by the team's owner Jorge Vergara and president, Jose David, because she was not Mexican and could not speak Spanish. Team plan: Billionaire Jorge Vergara has been accused of trying to 'Mexicanize' Chivas USA . The former youth academy coaches, Daniel Calichman and Teddy Chronopoulos, have also alleged that they were victims of the team's purging of non-Mexican players and coaches, according to Fox News. The men, who are both white, filed their complaint in May. Since assuming majority ownership of . Chivas USA in August last year, Mr Vergara made it clear he wanted to . replicate the team of the same name in Guadalajara, Mexico, in order to attract the large Mexican population in Los Angeles. According to the 2012 census, more than four million Mexicans live in the area. The original Mexican Chivas pro-team has only hired Mexican players since 1908, according to CNN. In the lawsuit brought by Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman, attorney Greg Helmer said: 'Mr Vergara undertook . a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the ""Americanization"" of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment policy . similar to the ethnocentric ""Mexican only"" policy that exists at Chivas . de Guadalajara.' Mr Helmer told Fox News: 'In the U.S. and in California, sports franchises have to abide by the same rules and laws that all employers are required to follow, including the laws prohibiting employment discrimination.' Appeal: Chivas USA's owner is said to be trying to make the team appeal to the large Mexican population in Los Angeles . It is claimed that in a staff meeting in November, Mr Vergara asked, in Spanish, for those who could speak the language to raise their hands. After identifying employees who did not speak Spanish, he allegedly told them they were fired. In her lawsuit, Ms Craig said it felt like 'ethnic cleansing'. Mr Chronopoulos has alleged that after the meeting, newly appointed team president Mr David asked him to research the ethnicity of current youth academy players and coaches. The request and recent changes led to Mr Chronopoulos and Mr Calichman filing a harassment and discrimination complaint with the team's human resources department. Three days later however, the men were asked to leave. Since Mr Vergara took over about seven non-Latino academy employees, including the two coaches, have had their contracts terminated, the lawsuit said. 'In contrast, no Latino employees have been terminated,' the suit states, according to CNN. Many non-Spanish speaking players have joined the youth program for LA Galaxy, which Chivas shares a stadium with. SB Nation pointed out however, that while many players may have a Latino background, most of the team is American. A spokesman for Chivas USA declined to comment on the legal matter. Checks: Chivas USA play against Vancouver, above. One of the men in the lawsuit claims he was asked to look up the ethnicity of players and staff . Major League Soccer has not made any public statements about the alleged discrimination. 'We are well aware of the allegations made by ex-players and employees of Chivas USA,' MLA's executive vice president, communications, Dan Courtemanche said. 'it would not be appropriate for us to say anything more when the litigation is ongoing,' he told Fox News, but added that Chivas USA has players from 15 countries.","Three employees allege they were forced out under plans to 'Mexicanize' Los Angeles team .

The Canadian military is secretly testing a stealth snowmobile in its northern territories to enable troops to covertly operate in Arctic conditions. Soldiers are testing the speed, acceleration, noise and battery endurance of the $620,000 machines, designed to be a silent hybrid-electric version of the existing gas-powered transporters. Clues that the government was seeking to upgrade its Arctic warfare capabilities were revealed in 2011 when the National Defence's research and development agency posted a tendering document for a snowmobile machine that could quickly switch to 'silent mode' when needed. Stealth-like: Canada's military has been testing stealth-like new snowmobiles, similar to existing ones, pictured, but capable of switching to 'silent mode' to sneak up on the enemy . The first tests with the new machines have been carried out in varying snow conditions at Canadian Forces Base Petawawa, according to Canada's CBC News, comparing how the silent snowmobiles perform against their noisier counterparts. Documents obtained under an Access to Information Act by the Canadian Press revealed the military have been using sound-meter readings to measure the machine's noise levels; they have been driving the snowmobiles at a steady speed across varying surfaces to test the batteries; and the buggy's acceleration on a 100m flat, snow-packed track has also been assessed. It also revealed the new machine has been named the 'Loki' after a mythical Norse, shape-shifting god. The report, quoted by CBC News, read: 'The prototype must be at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile, while providing a significant noise reduction. 'For military purposes, it is not enough for a snowmobile to operate quietly.' News that Canada is pushing ahead with plans to augment its military capabilities in the Far North comes at a time when defence spending has been reigned in to make way for measures to stimulate economic growth. Requirements: 'The prototype must be at least nearly as capable and reliable as a standard internal combustion snowmobile (pictured), while providing a significant noise reduction,' the defence report stated . The National Defence said spending on Arctic mobility would be suspended for eight years, however, the stealth snowmobile project appears to have been protected, according to the news service. The contract was originally set at $550,000 per snowmobile, but the Canadian Press obtained the document which shows a revised price tag of nearly $620,000. The winning bid came from Canadian firm CrossChasm Technologies. While many details of the capabilities of the new military machine have been kept under wraps, news of its arrival have not been met with enthusiasm by all. Michael Byers, a former federal NDP candidate who teaches international law at the University of British Columbia, told CBC News he questioned whether it was money well spent when the apparent threat of attack from the North seems negligible. Secret tests: The silent snowmobiles are being tested against the noisier versions at the Canadian Forces base, Petawawa . 'I don't see a whole lot of evidence that criminals and terrorists are scooting around Canada's North on snowmobiles and that we have to sneak up on them,' he said. 'I can't help but wonder whether they've been watching too many (James) Bond movies,' he added.","Snowmobiles tested against existing machines for noise, speed, endurance .

A career criminal and sex offender who was the last person to see a slain federal criminal investigator claims that the two planned to wed. The slain woman's family, however, says 56-year-old Randy Alana is lying. A reporter for the Oakland Tribune talked to Alana at the Santa Rita Jail in Dublin, where he is being held on a parole violation. Career criminal: Randy Alana says that he planned to marry federal prosecutor Sandra Coke and that they were a loving couple who shared a home, and even attended church together the day she went missing . Prosecutor: Sandra Coke disappeared August 4th from Oakland. Her body was found five days later. Coke's relatives and friends have said that Alana had contacted her to ask for help getting his life together . Alana said that he met Sandra Coke two decades ago while she investigated a murder case. He denied harming her. 'We recently talked about getting married,' Alana told the newspaper. Coke, 50, was last seen with Alana on August 4th, whom she briefly dated about 20 years ago, police and Coke's friends say. Search and rescue crews found Coke's body five days later in a woodsy area near Lagoon Valley Park in unincorporated Vacaville in Solano County. Santa Rita Jail: The pair met 20 years ago when she interviewed him while he was incarcerated as part of a death penalty investigation. Alana is now in solitary lockdown because he is considered one of the jail's most dangerous inmates . 'This is a man with convictions for murder and kidnapping. He was the last person seen with my sister, but claims he has nothing to do with her disappearance and killing,' said Tanya Coke, Sandra Coke's sister, in a written statement. 'He is clearly someone who thinks nothing of lying and manipulating to serve his purposes. Why would we or anyone else believe what he has to say?' Alana appeared in an Alameda County courtroom on Friday to face allegations that he'd violated his parole by contacting Coke, a capital case investigator for the federal public defender's office in Sacramento. Alana was also accused of resisting arrest, failing to charge a GPS monitor he was required to wear on his ankle and absconding from parole. Alana was arrested on Aug. 6 for violating his parole, two days after Coke was reported missing after leaving her Oakland home and telling family members she was meeting someone with information about her missing dog. Judge Morris Jacobson did not say why Alana had been ordered to stay away from Coke. Alameda County prosecutor Paul Hora told reporters after Friday's hearing that he didn't know why Alana had been told to stay away from Coke, but said the condition is specific to her. Hora said Oakland police are still investigating Coke's death and Alana has not been charged in connection with the incident. Alana told the newspaper that his attorney advised him not to talk to anyone about the case, but he said he had nothing to hide. He said he had nothing to do with Coke's murder. 'We recently talked about getting married,' Alana said. Alana said that he violated parole five times and spent extended time in the Santa Rita Jail. Deputies told the newspaper that Coke was a 'regular visitor' of Alana. Coke worked for the federal public defender's office as an investigator on death penalty cases. She also had worked for the California Appellate Project, the San Francisco Public Defender Office, the Equal Justice Initiative of Alabama, and she had her own private investigation firm. According to a press release issued by the federal defender's office, her work contributed to a recent effort to overturn a 2001 Sacramento County murder conviction. 'She dedicated her work and her life to looking for the best in people, to give some explanation to why people do what they do - even the most heinous of acts, all based upon the belief that no person should be judged only by the worst act he or she committed,' the release said.","Randy Alana met Sandra Coke two decades ago while she investigated a murder case .

Investigators believe a $1.5 million life-insurance policy could have been the motive for a savage sledgehammer and knife attack on a New York City psychiatrist last year. Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on shrink Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office with the heavy weapon and a kitchen knife. But, just four days before the attack, Weiss had reluctantly changed the beneficiary on his hefty insurance policy to Nolan's aunt, fellow psychiatrist Pamela Buchbinder, 43, with whom Weiss shares a young son. Nolan was living with Buchbinder in her Chelsea home at the time of the attack. He is also the Godfather of the pair's child. Crime scene: Jake Nolan, 21, is accused of unleashing on psychiatrist Michael Weiss, 38, in his Upper West Side office, pictured, with the sledgehammer and a kitchen knife . 'The ink was still wet (on the policy) when Nolan attacked him,' Weiss' lawyer, Roland Acevedo, told The New York Post, which has obtained family-court records proving the change in beneficiary. 'It's like a ""20/20"" episode. It sure looks like his son's mother put Jake up to this for the insurance money.' According to the newspaper, the Manhattan district attorney's office is now looking closely at the possible link. Sources told The Post investigators were trying to determine whether Buchbinder was with Nolan when he purchased the sledgehammer from a Manhattan Home Deport store. Weapon: Nolan allegedly swung the sledgehammer at Weiss before stabbing him eight times with the knife (stock photo) They have also quizzed Weiss and requested a copy of the life-insurance policy, a police source said. 'The circumstances are suspicious, and we're looking into it,' the source told The Post. Weiss finally agreed to put Buchbinder's name on his insurance policy on November 8, 2012, after weeks of badgering, Acevedo said. In the morning on November 12, Nolan allegedly arrived at Weiss' midtown Manhattan office carrying a black duffel bag and an argument about paying for the six-year-old boy's education ensued. He then asked to go to the restroom and allegedly came out swinging the sledgehammer over Weiss's head as the psychiatrist hid at his desk. Nolan then pulled out a kitchen knife and proceeded to stab Weiss in his back and chest eight times, police said. The shrink managed to wrestle the knife off Nolan and strike him once before he escaped and begged for help. '(Weiss) crawled into the hallway covered in blood and screamed, ""Help me! Help me!""' Acevedo said. Nolan was arrested and is now awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Nolan's lawyer Steven Brounstein declined to comment to MailOnline. MailOnline contacted Buchbinder but she didn't return a request for comment.","Jake Nolan, 21, allegedly attacked Michael Weiss, 38, in his Manhattan office last year .

DeAntre Turman, 16, and only a junior at Creekside High School, died of a broken neck after making a routine tackle. He had considerable interest from major college football programs and was considered one of the state’s top recruits for next year’s graduating class. Turman had already been offered a full scholarship to play football for the University of Kentucky, according to ESPN. A tragic end to a promising young life: DeAntre Turman died less than a month before his 17th birthday . Called ‘Tre Tre’ by friends, Turman was one of only a couple dozen juniors with Division-1 scholarships. A young life with seemingly limitless potential was cut short by what the medical examiner called ‘blunt force trauma,’ according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. A cornerback, Turman was an aggressive defender making a clean, solid tackle on a wide receiver in the open field, according to witnesses who spoke to local media. Nothing about the play seemed out of the ordinary until he didn’t get up after the tackle. T%alented: Turman was 'definitely one of the best players' at a football camp he attended over the summer . ‘Tre broke on it, dislodged the ball and his body just went limp. (He) immediately just went limp and he was on the ground,’ coach Glenn Ford told WSB. ‘[Everyone was] calling out his name, just trying to get him to come back to open his eyes up to move until the ambulance got there,’ Ford added. The ambulance arrived 15 minutes later, Turman was pronounced dead at a local hospital. Turman fractured the third vertebrae in his neck, according to the medical examiner. The young star attended a football camp during the summer and was slated to play in a December all-star game. As a tribute his number two jersey will not be worn by anyone on the field, according to the Journal-Constitution. ‘He was definitely one of the best players at the camp, and the thing I really loved about him, that he was real quiet and reserved,’ Joe Burns, co-founder of RisingSeniors.com, told the Journal-Constitution. ‘He was one of those kids that was really focused, and trying to make the most out of the opportunity.’ Well liked: Turman, pictured in white, had many friends and was respected by both teammates and coaches . Other experts agreed, Turman had real potential. A national recruiting analyst told the Journal-Constitution that ‘it was a no-brainer to invite Turman to the camp because of how well he made plays on the ball and defended receivers.’ Former coach Johnny White had nothing but praise for Turman. ‘He’s one of the best kids I’ve ever dealt with in my 18 years of coaching, period, hands down,’ White told WSB. ‘He was quiet, but always smiling. He had a real good spirit. It was always yes sir, no sir. He enjoyed his team, and he loved his teammates. Just a great kid’ The fallen star’s mother died when he was young, his guardian told WSB of his love for football. ‘That is what made him the happiest. Being the competitor and playing different sports made him happy,’ said Tarsha Keller, adding that Turman’s dream was to get a college scholarship and play at the next level - a dream he came so close to realizing. High school football players rarely die on the field, with an average of only three deaths a year the past decade, according to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research at the University of North Carolina. No players died last year, the first season without a death in almost 20 years.","DeAntre Turman was one of the top high school football players in Georgia .

An Indiana man has miraculously survived being struck by an Amtrak train going at 110 miles per hour with just scratches and fractured bones. Darryle Jacob See, 22, was walking in Michiana along the U.S. 12 east of Michigan City on Friday when the accident occurred. See, who was able to sit up and speak to police following the accident, says he doesn't recall the accident. Survivor: Darryle See's survival after being hit by a train is being hailed as nothing short of a miracle . Traveling at speed: The Chicago-bound Amtrak train was traveling at 110 miles per hour when it hit Darryle See . According to See's grandmother, Helen Hugley, he left the family's Shady Oak trailer park home to go for a walk along the Michiana shoreline about 11:30am. It appears that See, who had headphones on, walked into the middle of the train tracks and into the course of a Chicago-bound AMTRAK train traveling at 110 miles per hour. NBC reports that  conductors sounded the horn several times before employing the emergency brakes. But it was too late. Train officials said the train was traveling at 110 mph at the time of the accident. Grateful: See's grandmother Helen Hugley is ecstatic that her grandson survived the horrific accident with minor injuries . Impact: See was wearing just a t-shirt, shorts and sneakers, one of which fell off when he was hit by the train . See was struck by the train and the impact sent him flying 20 feet onto the other side of the tracks. Police and ambulance workers who arrived on the scene said See was alert and talking to police following the terrifying impact. LaPorte County Police Major John Boyd told NBC he's amazed anyone could survive being hit by a train traveling at such speeds. 'The conductor said it was a straight-on hit,' Boyd said. 'It was absolutely amazing,' he said of See's survival. 'I’ve seen a number of people get hit by trains and it’s never a good thing.' Nightmare: To the horror of conductors, See didn't move off the tracks after they sounded the train's horn . Hugley said See underwent surgery today at Memorial Hospital in South Bend hospital to repair cracked vertebrae. He reportedly has 'one or two' fractures to his pelvis. Boyd told NWI that the angled front of the locomotive could have deflected some of the force of the impact. 'He says he doesn't remember anything until he woke up on the other side of the tracks,' said Hugley . 'I would definitely call it a miracle. I couldn’t believe it when they told us he was alive and talking,' she told NBC. Following his successful neck surgery today, See is expected to make a full recovery.","Darryle See was walking along train tracks near Michigan City, Indiana, when he was stuck by a train .

A former Kansas police instructor screamed at the judge as he was sentenced to life in prison today for the April 2011 shooting death of his wife. Minutes before Brett Seacat was sentenced, he delivered a courtroom rant accusing the judge of helping to convict him by hiding evidence that proves his innocence. Accusations of family abuse, multiple suicide attempts, and life insurance payouts - all kept out of the murder trial - got an airing at the sentencing in the high-profile case. Scroll down for video . Bizarre rant: Brett Seacat delivered a diatribe before he was sentenced in court today, accusing the judge of hiding evidence . Life in prison: Brett Seacat was sentenced to a total of 31 years today for killing his wife Vashti and setting their home on fire two years ago . Seacat was convicted in June of shooting 34-year-old Vashti Seacat days after she filed for divorce, then setting fire to their house to cover the evidence. Investigators found her charred body in the Kingman home where the couple lived with their two sons, aged two and four. Seacat, a former instructor at the Kansas Law Enforcement Training Center in Reno County and former Sedgwick County deputy, escaped with the boys. Prosecutors at his trial portrayed Seacat as a manipulative man who used his law enforcement background to make it look like his wife shot herself. The defense argued it was suicide, noting even an experienced coroner couldn't decide whether the death was suicide or homicide. At his sentencing, the 37-year-old Kingman man accused Kingman County District Judge Larry Solomon of seeking publicity and assuring his wife's family even before the hearing that he would receive a harsh sentence. Devastated family: Vashti Seacat's sister Taylor Forrest reacts to comments made to her by Brett Seacat . In his statement, Seacat said he did not kill his wife. He also questioned much of the evidence against him and made accusations against Vashti Seacat's family. Seacat said it was 'ridiculous' to suggest that he tried to destroy evidence because of his knowledge relating to crime scenes. 'I teach about crimes,' he said. “I know what covers up crimes and what doesn’t. I know that a bullet hole has never been covered up by a fire.' He told the court that Vashti had committed suicide, and that she had attempted it before. 'I said it before and I’ll say it again,' he said. 'Vashti’s suicide was my fault. In my life, I’ve saved a lot of people from death, none more often than Vashti. No matter how many times you save someone, you can only fail to save them once. I failed with Vashti and it is the first and last thing I think about every day.' Orphans: Rich Forrest holds up a photograph of his sister Vashti Seacat and his nephews as he speaks to the judge Monday morning . Solomon imposed a sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years for premeditated, first-degree murder. He also gave Seacat a total of more than six years in prison for one count of aggravated arson and two counts of child endangerment. Since the four counts will run consecutively, Seacat will not be eligible for parole for more than 31 years. 'This is the kind of sentence you believe you will need for a Kansas Supreme Court nomination,' Seacat told the judge. 'You are going to hell for what you have done in this case,' Seacat told the judge. Seacatt vowed that the evidence the court suppressed will one day be presented and 'I will be free.'

'I don't intend to show any mercy; you didn't show Vashti any mercy,' Solomon said. Earlier in the hearing, Vashti Seacat's family recounted her fears about what her husband was capable of doing, the concerns for their own safety and the emotional havoc on the lives of the couple's two young children. 'On behalf of the family, I would like to thank you for your arrogance, Brett,' Taylor Forrest said, adding that his belief that he could get away with murder led him to make mistakes. Rich Forrest, Vashti Seacat's brother, told the court that Brett Seacatt destroyed his children's innocence and deprived them of knowing both their parents growing up. 'When the children are older,' he said, 'What exactly are we supposed to tell them when they ask about their daddy?'","Before Brett Seacat was sentenced for the murder of his wife today he abused the judge in a lengthy diatribe .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:16 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:32 EST, 19 August 2013 . After a year and a half behind barbed wire as a prisoner in World War II, 2nd Lt. David C. Cox had just about reached his breaking point. Deliveries of Red Cross parcels to Stalag VII-A had all but ceased, and the U.S. Army bomber co-pilot and his fellow POWs were subsisting on scant rations of bug-infested soup and bread. Outside the wire, Adolf Hitler's forces showed no signs of giving up. Cold and hungry, the North Carolina-born soldier made a difficult decision. He slipped the gold aviator's ring - a gift from his parents engraved with his name - off his finger and passed it through a fence to an Italian POW, who handed back a couple of chocolate bars. Desperation: 2nd Lt David C. Cox, seen centre with fellow soldiers, traded his precious ring for two chocolate bars while being held at a POW camp . The pilot would never see his treasured ring again - but almost 70 years later it has found its way back to his family. The gold ring had ended up in the hands of a Russian soldier on his way home from the war, who is thought to have traded it for a night's room and board at a small pub in present day Serbia - owned by the grandparents of Martin Kiss, 64. Mr Kiss' grandmother gave him the ring when he moved to Germany in 1971, for luck, or in case he needed some quick cash. He said he knew the ring must have come from an American soldier, but had no idea how to trace the owner. The master church painter and artist wore the ring on his little finger, before eventually placing it in a corked glass bottle for fear it would get damaged as he worked. That is until American couple Mark and Mindy Turner moved into the house next door in the tiny Bavarian village of Hohenberg. After inviting the Turners for dinner, Mr Kiss enlisted the help of the computer-savvy pair to try and trace the origins of the gold ring. 'Better to give than to receive': Martin Kiss is seen holding a photograph of his Hungarian grandparents, who gave him the ring in 1971 when he moved to Germany . Mark Turner went online when he got back home, and within 20 minutes he found a 2005 master's thesis from North Carolina State University. One . focus of Norwood McDowell's 219-page paper was the war diary of his . wife's grandfather, David C. Cox Sr. - the name on the ring's . inscription. And there, on page 179, was the anecdote about the . chocolate bars. After all those years, this epic ring cycle had ended . within a two-hour drive of where it began.'It just seemed like it couldn't be true,' Mr Turner said.He e-mailed McDowell a photograph of the ring and its inscription, who contacted the bomber pilot's 67-year-old son, also called David Cox. 'That's it for sure,' an ecstatic Mr Cox replied when McDowell forwarded the picture.'Well, praise the Lord!' Mindy Turner wrote back. 'We are so excited for your family!'After a few more e-mails and phone calls, the ring was on its way to the United States. Last . week, about a dozen family members and friends gathered in the living . room of David C. Cox Jr.'s Raleigh home and watched as he slit open a . small yellow parcel from Germany. 'And . here it is,' he said with a long sigh as he pulled out the ring. 'Oh, . my goodness. ... I never thought it would ever happen. I thought it was . gone. We all thought it was gone. 'He thought it was gone,' he said of his late father. Team effort: Martin and Regina Kiss are seen with their neighbours, U.S. couple Mark and Mindy Turner, who helped Mr Kiss to trace the ring's original owner . Following the December 1941 Japanese . attack on Pearl Harbor, the elder Cox left college and enlisted. The . Army Air Corps accepted him on his second application.He graduated from flight school on July 26, 1942. That same day, he married his high school sweetheart, Hilda Walker. To celebrate his commission, Irvin and Connie Bell Cox presented their middle son with a gold signet ring, the oval emblazoned with a raised propeller and wings. Engraved inside were the words, 'Mother & Father to David C. Cox Greensboro, NC,' and the numbers 10-4-18-42 — his birthday and the current year.Cox was assigned to the 305th Bomb Group, 364th Squadron — part of the 'Mighty Eighth' Air Force. By October, he was in England. Back where it belongs: With the help of Mark Turner, left, and Martin Kiss, right, the gold ring has been returned to the son of its original owner . As a co-pilot in the B-17 'Flying Fortress', Cox flew more than a dozen bombing missions over occupied France and the German heartland. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for helping to get his burning plane back to England from a May 1943 raid that cost the lives of half his 10-man crew.On July 28, 1943, Cox's plane was shot down over Kassel, Germany. He parachuted into a rose garden, was taken prisoner, interrogated and then shipped to Stalag Luft III, the POW camp made famous in the Steve McQueen film The Great Escape.He remained there until January 1945, when he and the other Allied officers were force-marched three days through the snow, then packed into train cars for another three days before ending up at Stalag VII-A near Moosburg, northeast of Munich.As Hitler's Third Reich collapsed upon itself, POWs from all over found their way to Moosburg. By the time Cox arrived, conditions there went from bad to what one historian described as 'barely correct by the standards of the Geneva Convention'.It was at Moosburg that he traded the ring for the candy bars.Finally, on April 28, 1945, Gen. George Patton's 14th Armored Division liberated the camp, and Cox, who was promoted to 1st lieutenant, made his way back to North Carolina. He started a tire retreading equipment company with his brother, and he and Hilda raised three children.Cox didn't talk much about the war, except to remind his children of his privations when they refused to clean their plates. And he spoke wistfully about his lost ring.Upon his return from the war, one of the first things Cox did was to have an exact duplicate made of his prized ring — right down to the inscription. When he died in 1994, the replica passed to his son, David Jr., who wore it until it finally broke in the middle. Cradling the original in his hand after opening the package Friday, the pilot's son was struck by the ring's condition, compared to its replacement. His sister, Joy Wagner, walked over and took the ring in her hands. 'Gosh, it's beautiful,' she said as tears welled in her eyes. 'Oh, that's so special.'David Cox said holding the ring gave him goose bumps.'I feel his presence,' he said of his father. 'I wish he was here.'Kiss — whose own grandfather spent several years in a Soviet camp during and after the war — said in a phone interview with The Associated Press that his only regret is that David Cox Sr. and his grandmother weren't alive to share the 'happy ending'.Refusing to accept even reimbursement for the shipping, he added, 'You know the old saying: It's better to give than to receive.'","Pilot David Cox traded his gold ring for chocolate while a POW in Germany .

Councils are trying to cover up the number of taxpayer-subsidised homes they are handing to foreigners, it was claimed yesterday. Local authorities have stopped giving figures for how many houses and flats they have given to foreign citizens amid rising worries over the impacts of immigration, a report said. Councils in London, where one in five publicly-financed homes are already known to be occupied by foreigners, are among those no longer supplying the figures. Refusal: Local authorities have stopped giving figures for how many houses and flats they have given to foreign citizens amid rising worries over the impacts of immigration, a report said . Now MPs have called for an inquiry into the suppression of information on who gets council and housing association homes. Labour’s Frank Field and Tory Nicholas Soames said in a statement on behalf of the cross-party Balanced Migration group: ‘This is a huge issue for many people. ‘The Government must now launch a full inquiry into what is going on in the allocation of social housing in London.’ The way subsidised homes have been  going to foreign citizens and not to families with long-standing local connections has become politically sensitive as immigration hits record levels and the recession has undermined ordinary people’s ability to afford to buy or rent private homes. Under Tony Blair’s government, senior Labour MPs complained the way in which local families in East London had failed to get public housing while new migrants succeeded had swelled support for the British National Party. Last year ministers acknowledged that a fifth of the nearly 800,000 publicly-owned homes in London are occupied by families and individuals who are citizens of other countries and not of Britain. Outrage: MPs Frank Field, left, and Nicholas Soames, right, are among those calling for the Government to launch an inquiry into the issue of council housing . The report from the Migrationwatch think tank said that local authorities in London are now  disclosing the nationality of new tenants for fewer than half the homes they let. Four authorities – Greenwich, Hackney, Lambeth and Newham – have declined to take part in the Government’s count of social housing lettings even though it is a legal requirement for them to do so. Two more councils, Ealing and Haringey, where there are high numbers of foreign citizens in social housing, have obscured their latest figures by claiming high numbers of tenants refuse to say what their nationality is. The report said that since waiting lists for social housing are ten times longer than the number of homes made available each year, only a small proportion of families that ask will ever get a house from a council or a housing association. Huge stock: Councils in London let 404,000 houses and flats while state-subsidised housing associations (file picture) Migrationwatch added: ‘It is important to be clear that the debate should be about foreign nationals, not people who are foreign born, who should be treated like any other British citizen.’ Its chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘It is deeply unsatisfactory that the information on new lets should be so chaotic given the huge importance of this issue to so many families. The Government must make the nationality question compulsory. This could provide the basis for a renewed debate on the criteria by which social housing should be allocated.’ Coalition ministers have made some changes to social housing allocation rules since 2010, with the aim of giving a greater claim to families with close connections to a local area. Councils in London let 404,000 houses and flats while state-subsidised housing associations, which do declare the nationality of tenants, have 376,000. Before the recession Whitehall calculations said that the cost to taxpayers of each socially-owned house or flat was on average £62,000. The figure suggests social housing in London has cost taxpayers almost £50billion.","MPs have called for an inquiry into the suppression of council house information .

A homeless couple who were shot over 15 times by LA sheriff's deputies during a botched raid have been awarded $4.1 million in compensation. Angel Mendez and his then-pregnant wife Jennifer were both shot when deputies - who did not have a search warrant for a wanted parole violator - burst into the wooden shack they were living in and opened fire in October, 2010. Deputies claimed that Mendez reached for a BB gun and fifteen rounds were fired. Angel Mendez was hit 10 times and had his leg amputated while Jennifer was struck once and feared that she might lose her unborn child. Scroll Down for Video . Compensation: Angel Mendez (left) and his wife Jennifer (right) were awarded $4.1 million after deputies in LA shot at them 15 times during a botched raid . In gruesome video footage shot by police immediately after the shooting incident, Mendez can be heard pleading for his life and asking sheriff's deputies Christopher Conley and Jennifer Pederson why they had burst in firing their weapons. Handing down his ruling, U.S. District Judge Michael W. Fitzgerald awarded $3.8 million to Mendez and $222,000 to his wife for damages relating to Fourth Amendment violations by the deputies. 'If they would’ve announced, ‘Police, open the door’ I would have came out,' Angel Mendez, who lost his leg as a result from the bullet wounds, told NBC Los Angeles. However, the deputies claim they began firing when Mendez reached for his BB gun and aimed it at them, while Mendez can be clearly heard disputing this fact in the aftermath of the shooting as emergency workers battled to save his life. Family: Angel and Jennifer Mendez with their small boy and little girl - who was almost killed in the shooting when Jennifer was struck by one of the 15 rounds fired . Aftermath: Angel Mendez lies on the floor outside his wooden shack after being shot 10 times by LA deputies (left) and reveals the wounds he received in his arms (right) 'Oh, please, just don’t let me die, sir,' Mendez can be heard saying in the footage, which was obtained by NBC News. Indeed, an officer is heard to ask why he aimed the gun. 'Why did you point the gun at my deputies?' the officer asks in the unsettling film. 'I didn’t, sir,' Angel Mendez responds. 'It was on my bed and I went to move it.' Terrified: Jennifer Mendez lies on the floor following the shooting at her wooden shack in October 2010 . Amputation: Angel Mendez eventually lost his right leg due to the wounds he suffered in the raid on his home in Los Angeles . A spokesperson for Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Steve Whitmore, said the Office of Independent Review found the shooting was justified and more to the point, the deputies acted in self-defense. 'The individual raised a weapon and pointed it at the deputies,' Whitmore said. 'They have to do what's necessary and in this case, they fired.' 'Please Don't Le Me Die': Angel Mendez pleaded with emergency workers to save his life after he was shot 10 times . Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said the Office of Independent Review found the shooting was justified . Jennifer Mendez told LA Weekly that she was ecstatic that the judge had found in her and Angel Mendez's favor. 'I'm really happy,' said Jennifer Mendez after the ruling. 'Justice was served.' The deputies had been looking for felony suspect Ronnie O’Dell, who was believed to be armed and dangerous.

Pulling over, the driver of the car in front gets out and unlocks a hefty padlock securing a steel gate. Passing through, we make our way down a dirt track to a windowless, breeze-block building that stands on its own in the centre of a field. This is not a clandestine meeting between members of a secret brotherhood. Rather, I am about to discover Hillier Nurseries’ trick to ensure hundreds of plants are in flower this week, when they attempt to land a coveted gold medal at the centennial Chelsea Flower Show. Winner's enclosure: Plantsman Ricky Dorlay in a cold store at the award-winning Hillier flower plant business on the outskirts of Romney in Southampton . It’s about 20C outside the building. Step inside and you’ll find a sliding door leading to a cold store where the temperature dives to 1C. Huddled together in the chilly vault are cornus, azalea, rhododendron, viburnum, sophora, pieris, spirea, choisya and many other beauties. All are in full bloom or smothered with buds. ‘Storing plants in here for several weeks holds them back a bit, so they are at their best for the show,’ says Andy McIndoe, 56, managing director of the nursery and driving force behind a floral exhibit that will see 4,000 plants arranged in the Great Pavilion, where more than 100 nurseries will display their wares. Based on the outskirts of Romsey, near Southampton, the renowned plant business has been established for almost 150 years. Since its first appearance at Chelsea in 1914, Hillier has bagged 72 gold medals and is the Guinness World Record holder for most consecutive golds awarded at the show, with an unbroken string of 67 since 1939 (the show did not take place from 1940 to 1946 owing to the Second World War). Andy has been responsible for staging the Hillier exhibit for 25 years. He says: ‘I don’t want to be the person responsible for bringing our winning run to an end. I’ve got my own two-acre garden but I don’t get to maintain it at all during May as Chelsea takes over my life.’ Award-winning: Queen Mary on a trip to one of the early Chelsea Flower Shows where Hillier holds the Guinness World Record for the most consecutive gold medals . The Royal Horticultural Society’s show runs from Tuesday to Saturday on its 11-acre site alongside the Thames Embankment in the grounds of The Royal Hospital. At the show, Andy and his team are creating a 65ft x 65ft display around the stone war memorial at the heart of the pavilion – the towering obelisk is a permanent structure built in 1849 to honour the soldiers who died in the Battle of Chillianwala during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. Hillier’s exhibit will be bisected by a slate pathway and feature an open-sided garden building, two circular raised pools measuring 13ft across, and a sculpture by Tom Stogdon, which will echo the shape of the war memorial. The structural backbone will be softened by shrubs, perennials, climbers, roses, conifers and 40 mature trees. Among the plants will be a quartet of debutantes. Astelia ‘Silver Shadow’ is an architectural plant with shiny silver, sword-shaped leaves, while Viburnum ‘Le Bois Marquis’ is a compact shrub with fragrant white summer flowers. Lavandula stoechas ‘Bouquet of Roses’ is a new form of French lavender with dainty blue and pink flowers and scented foliage containing hints of menthol and eucalyptus. A new bloom: The company's new lavender called 'Bouquet of Roses' which will feature in the show . Best of the bunch is Sambucus nigra ‘Blue Sheen’, an ornamental elder that has maroon-purple foliage with a blue tinge. Ideal in a mixed border or grown in a country garden setting, its sprays of pink flowers that appear in early summer are followed by dense clusters of shiny black fruit in autumn. Not all of the plants destined for Chelsea are placed in cold store. ‘The leaves of some will become drained of colour if they are subjected to chilly conditions, or they could drop both flowers and foliage when moved back outdoors,’ says Ricky Dorlay, 72, master plantsman at Hillier Nurseries. A veteran of 48 Chelsea campaigns, he estimates that he works seven days a week, 18 hours a day, in the months prior the show. He checks on the plants in cold store at least once a day, along with those grown in the warmth of a state-of-the art glasshouse. A structural plan for Hillier’s exhibit was drawn up about five months ago, but work began on site just eight days ago. About 13 lorry-loads of plant material have been transported from the nursery to the show ground since then. Four staff members started the building process, but about 25 will be there to work on the display in the next two days to ensure it looks first-class when scrutinised by the Royal Horticultural Society’s judges. Andy still suffers from butterflies in the weeks leading up to the show. ‘But the nerves soon disappear when you get on site because there’s a hell of a lot to do in such a short space of time,’ he says.","Hillier Nursery has scoped 72 gold medals at the Chelsea Flower Show .

Terusan was one of 21 orangutans released into the wild at the Bukit Batikap Conservation Forest earlier this month and their reactions - joyful, uncertain, apprehensive - were all caught on camera. And he's off! The cameraman can barely keep up as a young orangutan called Terusan bounds off into the Indonesian wild for the first time, running from the cage as soon as it is opened . No stopping me now! Terusan can't contain his excitement as he sprints off to explore his new environment at the Bukit Batikap conservation forest, to the obvious delight of his carers . The five mothers and their babies had been looked after at the Nyaru Menteng orangutan rescue and rehabilitation centre for several years and many had never experienced the wild. They were taken into rehabilitation as young orangutans who, although born wild, found themselves in captivity. It can take up to 12 years to prepare them for life in the wild, but pictures like these make all the work worthwhile. Another one shows Leonora and her baby .

The bus-sized meteor that slammed into Russia in February, injuring more than 1,000 people, setting off car alarms and shattering windows sent a plume of cosmic dust into the stratosphere that showered the Earth for three months. According to NASA's Suomi NPP weather satellite, the meteor left behind hundreds of tons of microscopic rubble when it detonated 15 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk on February 15. Some six months later, using the satellite's Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite, the space agency has released a video showing how the dust from the meteor, which also left visible chunks on the ground for passers by to pick up, was thrown up 28 miles and coated the Earth. Scroll down for video . Dust: According to NASA's Suomi NPP weather satellite, the meteor left behind hundreds of tones of microscopic rubble when it detonated 15 miles above the city of Chelyabinsk on February 15 . Lasting effect: The bus-sized meteor that slammed into Russia in February, injuring more than 1,000 people, setting off car alarms and shattering windows sent a plume of cosmic dust into the stratosphere that showered the Earth for three months . When the roughly 60 feet meteor exploded the heavier bits fell to the Earth, but the dust rose to dizzying heights, according to NASA. That represents far less material than is ejected by an erupting volcano, but it still got dragged around by the circulating atmosphere. After four days, the Suomi sensors had watched that dust plume wrap all the way around the planet. Eventually, it smeared into a single, 250 mile wide belt at an altitude of roughly 22 miles. The satellite watched it sit there there for months, slowly settling downward about 295 feet each day. Terrifying: Almost 1,200 people were injured when the meteor burst through the Earth's atmosphere at a speed of 46,000 mph . Friction: Burning from the friction with Earth's thin air, the space rock exploded 14.5 miles above the Russian town of Chelyabinsk . It was NASA Goddard atmospheric . physicist Nick Gorkavyi who came up with the idea to to track the cloud . using the incredible satellite. 'Indeed, . we saw the formation of a new dust belt in Earth's stratosphere, and . achieved the first space-based observation of the long-term evolution of . a bolide plume,' Gorkavyi, a Chelyabinsk native, said, according to Space.com. 'Initial . measurements 3.5 hours after the meteor explosion showed the dust 25 . miles high in the atmosphere, speeding east at 190 mph.' And within days the plume had 'circumnavigated the entire globe and returned to Chelyabinsk, creating a complete global belt.' Wake-up call: Experts said asteroid 2012 DA14 should drive nations to work together to create a warning system .

On a website dubbed Dewfeed that is built to look uncannily like the meme-spreading site, Texans for Republican Dan Patrick posted a series of short animated cat images that highlight what they call incumbent lieutenant governor David Dewhurst’s lack of leadership at June’s abortion bill filibuster. With posts like ‘Wendy Davis began her filibuster and Dewhurst began chasing his tail,’ Patrick gets catty in his fight to unseat Dewhurst, who has held the job since 2002. Win? Republican Dan Patrick hopes to oust lieutenant governor David Dewhurst with the help of animated cats on political site based on BuzzFeed called DewFeed . ‘The night that will live in Texas political infamy, as told by cats,’ is the title of the list of nine reasons—paired with cat GIFs—Patrick believes voters should out Dewhurst. The unusual campaign tactic was borne from the widespread criticism Dewhurst received following the short-lived Democrat victory over Texas abortion opponents led by a now nationally-known Wendy Davis. With the crowd in the Texas Senate gallery chanting at deafening levels, Dewhurst stood at the podium with his hands in his pockets as his fellow Republicans pleaded and shouted for order. Fail?

Amid one of the wildest scenes in the Texas Legislature in recent memory, Dewhurst failed to stop Davis and her supporters from running out the clock in her quest to stop the passage of a bill that all but bans abortions in the Lone Star State. Dewhurst faced almost immediate criticism from rivals within his own party and now Patrick is taking advantage of the initial spectacle by creating another. DewFeed pairs BuzzFeed’s rating system . with photos of the lieutenant governor: ‘LOL,’ ‘FAIL’ and ‘NOPE’ are . pinned to Dewhurst’s frowing mug. OMG: The site dubs June's abortion bill filibuster and the ensuing controversy as 'The night that will live in Texas political infamy, as told by cats' Cute? DewFeed uses BuzzFeed's highly recognizable list format and rating system of LOL, FAIL, OMG, etc . WTF? The site and its uncanny resemblance to BuzzFeed ends with a call to arms, so to speak--an animated cat fighting a dog with a Star Wars light sabre . Cats fight, sleep drunkenly, and generally act like fools in the GIFs that tell the story of the filibuster and Dewhurst’s role in it as the person in charge of controlling the flow of state legislation. The list ends with a call to arms. Above the final GIF, of a cat and dog fighting with Star Wars light sabres, comes the plea for votes. ‘Support Dan Patrick, candidate for Texas Lt. Governor,’ it reads. ‘He’ll never back down from a fight.’ V is for victory! Wendy Davis, Texas state senator from Ft. Worth, reacts to her successful filibuster in June. The democrat's victory may lead to Dewhurst's failure .

But the drug has devastating side effects, including paranoia and aggressive behaviour.. Hampshire Police Detective Constable Jonathan Hyland warned people about the consequences of taking legal highs. He said: 'The clear issue is people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs they read on-line are a substitute for controlled drugs. 'People incorrectly believe these ""legal highs"" are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs. 'Just because something is not illegal does not make it safe. 'Unfortunately, it appears anyone can call anything a ""legal high"" and sell it as ""safe"". 'It only becomes clear it is not safe when someone becomes severely harmed by taking it and subsequent investigations reveal substances within the compound can be lethal. 'This is the third exceptionally serious case involving AMT in Hampshire since 2012. 'If you are considering taking any type of non personally prescribed drug, I would urge you to consider for a few minutes before you use the substance.

A riot broke out at a juvenile correctional facility in South Central Florida Saturday night over a Cup Noodles deal gone wrong. According to Polk County Sheriff's spokesman Carrie Eleazer, two groups at the all-male facility Avon Park Youth Academy in Polk, Florida were engaging in a low-stakes game of basketball. A group from St Petersburg was playing a group from Orlando. At stake: three packages of instant ramen. Out of control: A riot broke out Saturday night at a juvenile detention center in South Central Florida over three packages of Cup Noodles . But when the St Petersburg team lost, they refused to give over the the instant noodles, sparking a brawl between the two teams. That fight started chaos at the private detention facility maintained by the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice, but run by the private correction company G4S which houses 138 juveniles. Valuable: The fight broke out when a losing basketball team refused to hand over the agreed-upon prize of three instant noodle packages . Police were notified and the staff were immediately called out of the building since they are not equipped to deal with violence at the compounds. 'Employees are not allowed to have any specialty equipment to include pepper spray, which would have allowed them to deal with the fight before it escalated to a riot,' Eleazer said. The riot wasn't contained until 12am the next day. Eleazer estimates that the rioting juveniles caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. Some juveniles gained access to an office building holding their records and set it on fire as well as setting a dumpster on fire. Eighteen of the 20 buildings on the compound were heavily damaged. By the time authorities from several law enforcement agencies showed up, they were handcuffing all of the teens in 'flex' handcuffs. None of the juveniles escaped. Seven detainees were injured in the riot including one broken leg. Sixty-four of the juveniles were transported to the PCSO South County Jail in Frostproof where they were placed in state custody. They are being separated from the adult inmates. The rest stayed at the academy. Eleazer says the Sheriff's office is investigating the riot and will be issuing felony charges to those involved. None of the riot was caught on camera since the facility doesn't have surveillance monitors and the academy is in a rural area on the Avon Park Air Force Range. The juveniles housed at the academy are considered 'moderate risk'. Juveniles sent to the academy are between the ages of 16 and 18 and stay an average of 270 days. No cameras: A police spokesman said none of the riot was caught on camera as there are not security cameras in place at the rural facility .","The Avon Park Youth Academy in Polk, Florida was taken over for more than three hours by delinquents Saturday night .

Cory Booker's internet start up faces another high-profile departure as it has been revealed that the company's CEO is leaving the flailing video aggregation site. It was previously rumored that founding member Nathan Richardson was being interviewed for a possible board position on another company but they initially said that such a position 'would not impact' his work with Booker's company, called Waywire. Now it has been reported that Richardson is leaving the day-to-day operations of the company, just as a handful of staffers and the teenage son of CNN head Jeff Zucker all departed before him. Moving on: Nathan Richardson (left) is now leaving the company he founded with Cory Booker (right) TechCrunch reported that Richardson, who was founded Waywire along with Booker and Silicon Valley consultant Sarah Ross, is leaving and though his new job has not been confirmed, initial speculation connects him to AOL. The video aggregation company is said to be losing cash quickly and it is supposedly being kept alive through early November so that it's closure doesn't hurt Booker's chances at winning the New Jersey Senate race. The latest news about the floundering company comes weeks after it was revealed that the 15-year-old son of CNN president Jeff Zucker had a position on the company's advisory board and had stock options in the company. The teenager resigned just hours later, and it now is clear that he is not the first person to leave the company. Running for office: After a slew of highly-publicized departures, there is speculation that the company is only staying afloat to keep it open while Booker runs for Senate . It was known that the small company had a round of layoffs in the spring, but now The New York Post reported that eight people left in April. 'When the company moved its focus from original production to curation, the production team was impacted. Several were given the option of changed, curation-focused roles with the company; they declined,' a spokeswoman told The Post. Booker did his best on last week to calm the fires without actually revealing any more details after a debate last week. Her idea: Sarah Ross is said to be the one who approached Jeff Zucker's son Andrew (seen with his father at left in 2009) to be a member of the advisory board of Cory Booker's start-up Waywire. He has since resigned . Connected: Sarah Ross, seen here talking with Booker and trailed by Mark Zuckerberg, is well known in Silicon Valley . 'This company is in its infancy. Of . course it has changed its business model. It’s going through changes,' he said of the internal overhaul at Waywire. 'I’m a part of an ownership group and we’ve concluded not to discuss that.' The . other parts of the ownership group are Mr Richardson and Sarah Ross, who admitted to being the one to suggest Zucker . join the board because the teenager is apparently known for his insight . into popular trends among teens. Ms . Ross then had a conversation with both Jeff and Andrew Zucker and they . agreed to have the now-15-year-old sign on to Waywire's advisory board . and receive a 'de minimus' amount of stock options in return. An . unidentified source told CNN Money that Booker himself was 'not . involved at all' with the decision, and Ms Ross herself admitted at an . early stage that the politician would not be a part of the day-to-day . operations of the start up. Promoting the brand: If Booker wins, he will have to resign from the board of Waywire and stop promoting it from his well-followed Twitter feed . The . New York Times reported that even in the nascent phase, it was clear . among the founders that Booker would be a more public role. When . the launched the company, Ms Ross reportedly said to Booker: 'You know . what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don’t have to . be involved — you’ve got a full-time job. But found the company.’ Unlike . many of the other boldface names connected to Waywire, like Oprah . Winfrey and Google's Eric Schmidt, it does not seem as if the elder . Zucker actually has any financial stake in the company. Very little has previously been revealed about the start-up, which was officially created in May 2012.

United States military units in Afghanistan are in the midst of the biggest force pullout in American history and it's resulting in the biggest yard sale of military hardware in American history. An estimated $50billion in military hardware - from armored vehicles to dining room sets, combat uniforms to vending machines - must be removed from the country by the end of 2014. The cost of bringing equipment home is reach an estimated $6billion. More than a decade of war is nearly over and the military no longer has use for much of the equipment. As a result, billions worth of hardware is being auctioned off online - much of it even available to civilians in the U.S. Pulling out: Billions of dollars worth of military equipment must be airlifted out of Afghanistan as U.S. troops prepare to pullout at the end of next year . Billions of dollars more is being scrapped and sold for scrap metal at pennies on the pound. The military is rushing to clear everything out of Afghanistan, or risk it falling into Taliban hands when American forces leave at the end of 2014. Fox News reports that the online auction site Government Liquidation is gearing up to handle billions of dollars worth of surplus sales in online auctions. The site generated more than $500million for the U.S. treasury by 2011 - before the massive draw-down efforts even began. The operation, called a retrograde, is complicated by the fact that the military must move nearly all of the equipment out of Afghanistan before it can sell it. eBay for the Army: Much of the equipment will wind up being sold on Government Liquidation, an online auction site for surplus military goods . Most of potential buyers, even allied militaries, aren't in a position to collect the equipment from war-torn Afghanistan. The Afghan military, already overburdened with the logistics of training and fielding a security force, cannot handle much influx of American equipment and U.S. commanders fear that just dumping the hardware on the Afghan National Army would result in much of it falling into disuse or, worse, into enemy hands. As a result, millions of tons of equipment must be shipped out of country, either by air freight or overland through Pakistan - both costly propositions. 'We’re making history doing what we’re doing here,' Major General Kurt Stein, the commander of the 1st Sustainment Command, told the Washington Post. Down the drain: Some 2,000 MRAP vehicles are being torn down for scrap in Afghanistan because the military doesn't need them anymore and cannot sell them . 'This is the largest retrograde mission in history.' The transport numbers are staggering. The military will move 95,000 cargo containers out of Afghanistan and 35,000 vehicles. But, despite the military's claim of efficiency, there are casualties - billions being wasted. The military own 25,500 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles across the globe - including 11,000 in Afghanistan. The vehicles were hastily-developed to cope with the IED threat of fighting an insurgency. In the rush to bring them to the battlefield, the military built too many. A report predicted that the military no longer has use for 12,300 of those vehicles - nearly half of the current inventory. As a result, 2,000 of the MRAPs - which cost taxpayers $1million each to build - are being torn down and sold for scrap. The metal is worth pennies on the pound in the Afghanistan scrap market, the Post reports.","Military equipment from 12 years of war must be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014 .

The now-disbanded UK Border Agency spent more than £13 million in the last year to cover immigrants’ legal fees in cases it lost, accounts have shown. The Agency's adverse legal costs rose by more than 44per cent compared with the previous year. The troubled organisation, which was abolished in March, paid adverse legal costs when they lost a case and were ordered to cover the costs of the successful party. Critics of the agency who called for it to be shut down, say the figures show who troubled the immigration system is. Keith Vaz MP, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'I am astonished that these figures are so high. 'This . is a complete waste of taxpayers’ money. Ultimately, the legal fees are . the result of poor decision-making by the former UKBA. 'If the Home Office had concentrated on fixing the system rather than covering up backlogs this figure would have been less.' The UKBA spent £2.5 million on flights originally booked to remove ineligible asylum seekers, which had to be cancelled when the asylum seekers were granted the right to appeal. The amount was a 24per cent increase on the previous year. The adverse legal costs come under the 'special payments' section of the UKBA accounts, which in total surged . 37per cent to £21.9 million in 2012/13 from £15.5 million in the previous year. The figures have been disclosed in the UKBA’s final annual report. The Home Secretary, Theresa May, split the Agency into two bodies- UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which are now under the control of ministers. Poor performance: The UKBA was disbanded in March. Its final annual spending report shows increases in the amount spent on adverse legal costs, including a pay out of more than £240,000 to one family . Adverse legal costs in cases with a . cumulative total of less than £250,000 added up to £12.6 million- an . increase of 44per cent from £8.7 million in the previous year. Special payments made in cases with cumulative totals of more than £250,000 increased by 19per cent to £1.6 million. A . family who challenges their removal were paid £104,000 in adverse legal . costs. An extra £138,000 in adverse legal costs was paid to five . individuals of the same family in relation to an unlawful detention . claim. £1 million was spent in returned appeal fees after losing challenges referred to the Immigration Appeals Tribunal.

Mr. Ayinde was found guilty in his latest trial of having intercourse with a daughters when she was as young as eight-years-old. The second sentence adds to the 40 year sentence Mr Ayinde received in a 2011 trial for sexually assaulting a separate daughter. Mr. Ayinde is known for directing the music video for the Fugees 1996 smash hit ‘Killing Me Softly.’ Disturbed man: Aswad Ayinde hides his face with a piece of paper during his sentencing, he received 50 years in prison after being found guilty of raping his daughter . In a disturbing disclosure during his first trial, Mr. Ayinde’s former wife said he was trying to create a ‘pure family bloodline’ by impregnating his daughters. He even claimed during a pre-trial hearing before the first trial that 'the world was going to end, and it was just going to be him and his offspring and that he was chosen.' In this latest trial, it was revealed that Mr. Ayinde began having intercourse with his second daughter from the time she eight-years-old, impregnating her four times. The sexual assaults happened for almost 30 years until Mr. Ayinde and his wife separated, officials said. They occurred in numerous homes across northern New Jersey, even while the family was under watch of state child welfare officials, according to NBC New York. Some of the rapes even took place in an abandoned funeral home. The family moving as far away as Florida to avoid investigation after case workers removed multiple children from the Ayinde household in 2000, resulting in Mr. Ayinde being arrested for kidnapping for trying to take them from state custody in a medical center, NBC New York reported. Craven: Mr. Ayinde was found guilty of repeatedly raping one of his daughters for decades - from the time she was only eight years old - and fathering four children with her . He pleaded guilty to lesser charges and received a year’s probation – as he continued raping one daughter for at least another two years, according to officials. The depraved father also beat and starved the girls using wooden boards and steel-toed boots for even ‘minor transgressions,’ Ayinde’s wife testified at the first trial. Some of the children Ayinde fathered with his daughters were born in the home, with at least two babies who died in the home having been buried without notifying authorities or obtaining birth certificates, NBC New York reported. Award-winning: Mr. Ayinde's video for 'Killing Me Softly' won 'Best R&B Video' at the 1996 MTV Video Music Awards . Mr. Ayinde also fathered 12 additional children with an additional three women, according to court records . Ayinde’s tortured daughters were home schooled and isolated from other children, so as to keep the family secrets hidden, the station added. With his wife too afraid to confront him, Mr. Ayinde carried out his evil plan without hindrance even while directing the music video for the Fugees 1996 breakout hit ‘Killing Me Softly, for which he won  ‘Best R&B Video' at the 1996 MTV Music Video Awards. The Fugees are also originally from Northern New Jersey. Mr. Ayinde faces three more trials over the alleged assaults.","This was only the second of five trials for Aswad Ayinde .

Lambeth Palace said Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby took part in live pheasant hunt in the 1980s . Striding along with a shotgun in hand, scouring the skies for a likely target … it is not exactly how one pictures the Archbishop of Canterbury. Well, until now. It has emerged that Justin Welby once went pheasant shooting. And, rather unfortunately, the revelation came the day after he turned down the role of RSPCA vice-patron. Dr Welby rejected the honorary post because he was too busy. But the decision to break with tradition by refusing the role is being seen in some circles as a snub. And details of the Anglican leader’s links with country sports will do little to endear him to animal lovers. Lambeth Palace has admitted Dr Welby ‘went on a live pheasant shoot on one occasion in the mid-1980s’, when he worked as an oil company executive. He was described as a ‘reasonable shot’ during the outing on an estate in Cambridgeshire. Dr Welby is also said to have been clay pigeon shooting on half a dozen occasions, most recently last year while visiting Texas for a meeting of the American House of Bishops. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, an animal rights group, said: ‘Welby should be honest about his past and make clear what he now thinks about the morality of shooting birds for sport.’ But Lambeth Palace insists it has no bearing on his RSPCA decision. Dr Welby’s four predecessors, including Rowan Williams and George Carey, all accepted honorary positions in the charity’s hierarchy. A Lambeth Palace spokesman said: ‘The Archbishop has received many kind invitations to patron a large variety of charities and good causes. Each invitation has been an honour, and in an ideal world he would like to accept them all. The Archbishop's predecessor Dr Rowan Williams (pictured) accepted the honorary role . Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop's links to countryside sports has no bearing on his decision (file picture) ‘However, in light of the sheer volume of requests the Archbishop receives, and the many pressures on his time and resources, he has reluctantly decided to restrict his patronage to a manageable number of organisations. 'The Archbishop has enormous admiration for the RSPCA and hopes to see its work thrive.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA said it respected Dr Welby’s decision, adding: ‘The position of vice-patron is not held by every Archbishop of Canterbury as a matter of course.’ However, the RSPCA has caused controversy recently. Critics accuse the charity of increasing ‘militancy’ by focusing on expensive political stunts and strong-arm tactics at the expense of its core mission to protect animals. Earlier this month an investigation for BBC Radio 4’s Face the Facts uncovered allegations that the organisation had lost its way and was too quick to take people to court. In the past five years, the RSPCA’s membership has slipped by 5,000 to 26,000 but annual donations remain at around £100 million.","Archbishop of Canterbury went on pheasant hunt during 1980s .

Employers' group the CBI has hiked its forecast for economic growth for this year – giving a further boost to hopes Britain is dragging itself from the post-recession doldrums. The body, which represents around 240,000 UK companies, raised its expectations for growth in gross domestic product from 1 per cent to 1.2 per cent during 2013 as confidence among business people increases. And for next year, the CBI reckons the economic recovery will gather pace with growth of 2.3 per cent compared with 2 per cent forecast previously. An increase in households’ disposable income, investment among businesses and the strengthening housing market will all support domestic demand, the organisation said in its latest forecasts. The upgrade to economic prospects comes after data from the eurozone last week confirmed the single currency bloc has emerged from recession. The CBI said the good news from Britain’s trading partner, along with a broader global recovery, means a positive boost to exports can be expected. But it’s not all plain sailing. The CBI warns that the government’s plan to rebalance the economy away from the dominant service sector – which depends on consumer spending – and towards manufacturing and overseas sales is taking longer than hoped. CBI director-general John Cridland said: ‘The economy has started to gain momentum and confidence is picking up, but it’s still early days. ‘We need to see a full-blown rebalancing of our economy, with stronger business investment and trade before we can call a sustainable recovery. We hope that will begin to emerge next year, as the eurozone starts growing again.’ Cridland also urged the Government to ‘get behind talented UK businesses’ to help them break into new export markets around the globe. Meanwhile the organisation also gave its backing to new Bank of England governor Mark Carney, saying the Bank’s recently-announced ‘forward guidance’ policy - designed to provide reassurance that interest rates will remain low for some time to come - will add to positive sentiment. The Bank of England has indicated the cost of borrowing will remain at its historic low of 0.5 per cent until at least 2016 . The bank has indicated the cost of borrowing will remain at its historic low of 0.5 per cent until at least 2016, although some City economists believe interest rates will have to rise sooner. The CBI predicts a slow strengthening of household spending in the second half of this year and through the next, with confidence lifting and better credit conditions. Improved spending power should be supported by a fall-back in inflation, a rise in disposable income and a stable labour market, it forecasts. Business investment, set to fall 2.8 per cent this year should grow by 7.3 per cent in 2014, the organisation said, with export growth of 0.7 per cent rising to 4.9 per cent - though imports are also expected to go up, from a negative 0.3 per cent this year to a rise of 4.4 per cent. Unemployment is expected to fall from 7.8 per cent in 2013 to 7.6 per cent in 2014, as the number of hours worked increases and productivity begins to recover. The joblessness figure has taken on increased significance after the Bank of England said that, subject to inflation fears, interest rates would remain at historic lows until it fell to 7 per cent.","CBI represents around 240,000 UK companies and has raised its expectations for growth domestic product .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 05:26 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:17 EST, 19 August 2013 . Dangerous criminals in top-security jails are being allowed to cook their own food as a reward for good behaviour, it has emerged. Offenders can purchase food from an approved list with their own money and are then allowed to prepare it to their liking in the prison kitchens. The self-catering scheme has been rolled out across many low-security jails to help inmates cope when they are released but sources claim the option is also being offered to dangerous offenders. Even inmates at high security jails, such as Full Sutton in Yorkshire where murderer Jeremy Bamber is serving his sentence and Long Lartin in Worcestershire where preacher Abu Hamza  was held, are being offered the perk. Controversial: Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire is one of the high-security jails to offer inmates the chance to cook their own food as a reward for good behaviour . Radical Islamists Abu Qatada (left) and Abu Hamza (right) have both been held at Long Lartin prison . A source told The Times: 'This is about providing an extra range of food for the most dangerous and more difficult prisoners - the ones the public would like the least.' Prisoners, who have to use money from their own allowance which can very between £4 and £25 a week, can purchase a 1.4kg frozen chicken for £3.69 or 370g of pork chops for £1.99, the newspaper reports. At Full Sutton prison, around a quarter of the 600 inmates are on the self-catering scheme with many more wanting to join. Other prisons to run the scheme include Frankland and Low Newton in County Durham and Gartree in Leicestershire. The revelation is likely to provoke questions for Justice Secretary Chris Grayling who has promised a tough stance on crime. Full Sutton prison in Yorkshire, where murderer Jeremy Bamber, pictured, is serving his sentence, is also offering the perk to inmates . A Prison Service spokeswoman said the self-catering scheme offered offenders a 'productive way to spend their time' while helping those due to be released to prepare for an 'independent life after prison'. They added that the scheme is also an incentive for prisoners to show good behaviour as the privilege is removed from any prisoner who does not comply with the prison regime. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'We are introducing a tough new regime in our prisons, and we are serious about enforcing it. 'There are a small number of kitchen facilities that provide prisoners serving long sentences with a productive way to spend their time and assist in their rehabilitation by preparing them for an independent life after prison. 'Prisoners are only able to use kitchens if they have earned the right to do so through good behaviour, they must order items from a controlled list and pay for them from their own earnings. In the high security prisons only plastic knives are available.' But . a little over a month ago, prisoners at HMP Long Lartin revealed that . Islamic extremists held at the jail threatened to stab anyone who tried . to cook pork in the communal kitchens. In . a letter to prisoners' magazine Inside Time, one inmate claimed it was . 'deemed dangerous, even a threat to your life' if you attempted to cook . the meat. 'Terror' preacher Abu Hamza and radical cleric Abu Qatada have both been held at the prison . The . inmate wrote: 'The kitchen is usually occupied by 90 per cent Muslims . and we have been told if we cook pork we will be stabbed. There have . been incidents here where people have been targeted and pressured and . bullied into converting to Islam. 'Young Muslim men are being radicalised in here and one day they may commit acts of terrorism in this country. 'There seems to be nothing being done here to stop it and people are scared to speak out.' Those . prisoners who are not allowed to use the self-catering option have to . pick their meals from a menu which includes a vegetarian option.

One of Ed Miliband’s closest allies attempted to defend him yesterday after fresh attacks – but blundered by echoing an infamous sound bite used by ousted Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna accused Mr Miliband’s Labour critics of ‘hysteria’ as Lord Prescott led a chorus of disapproval about his performance this summer. Responding to Lord Prescott’s criticisms, Mr Umunna said: ‘We are talking loud and of course we will be turning up the volume even louder.’ Unfortunate words: Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Labour would be 'turning up the volume' Mr Duncan Smith tried to answer his critics at the 2003 Tory conference by declaring: ‘The quiet man is here to stay and he is turning up the volume.’ He was ousted 20 days later. In a further blow to Mr Miliband, two polls yesterday found that fewer than half of Labour supporters think he is doing a good job. ComRes found that 46 per cent of Labour supporters and just 22 per cent of voters as a whole believe he is a good leader of the Opposition. The YouGov survey found that 49 per cent of Labour supporters approve of his performance, but 43 think he is ‘doing badly’. By contrast, 92 per cent of Tories think David Cameron is doing well. But it is criticism from within his own party that Mr Miliband will find most wounding.

It is time for Ed to show he is a grown-up politician big enough to lead this country.’ Cursed saying: Work and Pensions secretary Ian Duncan Smith uttered similar words shortly before he was ousted as Tory leader . Mr Miliband has been on the back foot for several weeks after he and his senior shadow cabinet colleagues took time off while David Cameron and his top team toured the TV studios promoting policies. Lord Prescott wrote yesterday: ‘This summer, we massively failed to get our case over to the public and hold the Tories to account.

"Downing Street says he takes work with him on holiday . By . Chris Brooke . PUBLISHED: . 08:54 EST, 18 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:00 EST, 19 August 2013 . David Cameron has taken his family on a third holiday of the summer – to a hideaway on the remote Scottish island of Jura. The Prime Minister spent a long weekend at a sprawling 20,000-acre estate owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor. The remote home is reachable only by a 20-minute ferry ride, making it an ideal location for a spot of downtime away from prying eyes. With a population of just 200 (as well as 4,000 deer), it is famous for malt whisky, stunning views, pristine beaches – and unpredictable weather. David Cameron is on his third summer break. The Prime Minister and his wife Samantha are pictured at a market in Aljezur, on the southwestern coast of Portugal, in June . The picturesque island of Jura, where Samantha Cameron's stepfather owns a large estate . Unfortunately for the PM, his wife and their three children, they had to endure spells of heavy rain. The family are due to head south from the Inner Hebrides today to a fourth holiday destination – their now-traditional summer break in Cornwall. Daughter Florence was born there in 2010 when Mrs Cameron went into labour unexpectedly and they are likely to spend the rest of the week enjoying the outdoor life away from Westminster. Perhaps with an eye on his image, Mr Cameron is remaining in the UK for his August ‘staycation’. David Cameron and his wife take a drink by a beach during their holiday on the Spanish Balearic island of Ibiza, Spain in May . The Cornish break is a traditional feature of the Cameron summer and daughter Florence was born during the family holiday in 2010 when Mrs Cameron went into labour unexpectedly . But the family’s other two summer trips have both been to Europe. With . the Tories improving in the polls, the holidays have been coming thick . and fast in 2013. At the end of May Mr Cameron and his family took an . easyJet flight for a week-long holiday in Ibiza where Mrs Cameron is . said to enjoy the nightclub music scene. They stayed in a villa which comes with staff and can be rented for up to £11,000 a week. Then last month the holiday tour of Europe moved on to another popular hotspot ... the Algarve region of Portugal. They took another budget airline flight to Faro and enjoyed two weeks in Aljezur. by Tony Rennell . The solitude and the silence were as seductive as the view. I was standing on the cliff top at the northern tip of Jura, staring across at rocky Scarba and Mull in one direction and down the strait to  the Corryvreckan whirlpool that almost drowned the writer George Orwell 66 years ago. To get here we’d crawled and bumped for miles across heather, bracken, bog and streams in an eight-wheeled all-terrain vehicle, glimpsing some of the island’s deer – 20 times more plentiful than Jura’s 200 human settlers, though still hard to spot in an area twice the size of Glasgow. Buzzards and eagles mewl overhead, adders slither beneath your feet, a wilderness to lose yourself in. Magnificent: The view of Tarbert on Jura during a rare gap in the clouds . We picnicked in a bothy on the beach where, in 1674, the Macleans of Jura and the Campbells of Mull hacked each other to death. And we felt as cut off from the modern world as it is possible to be. There was blue sky (for now – clouds on the way), bright sun (but rain on the way), a cutting wind, of course – that’s how it is in the Hebrides. Changeable, like the economy, like politics. There’s a sureness about the sun in Tuscany and the Algarve, other holiday destinations favoured by David Cameron. But perhaps his fleeting love affair with remote Jura is because its uncertainties and vagaries are more down-to-earth, more real. Or perhaps not. I say fleeting because his visit to the island where his in-laws have a holiday home was short, just a weekend before he’s off to crowded Cornwall. Cameron often waxes lyrical about the island. ‘I fish and try to catch the odd sea trout or mackerel,’ he said. ‘It’s a wonderful place. I don’t mind cold water and there are really beautiful beaches up there.’ Peaceful: Tarbert Lodge on the Isle of Jura where Prime Minister David Cameron spends his holidays . Gently shelving into the sea with soft sand dunes behind, those beaches are perfect playgrounds where his three young children can run free, just as my own son did last year. But talk about beaches may obscure other activities on Jura that the PM is more reluctant to discuss. He has gone out of his way to throw off the image of a huntin’ and shootin’ type (the fishin’ seems not to worry him, though he  says he doesn’t have the patience for it). He is known, however, to be an expert marksman, and the vast Astor estate is prime deerstalking territory. It is a pursuit the younger Cameron once relished – though apparently not the raw deer’s liver that was once put in front of him to eat. He has apparently given up stalking – in which individual deer for culling are tracked and then shot – because it sends the wrong political message, but that won’t stop tongues wagging. The Astor estate has also attracted controversy because ownership of the land is registered offshore in the Bahamas – the tax benefits of which for his wife’s family could also be something of a political embarrassment. These issues apart, what troubles me about the PM’s lightning visit to Jura is that, to get the benefit of island life, to drink in its soul-cleansing simplicity (as well as its renowned single-malt whisky), you need to give it time. Cosy; Inside Tabert Lodge on the Isle of Jura where David Cameron spends his holidays with his family . Time allows you to motor slowly the 30 miles of Jura’s one road, grandly called the A846, as it winds over the craggy hill from the ferry at Feolin and is often little more than a track with passing places. It passes through Craighouse, Jura’s one-shop, one-pub, one-garage town, dominated by its distillery. Then it crawls along the west coast before petering out well short of Orwell’s rented cottage, Barnhill, a place judged remote even by Jura’s extreme standards. To the west of that road is nothing but wilderness, mile after mile of it, soggy with water, riddled with lochs and dominated by the Paps, three round-topped mountains that climbers, walkers and joggers come from across the world to conquer, all three in one day for the most hardy. On the far side of the island, for the few intrepid souls who reach it, there are nothing but raised beaches formed by the retreating glaciers of the ice age and vast caves gouged out over aeons. With all that space and rugged countryside, Jura is a veritable outdoor gym for the athletically-minded. The air is good to breathe and apparently always has been. Back in 1703 a visitor named Martin Martin described Jura as ‘perhaps the wholesomest plot of ground in the isles or continent of Scotland’. With all that space and rugged countryside, Jura is a veritable outdoor gym for the athletically-minded . He was impressed by ‘the long life of the natives and their state of health, to which the height of the hills contributes in large measure by the fresh breezes that come from them to purify the air’. The island has proved good for the soul, too. George Orwell made the journey here to write in 1947, a city dweller drawn by the solitude. It took him two days to get from London, his journey ending with a seven-mile walk from the end of the road. The track was so overgrown he had to cut his way through some parts with a scythe. Once, he went out to sea, misread the tide and wind and was nearly sucked down to his doom in a rowing boat on the  Corryvreckan whirlpool. He survived to complete his ‘Big Brother’ masterpiece 1984, a grim perspective on the modern world that was perhaps possible to conjure up only in somewhere so apparently ‘uncivilised’. ‘On Jura,’ says the author Robert Macfarlane, ‘Orwell found himself able to think and see differently, roused by the country – harsh, graceful, aerial, marine – that surrounded him.’ The solitude of these islands still inspires writers. My novelist wife spent two years on neighbouring Islay. ‘I loved the peace, the freedom to live by my own rhythm,’ she recalls, ‘as well as the extraordinary beauty.’ She is English and was alone but no one meddled or interfered, except with friendship, bowls of unsurpassed Scotch broth and a dram. As far as local people were concerned, she was just the writer who lived in the old gamekeeper’s cottage. It was a relief to be away from urban living to something altogether simpler. There is a magic that draws some people – us included, as often as possible – back to our Hebridean haunts. It’s not for everyone. The insularity can turn in on itself, the very remoteness a curse rather than a blessing. Most islanders will confess to cabin fever at some stage or another. Some leave for good. But generally those who grew up on the islands or have been bitten by the bug return to the tranquillity, the cosiness, the sense of purpose. Island life is not idyllic. It can be pretty hard at times, with driving rain and cold winds in the winter, and plagues of midges descending on any patch of bare skin in the summer. Yet the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. ‘It moved me, saddened me, engaged my imagination and touched my spirit’ was how my wife put it. You don’t get that from a fleeting visit, Mr Cameron.","Mr Cameron is on the island of Jura in Scotland on a 20,000 acre estate .

David Cameron, pictured today, has privately discussed plans to ensure a power-share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015, it has been claimed . David Cameron is plotting to make Tory MPs sign a new coalition with the Liberal Democrats, it was claimed last night. The Prime Minister has privately discussed plans with cabinet ministers to ensure a power-share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015. Under the plans, backbenchers will get to vote on a new arrangement in order to ‘dip their hands in blood’. Many Tory rebels have refused to accept the compromises of coalition government because they had no previous say over the deal with the Lib Dems. Nick Clegg’s MPs, however, have been generally less rebellious because they voted to join the coalition. A Tory Cabinet Minister said: ‘They had meeting after meeting about the deal. Yes, it took a bit longer, but it meant that every one of them was actively signed up to the Coalition, and that’s meant they’ve been quite disciplined, all things considered.’ Referring to his Conservative colleagues, the minister said: ‘A lot of them don’t feel they had a say, so they aren’t under the same obligation to be supportive. 'We want to avoid that if we have to do it again.’ Ministers have long hinted that Mr Cameron should secure his party’s support before another coalition arrangement. But the discovery that he is already planning for power sharing will anger many – particularly during a period when Labour’s poll lead is evaporating and the Tories are more confident of winning. Mr Cameron privately believes that he can win a majority, but his aides believe they should prepare for all eventualities. Giving MPs veto powers over the terms of a coalition might dissuade them from seeking to oust him if he falls short of outright victory in the polls again.

Ms Jackson said: 'It’s very frustrating because the police often say they can’t take action on internet bullying because the sites these messages are posted on are foreign. 'No-one is willing to be responsible for policing these sites. Someone needs to find these trolls who are abusing people anonymously and lock them up. 'I’m providing the police and the sites with as much evidence as I can but the problem is getting worse and worse. 'There has to be a harsh penalty.

The two guards were attacked after an inmate was not allowed a second helping of food, it has been reported. The incident came just two days after a report warned of 'realistic concerns' that spending cuts would threaten the safety of staff and inmates at the prison. Two prison guards have been attacked by an inmate at Pentonville Prison in North London (file picture) In the attack on Thursday a male officer was punched in the face by an inmate, The Mirror has reported. A female officer was thrown against a wall by a second inmate when she tried to intervene. According to the paper, both of them were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises. Scotland Yard has said it is investigating the incident. A Prison Service spokesman told . MailOnline: 'Two members of staff from HMP Pentonville were treated in . hospital following an incident involving two prisoners on August 15. This incident has been referred to the police. 'Pentonville has a zero tolerance to . violence. Any prisoners engaging in violent behaviours will be stripped . of their privileges and are subject to disciplinary action.' The incident came just two days after a report had warned spending cuts would threaten the safety of staff and inmates at the prison (pictured) Steve Gillan, the Prison Officers Association's national secretary, told The Mirror there had been a rise in such attacks, which the association believed was due to Government cuts. But last month Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said the assault rate in prisons had fallen over the last five years and was at its lowest since 2004. He said: 'We have a zero tolerance approach to violence in all our prisons. 'We have systems in place to deal with perpetrators quickly and robustly, with serious incidents referred to the police for prosecution.

'We are committed to open and transparent reporting of data relating to deaths in custody, self-harm and assaults. It remains a priority to reduce the number of deaths and violence in custody. Prisons take the responsibility of keeping prisoners, staff and visitors safe extremely seriously.' A report by Pentonville Prison's independent monitoring board last week warned conditions at the prison remained unsatisfactory, The Evening Standard reported. The report said: 'The physical environment of this prison is a reproach to 21st-century Britain.' In June last year one of Britain's longest serving murderers John Massey escaped from the prison. He was arrested two days later following an 'intelligence-led operation, the Metropolitan Police said. Massey, who had broken out of jail twice before, accomplished his most dramatic escape using a makeshift rope to scale the walls of the Victorian-built prison. Last week's report said the escape was one of a number of problems the prison faced, although there had also been 'many positives' during the previous 12 months.","Report warned spending cuts would threaten safety of staff two days earlier .

A father was stabbed to death after rushing to the aid of his son, as an early morning argument spiralled into a murder. Mechanic Stephan Hollow was named by his neighbours as the victim of the knife attack just yards from his doorstep. It was understood that the 53-year-old had rushed to protect his son Tyler, known as 'Ty', 22 years, who suffered facial injuries in a row at their terraced house.

An abandoned village that was commandeered by the army during the war has its first new residents in 70 years - colonies of rare native honey bees. The deserted village of Imber on Salisbury Plain has been picked as the ideal location for a project aimed at boosting the population of the endangered British black bee. About 95 per cent of bees in the UK are non-native and were introduced here in the 1920s after a disease virtually wiped out the indigenous honey bee. Fresh start: Bee keeper Chris Wilkes is pictured in front of what is left of the deserted village of Imber on the Salisbury Plain where he hopes to build new colonies of British black bees . Abandoned: The village, pictured around 1900, was commandeered by the army so soldiers could practice ahead of the D-Day landings during WWII . New home: The deserted village of Imber, near Warminster, Wiltshire, is now surrounded by nectar-rich wildflowers which make the spot ideal to introduce new colonies of the endangered British black bee . Despite this, the bee population has been drastically decreasing in the UK and around the world primarily because of man-made problems. Change in climate and agricultural practices such as misuse of pesticides is one of the reasons for the decline combined with the loss of their natural habitat. Most crops - about 70 per cent - require pollination to develop fruits, nuts, and seeds. If the bee population continues to dwindle, we could face a food epidemic on a global scale. Beekeeper Chris Wilkes now hops to reverse that trend by reintroducing Britain's native bee. Boosting numbers: It is hoped the project will help boost the dwindling population of the British black bee . Conservation effort: Chris Wilkes has received permission from the MoD to set up 14 colonies of British black bees near St Giles church is Imber to help prevent the species from going extinct . Military site: The area surrounding Imber village is off limits for more than 300 days a year while the army practice drills . And he chose Imber as the perfect . spot to introduce 14 colonies of British black bees that won’t be . interfered with by competing foreign flying insects. Imber was evacuated in December 1943 by the military for training U.S. soldiers preparing for the D-Day invasion. Villagers were told at the time they would be allowed to return within six months. However, despite public appeals, their hopes were never realised and to this day it remains completely empty. The village is located on Salisbury Plain and is owned by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). It is now surrounded by a high explosive 'impact area' in the Salisbury Plain military training zone. But a 700-year-old church, St Giles, still stands in the village as does a manor house called Imber Court as well as a farmhouse, a farm and cottages. The village also has four council house style blocks which were built in 1938. In 1943, there was also a Baptist Chapel which was demolished in the late 1970s. The government began buying land on Salisbury Plain in the late 19th Century to use it for maneuvers. And in the 1920s, it began to purchase farms around Imber as well as the village's land. By the time of the Second World War, the government owned almost all of the land in and around the village. On November 1, 1943, the people of the village were called to a meeting in the schoolroom and given just 47 days' notice to leave their homes. Despite some villagers being upset at having to leave, many showed no resistance, seeing it as their duty to contribute to the war effort. Following the war, the village was still used for training soldiers - especially those who were serving in Northern Ireland. In the 1970s a number of distinctive-looking houses were built to aid army training on the site. The isolated hamlet is five . miles from the nearest colony of common bees and is surrounded by a . wealth of untapped, nectar-rich wildflowers on the vast Plain. This will give the British black bees a chance to thrive and breed a pure strain of the species. If it is a success, the project could be repeated in other areas of the country. British black bees are much darker . than their golden-coloured cousins that originate from southern Europe . and have thicker and longer hair. They . are able to easily survive British winters unlike the non-native . varieties that are vulnerable to prolonged harsh and cold weather, such . as last winter. Imber, . near Warminster, Wiltshire, was one of several villages in Britain to be . taken over by the army in World War II so troops could practise for . D-Day. The 200 residents were compensated and rehoused. Out of the 56 buildings that made up the hamlet only 14 remain standing today. Beekeeper . Chris Wilkes, from Salisbury, has been given special permission by the . MoD to set up 14 colonies of black bees behind St Giles church. Mr . Wilkes, a 61-year-old retired army major, said: 'Imber is a very . isolated area with not a lot of feral bee colonies about, in fact there . isn’t one in a four or five mile radius. 'The . area is very rich in wild flowers. Eighteen of the 22 top nectar . producing plants in the UK are right here, including clover, sainfoin, . viper’s bugloss, knapweed and melilot. There is also no interference from the public. 'It is very difficult to breed pure lines of bees because it only takes a few feral ones to give you a mongrel breed. 'But Imber gives us a great chance to breed a pure strain of British black bees.' The native honeybees are extinct in all but a handful of remote areas of Britain thanks to the mystery virus known as the Isle of Wight Disease which devastated the native population in the early 20th century. Beekeepers were forced to bring in colonies from southern Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Wilkes said: 'Black bees make up about four per cent of the bee population of Britain. 'It is a shame because they are ideal for the British climate because they survive our winters very well. 'It is the native bee and the one that has been selected by nature to be the best type for this country. 'Southern European bees need a lot of feeding up in August and September to get them through the winter but they really struggle when you have harsher, prolonged winters. 'A lot of bees did die out last winter which means there is a reduction this year in honey production and fruits that depend on being pollinated by bees.' Memorial: A memorial stone in the old Baptist cemetery in Imber to remember the 200-strong community who were forced to move when the army needed to use the area for D-Day preparations during World War II . Growing crisis: Black bees now only make up four per cent of the bee population in Britain . Local produce: The British bee is better equipped to deal with winters in the UK than their southern European cousins which die in the cold weather causing a reduced honey production .","Hamlet of Imber on Salisbury Plain was commandeered by the army for troops to practise ahead of D-Day landings during World War II .

The controversial new high-speed rail line will cost every household £3,000 and ‘defies economic logic’, an independent report has warned. Senior Tories were braced for a revolt against HS2 after a study found its price tag had soared to £80billion, double the official estimate. The report, released today, increased the pressure on David Cameron to abandon the scheme. Several cabinet ministers, including Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, are known to have doubts, and some senior Labour figures have publicly turned their backs on the project. Last night former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan, who has been campaigning against HS2 since leaving the Cabinet last year, warned party leaders that opposition was growing among backbench MPs and Tory grassroots. Ministers hope the 250mph rail link will be running between London and Birmingham from 2026, with two further lines to Leeds and Manchester planned for 2032. But conservationists said the environmental impact will be far worse than initially feared, with a 40-mile wide construction corridor blighting 500,000 lives. A field in Cubbington, Warwickshire, where a plaque has been put up. The village predates the Domesday Book and will be blighted by lorries during construction and train noise afterwards . And a report published today by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) found the project’s costs have been vastly underestimated. It set the real price tag at £80billion, concluding it offers ‘incredibly poor value for money’. The planned route for HS2 cuts through Mrs Gillan’s constituency of Chesham and Amersham, Buckinghamshire. Last night she said the Government’s determination to continue with the scheme could lose the Conservatives thousands of votes – particularly if Labour decided to oppose the project. ‘I’ve always said this is a very unpopular policy in my constituency and among a large and increasing number of Conservatives,’ she said. Neighbours in Great Missenden gather to protest against the HS2 route through their village . ‘I don’t think this is quite an election loser across the country yet, but if I were in Cabinet I’d be asking a lot of questions, because the more we look at this, the more unfeasible it is.’ A minister close to Mr Cameron told the Daily Mail: ‘We’re right to press on with this but if the political pain starts to outweigh the economic gain I suspect we’ll find a way of delaying things.’ Last night a source close to Mr Paterson said: ‘As Environment Secretary, Owen has reassured concerned MPs who have approached him that the full rigour of environmental regulation will apply to this project as to any other.’ The IEA report comes a month after Britain’s business leaders called on the Government to review HS2 because of its spiralling cost. Ministers hope the 250mph rail link will be running between London and Birmingham from 2026, with two further lines to Leeds and Manchester planned for 2032 . The think-tank is now calling on ministers to cancel the scheme, suggesting taxpayers’ money is being used simply to ‘buy votes’. If the projected £80million was used for alternative road and rail schemes, it would benefit the economy by £300billion, it found. Dr Richard Wellings, the report’s author, said: ‘The real tragedy is that if they want to spend our money well, they could get a massive return from other projects, whereas with HS2 the scheme itself will be loss-making. It is slightly better than digging a hole on the ground and filling it in again, but compared to alternative schemes it is very poor value for money.’ The original budget for HS2 was £33billion. It rose by £10billion this summer, but the IEA said this would inevitably spiral further due to route changes and extra tunnelling needed to placate opposition, as well as new stations and transport infrastructure. The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) is also warning that life in towns and villages up to 25 miles each side of the route will be disrupted for years. And some areas will be blighted by noise of up to 95 decibels – the same as a Tube train. A spokesman for HS2 Ltd said: ‘The IEA’s approach has clearly been designed to suit its aims and those of its funders to dismiss any major government project, something it has consistently done.’","The report released today increased pressure on David Cameron to abandon the scheme .

The weather over the past year has created the ideal conditions for a tasty, bumper apple crop, experts have said. Last year's wet autumn, followed by the icy spring and a hot summer have been perfect for apple growing, and this year's crop is set to be sweeter and rosier than apples seen in recent harvest, the Royal Horticultural Society said. The cool, wet spring and summer last year meant apple orchards saw a bad harvest, which could have contributed to the good crop this year as trees often compensate for a poor season by growing extra fruit the following year. Apple orchard Cornwall England.. Image shot 2006. Exact date unknown. While the wet autumn in 2012 was bad for last year's harvest, it was good news for this year, because it ruled out the chance of drought which can lead to small, poor tasting fruits. This year's weather has also been very good for apple trees, with the prolonged cold snap early on helping them fruit, and the sunny summer enabling them to grow and develop a good flavour, RHS experts said. Jim Arbury, RHS fruit specialist at the society's Wisley garden in Surrey, said: 'Apples evolved in central Asia to suit a continental climate of hot summers and very cold winters and need to be exposed to a certain amount of cold weather each winter or they won't flower or fruit properly.' He said most apple varieties need a minimum of 1,000 hours below 7C, and those kind of chilly conditions remained well into April, giving the trees enough 'chill time' for the fruit to set properly. Jim Arbury, pictured, the Royal Horticultural Society's fruit specialist in Surrey, said apples need to be exposed to a certain amount of cold weather each winter or they won't flower or fruit properly . 'The long extended period of cold also stopped the trees from flowering at their usual time. By the time they did flower, there were more daylight hours and the weather was warmer that it would be if they had flowered as usual.' This meant a lower risk of damage by frost and more insects around to pollinate the blossom. And when summer finally arrived, the warm, sunny conditions boosted ripening of apples. Mr Arbury said: 'Like all fruits, apples need sunshine if they are going to grow and develop a good flavour. In the spring crops were lagging up to a month behind but a sudden burst of sunshine in prime ripening season late June and July, has helped the apples gain some ground as well as helping them ripen up beautifully. 'This year's crop should have an excellent flavour.' The variety of temperature this year, some of it on a daily basis with cooler nights causing heavy dew before giving way to hot days, has also affected the apples, giving them a 'nice rosy blush', he added. The RHS predicted the home-grown harvest would start flooding into shops in the next few weeks, giving lovers of British varieties a real treat. The horticultural organisation also said the four RHS gardens round the country would be celebrating all things apple with tastings, tips and cookery demonstrations at their taste of autumn festivals, taking place at Wisley on October 16-20 and the other gardens October 12-13.","This year's crop set to be sweeter and rosier than in recent harvest .

England cricketer Monty Panesar's recent drunken rampage which ended with him urinating on nightclub bouncers was sparked by a bitter divorce from his wife, it was claimed today. The spin bowler has kept his separation from his wife of three years Gursharan Rattan a secret. But friends of the star have claimed his recent troubles are a result of his heartbreak over the breakdown of his marriage to the pharmacist. England cricketer Monty Panesar, pictured left is said to have gone on a drunken rampage at a nightclub in Brighton because he was struggling to come to terms with his divorce from Gursharan Rattan, pictured right . A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Monty was devastated by the breakdown of his marriage and is still coming to terms with his recent divorce. His personal struggles have been a direct result of that. 'He did everything he could to make it work,” said the source. But ultimately he felt there were some insurmountable family issues and this became an increasingly difficult factor within the marriage. He is still sad that they couldn’t make it work.' Panesar's spokesman confirmed the divorce. The devout Sikh, who is meant to abstain from alcohol under the Sikh code of conduct, was forced to apologise after being fined £90 for his drunken antics at a nightclub in Brighton two weeks ago. The 31-year-old, who was dropped by England ahead of the Ashes series because of his poor performance, was thrown out of Shooshh on Brighton seafront after a group of young women complained that he was bothering them. He is believed to have then gone on to the promenade above the club and relieved himself over the doormen below.Witnesses said the bouncers gave chase . and cornered the cricketer in a pizza restaurant before putting him in . an arm lock and dragging him back to the venue in tears. The incident happened at Shooshh nightclub on Brighton beach when Panesar was kicked out of the club . Shamed: Monty Panesar is a firm favourite with cricket fans, but his off-field exploits have landed him in trouble . A source added: ‘The bouncers noticed water falling on them – then realised what was happening. ‘They chased Monty into a pizza shop and he was shouting, “Help! Help!”. ‘He struggled a bit and didn’t want to go. But once they had him locked in, he gave up and walked back with them.’ The cricketer, who lives in nearby Hove, was detained for 45 minutes before the police arrived and issued him with a £90 spot fine for being drunk and disorderly. He had been to a vodka bar before moving on to the club. Panesar’s spokesman said he did not dispute being fined for his drunken antics and added that he wanted to express his ‘unreserved apologies for any offence caused by his behaviour’. The sportsman married Gursharan in a traditional Sikh ceremony and the couple moved to Hove in East Sussex when he signed a three-year contract to play for Sussex. But problems in their marriage soon began to show and he was arrested by police after reports of an argument with his wife in a pub car park two years ago. He was interviewed before being released without charge.

Brenton Emmons, 47, has travelled more than 8,000 miles to Indonesia after his daughter, Cheznye, tragically died there in April. Mr Emmons, from Great Wakering, Essex, is determined to bring those responsible for her death to justice. Cheznye Emmons, 23, was travelling across Indonesia with her boyfriend, Joe Cook (right) when she died after drinking methanol which had been labelled as gin . Brenton Emmons (right) and Boo Beckett travelled to Indonesia earlier this summer in a bid to catch shopkeepers who are still selling methanol laced alcohol which killed Mr Emmons's daughter, Cheznye . A statement on Mr Emmons's Facebook page on July 12 read: 'Going back to shop that the gin was bought from to take more photos, can't say to  much at the moment, but my feelings are all over the place at this point in time.' 'I've had hardly no sleep for a couple of nights now. I can't stop thinking my little girl and just how far the shop is too the hospital it must of been f****ng horrific.' 'This is breaking my heart but I'm just hoping we can get some justice, just for peace of mind if not anything else. We are still waiting on police reports on raids done first day we got here.' The raids Mr Emmons refers to took place after he alerted authorities to a local shop in Bukit Lawang where he bought counterfeit whisky. Brenton Emmons has made the emotional journey back to Indonesia where daughter Cheznye died of alcohol poisoning in April . He also purchased two bottles of gin during his trip which were brought back to the UK for analysis. Tests revealed a staggeringly high amount of methanol in the drink - two 25ml shots could be enough to blind someone, and four could potentially kill. Brenton Emmons has returned to the popular tourist spot in south Sumatra with friend, Boo Beckett, in a bid to shut down shops selling illegal alcohol . Mr Emmons returned to the popular tourist spot in southern Sumatra with his friend, Boo Beckett, in July after launching a campaign in the UK against methanol poisoning. CHEZ - Save a Life Campaign aims to . raise awareness about methanol poisoning abroad and in the UK so that . others won't have to endure the same heartbreak the Emmons family. The campaign encourages travellers to 'stick to beer' when drinking abroad. A . statement from the campaign's Facebook page says its 'mission' is to . spread 'very simple' information 'into the NHS system, onto the streets . and into our heads'. It . continues: 'nobody deserves to be hurt or killed for something that . could so simply be stopped. Cheznye was stolen from us whilst travelling . in Indonesia on her dream trip. She drunk (sic) gin from a sealed . bottle that had been laced with methanol.' 'Our family wish to stop anyone else suffering a tragic loss like ours.' Beautician, Cheznye had been travelling across Indonesia with her . boyfriend, Joe Cook when the couple arrived in Bukit Lawang after visiting an orangutan sanctuary. The pair fell ill after drinking from a bottle labelled Mansion House Gin at a full moon party. CHEZ- Save A Life campaign aims to warn young people about the dangers of methanol poisoning at home and abroad . Cheznye was taken to hospital after suffering loss of sight and seizures. She was kept there for five days until her parents, Brenton and Pamela Emmons, were told there was no more doctors could do for her . Cheznye woke up the following day unable . to see and was taken on a five hour journey through the jungle to . hospital, where she was treated for blindness, kidney failure and . seizures. Mr Cook, 21,survived the methanol poisoning but was forced to make the call to Cheznye's parents after she showed no signs of recovery. She spent five days in hospital before doctors told Mr Emmons and Cheznye's mother, Pamela who had flown to the area, there was nothing else they could do. They were left no choice but to turn off the medical machine that was keeping their daughter alive. Dream trip: Cheznye and boyfriend, Joe Cook, had been travelling across Indonesia on what Mr Emmons described as her 'dream trip' before drinking the lethal alcohol . Beautician Cheznye and her boyfriend, Joe Cook, both drank from the bottle which they had purchased in a local store. Mr Cook survived the alcohol poisoning in April . Mr Emmons is determined to spread the word about the dangers of alcohol poisoning. He told The Sun newspaper: 'I just want to get the message out to other parents and travellers - they need to know how devastating and dangerous this is. 'I don't want another dad to feel the way I do.' High taxes on recognised brands of wine, beer and spirits in Indonesia have prompted shop owners to mix the drinks with a locally brewed substance called arak. Some, like in Cheznye's tragic case, are replacing drinks with methanol which is colourless to try and keep costs down. Methanol, which is also called methyl . alcohol, is used in numerous industrial applications, including the . production of formaldehyde, acetic acid and as a fuel component.","Brenton Emmons is determined to catch criminals who are still selling illegal alcohol in popular traveller spot .

The mother says the renowned TV star asked her to wear her private school uniform and sung a nursery rhyme while they had sex (file picture) A renowned British actor whose sex life is already protected by a High Court super-injunction has been questioned by police over separate claims that he seduced a girl of 15. It is alleged that the married star of TV and films asked the girl to put on her private school uniform before a meeting during which he plied her with alcohol. The victim, now 39, also makes the bizarre claim that the actor recited the nursery rhyme Ride A Cock Horse To Banbury Cross during sex. She said she had originally been reluctant to report the incident to police but changed her mind last autumn after the Jimmy Savile allegations made her ‘see things differently’. She said: ‘I’d always felt partly responsible for what happened, but [the Savile inquiry] made me realise that I wasn’t responsible – he was, he was the adult.’ The woman, a civil servant and mother of three who lives in the South West, was told by the Crown Prosecution Service that it was ‘entirely satisfied the sexual assault took place as you described’. But the actor – who denied the claim when questioned by police and who cannot be named – escaped prosecution for allegedly having sex with an underage girl because the law that applied at the time meant any charge had to be brought within a year of the incident taking place. In a wholly unrelated legal case in 2011, the hugely popular star took out an injunction to prevent publication of claims about his private life. In the latest allegations, the woman said she had met the actor at a theatre in August 1989, when she was 15. It was shortly before she started . boarding school and the actor, now a household name, said her school was . near his home and he would like to take her out. She called him in . October and he said it would be ‘nice’ if she wore her uniform. They met in the local town centre and she says he drove her to his home where he gave her wine before they had sex. ‘It happened fairly quickly and I was compliant and just let him get on with it,’ she said. ‘It was clear he knew what he was after. As we had sex he recited the nursery rhyme.’ Women went to police as she said the Jimmy Savile allegations had made her see the incident differently . The woman, who has since been divorced twice, added: ‘At the time I thought it seemed odd but now I just think it was horrible.’ He later dropped her back and said ‘see you soon’, she claimed. After the police handed their file to the CPS, the woman received a letter explaining that it would be unable to take action. Any charge would have been under the Sexual Offences Act 1956 and proceedings would have had to have started within a year of the incident. However, if there had been evidence that there was no consent, the actor could have faced a rape charge, prosecutors said. The woman, who first married at 18 and has attempted suicide twice, said the experience ‘set the tone’ for her expectations of men and of being used by them. She told the Sunday Mirror: ‘He knew what he was doing and doesn’t care about anybody else. ‘He comes from a lovely background with a good education and he clearly feels entitled to behave like that. But he does not have the right.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Woman alleges married TV star asked her to wear her school uniform .

Neville Hume inherited the utensils in 1979 from his late father Alfred who had been given them by his own father, and has been using them ever since. The former hairdresser from Sutton Coldfield, Warks, claims they are more reliable than tools in shops today. Mr Hume has been using his grandfather's tools since 1979 and claims they are more reliable than those in shops today . Despite being over 130 years old, the Victorian weeding hoe and digging fork are in surprisingly good condition. The handles of both tools are made from elm wood, with their steel ends remaining in almost pristine condition. The four prongs on the fork have been worn down slightly and are now only four inches long, about half their original length. But Mr Hume insists he wouldn't be caught in his garden without them. He said: 'My grandfather was a professional gardener for a wealthy landowner and his boss bought the tools for him. 'I guess they built things to last in those days. 'My father was given them and he worked as a chauffeur and gardener and so used them professionally as well. 'When he retired he even took them to his retirement home and used them right up until he died in 1979 . 'I have had them since then and use them all the time in my garden and allotment. They are perfect for tidying up a flower border. 'I always keep them clean and wipe them off after I use them. 'I've had lots of other forks over the years but the tines of those end up bending out of shape and they don't last.' Mr Hume who lives with his wife, Amanda, does not have any sons of his own to pass the tools on to. 'If and when it gets to the point where I can't manage the garden anymore I will probably donate them to a museum,' he said.","Neville Hume, 73, was given tools which first belonged to his grandfather who was a Victorian Gardener .

The sharp increase in house prices comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble . The average asking price of a home in England and Wales has jumped by around £20,000 since the beginning of the year, a report reveals today. A typical home advertised for sale in an estate agent’s window now has a price tag of £250,000, equal to nearly ten times the average full-time salary in this country. The sharp increase comes amid growing concern that Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble. At the beginning of January the report, from the property website Rightmove, reveals the average asking price was £228,989. Today it is £249,199, a jump of £20,210. In London, the affordability crisis facing anybody wanting to get onto the housing ladder, or move to a larger home, is even more acute. The average asking price in London hit £501,067 this month [aug], compared to £454,875 in the same month last year, according to Rightmove. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, called on ministers to ensure ‘an unsustainable boom in property prices’ is not created by their recent interventions. He said: ‘It is now critical that the supply of property improves so that the goal of a significant increase in transaction numbers is not over-shadowed by an unsustainable boom in property prices.’ Since April, a scheme called Help to Buy helps people with a small deposit of five per cent to buy a new-build property for up to £600,000. They are given a five-year interest-free loan for up 20 per cent of the property price. From January, another scheme, which confusingly is also called Help to Buy, will allow people with the same small deposit to buy a home, with the Government providing a guarantee to the mortgage lender of up to 15 per cent of the loan. This scheme will apply to old properties as well as new properties. Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove, has called on ministers to ensure 'an unsustainable boom in property prices' is not created by their recent interventions . The Institute of Directors slammed the . new Help to Buy scheme as ‘very dangerous’, while the consultancy . Capital Economics said it is ‘ropey economics’ but added it may be ‘more . successful politically.’ Rightmove . said it is ‘already seeing early signs of demand outstripping supply’, a . problem which Britain’s housing market has faced for many years to the . fury of housing campaigners. The housing charity Shelter says 250,000 new homes are needed every year, but only 106,820 were completed between May 2012 and June 2013, according to the Government’s figures. Kay Boycott, a director of Shelter, said: ‘Unless we see radical action from the government to tackle our chronic shortage of homes, house prices and rents will quickly rise even further out of reach for millions of people across the country struggling to find a stable home of their own.’ Overall, the Rightmove figures show the average asking price has risen by 5.5 per cent over the last year, although it fell by 1.8 per cent in August. The asking price of the average flat has reached an all-time record of £209,652, compared to £188,445 for a terraced property, £204,392 for a semi-detached home and £364,254 for a detached house.","Growing concern Government schemes to boost the housing market may be fuelling another house price bubble .

Labour officials are considering making a commitment to cut the voting age from 18 to 16 in their election manifesto, it was revealed today. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the change should be combined with improved citizenship education in schools to teach 16-year-olds about the democratic system. MPs believe the pledge by Labour would increase the likelihood of a coalition at the next election between them and the Liberal Democrats - who have long supported the lowering of the voting age. Idea: Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the change should be combined with improved citizenship education in schools to teach 16-year-olds about the democratic system . Mr Khan, who is also MP for Tooting in south London, told The Sunday Times: ‘The evidence we have is that if you vote the first time you are entitled to, you will carry on doing so through your life. ‘There are more and more things that 16 and 17-year-olds can do - work, pay national insurance and tax, have sexual relationships, get married and enter civil partnerships and join the armed forces.’ The reform would be introduced in time for the election in 2020 if Labour return to power in 2015. One of the major reasons behind it is that the party wants to capture the vote of young people. Lib Dem MP Stephen Williams fronted a successful backbench motion for the lowering of the voting age - and said Labour’s support could help the party decide who to support in a hung Parliament. Younger votes: MPs believe the pledge by Labour would increase the likelihood of a Coalition at the next election between them and the Liberal Democrats - who have long supported the lowering of the voting age . He told The Sunday Telegraph: ‘If we can bank that as an agreement then if the next Parliament does result in an inconclusive election, which I think is quite likely, the more issues that we know in advance that we're likely to agree on will make the negotiations swifter.’ 'The evidence we have is that if you vote the first time you are entitled to, you will carry on doing so through your life' Sadiq Khan, shadow justice secretary . Mr Williams added: ‘I have never been in favour of compulsory voting. I think voting should be attractive to people but it's up to politicians to give people good reasons why they should turn out to vote.’ The MP’s motion earlier this year was passed by 119 votes to 46 - but this was not binding, and Prime Minister David Cameron insisted he would not be supporting a change in the voting age. You are only able to vote aged 16 in a select few countries in the world. Those aged 16 have been able to vote for two decades in Brazil, while Argentina lowered the age of voting to 16 last year.","Sadiq Khan: Combine change with improved citizenship education .

A mammoth fund worth £20 a year for every adult and child in the UK should be set up to encourage cycling, the Liberal Democrats say. The latest idea from the junior Coalition party would cost the taxpayer more than £1.2billion a year at a time when public spending needs to be cut to help bring down the deficit. It would also give cycling as much public money as some entire departments in Whitehall. Healthy plans: The proposed budget would see £20-a-year spent on each UK citizen to encourage cycling . However, the party will discuss plans for a ‘cycling budget’ at its conference next month after they were proposed by Cambridge MP Julian Huppert. Critics will point out that the scheme is traditional Lib Dem posturing that will make very little difference to efforts to encourage more people into the saddle. George Eustice, Conservative MP for Camborne and Redruth, said: ‘Getting people cycling is important, but I don’t think this policy would work. 'It would mean an unfunded cost of over £1.2billion, which would simply lead to more borrowing and more debt.’ On yer bikes! The cycling budget had been proposed by Cambridge MP Julian Huppert . Tory backbenchers will see the plans as merely the latest in what has been called the Lib Dems’ ‘war on the motorist’. Other proposals to be discussed at the party’s conference include automatically blaming drivers for all accidents involving cyclists using a legal system of ‘proportionate liability’. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s party also wants to ban all petrol and diesel cars by 2040. Their ‘cycling budget’ motion would see the creation of a budget worth £10 per person, increasing later to £20 a head. The most recent official estimates put the UK population at 63.2million. So at £20 per person, Mr Huppert’s scheme would cost £1.26billion per year – the equivalent cost of 41,489 soldiers. Funding the cycling policy would mean slashing the total number of Army personnel in half. It is also the equivalent cost of taking 31,752 policemen off the streets, 48,672 nurses out of hospital wards, or removing 39,371 teachers from schools. The budget’s size is also comparable with some government departments. In 2014/15, the amount of taxpayers’ money allocated to the Foreign Office is expected to be about £1.35billion. The Lib Dem’s spending proposals do not stop there. Mr Huppert’s motion also calls for an increase in the ‘local sustainable transport fund’, better integration of the  cycle network and the creation of more cycle paths.","New plan would see £20-a-year spent on each UK citizen .

Boys do better than girls in exams such as science because they are better at taking risks, the man in charge of admissions at Oxford University said yesterday. Mike Nicholson claimed: ‘We have generally seen male students tend to be much more prepared to take risks, which is why they do well in exams. ‘Generally, female students are risk-averse and will tend to take longer to think about an answer. If it’s a multiple-choice question [boys] will generally go with their gut feeling. Girls will try to reason it out.’ Boys are better at exams than girls because they are 'more prepared' to take risks, according to the man in charge of admissions at Oxford University . He said that what while it depends on the . subject discipline, the university had seen male students tend to be . much more prepared to take risks, which is why they do well in exams. He said boys tended to 'whizz through' timed multiple choice exams whereas girls may not even finish them. Admitting he was talking in ‘broad brush strokes’, the director of undergraduate admissions at Oxford added: ‘If you are using timed multiple-choice assessments, that has a bearing on the likelihood of the female students even finishing the section.’ However, Professor Averil MacDonald, a board member of the Women in Science and Engineering campaign and chairman in science engagement at the University of Reading, said his statement was ‘factually incorrect’. She pointed out that while boys dominated subjects such as physics, girls actually achieve better results across the board. She added: ‘Girls are outperforming boys at all subjects. They are getting better results than boys even in subjects like physics, which are traditionally seen as a male preserve. ‘Boys may be following gut feeling, but that isn’t necessarily the way to get the right result.’ Professor MacDonald agreed that boys did tend to be favoured when more weight was given to exams than coursework. ‘If you phrase a question in the context of a story, boys tend to strip away what’s irrelevant more quickly. ‘But, if you ask any teacher, girls are more organised at completing coursework and getting it in on time.’ She added: ‘Industry is crying out for more female scientists and engineers because it’s important not just to have a male perspective, and more needs to be done to tackle the stereotypes in schools that mean teachers are pushing girls away from science subjects.’ Oxford University said there were 17,500 applications for 3,200 places at Oxford this year. Mr Nicholson said that so much effort was put into selecting students when theyfirst apply that they did not do much during the clearing process. Thursday’s A-level results revealed that this year the big winners in the battle of the sexes this year were boys. Eight per cent of boys achieved the top grade of A * compared to 7.4 per cent of girls. Last year they were separated by just 0.1 per cent. Boys also narrowed the gap in combined A* and As with a 0.2 per cent improvement to 26 per cent, while girls slipped half a per cent to 26.6 per cent. 0verall, girls still managed to outperform boys in all subjects except maths, chemistry, Spanish, French and German. Mike Nicholson, the director of undergraduate admissions, said that female students tend to be risk-averse whereas boys 'go with their gut feeling' Four in five physics exams were sat by boys, an increase of four per cent in a year. They also took 60.7 per cent of the maths papers, up 3.9 per cent. But girls accounted for 74.3 per cent of psychology entries, a rise of 5.2 per cent, and around seven in ten psychology A-levels. Experts suggested peer pressure might be deterring candidates from taking exams usually associated with the opposite sex. Michael Gove is trying to end grade inflation by making exams more robust. End-of-course exams replacing bite-size tests on modular courses is one of the measures being introduced under the Education Secretary’s watch. 'They only begin to think about it once they’ve got a string of As at that level. It gives them the confidence to think Oxford is within their reach. 'Our biggest concern is that the proposed reforms could undo an awful lot of work that has been going on in the higher education sector to encourage students.'","Mike Nicholson is director of undergraduate admissions at the university .

Russia will begin to operate the world's first floating nuclear power plant in just three years time. The specially-made ship with a nuclear power plant on-board will provide energy, heat and drinking water to relatively inaccessible areas of the vast country. The director of Russia's largest shipbuilders, the Baltic Plant, announced that the unique ship should be operational by 2016 at the 6th International Naval Show in St Petersburg. In three years, Russia will have the world's first floating nuclear power plant. The Akademik Lomonosov is to become the first of a series of floating nuclear power plants, which Russia plans to put into mass-production . The first ship will be called Akademik Lomonosov and is intended to be the first of small fleet of floating nuclear plants in Russia. It is designed to provide energy to big industrial companies, cut-off port cities and offshore oil and gas platforms. The ship's power-generating capabilities were based on nuclear reactors which are already on-board ice breaker ships in the chilly region that have operated successfully for over half a century. The Akademik Lomonosov will weigh 21,500 tons and have a crew of 69 people. But it will not have a propulsion system so will have to be towed to the location where it is needed, according to global news service, RT. It will have two modified KLT-40 reactors that will be able to provide enough energy for a city with 200,000 people. Together the reactors will generate 70MW of electricity or 300 MW of heat.

Russia's large towns and ports along its northern coastline and its far eastern regions are currently not experiencing much economic growth, partly because of a lack of energy, so it is hoped that these floating power stations will help the situation. The country could also use them near areas of mineral deposits and military bases outside the country. The floating power plants will be able to be modified and be used as a desalination plant. This means that the ship could produce a staggering 240,000 cubic metres of fresh water every day. A total of 15 countries have expressed an interest in using floating power stations, including: China, Indonesia and Argentina. The ship builder insists that the process of fuel enrichment on the floating power station complies with the International Atomic Energy Agency's regulations.

The firm claims that its floating power station is safe for the environment as it does not release any hazardous substances while it is operating. Building of the first ship got underway in 2007 at that Sevmash Submarine-Building Plant in Severodvinsk. It was moved to the Baltic Plant where it stayed for two years after the money ran out. But work on the vessel has got underway again after a financing deal was signed between the Baltic Plant and a company owned by the Russian State in December of last year.","Floating nuclear power station will provide energy, heat and drinking water to relatively inaccessible areas of Russia .

'He hogs it': Library director Marie Gandron wants to end 9-year-old Tyler Weaver's five year reign over her library's children's reading contest . A fifth grade boy just won his public library’s children’s reading club contest for the fifth year in a row but instead of congratulating him, his librarian wants him banned from the contest. Hudson Falls Public Library Director Marie Gandron says 9-year-old reading ace Tyler Weaver ‘hogs’ the annual competition and needs to step aside. The self-proclaimed ‘king of the reading club’ read 63 books for this summer’s Dig Into Reading event between June 24 and August 3 and his unparalleled prowess has the other children scrambling to keep the pace. ‘Other kids quit because they can’t keep up,’ Gandron told the Post-Star. Over . the last five years of contests, Tyler has devoured an impressive 373 . books at or above his reading level. He accepted his fifth title on . August 15. Tyler has . won the coveted prize every year since kindergarten. He’s proud of his . accomplishments and he’s not shy about saying it. ‘It feels great,’ Tyler said. ‘I think that was actually a record-breaking streak.’ Tyler’s mom Katie concurs. ‘I . don’t see the downside of Tyler winning five years in a row. I think . people should be proud of him, especially a library director,’ she said. Prizes he’s received over the years include an atlas, water bottle, and t-shirt. ‘They’re really not any grand things. I think he just likes to be the top reader,’ said Katie. Menace? 9-year old Tyler Weaver is about to start fifth grade and has won his library's reading contest since kindergarten. But his library's director thinks it is time for him to relinquish his crown . Feud: The picturesque Hudson Falls Library may be pretty on the outside, but strife in the children's section is making things ugly on the inside . But Gandron doesn’t seem to like it. Until Katie made the controversy public, Gandron wanted to change the rules so that winners are drawn from a hat instead of chosen by number of books read. And this isn’t the first time the library director and Katie have been embroiled in a reading contest dispute. Gandron told the Post-Star that Tyler’s mother has a bad ‘attitude’ toward the reading contest because several years ago a little girl claimed to have read 200 books. Though the mother backed up her daughter’s claims, it turned out they were both lying. ‘That’s when we stopped [going on the parents’ word] because she wasn’t [reading the books],’ Gandron said. Rigged? Katie Weaver, right, says her son deserves to keep competing. But Gandron says Tyler's mom has an 'attitude' about the contest because of cheating by other kids in previous years . Now the participants are quizzed on each book they claim to have read to ensure they’re telling the truth. The debate over Tyler’s reading award has caused internal strife at the library, as well. Library aide Lita Casey, who Tyler calls ‘Gram,’ has taken Tyler’s side over her boss’s and says Tyler won the contest fair and square. ‘My feeling is you work, you get it. That’s just the way it is in anything,’ said Casey, who’s worked at the library for 28 years. Dynasty: Though Katie has threatened to take her son's talents elsewhere, Tyler's brother Jonathan, right, may continue the family's reign--he's won second place for the last two years . It remained unclear how the feud would be resolved. But Katie maintains she’ll be taking her son’s reading skills elsewhere—to the Crandall Public Library in Glens Falls. Meanwhile, taking Tyler out of the running won’t necessarily end Gandron’s troubles. There may be a dynasty emerging in Tyler’s 7-year-old brother Jonathan, who has now won second place for two years in a row.","Tyler Weaver has won the Hudson Falls Public Library reading club contest five years in a row .

A street performer accused of 'annoying' shoppers by addressing them on the meaning on life with a megaphone is fighting a council fine for noise nuisance because 'it is his human right'. Danny Shine, 46, repeatedly used the loudhailer to warn members of the public in London's Oxford Circus shopping district about the perils of consumerism in November last year. But a council warden confiscated his megaphone and Mr Shine was issued with a court summons for breaking a Westminster City Council bylaw for 'the prevention and suppression of nuisances'. Mr Shine has decided to fight the case at Westminster Magistrates Court next month, claiming the law infringes on his human right to 'freedom of expression', and faces a fine of up to £500 if he is found guilty. Scroll down to watch video . 'Noise nuisance': Danny Shine, 46, has been accused of breaching a council bylaw by 'annoying' shoppers in London's Oxford Street by addressing them with a megaphone . As well as fighting his own case, Mr . Shine, from Hendon, North London, hopes to have the 12-year-old bylaw . declared unlawful by the court for conflicting with the Human Rights Act. Mr Shine has been expressing his views with his megaphone on the streets of London for the past four years and videos of his antics have been viewed more than two million times on YouTube. Mr Shine told The Independent: 'This law is completely arbitrary. It allows a member of the public or a civilian officer to prosecute you because you've annoyed him. 'While corporations are allowed to drown us in their messages, I’m not allowed to do what I think of as interactive street theatre. I end up with a summons and a choice of accepting a fine or fighting a case and ending with a legal bill of £10,000. This is shutting down freedom of expression.' But the council says it is not prosecuting Mr Shine over the content of his speeches - just for the level of volume he delivers them at, which was causing a noise nuisance for shoppers and local businesses.

A Westminster City Council spokesman told MailOnline: 'This case isn’t about what you say in public – it’s about the volume at which you say it.

'It’s our job as a local authority to protect the interests of the public and visitors to Westminster from undue noise and irritation.' A council official added that Mr Shine was initially given the opportunity to sign a written undertaking that he would stop using the loudhailer to resolve the matter. When Mr Shine refused, he was asked to accept a caution. When he also refused to take a caution, court action was taken as a last resort, the official said. The 'Good Rule and Government' bylaw was drawn up in 2001 to stop people from making 'any noise which is so loud or so continuous or repeated as to give reasonable cause for annoyance to other persons'. The council said it has only used the law twice under extreme circumstances in the last year. The case is due at Westminster Magistrates in September. Last resort: A Westminster City Council official said court action against Mr Shine was a last resort after he refused several requests to stop using a megaphone.

Two New Yorkers either don’t care about or don’t understand the city’s byzantine parking regulations. Despite owing almost $350,000 for over 2,200 parking tickets between them, the two individuals aren’t even at the top of the list of worst scofflaws in New York. That honor goes to a New Jersey-based company that owes more than $316,000 for over 1,700 tickets, according to the city. The 10 worst offenders were made public Monday by the New York Post. Parking tickets: Some people pay them, others owe six-figures worth of fines . Wallinton, NJ-based Consolidated Dairies owes a staggering $316,059 – including over $37,000 in interest – for 1,759 tickets racked up by drivers since 2005, according to the Post. A message left for comment by MailOnline with the dairy products distributor was not returned. The top 10 list, first reported by the Post, is made up almost entirely of companies - except for two people. Manhattan resident John Caruso is indebted $176,821 for the 872 tickets he’s racked up in the past 8 years, including over $54,000 in interest, according to the Post, which speculated the reason he can’t be tracked down is because he’s never lived at the address listed for him in city records. The Greenwich Street address the city has for him used to have mailboxes for non-residents, according to a doorman questioned by the Post. Coming in just after Caruso is Brooklyn’s Anthony Grady, who owes $172,250 towards 1,404 tickets dating back to 2005. When the Post attempted to reach Grady, there was an eviction sign on the scofflaw’s door. Source: NYC Department of Finance . Former neighbors defended him, telling the Post that the parking signs in the area are confusing because of a nearby school. ‘The school has different schedules of when you can or can’t park on the road. The signs [are] a little bit hidden,’ Kelsea Baker told the paper. City Finance Commissioner David Frankel expressed his frustration to the paper, saying that it’s ‘outrageous that a few New Yorkers cheat their fellow citizens.’ Frankel may be an outlier though, especially after the city’s rage-inducing parking signs were completely redesigned earlier this year. Referring to the old parking signs as ‘a five-foot-high totem pole of confusing information,’ city Department of Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan said the new signs would be ‘ easier to read and take the stress out of figuring out where and when you can legally park’ at their January unveiling. Redesigned parking signs: The city unveiled new parking signs earlier this year in an effort to decrease the frustration felt by many city drivers . ‘You shouldn't need a Ph.D in parking signage to understand where you are allowed to leave your car in New York,"" City Council Member Daniel Garodnick added. Parking signs have long confused city drivers, and were even lampooned by comedian Louis C.K. The city is still in the process of rolling out the new signs, but they – along with parking holidays in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy – may have contributed to the city issuing fewer tickets in fiscal year 2013 than in previous years. Meter maids wrote just under 7.4million tickets totalling $466million between July 2012 and June 2013, according to the Post, a surprising drop from the 9million tickets and $512million in fines the previous year. Deadbeat offenders owe about $570million in unpaid tickets, according to the Post.

Cancer Research UK's new website highlights the discrepancy in healthcare between those living in the North and the South. London and the South came out on top while the Liverpool was found to perform the worst . Salubrious London boroughs including Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster are the least likely to contract or die from cancer in the country, whereas cities in the North such as Liverpool and Manchester show the highest prevalence – and death rate – of the disease, according to a report by The Independent. Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis and patient engagement at Cancer Research told the newspaper: ‘There has been plenty in the news over the years about north-south divide and a lot of factors will play into that. Incidence of cancer is very often a reflection of lifestyle in an area - levels of deprivation and high smoking rates, for example . 'Incidences are very often a reflection of lives that have been led: deprivation, high smoking rates, high alcohol rates, low exercise – all the things that we know contribute to increased cancer risk. ‘If you get well-established communities that are either incredibly well-off or deprived, the chances are you are going to get higher cancer incidences in the more deprived areas, and [the] converse.’ According to the latest data, 295.9 people out of 100,000 develop cancer in Kensington and Chelsea. That figure is well down on the national average of 398.1 per 100,000, but even further below the highest incidence rate of 498.4 out of 100,000 at the Liverpool Primary Care Trust. Cancer mortality rates show a similar trend. The lowest rate of 123.9 deaths per 100,000 was recorded by the Kensington and Chelsea PCT, with Liverpool PCT registering the highest number of deaths in the country at 239.9.

More than 1.7 million GlucoMen LX Sensor blood glucose test strips are being recalled for fear they may give false readings . More than 1.7 million blood glucose testing strips are being recalled for fear they may give false readings. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said people with diabetes should not use the strips because of fears they could give inaccurate results, leading to a patient injecting too much insulin. The strips have been subject to a manufacturing fault. They are GlucoMen LX Sensor blood glucose test strips for use with the GlucoMen LX and GlucoMen LX PLUS blood glucose meter. The strips are manufactured by Menarini in Italy and distributed in the UK. There are no reports at present of patients being harmed by using the strips, the MHRA said. Just over 1.7 million test strips in the affected lots were sold to pharmacies in the UK between October and November 2012. The affected lots are 3212219249 (expiry date 31/08/2014) and 3212214249 (expiry date 31/08/2014). The MHRA is investigating why the manufacturer did not alert it to a potential problem with the strips until last month. The strips were not distributed in the UK after November last year but officials are worried they may still be on shop shelves, or that people may still have them in their homes. The manufacturing fault has now been resolved.

People with type 1 or type 2 often test their glucose several times a day using test strips and a hand-held monitor. The reading tells them whether they need to inject insulin to bring down high blood sugar, or eat more to increase their blood sugar levels.","The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said people with diabetes shouldn't use the strips because they could give inaccurate results .

A historical mystery has been uncovered at Sheffield Cathedral after 15 aristocratic bodies disappeared from the crypt. In the Tudor era, the Earl of Shrewsbury built a special chapel to house the bodies of his descendants - but 500 years later, nearly all of them have gone missing. The body-snatching whodunnit was only revealed last week, when archaeologists opened up the sealed crypt and found 15 fewer bodies than they had expected. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This is the entrance to the crypt of the Shrewsbury Chapel, where 15 bodies have disappeared . Setting: The remarkable find was made by archaeologists during renovations of Sheffield Cathedral . George Talbot, fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, constructed the Shrewsbury Chapel in 1520, when the cathedral was just a parish church. He intended the chapel to house him and his descendants after their deaths, and when he died he was buried there. The monument to the fourth Earl - along with that to his grandson, the sixth Earl, who guarded Mary Queen of Scots - became one of the church's most famous features. More than a dozen of their descendants were also buried in the chapel, as the Talbots were considered Sheffield's leading family thanks to their status as Lords of the Manor. Investigation: Canon Rev. Simon Cowling peers into the entrance buried in the chapel's floor . Discovery: Workers had to dig deep through the centuries-old floor of the chapel to find the crypt . However, by 1809 all but two of the coffins supposed to be in the chapel had vanished, according to antiquarian Joseph Hunter, the last man to visit the crypt before it was sealed in the early 19th century. Although Hunter dutifully recorded the loss of the 15 bodies, his discovery seems to have slipped out of the historical record until this year. A renovation project began in the cathedral earlier this year, and last week workmen were digging up the floor of the chapel when they came across the entrance to the Shrewsbury tomb. However, when they entered they realised that of the 17 nobles supposed to be buried there, only two remained - the seventh Earl, Gilbert, who died in 1616, and 18th-century aristocrat Henry Howard. Powerful: George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, is supposed to be in the crypt of the Shrewsbury Chapel . Iconic: The monument to the sixth Earl, pictured, is one of the most impressive sights in the cathedral . The most obvious solution to the . puzzle might seem to be grave-snatching, but the fact that the heavy . lead coffins are missing as well as the corpses themselves would seem to . suggest that this was not the case. Archaeologists . are now exploring the possibility that the crypt harbours a secret wall . concealing the true location of the bodies. Alternatively, the coffins may have been removed from the chapel and taken to a different location. Cathedral . officials are now collaborating with historians from the University of . Sheffield in an effort to crack the mystery and hunt down the bodies. Peter . Bradley, the Dean of Sheffield, said: 'We will be working closely with . our partners at Sheffield University to solve this mystery, as one of . the missing bodies belongs to one of the most important men in . Elizabethan England - George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury.' Patriarch: George, the fourth Earl, who built the chapel, is commemorated alongside his two wives . Gone: The fourth Earl and 14 of his descendants appear to have vanished from their resting place . George Talbot, fourth Earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1538) Mary, Lady Talbot - wife of the fifth Earl (d. 1538) William Talbot, Marshal of Ireland - son of the fourth Earl (d. unknown) Francis Talbot, fifth Earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1560) Thomas Talbot - infant son of the sixth Earl (d. 1565) Gertrude, Countess of Shrewsbury (d. 1566) Mary, Countess of Northumberland (d. 1572) George Pierrepoint (d. 1573) George Talbot - infant son of the seventh Earl (d. 1577) Elizabeth, Countess of Lenox (d. 1581) Francis, Lord Talbot (d. 1582) George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury (d. 1590) Charles Cavendish (d. 1594) Henry Talbot - brother of the seventh Earl (d. 1595) Mary, Countess of Shrewsbury (d. 1632) The Talbot family, who were ennobled in the 15th century as the Earls of Shrewsbury, owned most of Sheffield and rose to become one of England's most influential families under the Tudor dynasty. The fourth Earl built the Shrewsbury Chapel before his death in 1538, and in his will ordered a monument to be made featuring him flanked by his two wives, Anne and Elizabeth. He married Anne when he was just 13, and the couple had 11 children before she died and he re-married. The Earl was made Lieutenant General of the North, and once entertained Cardinal Wolsey as the notorious priest travelled south to face trial for treason. In 1536, he put down the 'Pilgrimage of Grace', a popular rebellion against Henry VIII's religious policy. However, it is his grandson, the sixth Earl, who has the largest monument in Sheffield Cathedral, standing against the chapel's south wall. He was best known for marrying Bess of Hardwick, then the richest woman in England apart from Elizabeth I, and for guarding Mary Queen of Scots during her 14 years of imprisonment in Sheffield. Looking after Mary, the mother of James I, nearly ruined him financially - and he is said to have suffered emotional turmoil too, having fallen in love with her yet being forced to watch her execution. Works: The chapel has been turned into a building site during the renovations and investigation . Atmospheric: The cathedral has providing the setting for a 500-year-old historical detective story . Archaeology: The cathedral and chapel are set to be restored to their former glory . The monument to the sixth Earl shows him lying on a rush mat wearing elaborate armour, his feet resting on a trusty dog. At his funeral, so many townspeople turned out to catch a glimpse of his coffin that two trees were said to have collapsed under the weight of the men who had climbed them to get a better look. The Shrewsbury Chapel passed out of the hands of the Talbot family when one of their heiresses married Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, whose descendants became the Dukes of Norfolk. The church where the chapel was located became Sheffield Cathedral in 1914, and in 1933 the 16th Duke of Norfolk donated the chapel to the cathedral to be enjoyed by the public. Fame: George, sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, who served as custodian to Mary Queen of Scots . 1406: Sheffield was passed to John Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, from Sir Thomas Nevil. 1453: The first Earl died in battle at Chatillon in France. He was immortalised in Shakespeare's Henry VI Part 1 as 'valiant Talbot, above human thought'. 1460: The second Earl, John, died during the Wars of the Roses, and the Lordship passed to the third John Talbot. 1510: The fourth Earl, George, ordered the construction of Sheffield Manor just one mile from Sheffield Castle. 1520: The fourth Earl added a chapel to the parish church, now Sheffield Cathedral, to hold the family tombs. 1530: Cardinal Wolsey visited Sheffield Manor as a guest on his way to London to stand trial for high treason before Henry VIII. 1538: The funeral of the fourth Earl took place in Sheffield amid much pomp and ceremony . 1553: The sixth Earl, George, right, took over the lordship of the manor. 1570-84: The sixth Earl was responsible for safe custody of Mary Queen of Scots and kept her at Sheffield Manor, Sheffield Castle and Worksop Manor as well as at his Midlands estates. 1590: More than 20,000 people attended the elaborate funeral of the sixth Earl at Sheffield Cathedral. Gilbert became the seventh Earl and inherited the lordship of Sheffield Manor. 1616: The seventh Earl died. He had no sons so his property, including the Sheffield estates, were inherited by his daughter Alethea Talbot. She was married to Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, so the Sheffield estates were absorbed into the House of Howard.","Earl of Shrewsbury established family chapel at Sheffield Cathedral in 1520 .

Scientists hope a new test could detect Alzheimer's disease at least a decade before symptoms appear - paving the way for early treatment . Scientists hope a new test could detect Alzheimer’s disease at least a decade before symptoms appear - paving the way for early treatment. The discovery of a fall in levels of a certain type of genetic material could signal an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The biological marker is found in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) at least 10 years before signs of dementia become apparent. There are 800,000 people with dementia in the UK, and one in three people over 65 will die from the degenerative disease. Currently, the only way to accurately diagnose the disease is by post-mortem neuropathological analysis, although memory and other brain function tests are used to determine whether drugs and other treatment may help. Spanish researchers at the CSIC Institute of Biomedical Research of Barcelona believe they may have found a marker that could suggest the disease process is underway before symptoms start to show. They found a drop in the content of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) - genetic material present in the energy centre of cells - in spinal fluid may be a signal for the disease. They suggest that decreased mtDNA levels reflect the diminishing ability of mitochondria to power brain cells, thus triggering their death. The drop in the concentration of mtDNA precedes the appearance of other recognised biochemical Alzheimer’s biomarkers, suggesting the process of Alzheimer’s disease starts earlier than previously thought and that mtDNA depletion may be one of the earliest predictors. Researchers have previously been unable to detect the genetic material in spinal fluid, but they used a new technique to amplify tiny amounts, says a study in the journal Annals of Neurology. The researchers hope other labs and hospitals will be able to replicate the results. They say by finding a way to block the degeneration, clinicians may be able to diagnose and treat the disease before symptoms even appear. Lead author Dr Ramon Trullas said: ‘If our initial findings can be replicated by other laboratories, the results will change the way we currently think about the causes of Alzheimer’s. The discovery of a fall in levels of a certain type of genetic material could signal an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's. Image shows a CT scan of the brain of someone with Alzheimer's . ‘This discovery may enable us to search for more effective treatments that can be administered during the pre-clinical stage.’ Dr Marie Janson of Alzheimer’s Research UK, the UK’s leading dementia research charity, said: ‘Problems with mitochondria have already been linked to Alzheimer’s, which is why Alzheimer’s Research UK is currently funding research to further examine this link. ‘This small study suggests that decreased mitochondrial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid may indicate the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s, but more work is needed to confirm this in larger groups of people. ‘It would be useful to see further studies investigate changes in mitochondrial DNA over time, to determine how long before symptoms such changes might be detected. ‘We know Alzheimer’s begins to develop before symptoms appear, and the ability to detect the disease at this stage is crucial for recruiting the right people for clinical trials of potential new treatments.’","A drop in the content of mitochondrial .

Cancer is always a devastating disease that forever changes the lives of every single person it affects, whether it hits them directly or indirectly, and whether the sickness responds well to treatment or not. But Rick Keyworth, diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma aged just 21 over Christmas 2008, was one of the lucky ones. For Rick, an overweight, out-of-shape, beer-drinking 'rugby lad' from Stockport, the malignant 15cm tumour growing in his neck - along with the the ensuing seven months of brutal chemotherapy and radiotherapy - was the wake-up call he needed to radically shake-up his life. Rick during his chemotherapy treatment, left, and now, right, as a muscly personal trainer . Rick, left, with a friend on a 'lads' night out' before 2008, when he was diagnosed with cancer and was forced to radically rethink his life . Following his treatment, when he was given the all-clear, doctors at the Christie cancer hospital in Manchester warned him that treatment had ravaged his body and left it severely weakened. He was now more susceptible to life-threatening diseases such as heart attacks, strokes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Rick wanted to ensure he had the best possible chance of a long and healthy future with his girlfriend - now wife - Danielle. He knew it was up to him to make changes himself. Newly inspired, Rick immediately began reading exhaustively around nutrition, health and fitness. He stopped eating heavily processed foods, high-fat foods, high-sugar foods and junk. He hit the gym and the rugby field. Streamlining his diet and dialling up his activity levels, Rick saw results almost immediately. Rick says cancer was the wake-up call he needed to sort his life out, focus on his health and get into shape . Rick said: 'I was always an active lad - always playing rugby and cricket, even during my treatment - but my diet wasn't good. I was your typical rugby boy: I loved curries and beers. At 5ft 9in and 15st 5lb I had a big old belly on me' Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'I was . always an active lad - always playing rugby and cricket, even during my . treatment - but my diet wasn't good. I was your typical rugby boy: I . loved curries and beers. At 5ft 9in and 15st 5lb I had a big old belly . on me. 'Doctors were blunt . with me, which I appreciated, and said the cancer treatment had given me . a bit of a kicking. 'I was suddenly at risk of other diseases so I knew I . had to get my act together. I wanted to give myself the best possible . chance of living.' 'I . was doing doing three or four intense resistance sessions a week and . three rugby sessions. I went completely back to basics with my diet and . cut out all sugars and fats, eating just lean meats and oily fish, . vegetables, fruit and carbohydrate. And magic happened. 'I . suppose in that way the cancer was an eye-opener. It forced me to sort . my life out and was, I suppose, a bit of a blessing in disguise. Though . it isn't the way I would have chosen to do it, given the choice!' Speaking about his healthy diet, Rick said: 'I went completely back to basics with my diet and . cut out all sugars and fats, eating just lean meats and oily fish, . vegetables, fruit and carbohydrate. And magic happened' 'One of my biggest motives to change my life was that I wanted to give myself the best possible chance of surviving. It was horrible to see my family and my girlfriend, who is now my wife, worrying about me' Rick said: 'I have a very strict, structured . regime. I prepare most my meals in advance so I never get . stuck reading the nutritional content of sandwich packets and unable to . eat anything!' Rick watched the weight fall off and his physical fitness peak. But he didn't want to stop there. 'I started to read more and learn more and instantly see results in myself. 'But I didn't want to just read and know about it, I wanted to take it to the next level and teach other people about it, so I qualified as a personal trainer in 2010, which seemed the natural progression.' Combining his own workouts with personal training, Rick works out around eight times a week. Such a big life transition has not been easy, but Rick maintains it with military precision, counting calories and writing down every single thing he has to eat, as well as how much exercise he does. Doctors at the Christie cancer hospital . in Manchester told Rick, pictured before the cancer,  that treatment had left his body severely . weakened and more susceptible to life-threatening diseases such as heart . attacks . 'I have a very strict, structured regime,' he said. 'I prepare most my meals in advance so I never get stuck reading the nutritional content of sandwich packets and unable to eat anything. And I use Muscle Food, a trusted brand who have a range of products I know will offer exactly what I need. Breakfast: . Four-egg omelette made with semi skimmed milk . 1 packet oat so simple honey porridge with milk . 30g flaked almonds . 11am: . 130g chicken breasts, 350g boiled potatoes boiled, tikka seasoning . Romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, cherry tomatoes, peppers and beetroot salad . 3pm: . Same meal as at 11am . - same as 2 . PERSONAL WORKOUT . 7pm . Rump steak or homemade turkey burger . 200g rice or wholemeal muffin . Salad as above with olive oil or boiled frozen vegetables . Before bed: . Mackerel or salmon fillet or eggs . Pineapple . Throughout day: . Bananas and apples as needed . 'Getting in shape and being healthy is all about diet and nutrition, and it's not about doing it for a short time, it's about doing it month-in, month-out. 'Consistency and being . self-disciplined are the key to results.' Rick - whose weight dropped to 12st 4lb and whose body turned from fat to muscle - eats about six regimented meals a day, supplemented with fruit. And not only does he write down everything he puts in his body, he also logs it onto MyFitnessPal, a mobile app to which his clients have access - so they can see if he slips up. 'Of course I treat myself every now and then. I'm human! I had a tub of peanut butter and chocolate ice cream at the . weekend. Everybody has cravings. 'But it might be two or three weeks until I have . something bad again. And it wouldn't happen every day. It's only when tubs of peanut butter ice cream become the norm that you have to worry.' Rick has now, thankfully, been given the all-clear from cancer, but he still has an MOT once a year to make sure everything stays as it should. 'One of my biggest motives to change my life was that I wanted to give myself the best possible chance of surviving. It was horrible to see my family and my girlfriend, who is now my wife, worrying about me. I feel like I had the easy role and they had the difficult one.' 'My dad died in between my chemo and radiotherapy treatments, and knowing how much my mum must have gone through. If there is anything I can now do to stop that happening again, I will.' These days Rick is a picture of optimum health, and in a roundabout way credits cancer with giving him the impetus to change. He said: 'I'm a lot happier now . that before I had it. I guess it kind of sorted me out.'

German doctor Dr Daniel Ubani (pictured) unlawfully killed a 70-year-old man on his first GP locum in the UK . Patients are being put at risk because no fewer than 40 per cent of doctors taken on by the NHS every year are foreign, a top cancer surgeon has warned. Dr J Meirion Thomas said far too many of them had poor language skills, knew nothing about our culture and had not received up-to-date training in their own country. Out of around 13,000 new doctors registered by the General Medical Council every year, just 7,000 come from British medical schools. Meanwhile the NHS is becoming a ‘bonanza’ for doctors arriving in increasing numbers from Greece, Spain and eastern Europe. Dr Thomas, a consultant surgeon at The Royal Marsden Hospital in London, also hit out at the poor quality of family doctors, saying the only reason A&E departments were at ‘breaking point’ was because many GPs were ‘not good enough’. Dr Thomas has already exposed failings in the NHS in a series of trenchant articles for the Daily Mail. Earlier this year he raised the alarm over the number of foreign patients being treated for free by the NHS, saying it was costing taxpayers millions of pounds a year. In an article for The Spectator magazine this week, he called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to scrap expensive NHS IT schemes and spend the billions saved on ‘training more British doctors’. ‘This is an essential building block of a durable recovery,’ he said. He went on: ‘Most readers will be surprised to learn that every year, we import 40 per cent of our doctors because of insufficient training places in British medical schools. ‘We encourage young people to become doctors, then we slap them back for want of places. ‘So 40 per cent of doctors starting work in the NHS every year have little or no knowledge and experience of British culture or of our Health Service – and this in the most people-centric occupation of all. It really does matter.’ Dr Thomas blamed the Government for not wanting to pay for more expensive places – a failing which was opening the door to doctors from Europe and beyond. ‘From the foreign doc’s perspective, working for the NHS is a bonanza,’ he said. ‘European doctors fly in to cover locum vacancies, especially in general practice. There is no test of language proficiency before registering. ‘As a result of austerity in southern Europe, there has been a significant increase in GMC registrations of newly-qualified doctors from Greece, Spain, Italy, Portugal and especially eastern Europe.’ Dr Thomas also hit out at the poor quality of family doctors, saying the only reason A&E departments were at 'breaking point' was because many GPs were 'not good enough' (file picture) He said the reliance on overseas doctors meant there were real risks to patient safety. ‘Importing doctors from abroad might not be a bad thing if there were any guarantee the entry criteria to foreign medical schools were as rigorous as our own,’ he said. ‘A GMC survey published in the British Medical Journal recently showed foreign-trained doctors were up to four times more likely to be suspended or struck off than their UK colleagues. Defenders of the system say there are filters in place to weed out dodgy doctors. ‘But where was the filter that checked the competence of Dr Daniel Ubani, a Nigerian-born German citizen who on his first GP locum in the UK unlawfully killed a 70-year-old man?’ Dr Thomas also used his article to hit out at GPs, saying they were so old-fashioned that patients had no option but to turn up at hard-pressed A&E departments. ‘Modern medicine has been revolutionised by technology, little of which has filtered down into general practice,’ he said. ‘GPs cannot carry out certain essential tests quickly. It is very easy for GPs to become “de-skilled” and by mid-career some may not be well enough informed to manage serious acute illnesses. ‘No wonder, then, that patients with acute problems prefer to go to A&E; it’s because GP services aren’t good enough: which is why A&E units are at breaking point.’","Just over half of new doctors each year come from British medical schools .

The larger-than-life work depicts the man who discovered Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst standing upright with a blood-red face,  devil’s horns and an outstretched, moveable arm and grasping fingers which are clearly in Nigella strangulation mode. The 6ft 7in mannequin is entitled ‘Playful Tiff’, a reference to how Saatchi described the infamous incident at Scott’s Restaurant, Mayfair, which ended with his accepting a police caution for assault and a quickie divorce. Controversial: 'Playful tiff' is a sculpture by an anonymous artist in London's Jealous Gallery which shows Charles Saatchi as the devil and allows members of the public to be strangled by him .

Sheherazade has gone into business with her pal, model Laura Bailey, designing gold jewellery . While millionaire MP Zac Goldsmith and his second wife Alice are cooing over Dolly, their new baby — his third child and her first — his   ex-wife Sheherazade has been busy with a production of her own. Little has been heard of stunning Sheherazade, 39, since she divorced Zac three years ago thanks to  his adultery with  lissom Rothschild heiress Alice. Now, I discover, she  has gone into business with her pal, model Laura Bailey, designing gold jewellery. Clients of their new Loquet London online company can purchase  heart-shaped lockets made of crystal and 18-carat gold which, the pair explain, are ‘designed to be worn close to the heart like a talisman’. The idea is that you then fill them with tiny meaningful charms. Sheherazade — the daughter of Colombian-born socialite Viviane Ventura and her ex-love, feared Seventies asset-stripper John Bentley — says she got the idea from her ten-year-old son, James, after he came home from a funfair with a  plastic heart on a necklace. Her efforts, of course,   are somewhat more  elaborate — she  sells the baubles for between £400 and £550 each, plus you need a chain to hang them on, which can cost up to £2,000.  Sounds like an ideal christening present for Zac’s little girl. ........................................................................................

A band of forgotten women were hugely influential in the rise of Christianity but their contribution has been neglected by the mainstream churches, a leading expert has claimed. Professor Kate Cooper of the University of Manchester has identified dozens of forgotten Christian women who were influential in the first and second centuries, during a period when Christianity was - in some respects - more progressive towards women than today. She believes that women played a central role in spreading the new Christian faith through informal friendship and family networks. Saint Thecla of Iconium, is believed by second century Christians to have been one of St Paul's disciples. Legend has it that Thekla rebelled against her family to refuse marriage - an unthinkable act at the time . Their authority within Christian communities was earned through their role as parents, community organisers, and small business owners. One, Lydia the Purple-seller of Philippi, remembered in the Bible’s Book of Acts, was the first person to sponsor St Paul. Another woman, Perpetua, who lived in Carthage at the end of the second century, was famous at the time for refusing to denounce her faith, choosing martyrdom against her father’s wishes. Her diary, written while she awaited execution in prison, was a radical document which would be seen in today’s world as extreme and very unlike the official Christian views of what the Christian woman should be, said Professor Cooper. One of the most important, she said, is Thecla of Iconium, believed by second century Christians to have been one of St Paul’s disciples. Though there is no strong evidence that Thecla existed, her story was hugely influential in the first few hundred years of Christianity . Referring to the ‘Acts of Paul and Thecla’, an anonymous second century text, Professor Cooper shows how Thekla rebelled against her family to refuse marriage - an unthinkable act at the time. 'Though there is no certain evidence that Thecla existed, her story was hugely influential in the first few hundred years of early Christianity,' said Professor Cooper, who has written a new book entitled Band of Angels: The Forgotten World of Early Christian Women. The influence of her story was far-reaching, in that it became the root of the Catholic theology of chastity and virginity. 'Every major Christian male writer in the fourth century had a sister, and these young women were encouraged to follow Thecla’s example. 'Rather than criticising her for disobeying her mother, the early Church celebrated her courage. 'Christianity was quite revolutionary in the way it treated its women, especially when you realise how sexist the ancient world was. 'So it’s sad that Thecla and her contemporaries are not properly remembered and honoured today. They should be an inspiration: for example to the people campaigning for women bishops and priests.' Women, says Professor Cooper, regularly preached the gospel in the first two centuries of Christianity, and in some communities women carried out baptisms. It wasn’t until the Roman Emperor Constantine’s conversion to Christianity, in around 313 AD, the religion became institutionalised: male bishops were now government officials and women came to be seen as players in the background rather than public figures. Professor Cooper added: 'These women – saints who had a radical and powerful presence in the early church – have been hidden in plain sight. 'Many Gospel stories, for example – such as the story of Mary and Martha in the Gospel of Luke – can tell us far more about women’s role if we stop to pay close attention – something male writers have not done. 'The ancient sources mention the women, but over time less and less attention was given to their role. Really, they have been airbrushed out of history. 'It is quite sad that a religion which began with a mother and her wonderful baby should still have so much difficulty with remembering to honour the contribution of its women.'","Professor Kate Cooper of the University of Manchester has identified dozens of women who were influential in the first and second centuries .

Most have already lived together and have all the household items they need - so what they really want is cold, hard cash. Tradition dictates it's somewhat rude to demand money from your friends and family - but one couple have come up with a novel way to do it without causing offence. Gemma Daborn and her husband, Marcus, from North London, created a 'reverse wedding list' when they married in 2010. Wedding list dilemma: Gemma and Marcus tied the knot in 2010, but having lived together first, already had everything they needed . Give and receive: The couple invited their guests to buy items off them which they no longer needed . Novel idea: The pair created a wedding list where they could sell lots in return for money for their honeymoon . They put on it all the items they owned which they no longer needed and invited their guests to purchase them. Their friends and family got something for themselves and the newlyweds could then afford the honeymoon of their dreams. Roll up, roll up: Toys were available to buy for £20 . Fun: The couple's guests took the wedding list in good humour . Going, going, gone: Items guests buy which they don't actually need can be donated to charity . Gemma explained to the MailOnline: 'A reverse wedding list is where guests are invited to buy gifts from you rather than for you. My husband and I did this when we got married in 2010. 'Like most couples we had lived together for several years, we had a flat crammed full of stuff and, if anything, we needed to de-clutter, not be bought more toasters and blenders. 'What we ideally wanted was money for our honeymoon but we felt awkward asking our friends and family for cash. So we took all the household items we no longer need and listed then and invited guests to buy them from us.' The couple were delighted their guests embraced the spirit of the gift list - as Gemma admitted some of the items on sale weren't exactly must-haves - with prices starting at £10. Make them laugh: The list allowed Gemma and Marcus to ask their friends for money without causing offence . Cheap and cheerful: Items were affordable so their guests could spend as little as they wanted . She said: 'We had so much stuff we no longer needed - two blenders, two printers, loads of duplicate DVDs and CDs - so this seemed like the perfect solution to de-clutter and raise some cash at the same time. 'We gave guests the option to donate the item they purchased to charity if they didn’t actually want to keep it themselves and we also listed non-material things, like dinner for two at ours.' After having a perfect wedding and honeymoon, the couple went on to have a son, Oscar, in September 2012. Paradise found: The generosity of their guests meant the couple could have a dream honeymoon . Expanding family: Oscar was born in September 2012 and Gemma decided to launch her gift list as a business while on maternity leave . Get your own reverse wedding list: Now other couples can create a list where their wedding guests can buy a gift 'from you not for you' It was while on maternity leave that Gemma considered sharing her wacky wedding list idea with the world and turning it into a business. Now she has set up the website reverseweddinglist.com where other couples can sign up and sell their wares to their guests. Gemma said: 'Setting up the business has been a challenge with a young baby but I'll really proud of the site. I hope there are couples getting married out there who want to create a reverse wedding list of their own.'","Gemma and Marcus Daborn came up with idea of a 'reverse' wedding list .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:47 EST, 28 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:55 EST, 28 April 2013 . Built to dominate the enemy in combat, the Army's hulking Abrams tank is proving equally hard to beat in a budget battle. Lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer money over the past two years to build improved versions of the 70-ton Abrams. But senior Army officials have said repeatedly, 'No thanks.' It's the inverse of the federal budget world these days, in which automatic spending cuts are leaving sought-after pet programs struggling or unpaid altogether. Tanked: Lawmakers from both parties have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds to build improved versions of the 70-ton Abrams tank, which the Army doesn't want . Republicans and Democrats for years have fought so bitterly that lawmaking in Washington ground to a near-halt. Yet in the case of the Abrams tank, there's a bipartisan push to spend an extra $436 million on a weapon the experts explicitly say is not needed. 'If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way,' Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army's chief of staff, told The Associated Press this past week. Why are the tank dollars still flowing? Politics. General: The Army's chief of staff, Gen Ray Odierno, says 'If we had our choice, we would use that money in a different way' Keeping the Abrams production line rolling protects businesses and good paying jobs in congressional districts where the tank's many suppliers are located. If there's a home of the Abrams, it's politically important Ohio. The nation's only tank plant is in Lima. So it's no coincidence that the champions for more tanks are Rep Jim Jordan and Sen Rob Portman, two of Capitol's Hill most prominent deficit hawks, as well as Democratic Sen Sherrod Brown. They said their support is rooted in protecting national security, not in pork-barrel politics. 'The one area where we are supposed to spend taxpayer money is in defense of the country,' said Jordan, whose district in the northwest part of the state includes the tank plant. The Abrams dilemma underscores the challenge that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive in order to ensure there's enough money for essential operations, training and equipment. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, faces a daunting task in persuading members of Congress to eliminate or scale back projects favored by constituents. Federal budgets are always peppered with money for pet projects. What sets the Abrams example apart is the certainty of the Army's position. Sean Kennedy, director of research for the nonpartisan Citizens Against Government Waste, said Congress should listen when one of the military services says no to more equipment. 'When an institution as risk averse as the Defense Department says they have enough tanks, we can probably believe them,' Kennedy said. Congressional backers of the Abrams upgrades view the vast network of companies, many of them small businesses, that manufacture the tanks' materials and parts as a critical asset that has to be preserved. The money, they say, is a modest . investment that will keep important tooling and manufacturing skills . from being lost if the Abrams line were to be shut down. Uphill battle: The Abrams dilemma underscores the challenge that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel faces as he seeks to purge programs that the military considers unnecessary or too expensive . The Lima plant is a study in how federal dollars affect local communities, which in turn hold tight to the federal dollars. The facility is owned by the federal government but operated by the land systems division of General Dynamics, a major defense contractor that spent close to $11million last year on lobbying, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Mayor David Berger. But the facility is still crucial to the local economy. 'All of those jobs and their spending activity in the community and the company's spending probably have about a $100million impact annually,' Berger said. Jordan, a House conservative leader . who has pushed for deep reductions in federal spending, supported the . automatic cuts known as the sequester that require $42billion to be . shaved from the Pentagon's budget by the end of September. The military . also has to absorb a $487billion reduction in defense spending over the . next 10 years, as required by the Budget Control Act passed in 2011. Still, said Jordan, it would be a big mistake to stop producing tanks. Production: The Lima Army Tank Plant is Lima's fifth-largest employer with close to 700 employees, down from about 1,100 just a few years ago, according to Lima's mayor . 'Look, (the plant) is in the 4th Congressional District and my job is to represent the 4th Congressional District, so I understand that,' he said. 'But the fact remains, if it was not in the best interests of the national defense for the United States of America, then you would not see me supporting it like we do.' The tanks that Congress is requiring the Army to buy aren't brand new. Earlier models are being outfitted with a sophisticated suite of electronics that gives the vehicles better microprocessors, color flat panel displays, a more capable communications system, and other improvements. The upgraded tanks cost about $7.5million each, according to the Army. Out of a fleet of nearly 2,400 tanks, . roughly two-thirds are the improved versions, which the Army refers to . with a moniker that befits their heft: the M1A2SEPv2, and service . officials said they have plenty of them. 'The . Army is on record saying we do not require any additional M1A2s,' Davis . Welch, deputy director of the Army budget office, said this month. The . tank fleet, on average, is less than 3 years old. The Abrams is named . after Gen Creighton Abrams, one of the top tank commanders during World . War II and a former Army chief of staff. New tech: The upgraded tanks cost about $7.5million each, according to the Army . The Army's plan was to stop buying tanks until 2017, when production of a newly designed Abrams would begin. Orders for Abrams tanks from U.S. allies help fill the gap created by the loss of tanks for the Army, according to service officials, but congressional proponents of the program feared there would not be enough international business to keep the Abrams line going. This pause in tank production for the . U.S. would allow the Army to spend its money on research and . development work for the new and improved model, said Ashley Givens, a . spokeswoman for the Army's Ground Combat Systems office. The . first editions of the Abrams tank were fielded in the early 1980s. Over . the decades, the Abrams supply chain has become embedded in communities . across the country. General . Dynamics estimated in 2011 that there were more than 560 subcontractors . throughout the country involved in the Abrams program and that they . employed as many as 18,000 people. More . than 40 of the companies are in Pennsylvania, according to Sen. Robert . Casey, D-Pennsylvania, also a staunch backer of continued tank . production. Like new: The Abrams tank fleet, on average, is less than 3 years old. It is named for Gen Creighton Abrams, one of the top tank commanders during World War II and a former Army chief of staff . A letter signed by 173 Democratic and Republican members of the House last year and sent to then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta demonstrated the depth of bipartisan support for the Abrams program on Capitol Hill. They chided the Obama administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the United States for the first time since World War II. Portman, who served as President . George W. Bush's budget director before being elected to the Senate, . said allowing the line to wither and close would create a financial . mess. 'People can't sit around for three years on unemployment insurance and wait for the government to come back,' Portman said. 'That supply chain is going to be much more costly and much more inefficient to create if you mothball the plant.' Pete Keating, a General Dynamics . spokesman, said the money from Congress is allowing for a stable base of . production for the Army, which receives about four tanks a month. Facing backlash: Lawmakers have chided the Obama administration for neglecting the industrial base and proposing to terminate tank production in the U.S. for the first time since World War II . With the line open, Lima also can fill international orders, bringing more work to Lima and preserving American jobs, he said. Current foreign customers are Saudi Arabia, which is getting about five tanks a month, and Egypt, which is getting four. Each country pays all of their own costs. That's a 'success story during a period of economic pain,' Keating said. Still, far fewer tanks are coming out of the Lima plant than in years past. The drop-off has affected companies such as Verhoff Machine and Welding in Continental, Ohio, which makes seats and other parts for the Abrams. Production: The first editions of the Abrams tank were fielded in the early 1980s. Over the decades, the Abrams supply chain has become embedded in communities across the country . Ed Verhoff, the company's president, said his sales have dropped from $20 million to $7 million over the past two years. He's also had to lay off about 25 skilled employees and he expects to be issuing more pink slips in the future. 'When we start to lose this base of people, what are we going to do? Buy our tanks from China?' Verhoff said. Steven Grundman, a defense expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said the difficulty of reviving defense industrial capabilities tends to be overstated. 'From the fairly insular world in which the defense industry operates, these capabilities seem to be unique and in many cases extraordinarily high art,' said Grundman, a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial affairs and installations during the Clinton administration. 'But in the greater scope of the economy, they tend not to be.'","Lawmakers have devoted nearly half a billion dollars in taxpayer funds over the past two years to roll out upgrades of the Abrams tank .

Another tank moves close to it, no doubt to mount a rescue effort . Hit: The second tank is also targeted by what appears to be a projectile . Problems: It initially appears those inside the tank are not badly injured, as it begins to reverse following the attack . Horrific: But it is then hit by a second blast, creating a huge fireball . However, it is then targeted by what seems to be a projectile which causes an enormous explosion. The chaos in Syria continued yesterday when  the country's ambassador to Iraq defected in protest over President Assad's violent suppression following the 16-month uprising. Nawah al-Fares said in a video statement posted on Facebook: 'I declare that I have joined, from this moment, the ranks of the revolution of the Syrian people,' He did not elaborate or say from where he had posted the statement. 'I ask ... the members of the military to join the revolution and to defend the country and the citizens. Turn your guns toward the criminals from this regime,' Fares said. 'Every Syrian man has to join the revolution to remove this nightmare and this gang which has reeked corruption across Syria and destroyed the state and society over the last 40 years, and to guarantee a bright future for the coming generations.' Fares, who has close ties to Syrian security, was the first senior diplomat to quit the embattled government. Under pressure: Although there has been no official confirmation, the tanks are thought to be Syrian army vehicles, loyal to President Bashar al-Assad . He did not spell out his reasons for defecting, but repeatedly said government forces have been killing civilians. There has been no comment from Damascus or Baghdad and the White House said it was unable to confirm the defection, hailed by Assad's opponents as a sign of crumbling support. Assad's chief backer on the U.N. Security Council, Russia, remained firmly in the Syrian leader's camp. And the 15-member council made little headway after international mediator Kofi Annan asked it to agree on 'clear consequences' if the government or opposition fail to comply with his faltering plan for a political solution to the crisis. Fares, a Sunni Muslim and who had held senior positions under the late president Hafez al-Assad, is from Deir al-Zor, the eastern city on the road to Iraq which has been the scene of a ferocious military onslaught by Assad's forces. 'This is just the beginning of a series of defections on the diplomatic level. We are in touch with several ambassadors,' said Mohamed Sermini, a member of the main opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Council. The defection of Fares could be a major blow to Assad, who wants to convince a sceptical world he is conducting a legitimate defence of his country against foreign-backed armed groups bent on toppling the government. The apparent crack in Assad's diplomatic ranks came as international diplomacy inched along, plagued by divisions over what the next steps should be to address Syria's crisis. Annan, appointed mediator by the United Nations and the Arab League, briefed the Security Council by video link from Geneva on the results of this week's diplomatic shuttle to Damascus, Tehran and Baghdad - three capitals forming a Shi'ite Muslim axis of power in the Middle East. Gone: The chaos in Syrian continued yesterday when the country's ambassador to Iraq, Nawah al-Fares, defected in protest over President Assad's violent suppression . The deeply divided council must decide the future of a U.N. observer mission in Syria, known as UNSMIS, before July 20 when its 90-day mandate expires. It initially approved 300 unarmed military observers to monitor an April 12 ceasefire, which failed to take hold, as part of Annan's peace plan. 'He (Annan) called for the Security Council members to put aside their national interests and to put joint and sustained pressure on both parties with clear consequences for non-compliance,' Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said. Russia and China, both veto-wielding permanent council members, have for months blocked moves by western and Arab countries aimed at increasing the pressure on Assad, leaving the council deadlocked.

A 600-year-old country pile described as England's 'perfect timber framed house' has gone on the market for £2.25million. Set in five acres of rolling countryside, Stonehill House has been home Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie and rock star Keith Emerson. The plush five-bedroom property in East Sussex, which boasts an adjoining cottage and barn, was lauded by architecture expert Nikolaus Pevsner's 1965 architecture bible Buildings of England. Welcome to paradise: Stonehill House was described by architecture guru Nikolaus Pevsner as 'the perfect house' and has gone on the market for £2.25million . Idyll: Set in five acres of rolling countryside, Stonehill House has been owned by musicians and writers including Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie and rock star Keith Emerson . Within the 4,344 sq ft house's lavish grounds are a lake, a swimming pool, a tennis court, an orangery, a paddock and extensive landscaped gardens. Stonehill House was built in the 15th century as a giant hall, with rooms added during Tudor times . The oldest records relating to the house state it was home to a family of iron founders called the Elphicks, and that the once formed part of the vast Sackville estate. A 1,076 sq ft two-bedroom cottage was added in the 18th century. In more recent times it was home to Scottish author J.M. Barrie who moved in in 1921, around 15 years after he created his most famous character Peter Pan. Grand: The main house was built in the 15th century with the rest added in the 18th century . Features: With its beams and original furniture, the 600-year-old property was lauded in Pevsner's 1965 architecture bible Buildings of England . Gorgeous: The majority of the rooms in the house were built in Tudor times and maintain the traditional style . Barrie lived there until 1934, three years before his death. The . house, which is typical of historic Wealden architecture found in the . south east of England, underwent renovation in 1912 and again in 1924. It belonged to Keith Emerson, keyboardist with prog rockers Emerson, Lake and Palmer in the 1970s and 1980s.Stonehill House is around a mile from the chocolate box village of Chiddingly, near Hailsham. It is being sold by estate agents Savills at a guide price of £2.25million. Celebrated: J.M. Barrie at his desk and he lived in the grand property for more than 15 years . Sophie Wysock-Wright, from Savills, said: 'Stonehill House is a fantastic slice of British history. 'The timber front is incredible and the house has the most amazing round-headed front door, an original from the 15th century. 'The five acres of gardens are simply stunning - they are very well cultivated and feature upper and lower gardens. 'Stonehill House has been described as the quintessential English country house but it is much more than that. It is the perfect blend of history and contemporary living all set in a stunning location. It is a dream home in every sense.'","Stonehill House in Sussex described as 'the perfect timber framed house'

A British holidaymaker broke down in tears as she told a Spanish court how she was allegedly gang-raped by three men at knife-point who offered her a lift home from a Spanish nightclub. The woman, now 42, said they forced her into sex after taking her to remote wasteland, brandishing a knife and drugging her with a mystery liquid. She told the one-day trial in Malaga via videolink from a court in Britain: 'They were laughing and doing whatever they wanted to me. The alleged gang-rape happened in 2001 after the woman became separated from friends she been out with in the Costa del Sol resort Benalmadena . 'I was scared and felt I had to be compliant. 'They pushed me on the ground after they finished with me and they took my shoes. 'I collapsed. The next thing I knew it was morning and I was in a place in the mountains I didn't know with no houses around.' The alleged gang-rape happened in the early hours of November 4, 2001 after the holidaymaker, then 30, became separated from friends she had been out with in the Costa del Sol resort of Benalmadena. She reported the rape later that day and identified three men from CCTV footage as the attackers who offered her a lift home in a 'small, red car'. Police failed to identify the trio at the time. But one of the defendants, Spaniard Francisco Santiago, was arrested in 2010 when detectives detained him on an unrelated matter and matched a DNA sample they took to one they had obtained from the alleged victim's clothes nine years earlier. His brother Mariano and cousin David Santiago were arrested and charged after he told police they had been with him that night. They have been warned they face 26 years in jail if convicted after taking the witness stand yesterday. The woman says the men offered to give her a lift home after she lost friends in the Spanish resort of Benalmadena (pictured) Their alleged victim had to give her evidence in two 25-minute sessions after breaking down halfway through and asking for a break to recompose herself. State prosecutor Maria Teresa Verdugo described how the men took it in turns to rape the tourist in a Seat Ibiza after tricking her into believing they would give her a lift back to her holiday apartment. It is claimed they knocked her unconscious during the sex attack. Ms Teresa Verdugo said: 'Her account of what happened that night stands out for its brutality and violence. 'She is saying now what she has said right from the start. 'The jail sentences we are demanding reflect the violence these men used and the victim's defencelessness.' Map showing Benalmadena in the Costa del Sol in Spain where the woman lost her friends before allegedly being raped . The defendants, aged 22 to 24 at the time, told the court their DNA was on the victim's clothes because she had performed a sex act on one inside the nightclub and the other two afterwards in a nearby car park. Francisco claimed he made no mention of it in police interviews prior to the court case because his memory had failed him after so many years. David Santiago, a father-of-two, said: 'I swear on my children's life this woman is not telling the truth. 'I have two young kids and I would never be capable of committing such horrendous crimes.' State prosecutor Maria Teresa Verdugo asked the court to convict two of the defendants on three charges of rape and a single charge of wounding and sentence them each to 31 years in jail. The judge said they will be reserving judgement until a later date.

Operation: Jasmine Smith is one patient to have benefited from the pioneering surgical technology . Pioneering surgical technology similar to car satnav systems is revolutionising the treatment of difficult-to-reach brain tumours. The technique uses MRI scanning to show the soft tissues inside the brain, in real time. So unlike an  X-ray, which is effectively a photograph, this is like a live video feed from inside the head. The images are used to create a three-dimensional map of the brain, which is shown on a screen, allowing surgeons to pre-plan the operation instead of going in blind. Brain tumours are among the hardest to remove completely. Some surgeons describe the process as like ‘trying to extract a spider from jelly’. While parts of the head are easily cut away, the nature of such cancers means it spreads through the brain – so ‘legs’ may be left, which will continue to grow. Taking away too much healthy brain tissue can result in long- term damage and complications such as loss of speech, vision and motor functions. During the new ‘satnav’ operation, images can be updated during surgery, making it far easier to target the tumour precisely and helping to avoid harm to the surrounding brain. Mr Andrew McEvoy, neurosurgeon at the National Hospital  for Neurology & Neurosurgery in London, has performed more than 100 of these operations since the technology became available two years ago. He says: ‘We can stop the operation and scan the brain while the head  is still open to double-check that all the tumour has gone. ‘Patients have their wound closed up only once the scan gives the  all-clear. It lessens the need for a second operation a few days later to remove any tumour left behind. Afterwards, it leaves more vital functions intact because the surgery is so controllable.’ One patient to have benefited is Jasmine Smith, 22, a trainee nurse. Jasmine lives with her parents, Ruth, 41, and Ambrose, 42, who run a roofing business, and her sister Amber, 19, in Denham, Buckinghamshire. Jasmine’s problems began in 2008, when she suffered the first of a series of seizures. ‘I was talking to my mum when I had a strong sense of déjà vu,’ she says. ‘Apparently, then I babbled something about my brother – but I don’t have a brother. Then I felt really tired and slept for two hours.’ Guided in: Surgeons remove Jasmine's tumour during a 13-hour operation in June 2011 . A week later Jasmine fainted. Initially she put the incidents down to exhaustion. She was studying performing arts and dancing seven days a week. But when she started to feel a numbness in her face, she went to her GP, fearing she had had a stroke. He immediately referred her for  a brain scan, which revealed a tangerine-sized tumour. Every day at least 20 people are diagnosed with a brain tumour,  and Jasmine’s type, an epidermoid tumour (also called an epidermoid cyst), makes up about one per cent of those. It is benign (non-cancerous) and is formed by skin cells deposited in the wrong place during brain development in the womb. This causes a cyst to form, which makes up the tumour. It is likely Jasmine was born with it, and due to its slow growth she developed symptoms only when it got big enough to put pressure on her brain and trigger seizures. Her neurologist told her that because of its position, the tumour was inoperable. Her only option was to try  anti-epileptic drugs to see if they would control the seizures, which continued to worsen – and often led to her blacking out completely. Hard to reach: It is likely Jasmine was born with the tumour (pictured) Then, two years ago her neurologist referred her to Mr McEvoy as she was considered an ideal candidate for the new ‘satnav’ procedure. Jasmine underwent the 13-hour operation under general anaesthetic in June 2011. After nine days, she was sent home. Eighteen months later she suffered another major seizure – and has been put back  on anti-epileptic medication, which has now controlled the problem. She has since returned to work. Despite not having a perfect result, she is happy. She says: ‘The reality of my ordeal sank in only about a year after the op – I was looking at photos of my brain after surgery and burst into tears. It felt like a release. I decided to give up dancing for nursing. I started my training in September. I felt so inspired by the wonderful medical team that saved my life, I want to give something back.’","New technique uses MRI scanning to show tissues inside brain in real time .

Top of the class: Sixth formers who achieve the best A-Level results will have extra cause for celebration . Tens of thousands of school leavers with good A-levels face missing out on top universities, which are rejecting applicants with grades lower than ABB. Sixth-formers receiving their results in a fortnight will be divided into a two-tier clearing system. Those with the highest grades will find a large number of places in a range of courses on offer. But those with grades equivalent to ABC or less will find undergraduate offers severely restricted, a Daily Mail survey has found. Students who miss out will have to settle for courses at less prestigious universities or put their lives on hold while they resit exams or take a gap year. In previous years, universities have been limited in the number of students with top grades that they can take. This provided an opportunity for lower grade students to get in. However, this restriction has now been dropped and the prestigious universities have been told they can take as many students as they like with grades of ABB and above. Competition for places is intense as grade inflation means around 27 per cent of A-level candidates got A or A* grades last year and around half were awarded Bs. Elite universities including Oxford and University College London have already stated they will not take part in clearing. But other prestigious Russell Group institutions have confirmed they are looking to harvest top students through the system. The University of Exeter said it wanted ‘as many suitably qualified applicants as possible’. The University of Sheffield said it was ‘looking to recruit high quality students through adjustment and clearing this year’. Two tier: Tens of thousands of sixth formers face missing out on their first choice of university after the rules governing how many top students could be accepted were relaxed . Birmingham has said it is ‘definitely’ taking part in clearing and Warwick, Leeds, Manchester and Southampton recently indicated they were likely to have places available. Malcolm Trobe, deputy secretary general of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘There is a concern that universities will not be able to accept applicants on some courses who just miss getting an ABB, when in previous years they might have been able to accommodate them. ‘This is why it is so important that students have an insurance offer that actually gives them a safety net. 'About 40 per cent of students last year went for second choices that needed at least the same grades as their first choice. These are the students who are going to be in a muddle.’ A Universities and Colleges Admissions Service spokesman said: ‘If an applicant does not meet the conditions of their offer, acceptance is at the discretion of the institution.’ Rich pickings: Sixth formers who pass their A-Levels with top marks will have a wide range of courses to choose from at the very best universities .","Undergraduate offers will be severely restricted, the Daily Mail has found .

But it seems Alan Sugar may be preparing to quit the BBC1 show that turned him into the nation’s most recognisable – and irascible – business tycoon. The 66-year-old, who is chairman of the Amshold group of companies, may leave to devote more time to his other work, his right-hand man has claimed. Nick Hewer (left) said he 'wouldn't be surprised' if Alan Sugar (centre) quit The Apprentice next year . Five candidates are left in this year's series - the ninth - but the opening episode was watched by six million viewers, down on the 8.1million who tuned for the 2008 series opener . Nick Hewer, who sits next to Lord Sugar in The Apprentice boardroom, said he ‘wouldn’t be surprised’ if he left after the tenth series next year. He told the Radio Times: ‘He won’t get bored. But he is all over this show for 12 months of the year, every task, every aspect of the scheduling, marketing, and press – everything. ‘Don’t think he just pops in, does his little bit and pushes off home. Not a chance. He’s very devoted: possibly, I think, to the detriment of his other business interests. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if at some point after ten years he said, ‘Actually lads, I think I’ve done my bit.’ Hewer first met Lord Sugar in 1983 when his PR company was chosen to represent the businessman’s company Amstrad. Since then, they have become firm friends as well as business confidantes. The 69-year-old, who hosts Countdown as well as helping with The Apprentice, said he was ‘only speculating’ about Lord Sugar’s future, but felt the tycoon had ‘done his duty’. He added: ‘He might say he’s only going to do 11 or 12 series, but then find it hard to walk away because it’s his baby.’ In recent years, The Apprentice has seen . its audience ratings slump. This year’s opening episode was watched by . 6million viewers, down on the 8.1million who tuned in for the 2008 . series opener. Hewer said Lord Sugar has been so devoted to the programme it has been to the 'detriment of his other business interests' Nick Hewer was speaking to Radio Times about the future of the show . The show has brought Lord Sugar other headaches. Earlier this year, he was forced to give evidence to an employment tribunal after a former winner, Stella English, claimed she was treated like an ‘overpaid lackey’ in her prize job. She lost the case. In 2009, senior Tories called for him to quit the programme after he became Labour’s ‘enterprise tsar’, but he stayed on after agreeing to suspend public activity during the airing of his shows. Hewer said the BBC should not attempt to replace Lord Sugar with another host if he does decide to leave the show. He said: ‘People would pay to do that job. But as a broadcaster, the BBC would have a really tough decision whether or not to rest this programme. ‘If Alan Sugar says, “Look, I’ve done my ten years,” or whatever it is, if he thinks he’s done his bit, I think they would be crackers to run it the next year with someone else. ‘Because it’s his show, and he’s made such an impression that you would need to be a suicide merchant to take it on after Sugar in the next year. ‘Rest it for three years, let the memories dim, and then bring it back. But, you know, somebody will say, “Are you mad? We want those eight million viewers,” or whatever it is. It’s a huge show. Nobody wants to say ""cheerio"" to such a successful format. That will be a hard decision.’ Hewer added the BBC should not attempt to change the format of The Apprentice to try to attract more viewers. He said: ‘If you have a great format, you tinker with it at your peril, because there’s a little bit of magic in that format. This series has been as fresh as ever, and I think the grit in the oyster is the jeopardy. ‘That someone sat on their squashy sofa in Sunderland who hasn’t got a job can quite legitimately shout at the telly, “Don’t do that, you idiot, I could do better.” That’s the magic.’","Nick Hewer said he 'wouldn't be surprised' if Lord Sugar left show next year .

Jason Thomas (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court) persuaded Luisa Smith to send him £175,000 by telling her he needed to pay off drug debts, it is alleged . A personal trainer duped a trust fund manager out of £175,000 after saying he loved her - and then used the money to fund an extravagant lifestyle, a court heard today. Jason Thomas, 42, persuaded Luisa Smith, 35, to send him the cash by telling her he needed to pay off drug debts, it is alleged. Thomas even convinced his smitten victim he would use some of the money to buy a house with her, Southwark Crown Court was told. But instead, he used the proceeds to fuel his ‘delusions of grandeur’, splashing out on luxuries including a jet-ski and designer watches. Smith, a trust fund manager at Capita Trustees in Jersey, ended up plundering two high-profile accounts and remortgaged her flat to get the money for the man she loved. The cash was then sent back to Thomas via bank accounts belonging to his brother Steven, 43, and former Credit Suisse banker Rory Codd, 34, jurors heard. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said of Jason Thomas: ‘He used this woman to fund an extravagant lifestyle. ‘The Crown say Jason Thomas has delusions of grandeur and has an over-inflated feeling of self-worth which his personal training could not satisfy. ‘He targeted a woman in a good job and he told her that he needed her cash because he was in debt to drug dealers or that his own clients had not paid him. ‘And so the woman paid up, wanting to impress the man she loved.’ Smith met Thomas through a friend and immediately fell in love with him when they kissed on a date during 2008. But within months, he was pleading for money he said would be used to pay off drug debts. In a ‘test run’ on June 27, 2009, he received £40,000 after Smith remortgaged her flat and paid the money via Codd’s account. A further payment of £98,000 was then made to Codd from one of the trust accounts Smith was looking after at her work. Between . May and August 2009, payments of £62,500 and £14,000 were paid to . Steven Thomas from a trust account Smith was in charge of. Trial: Luisa Smith (left), 35, a trust fund manager at Capita Trustees in Jersey, plundered two high-profile accounts and remortgaged her flat to get money for Jason Thomas (right). She was jailed for two years in 2011 . Ms Karmy-Jones said: ‘He said if she loved him she would be happy to give him money and help clear his debts. ‘Jason Thomas enjoyed living an extravagant life though and some of his expenses were well beyond the means a personal trainer’s salary could provide.’ In February 2008, Thomas was looking . to buy an £85,000 boat which he told the dealer he would be able to pay . for once some funds had cleared in a Jersey account, the court heard. In . March 2009, he took another woman he was looking to fleece to Thailand . for a fortnight at a cost of £1,690 but the court heard the money came . from Codd’s account. And in May that year, he bought a Mercedes SLK Kompressor 200, with Codd supplying the downpayment from his account. He also bought an Audi TT using money from a friend's account. Thomas then had £1,500-worth of work done to a jet-ski he wanted - but again had Codd pay the downpayment on his behalf. The cash was then sent back to Thomas via bank accounts belonging to his brother Steven (left), 43, and former Credit Suisse banker Rory Codd (right), 34, jurors heard . In July 2009, when he found the boat he wanted to buy had been sold, he organised for one to be custom-built for him at a cost of more than £100,000. Two payments of £20,000 were made by Codd in August 2009 to the boat builder and a further £17,000 was paid by Jason Thomas. While in Jersey, Jason Thomas bought a £3,460 Rolex watch which he sold days later for a similar price but for cash. The alleged fraud was discovered in August 2009 when Smith, from St Helier, went on holiday and unusual payments were discovered by workmates. She was sacked and later convicted of two counts of fraud and sentenced to two years in prison. Jason Thomas, of South Woodford, Essex denies two counts of conspiracy to acquire criminal property and eight counts of acquiring criminal property . Rory Codd, of Kilburn, north-west London, denies three counts of acquiring criminal property and a single count of conspiracy to acquire criminal property.

The ‘Nenshou’ app from Japan is aiming to grab attention by marrying personal training with 'anime' dating - and throwing a bit of bullying into the mix too. The app combines the world of ‘gaming dating’ (where the player is a lonely singleton who tries to win the affections of potential partners) with weight loss. Not only that, but your virtual love interest hectors you into slimming down with ‘motivational’ statements such as ‘Fat girl, do some more exercise, okay?’ Scroll down for video . As your weight drops and love blossoms, you are taken through increasingly romantic scenarios - but the relationship depends on your dieting success . The app creates a love interest - a high school crush - who you try to impress by loosing weight. Sounds like a healthy relationship. To start, each player creates an animated character, who then meets up . with their childhood sweetheart. The long-lost love proceeds to tell you you've got fat . and need to lose weight. Charming.

A landmark documentary capturing the drama of a murder trial from inside a British court room is to be broadcast on television for the first time. In an unprecedented move, a film crew was allowed access to an entire case - including the moment a businessman was convicted of murdering his wife. Cameras have been banned within the precincts of court since 1925. But Channel 4 was granted permission to follow the six-week retrial of Nat Fraser at the High Court in Edinburgh in 2012. Drama: In a legal first, cameras caught the moment businessman Nat Fraser, left, was convicted of arranging the murder of his wife Arlene, right, following a six-week retrial at the High Court in Edinburgh . The documentary has reignited the debate about how much access television cameras should be given to British courts. Bafta-winning filmmaker director . Nick Holt, who directed the documentary, said it was right that the public were given . greater access to the court system. He told the Independent: 'We . have a right to see this process which costs us an enormous amount of . money and which we are very good at and very thorough at. 'There is . nothing to hide, nothing shameful going on. The process of filming . demystifies the legal process.' Access: Cameras were allowed to follow an entire case - including to its court room climax - for the Channel 4 documentary Murder Trial, pictured . Historic: In a first in British legal history, cameras recorded legal proceedings from inside the court room . Warning: Some legal experts have warned opening up the court room to cameras could harm justice . The previous decade has seen a gradual opening up of access for cameras in British courts. The Government wants the end of a court case to be shown on television so 'justice is seen to be done'. Scottish courts, last year, allowed the filming of sentencing remarks from Lord Bracadale – who presided over the Fraser retrial. Opening up: Judge Lord Bracadale allowed cameras to film him delivering a sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, last year . The two-hour documentary, The Murder Trial, which will be broadcast on Tuesday July 9 at 9pm on Channel 4, used six remotely controlled cameras to capture all the unfolding drama within the court room. After three years of negotiation the Scottish High Court gave documentary team permission to film the judge, lawyers, defendant and witnesses during the high-profile retrial of Fraser who was accused of killing his wife Arlene. Her . body has never been found, there is no weapon, no crime scene and her . husband appears to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared. Reservations: Lord Judge says that allowing cameras into crown court sentencing hearings could lead to disruption, including boos and cheers from the gallery . With . over 70 witnesses and 104 pieces of evidence the complex case is . dissected firstly by the prosecution QC Alex Prentice and then the defence QC John Scott. Nat . Fraser was first brought to trial in 2003 for the murder of his wife – . he was found guilty. But Fraser argued that the trial was a miscarriage . of justice and challenged the verdict in the highest courts in the land. The case became a cause celebre. Eventually, after years of protesting . his innocence, the conviction was quashed in 2011. In April 2012, Fraser was sent back to the High Court in Edinburgh for a fresh trial, . 14 years after his wife’s disappearance. A new jury was sworn in to hear . all the evidence against him. Broadcasters will be allowed into the Court of Appeal from October and this is likely to be extended to crown court prosecutions. But opening up of courts to cameras has sparked a heated debate within the legal profession. The highest judge in the country, Lord Chief Justice Judge, has said filming a sentencing could spark chaos in a courtroom. He warned that lifting the 90-year-old filming ban could encourage hecklers to yell abuse or even cheer knowing it will be broadcast across the country. Lord Judge also raised concern that allowing cameras into sensitive cases could prevent witnesses coming forward.","Cameras capture moment businessman is convicted of arranging his wife's murder .

A mother whose son suffered horrific burns at nursery when staff spilt boiling chicken fat on his leg has successfully sued the school. Staff at Kids Academy in Leeds initially told Katie Brewster that her five-year-old son Harrison Farrell had dropped his own soup on his lap - but only later did an assistant admit a worker had tripped carrying a chicken dish. Marketing executive Miss Brewster, 30, immediately withdrew her son from the nursery and was then sent a bill for £600 for failing to give a month's notice. Five-year-old Harrison Brewster suffered serious burns after a nursery worker spilt chicken fat on him - his mother Katie Brewster, 30, from Leeds, has successfully sued the Kids Academy school in Holt Park, Leeds . The family sued the nursery and were awarded a five-figure sum after its insurers admitted liability for her son’s burns at Leeds County Court.  Miss Brewster has put the money into a fund for her son. But Harrison has been left with a large scar on his thigh following the incident at Kids Academy in Holt Park, Leeds, on July 24 last year. Miss Brewster said: 'When I got the call at work, I was told that Harrison had spilled soup on his leg and that, just to be on the safe side, I might want to take him home. 'I went straight there, and on the way I contacted the doctor to make an appointment to have him checked out. 'When I got to the nursery I could tell Harrison hadn’t done it to himself straight away. I demanded to know what had happened.  I was really shocked: he was really badly burned, but nobody had even called for an ambulance. 'I was just appalled.  Eventually one of the assistants told me what had happened and I was absolutely mortified.' Harrison's leg was blistered where the hot fat had hit it - doctors say he will always have scarring there . 'In so much pain': The injured child then developed an infection and had to spend three days in hospital . Harrison's worried mother took him straight to the doctor where the wound was dressed and then to A&E, where his large blisters were syringed and the wound cleaned. Doctors told her he had sustained second-degree burns to his right leg, and the child had to spend three days in hospital when an infection developed. Miss Brewster said: 'Harrison was really brave, but it was absolutely awful to see him in so much pain and discomfort.' Once they got out of hospital and Miss Brewster removed her son from the nursery, she was astonished to receive a £634 bill for them for failing to give one month's notice. She said: 'I'd already decided that they needed to be held to account for what they’d done, if only to try to make sure this didn’t happen to anyone else. Kids Academy sent Harrison's mother a £634 bill after she withdrew him - for failing to give one month's notice . 'But when I got the invoice that was just adding insult to injury. I knew it would be a struggle, but there was no way he was going back to the nursery. 'Now that this is all over, I’m just happy that Harrison’s injury wasn’t even more serious.  He was under the care of the plastic surgeon for six months after the incident, but has now been discharged and we’re just concentrating on getting on with our lives. 'Thankfully the injury is healing quite well, and it hasn’t affected Harrison’s enjoyment of school. He’s back to being the happy little boy he was before all this started.' Chris Baxendale, the family's lawyer, said: 'This was a scary ordeal, both for Harrison and his mum as well. 'Katie Brewster's shock, upset and outrage was entirely understandable' - Chris Baxendale, solicitor for Harrison's family . 'The injury he sustained was really quite severe, and Katie’s shock, upset and outrage was entirely understandable. 'The nursery’s own prospectus points out the danger presented by adults carrying hot drinks, yet they failed to apply the same standards to fluids from hot food. 'The fact that the hot chicken was even being carried in the nursery area was in itself an act of negligence.' A spokeswoman for Kids Academy said: 'Harrison’s parents and Ofsted were immediately notified of the incident. 'We co-operated fully with an Ofsted investigation. They concluded Kids Academy met all of its legal requirements and no further action was recommended. 'A copy of their report was sent to Ms Brewster. Harrison received compensation for his injury which the court has approved. 'Everyone at the nursery wishes Harrison and his family well for the future.'","Harrison Farrell spent three days in hospital after his leg was badly burnt .

Since Friday, it has been drilling a six-inch exploratory borehole 3,000ft into the Sussex shale and limestone in search of oil and gas. Although there are no immediate plans to use fracking at the site, the controversial technique is expected to be deployed if fuel reserves are found. Scroll down for video . Concrete carbuncle: Aerial pictures of the site near Balcombe in Sussex where Cuadrilla are looking to extract Gas By Fracking . Fracking involves pumping water, sand and chemicals deep underground at high pressure to crack rocks and retrieve the natural gas trapped inside. Opponents say the process causes  tremors, noise and pollution. If used, the night sky around the  village of Balcombe in West Sussex could become lit up with ‘flares’ of burning gas similar to those seen on oil rigs.

According to Cuadrilla, which is licensed to carry out the Balcombe test drill, the operation will continue for two-and-a-half months. It is also looking to acquire up to six more sites for shale gas exploration. Drilling could begin on two of these as early as 2014. Despite living in neighbouring Kent, Energy Minister Michael Fallon is keen that the dash for gas extends across a vast swathe of the South. He said there may be opportunities to exploit shale gas from Dorset, through Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. Yesterday Downing Street endorsed his enthusiasm. Asked about the energy minister’s assertion, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The PM has no reason to think that Michael Fallon is wrong about that. ‘The Prime Minister thinks that shale gas represents an exciting potential resource for Britain that could contribute to our energy security. ‘Fracking will only be allowed where it is safe and poses no risk to the environment.’ Mr Osborne made it clear that communities where shale gas extraction takes place will be compensated. He said: ‘We’ve designed a regime that is very generous for local communities where this activity might take place.’ But Craig Bennett, of Friends of the Earth, said: ‘Fracking poses a real threat to the local environment and causes more climate-wrecking pollution. ‘It’s little wonder communities across the country, including  the Tory shires, are mobilising against it.’","This rig has been drilling a six-inch exploratory borehole 3,000ft into the shale and limestone .

Three schoolgirls were taken out of class after they shaved off half their hair to raise money for a cancer charity - even though teachers had sponsored them to do it. The 12-year-old pupils were hauled in front of their head of year, who told them their fund-raising efforts were 'pathetic' and accused them of only being interested in their own popularity. The mother of one of the girls accused the school of being 'ridiculous' and discouraging pupils from embarking on similar charity work in the future. Charity: Kiera Thomas, Gemma Wright and Macey Daden (pictured left to right) shaved off half their hair to raise money for Cancer Research UK . Kiera Thomas, Gemma Wright and Macey Daden decided to adopt the unusual hairstyles, with the breast cancer ribbon shaved onto the side of their heads, in order to battle cancer after losing loved ones to the disease. They raised £800 for Cancer Research UK, with some of their teachers at St Leonards Academy in St Leonards on Sea, Sussex,  among the generous donors who sponsored the girls. However, they were hauled before the head of Year Seven and told off for their appearance, while Kiera was put in isolation from her classmates because of her haircut. The senior teacher told the girls, 'It is a pathetic way to raise money,' according to Gemma. Kiera added: 'He said we did it to draw attention to ourselves and become more popular with the older kids.' Disciplined: The three girl were told they were 'pathetic' and Kiera was put into isolation . The girls asked teachers for permission . to carry out the stunt, and were told that it was OK as long as they . covered up the patterns which they shaved into their hair. Kiera's mother Susan said: 'Kiera's hair is pretty much impossible to cover because of the way it was cut and also because it is so thin. 'Kiera was put into isolation on Monday from the rest of her class and told she couldn't go into any class until her hair was covered over. She came home in tears. 'They were told it was an ""absolutely pathetic"" way to raise money and that they should have gone on a jog instead. But some teachers sponsored them to have half their hair shaved off. 'A lot of people say the youth of today are selfish and self-centred. My daughter and her friends proved they're not. I think it was very brave, courageous and completely selfless of the girls to raise money. 'To make them feel so bad about doing something so worthwhile is pathetic and ridiculous. The way the school has handled this has been atrocious.' Jenny Jones, principal of St Leonards Academy, said: 'While we applaud these girls for their efforts in raising money for charity, we have rules and regulations regarding dress and appearance which apply to all our students.'","The three 12-year-olds have raised £800 for Cancer Research UK .

The NYPD and researchers from Brookhaven National Laboratory have installed testing devices and will release the gasses - which are completely harmless - in an effort to test of how they spread through the subway system. Officials have long noted that New York's subway system and its five million daily passengers are vulnerable, and this experiment will help experts understand how chemical, biological or radiological weapons could be used in the subway in a terrorist attack. Terrorist test: The NYPD are hoping the results of their tests will help police hone their response to potential chemical or biological attacks on the subway system (stock image) The police will use the information gathered in the tests to hone their plans for emergency responses to such attacks. NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said in a statement that about 200 sampling . devices will be set up to take measurements. The small black-and-gray boxes containing . monitoring equipment have been installed on subway platforms and lamp . posts poles around Manhattan. The first part of the study began today at 8am. The gasses are harmless perfluorocarbons, released at low levels at several subway stations and at street level for about half-an-hour during the morning. The study is being funded through a $3.4 million grant from the federal Department of Homeland Security . Commuters: More than five million people ride the New York City subway daily . 'The NYPD works for the best, but plans for the worst when it comes to potentially catastrophic attacks such as ones employing radiological contaminant or weaponized anthrax,' Ray Kelly said. 'This field study with Brookhaven's outstanding expertise will help prepare and safeguard the city's population in the event of an attack.' Paul Kalb, division head for environmental research and technology in the environmental sciences department at Brookhaven National Laboratory, told The New York Times that the study will help researchers to understand how the subway system affects the flow of air above and below ground. 'The subways play a major role in how air moves through Manhattan and the five boroughs,' Kalb told the Times. Threatened: After the terrorist attacks in London in 2005, New York City upped its security on the transport system and this latest test is part of the NYPD's efforts to prepare . '[Gasses] can spread further and in a way that you might not anticipate,' he said, adding that the tests will help the NYPD decide which subway lines to close down in the event of an attack to limit the spread of contaminated air. The traceable gases will be released in seven different locations in Manhattan - three above ground and four below - on three nonconsecutive days this month. According to DNAinfo, today's testing will conclude at 3:30pm. The other two testing days are yet to be announced, and are dependent on weather.","The NYPD will release harmless gasses into the subway system today .

Police in Australia have released CCTV footage of a gang storming a car workshop and shooting a worker dead as they try to identify the men. Nine hooded men are seen striding into the garage, some of them holding guns outstretched in front of them, as a barrage of bullets rained down on the victim, killing Jason De leso, a father to be. The horrific mob attack happened in broad daylight nine months ago, in Pooraka, Adelaide, South Australia, but police have so far failed to prosecute anyone for the execution-style killing. Scroll down for video . Killing: This is the terrifying moment a gang of hooded men stormed a garage in Adelaide, Australia, and gunned down Jason De leso, last November . They believe the brutal attack is linked to a dispute between biker groups known as the Finks and the Hells Angels. Bike gangs are notorious for keeping their silence, but South Australia police has offered $500,000 to anyone who can identify the men. Paul Dickson, assistant commissioner at South Australia Police, told 9News the code of silence would not protect the men, and it was 'only a matter of time' before they were arrested. The footage, although pixelated, shows some important details the police think may help identify the men. Reward: Nine as yet unidentified men stormed the car workshop at around 12.45am on November 21. Police hope releasing this footage will help identify the men . The men are believed to be members of a motorbike group and police said at the time . As the shots are fired one man puts his hands over his ears . As the men run away, one of their hoods falls down, showing a scar on the back of his head and a tattoo on the his neck . In particular, one man's hood falls . down as they run out of the car park after the murder.

Reward: Police in South Australia are offering $500,000 to anyone who can identify the hooded men who raided Jason De leso's (pictured) garage in November and shot him . The . police also say they believe two cars were involved in the attack: a . white Mazda 2, found burnt out at Kangarilla the day of the murder, and a . white Nissan Pulsar Hatchback. Meanwhile, the grieving family of Mr De leso have stressed that the father-to-be was an 'innocent person'. He worked in the garage which did some spray painting work on Finks motorbikes but they say he had no connection to either Finks of Hells Angels. In a statement, seen by 9News, they said he was a fmaily man who loved life and gave his heart to all of who came into contact with him'. At the time of the killing he was expecting to be a father. The statement added that Me De leso never got hte chance to hold his child or hear the word 'Daddy'. The Finks are a motorbike club, founded in Adelaide, Australia, in 1969. They are named after a cartoon  catchphrase, in which peasant would proclaim, 'The king is a fink' in The Wizard of Id. Fink members are identified by their . leather jackets which have a picture of the cartoon king's jester on the . back.

Art critic Brian Sewell said he 'loathed' the public service broadcaster for its treatment of culture, saying it failed to replace the experience offered by books and museums. His comments were echoed by Sir Roy Strong, former director of the National Portrait Gallery and the Victoria and Albert Museum, who accused the BBC the 'outrageous exploitation' of academics. Outspoken criticism: Sir Roy Strong (left), former director of the National Portrait Gallery, and Brian Sewell (right), the arts writer, have both slammed the BBC for what they see as its lacklustre arts coverage .

'All you do is watch television and that is it in a nutshell. But that's a nutshell that I think is no good to anybody.' The criticisms are just the latest attack launched by Mr Sewell on the quality of the BBC's cultural output.

The Deputy Prime Minister is preparing defy his grassroots to refuse  to campaign in 2015 on a promise to scrap £9,000 tuition fees. But as new figures showed Lib Dem membership has slumped by a third in three years, a survey of activists revealed most would prefer to see Labour’s Ed Miliband installed as Prime Minister next time round. Choice: Lib Dem members overwhelmingly prefer the idea of Labour returning to power after the 2015 election . Choice: Nick Clegg is under pressure from Lib Dem members to shun a new coalition with Try David Cameron (left) to form a power-sharing deal with Labour's Ed Miliband (right) A survey of members by Lib Dem voice shows 40 per cent want to their party to form a full coalition with Labour after the 2015 general election, compared to just 13 per cent who want a repeat of the power-sharing deal with David Cameron’s Tories. A further 15 per cent would like a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement with Labour, which would stop short of a coalition and leave the Lib Dems free to vote on an issue-by-issue basis, but agree not to bring down the government or vote against its Budget. It means more than half (55 per cent) of Lib Dem members want to see some form of arrangement with Labour . compared to fewer than 1 in 5 (18 per cent) who want to return to power . with the Tories. Labour's income in 2012 was around £2.75million more than that of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats combined.

However the accounts, released by the Electoral Commission, also Labour's membership also dropped, from 193,961 in 2010 and 193,300 in 2011 to 187,537 last year. Labour's income was up from £31.2 million in 2011 and Conservative funds also rose from £23.7 million, while Lib Dems saw a small fall from £6.2 million. Both the Scottish National Party and the UK Independence Party bucked the trend of falling membership figures. The SNP saw membership soar from 16,232 in 2010 to 24,732 in 2012, on the back of the party's capture of overall control in Holyrood, while Nigel Farage's UKIP has grown from 15,535 in 2010 to 20,409 last year. Meanwhile, membership of the far-right British National Party continued to tumble, from 14,046 in 2010 to 7,651 in 2011 and just 4,872 in 2012. The SNP had an income of £2.3 million in 2012, UKIP £1.2 million and the BNP £462,450. Stephen . Tall, editor of LibDemVoice, said: ‘Tactically, it makes sense for the . Lib Dems to want to choose Labour next time: it would show the party . isn’t simply an adjunct to the Tories but can work with both other major . parties if that’s how the public votes. ‘On a principled basis, Labour’s position on a range of big economic issues - tax-cuts for the low-paid, the ‘mansion tax’, ending universal benefits for wealthier pensioners - has moved towards the Lib Dems’ in recent months.’ Latest data from the Electoral Commission showed the Liberal Democrats took in just over £6 million in donations in 2012, and spent more than £6.4 million. The accounts also showed revealed a steep decline in membership for the Liberal Democrats, down from 65,038 in 2010 to 48,934 in 2011 and 42,501 last year. The stage is set for another stand-off . between Mr Clegg and his members at the party’s annual conference in . Glasgow in September. The . party leader intends to go into the general election with an explicit . pledge to keep annual university tuition fees of £9,000. Lib . Dems will be asked to back the plans to retain the controversial fees, a . move which would allow it to become a manifesto promise. The . fallout of the row over tuition fees has hung over the party since it . fought the 2010 election opposing increases before swiftly agreeing to . introduce significantly higher costs. Mr Clegg later apologised for breaking the pledge in a video that was quickly spoofed and went viral on the web. Last . month, he told party members that the 2015 manifesto will make a clear . distinction between ‘commitments' and 'ambitions' and will also spell . out the party's red lines for any coalition negotiations. Policy papers have been drawn up by . the Lib Dem higher education working group, led by Baroness Sal Brinton, . which dismiss calls to reduce the fees to £6,000 or replace them with a . graduate tax. It recommends . retaining the £9,000 limit with a new government then reviewing the . policy. Party sources said that work would focus on how effective the . policy had been. Under Lib Dem rules, proposals must be backed at its conference to become party policy. A spokesman said: ‘This will be debated at conference.’ Not again: Only 13 per cent of Lib Dem members surveyed by LibDemVoice want to see a repeat of the coalition with the Conservatives . A senior Lib Dem source told The Independent:  ‘We know that we must not go into the next election making unrealistic promises that we won't be able to keep. ‘Everyone from grass-roots activists to Government ministers has taken flak on this and we all emerged from that experience bruised, so we are determined not to repeat the mistake. ‘That experience has taught us all the importance of realistic, costed policies that we can be confident could be delivered in government. ‘That's why we have thoroughly examined the current system and the alternatives and have concluded that we should stick with the current system and review it once it has been given a proper chance to bed in.’","Majority of activists would prefer to see Ed Miliband's party in power .

Asian needle ants, an aggressive species with painful stings, is on the march, winning territory from Argentine ants, the U.S.'s most famous invasive species. The Asian ants are not just a worry for the Argentine ants, but also for humans. They cause itchy bites on people that can cause anaphylactic shock, a severe reaction that can result in death, if the person is allergic. Argentine ants were very successful as an an invasive species, spreading across the country with their territorial behaviour and super-colonies, having arrived in the U.S. in the 19th century. Scroll down for video . Battle of the ants: Asian needle ants, right, are pushing out Argentine ants, left. Researchers predict that the more aggressive Asian ants, which have painful bites, could be the next big foreign ant invasion in the U.S. For a long time, they have been the dominant invasive species, but now Asian ants are displacing them. Unusually the Argentines have not been fighting the newcomers, letting them gain ground quickly in pockets everywhere from Alabama to New York to Oregon. Lead author of the research into this ant influx, Eleanor Spicer Rice at North Carolina University, said the Asian ants could be the next major ant invasion. Dr Spicer Rice began to investigate after she noticed Asian ants winning turf over the Argentines in a North Carolina office park. Normally the territorial Argentine species do not having any other species of ant nearby, so Dr Spicer . Rice decided to investigate. The researchers believe the Asian . ants have an advantage over the Argentines because they are active in . cool weather, whereas the Argentine ant rests until spring. The Asian ants start building new nests around March, whereas the Argentine ants start in late April or May, giving them a headstart every year. Dr Spicer Rice said that they are very likely to continue their advance as a species. 'The Asian needle ant is moving into forests and urban environments. 'Because it is active at cooler temperatures, it could move into a very broad range of territory.' Unlike the Asian variety, Argentine ants do not pose a direct threat to humans. Argentine ants have also appeared in greater numbers in Britain, taking advantage of balmier summers.","More aggressive Asian ants are winning the battle for territory .

Explosive: The flames of the crash took ten minutes to extinguish and kept firefighters from responding right away . The plane's wings and horizontal stabilizer sustained substantial damage. In the Soldotna crash, the flames took 10 minutes to extinguish and initially kept firefighters from reaching the wreckage, according to authorities. The de Havilland is similar to an Otter that crashed in Alaska in 2010, killing former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens and four others, Johnson said. The plane in the Stevens crash was equipped with floats, while the plane in Sunday's crash had wheels. It's possible to drive from Anchorage to Soldotna, but it's about a four-hour trip as the highway hugs Turnagain Arm, then cuts through a mountain pass. Soldotna, with a population of about 4,300, is on the banks of the Kenai River, and the area is busy this time of the year with people fishing for salmon. The airport is located about a mile from a commercial area and has a paved runway that is 5,000 feet long. What happened?

Other celebrities who have opted for older names include Lily Allen, who named her children Ethel and Marnie, Bruce Willis – who chose Mabel for his daughter – and singer Dido who decided to call her young son Stanley. The poll of 6,227 by parenting site Netmums.com also revealed that one in eight families give all their children names beginning with the same letter, like Wayne Rooney’s sons Kai and Klay. The trend, which was inspired by Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, is most commonly used with J and K names.

Almost 15 per cent of parents claimed they had picked an unusual name as they felt normal names were ‘dull and overused’ while 4 per cent hoped it would ‘make their child stand out’. But names are becoming a parental battleground, with one in 20 mums seeing a name they had selected ‘stolen’ by a friend – forcing three in five to change their minds.

Pret a Manger has been named the worst of the high street coffee shops in a test that suggested its coffee tastes ‘thin’ with hints of burnt charcoal. The damning verdict will be bad news for the successful chain, which makes much of its claims to be an ethical retailer using the finest natural ingredients. Consumer champion Which? brought in Giles Hilton, a tea and coffee merchant with Whittard of Chelsea, to carry out a snapshot taste test of coffee from Pret, Costa, Starbucks, Caffe Nero and the cafes at Marks & Spencer. Bad news: Pret a Manger has been named the worst of the high street coffee shops in a test that suggested its coffee tastes 'thin' with hints of burnt charcoal . He bought both a simple black Americano in each outlet and a cappuccino, which is the nation’s favourite lunchtime coffee shop choice. The Pret Americano was the cheapest at £1.70, but it did not represent value for money in Mr Hilton’s test. ‘It’s the cheapest, but Pret’s tasted plain thin, with too much water and it smelt of burnt charcoal,’ he said. Pret uses only a single shot of espresso in its drinks, while most of its rivals have shifted to a stronger two-shot formula as standard. Its cappuccino was also cheapest at £2.10, but again failed the taste test. ‘This was served with too much milk, which was over-heated by the steamer – this makes the milk taste caramelised,’ said Mr Hilton. Damning: The verdict will be bad news for the successful chain. A Pret A Manger store in London is pictured . Success: The most expensive of the chains, Caffe Nero, topped both categories . Profits at Pret soared by 17 per cent . last year, but it has come under fire for its reliance on cheap young . foreigners to man its tills.

Mr Hilton said he loved the ‘body and density’ of its Americano, which had a good depth of taste. Pret played down the significance of the test. A spokesman said: ‘Pret appreciates all feedback. 'Our coffee is organic, Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance and we take enormous trouble blending and roasting.

The Queen was born by Caesarean section in her maternal grandparents’ London home in April 1926. At the time, she was third in line to the throne, but her weight was not announced. The average weight of a baby born close to its due date is around 8lb 2.5oz (3.7 kilos), but Kate was overdue. Judith Rowbotham, a social historian at Nottingham Trent University, said that in the past, birth weights of monarchs were not revealed. The newest member of the Royal Family, however, will have the details of his arrival pored over by a worldwide audience. She said the baby prince was a ‘respectable weight’ and added: ‘It’s not champion or a 9lb or 10lb, which would be eyebrow-raising.’ ‘What it certainly shows is that this is a baby of healthy parents. He’s definitely got more weight than his father and grandfather did. ‘I doubt we were told the birth weights of previous monarchs. ‘I’m pretty certain we weren’t for George V and George VI. That kind of information would have been seen as very private detail. ‘Before, it was enough to know that the child was born alive and healthy. After that, the bulletins would go very quiet.’ Prince Harry weighed 6lb 14oz when he was born in 1984. William’s cousin, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor, was born prematurely weighing 4lb 9oz in 2004, while Louise’s brother Viscount Severn, arrived in 2007 weighing 6lb 2oz. The Queen’s first great-grandchild Savannah Phillips was just slightly heavier than William and Kate’s new baby son and arrived weighing 8lb 8oz in December 2010. The monarch’s second great-grandchild Isla Phillips, born In March last year, weighed 7lb 4oz. The Prince of Cambridge’s birthweight falls within the current healthy range of six to nine pounds – and is close to perfect given the extra time in the womb and the inheritance factor of tall, healthy parents. The average weight of newborn babies is 7lb 8ozs, with lighter babies being classified small for gestational age (SGA) or of low birthweight. Babies classified as large for gestational age (LGA) weigh more than expected compared with the time spent in the womb, around nine pounds and over, according to fetal growth charts. The new arrival’s weight will be satisfying for both parents and doctors, and is probably slightly more than expected because he was overdue. Larger than normal babies are not only difficult to deliver but may herald health problems in later life. Scientific evidence suggests they may be more prone to obesity, diabetes and heart problems when they grow up. Similarly, . although small babies are easy to deliver there may be developmental . problems linked to size as countless studies on premature babies have . shown. The growth of . the new Royal will have been closely monitored by scans throughout . Kate’s pregnancy, because failure to thrive in the womb rings alarm . bells, suggesting the placenta is not working properly. Andrew . Shennan, professor of obstetrics at St Thomas’ Hospital, London and . adviser to Tommy’s baby charity, said the newborn’s weight was ‘spot-on . normal’. Facts and figures: Royal aide Ed Perkins leaves St Mary's hospital with the official announcement that the Cambridges' son has been born and the essential details of the bouncing boy . Another healthy boy: Prince William weighed in 7lb 1.5oz at when he was born in 1982 (pictured in the arms of his mother Princess Diana and Prince Charles) He said: ‘We take into account the ethnicity of the mother, her height and weight and whether it is the first-born – they tend to be a little smaller than children born subsequently. 'This child is well within the normal range for birthweight that we would hope to see.’ As a summer-born baby, however, the newest royal will be one of the youngest in his class, which could put him at a disadvantage early on. A July birthday will mean that the new Prince of Cambridge will start school not long after he turns four. Summer-born pupils tend to battle with confidence in their academic abilities. However, they are also said to have a strong belief in controlling their own destiny –  not be surprising for a child who will learn early on in his life that he will one day become King.","Prince William weighed 7lb 1.5oz and Prince of Wales was 7lb 6oz at birth .

Kaitlyn Hunt, the 19-year-old Florida teen accused of having a sexual relationship with her underage girlfriend, is back in jail after it emerged they allegedly had sex just weeks ago. The teenager was booked into the Indian River County Jail at 9pm Monday after she was brought in by a representative from the bail/bond company that posted her bail, the sheriff's office said. Sgt.Thomas Raulen, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told WPTV that Hunt's return to jail was not a result of judicial action but carried out at the discretion of the bail/bond agent. A judge could today decide to keep Hunt behind bars for allegedly violating the terms of her pre-trial release after it emerged last week that she had remained in touch with the girl by allegedly slipping her an iPod and exchanging more than 20,000 text messages following her arrest in February. Behind bars: Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, who 'had sex with her underage girlfriend', has returned to jail in Florida . After the new details emerged, . prosecutors withdrew a plea deal that would have seen Hunt avoid prison . time but register as a sex offender. Now she faces the possibility of . having to do both. The case . has garnered national attention as the teenager's supporters have . claimed that the younger girl's parents only contacted police about the . relationship because Hunt is gay. She was charged with two counts of . lewd and lascivious battery in February and jailed before posting . $5,000. She was banned from contacting the younger girl, whom she had . met at high school. Under . Florida law, even if the relationship was consensual, it is illegal for . anyone over the age of 18 to have sexual relations with anyone under . that age. At the time of their relationship, Hunt was 18. In jail: Hunt, who met the underage girl as they attended the same high school, faces up to 15 years in jail . Court documents accuse Hunt of 'covertly . contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to . the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it. Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the plea deal when renewed accusations broke. The new evidence indicates Hunt and the . girl, until recently, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day . at Sebastian River High School in March. Court . documents claim that the teens exchanged thousands of texts since . March. Hunt also allegedly sent more than 25 lewd photos of herself . which show her nude or 'masturbating while moaning'. They . also allege that Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith, may have helped her . daughter cover her tracks by messaging the girl, urging her to delete . all trace of their contact. Revoked: Hunt, pictured in court earlier this month, had a plea deal on the . table until investigators accused her of violating her bond terms with . continued contact with her 14-year-old lover . Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded 20,000 text messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt . According to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend told detectives about the continued illicit contact and how Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact.' 'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told . the girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in . communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.' 'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.' On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship. 'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you . snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.' The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.' New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . Massive push: A 'Free Kate' Facebook page has generated more than 35,000 followers so far, and an online petition urging that the charges be dropped already has nearly 120,000 signatures . The . defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court . documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith . tried to help her daughter cover her tracks. 'Delete . EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete . everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing. 'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.' To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.' Ms. Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents . make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest . revelations. Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July . Defending his daughter: Steven Hunt (right) insists that his 19-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn (left), is being targeted . by prosecutors for dating a 14-year-old classmate because she is . lesbian . 'It is . apparent that the conduct of both the defendant and Kelley Hunt Smith is . severely threatening the integrity of the judicial process,' read the . documents. The younger girl's parents have remained adamant that Hunt should be prosecuted as a sex offender. The . glut of publicity included interviews in where her parents claimed . their daughter was only charged because she is gay. As of May, 300,000 . people had signed an online petition to have the charges against the . teenager dropped. If she goes to trial, she faces 15 years in prison if convicted on the two original charges of lewd or lascivious battery alone. She is now likely to face additional charges for breaking the terms of her bond. Thousands have signed petitions in . support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged . with lascivious battery of a minor. But while she and her parents gave . national interviews maintaining her consensual relationship was . innocent, Hunt was breaking court orders that she stay away from her . 14-year-old girlfriend and could now lose a plea deal offer and face . additional felony charges. According to the documents: . February 17, 2013: A Vero Beach court gives 'no contact' order banning Hunt from 'direct or indirect' contact with the girl . March 1: .

These powerful supercars, which go from zero to 60mph in 3.7 seconds and can reach 205mph, are designed to turn heads. But this one is a real attention-seeker: its bodywork has been wrapped in black velvet.Perhaps you could call it a Furrari. As a statement of untrammelled wealth, this motor takes some beating. Normal 599s start at £212,000, but customised versions cost hundreds of thousands more. And when that black velvet gets spattered with dirt or mud, you can’t take it to a car-wash. Instead, every inch needs to be shampooed and hand-brushed by a team of flunkies. Scroll down for video . Ramadan racer: This Ferrari is bound to grab attention with its velvet-covered roof . Touchy-feely: Passers-by in a posh part of London were stunned when they saw a 205mph Ferrari which had been wrapped in velvet . But for the Middle Eastern owner seen helping his leggy girlfriend and her luxury shopping bags into the passenger seat this week, the motor, with its customised vehicular dinner jacket, is exactly what he needs to keep up with the Joneses. In recent years, around the time of Wimbledon, Royal Ascot, and the Lord’s Test, the streets of Central London have played host to an extremely modern addition to the time-honoured calendar of the summer social season. To those in the know, it’s called the ‘Ramadan Rush’. In the weeks before and after the Muslim holy month of fasting, which this year begins on Tuesday, thousands of young and spectacularly wealthy residents of oil-rich Gulf states flock to our capital, seeking an escape from the oppressive heat and (whisper it quietly) conservative laws and social customs of their home countries. And unlike other holidaymakers, they don’t turn up with a couple of suitcases and a carrier bag full of duty free. Instead, the glamorous ‘Gulfies’ charter entire cargo jets to fly over their collection of customised supercars. Costly: A £1 million Qatari registered Pagani Huayra and an orange Lamborghini . Shimmering: A £2 million Bugatti Veron car that has been flown over to London by rich Arabs who spend June in London shopping ahead of Ramadan . Speedster: A £1 million Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport . This weekend the streets around the luxury hotels of Park Lane and the posh shops of Knightsbridge will be clogged with bespoke Lamborghinis, Bugattis, and McLarens, along with rarer brands of high-octane sports cars with names such as Koenigsegg, Pagani and Saleen. You can spot the Ramadan Rushers from their overseas number-plates, often in Arabic. Most come from Qatar, Dubai, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and are in the UK for just a few weeks at a time (any foreign vehicle in Britain for longer than six months must be registered with the DVLA in Swansea, and carry British plates). Their arrival draws supercar enthusiasts from across Britain and Europe, along with a tribe of photographers and videographers known as the ‘Carparrazzi’, who run websites carrying footage of the most outrageously-designed vehicles. Among the extraordinary cars catching the Carparrazzi’s eyes this year has been a customised blue-and-white Bugatti Veyron from Saudi Arabia worth an estimated £1.6 million and known by the nickname L’Or Blanc, or White Gold. The ostentatious 250mph vehicle, which was also in London last year, has bodywork inlaid with delicate, highly polished white porcelain. Watch for the ticket! A Dubai registered Bugatti Veyron, the fastest and most expensive production car in the world . Another world: A £1.6 million Saudi-registered Bugatti Veyron L'or Blanc . Take your pick: Two Qatar-registered Hamann-tuned BMWs with a Lamborghini Aventador sandwiched in the middle . Also making waves is a Pagani Huarya which is believed to be owned by a twentysomething member of Qatar’s ruling Al-Thani family. The vehicle, which retails for £880,000, is one of a small fleet imported this year by the Al-Thanis, whose affection for London appears to be un-dented by a headline-making incident three years ago when their turquoise Lamborghini and a Koenigsegg were clamped outside Harrods. Yet the Arab invasion isn’t good news for everyone. As the Ramadan Rush has grown in popularity, so too have tensions between the Rushers and locals. The problem is noise. Specifically the sheer volume of the roar that visiting supercars make on quiet backstreets — day and night. ‘Even when they are stationary, revving their engines, we get woken up,’ complained Panda Morgan-Thomas, the chairman of the Knightsbridge Residents Association, when we spoke yesterday. ‘Last night I was woken at 3am. I get inundated with complaints from neighbours at this time of year. It’s difficult to live a normal life when you are deprived of sleep for weeks on end.’ Residents are also concerned by the allegedly dangerous manner in which many ‘Gulfies’ drive. YouTube contains clips of, among other things, a Lamborghini Aventador performing a full-throttle ‘power slide’ at speeds of around 80mph, around the corner of a leafy Belgravia street last year. In 2010, another car, also a Lamborghini, wrecked four parked cars in Lowdnes Square, Knightsbridge, after spinning out of control. Its driver and passenger, both from Abu Dhabi, were arrested. ‘At some point,’ adds Morgan-Thomas, ‘someone is going to get seriously hurt.’ Hey big spender: A £500,000 Qatari-registered Mercedes McLaren SLR 'Mansory Renovation' Colourful: A Lamborghini Aventador, which was seized on Wilton Place in Knightsbridge by police for being driven illegally without insurance . Concern over noise and dangerous driving by Arab visitors inspired the Channel 4 documentary Millionaire Boy Racers earlier this year. It raised an interesting conundrum: for while Gulfies provoke criticism, they are increasingly important to London’s economy. During the Ramadan Rush, roughly 80 per cent of guests at London’s top hotels are from Arab states. They are crucial to the restaurant and nightclub trade, and make a huge contribution to the bottom line of high-end retailers. Figures from the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue suggest they spend an  average of £1,000 per transaction, more than visitors from any other region. Yet no one, however wealthy, is above the law. In response to complaints, the Metropolitan Police tells me that officers are instructed to ensure overseas vehicles are insured and carry legal number plates. The policy made the news on Tuesday when a purple Aventador from Qatar — which boasted glow-in-the-dark orange stripes inspired by the film Tron — was seized in Wilton Place, Knightsbridge, after it was being driven illegally without insurance. It spent 24 hours outside New Scotland Yard, before being returned to its owner, who had presumably paid a hefty fine. By Thursday night, the vehicle was parked outside a bar in Mayfair. This time, it got a £120 parking ticket. But to its lucky owner, that’s small change. Green with envy? A Qatari-registered £350,000 Lamborghini Aventador .

'Like Father, Like Son': Anton Ferdinand posted a picture of the cover of The Game's song on Twitter . Footballer Anton Ferdinand has joked about the racism charge faced by John Terry’s father, by saying that he was listening to a rap song called 'Like Father, Like Son'. The 28-year-old Queens Park Rangers defender posted a picture of the cover of The Game’s song on Twitter and told his 340,000 followers: ‘Don't you just love it when your music is on shuffle #nowplaying’. Ted Terry, 59, was arrested earlier this year after a scuffle on Fenchurch Street in central London, before being charged with two racially motivated offences on Tuesday when he answered bail. The tweet was posted by Ferdinand on Tuesday at about 9pm, within hours of the news breaking. Ferdinand accused former England captain John Terry of racially abusing him during a match at Loftus Road in October 2011. Terry denied this and was cleared of the charge on a criminal standard of proof in a law court. The verdict last year brought to an end a long saga which saw Chelsea defender Terry stripped of the national captaincy and England manager Fabio Capello resign in protest. He was eventually banned for four games and fined £220,000 by the Football Association, which found against him under a lower burden of proof of racially abusing Ferdinand. This was decided on the balance of probabilities, rather than beyond reasonable doubt, which was the measure used in the criminal courts. The offences Ted Terry answered bail to this week are a common assault and a public order offence. Two other men, Tudor Musteata, 47, and Stephen Niland, 36, were also charged following the fracas at 8pm on March 22.

He was later cleared of four charges, including affray and wounding with intent. John Terry and Chelsea team-mates were also accused of drunkenly mocking American tourists following the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001.

Police said Abeyta was being held for investigation of charges including murder. The wounded woman was reported to be Abeyta's estranged spouse, according to KDVR. Campbell . said on the day of the killing, he was on his way to his sister's . house for a visit, but became struck in a traffic jam. He never got to see Roskilly . alive again. ‘In my mind, I just wish I had been there a little sooner. But, again, you never know,’ Campbell said. The incident started at 10.40am Friday in the Harvey Park neighborhood in the 2200 block of South Irving, when police said Abeyta shot dead Roskilly after wounding his wife. Good Samaritan: Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, said he believes his sister died trying to protect her neighbor from her husband . Officers who responded to the scene spotted a man, who then fired a shot at propane tanks set up in the middle of the street with gunpowder on top. The maeksehift device 'activated,' but no ibe was one injured. One of the officers then shot Abeyta in the chest. Police said the man was in critical condition, while his wife was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the leg. Before he was shot, Abeyta was seen walking with his weapons. Police alerted residents to stay inside and a high school was put on lockdown. Abeyta was shot within about a half hour of that warning. Police didn't immediately say whether Abeyta lived in the neighborhood, but Melissa Allen told The Denver Post that he has lived in the area at least since she moved in three years ago. She said he lived in a house with his wife and two children, who are in elementary school. Allen said she and her children saw him walk down the street Friday. Abeyta, an Army veteran allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has had multiple run-ins with the law over the years. In 2007, he was arrested on charges of felony menacing with a deadly weapon and felony child abuse. Court documents cited by ABC2News state that Abeyta's wife took out a restraining order against him and the couple filed for divorce, but it was never finalized. According to Roskilly's long-time friend, Daniel Markin, she and Abeyta had been in conflict in the past. War of roses: A friend said that Abeyta was upset that Roskilly's rose bushes were encroaching on his property . Strong-willed: Roskilly recently celebrated a major millstone after losing 220lbs in a single year . Markin explained to The Denver Channel that the 31-year-old man was upset that his neighbor's rose bushes were encroaching on his property. ‘Daniel was pretty much trying to get Sandy out of her house anyway he could,’ Markin said. Loved ones described Roskilly as a loving and generous woman who would do anything for others. Earlier this month, the 47-year-old celebrated a major milestone in her life, according to 9News. After struggling with obesity for years, Roskilly managed to shed 220lbs in just one year. On Facebook, Roskilly joyfully boasted about her weight loss. On August 5, she wrote: 'I'm getting so close to my goal of 160 Lb. that it scars [sic]me so time not jokin im now 199lb.'","Shooter Daniel Abeyta had homemade bombs made from gunpowder-laced propane tanks .

Police are investigating whether NFL star Aaron Hernandez shot dead a semi-pro football player in June because he knew about a double murder the disgraced New England Patriots player is suspected of committing, it was claimed Sunday. Hernandez is currently awaiting trial, charged with murdering Odin Lloyd in an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts, on June 18. Numerous reports indicate that police now suspect Hernandez could also be responsible for the deaths of two immigrants from Cape Verde in Boston in July 2012. He has not been charged in that case. Charged: Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez is currently in jail awaiting trial on charges that he murdered a semi-pro football player . Odin Lloyd, 27, was shot five times less than a mile from Hernandez's home . The Boston Globe reported Sunday that a police source said Lloyd could have been killed because he had knowledge of the double-slaying. Prosecutors have not commented publicly on the motive behind the murder of Lloyd, a 27-year-old player for the semi-professional Boston Bandits. Previous reports from Boston TV stations have quoted law enforcement sources as saying that Lloyd was killed for 'talking to the wrong people' while he was out with Hernandez at a club the night prior to his death. Hernandez, 23, has pleaded not guilty and professed his innocence from his jail cell. He has hired a high-powered defense lawyer to fight the charges. Last year, the New England Patriots signed the tight end to a four-year, $40million contract. When he was charged, the team dropped him. Within a week of Hernandez's arrest in Odin's shooting, reports began to emerge that police were also investigating his involvement in the 2012 double-murder. Court records revealed that an SUV registered to Hernandez, which police believe was seen fleeing the scene of the shooting, was recovered at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol, Connecticut. According to Boston police, Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, were shot outside a Boston club when a passing SUV fired several shots into their car. The club shooting case is now in front of a grand jury, which will determine whether there is enough evidence to file charges. An SUV registered to to Hernandez was seized by police investigating a 2012 double murder. It was found at the football player's uncle's home in Bristol, Connecticut . The Globe report provides a detailed view of Hernandez's ties to his hometown of Bristol and other allegations leading up to his arrest for murder. The newspaper suggests that Hernandez was largely on the straight and narrow - finished high school at age 17 and an honor student before moving on to the University of Florida - before the death of his father. Dennis Hernandez loomed huge in the life of his son Aaron and ensured his nose stayed in the books and his feet stayed on the field and off the street. When Mr Hernandez died during routine surgery in 2006, Hernandez went into free fall. The Globe claims that it was then that Hernandez began using drugs and surrounding himself with rough characters from Bristol, including ex-cons.","Aaron Hernandez, 23, charged with murdering Odin Lloyd on June 18 .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:48 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:07 EST, 19 August 2013 . Californian prisons will be allowed to force-feed hunger striking inmates, a federal judge ordered today. U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson approved a request from state and federal officials concerned about the welfare of nearly 70 . hunger-striking inmates who have refused all prison-issued meals for seven weeks. Standard prison policy is to let inmates starve to death if they have signed legally binding do-not-resuscitate (DNR) requests. Striking: Arturo Castellanos is one of four gang leaders who have signed letters on behalf of hunger strikers, all serving life sentences for murder . Confronting: Rapper Mos Def rapper Mos Def pretended he was being force fed by nasal tubes in a violent video . Prison officials already can seek a court order forcing an individual inmate to take food, though they have not done so. But now, state corrections officials and a . federal receiver who controls inmate medical care have received blanket . authority to . feed inmates who may be in failing health. The order includes those who recently signed requests that they not be revived. The Prison Law Office, a Berkeley-based . nonprofit that represents inmates' welfare in ongoing lawsuits that led . to a federal takeover of the prison health care system and a requirement . that the state sharply reduce its inmate population to improve . conditions, also joined in the request. The filing came as prison officials and inmates' attorneys argued over whether strikers should be allowed to voluntarily begin a liquid diet. 'Patients have a right to refuse medical treatment. They also have a right to refuse food,' said Joyce Hayhoe, a spokeswoman for the receiver's office. 'If an inmate gets to the point where he can't tell us what his wishes are, for instance if he's found unresponsive in his cell, and we don't have a DNR, we're going to get nourishment into him. That's what doctors do. They're going to follow their medical ethics. 'We'd take any and all measures to sustain their life.' The process, which prison officials call 'refeeding', could include starting intravenous fluids or snaking feeding tubes through inmates' noses and into their stomachs. Order: U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson of San Francisco ordered Californian prisons can force-feed inmates if necessary . Under the new system, DNR orders signed by a hunger striker at or near the beginning of the strike or during the hunger strike would automatically be deemed invalid. However Jules Lobel, president of the Center for . Constitutional Rights, who represents 10 inmates suing to end prolonged . solitary confinement at Pelican Bay State Prison, said the decision violates international law. 'Force-feeding violates international law to the extent that it involves somebody who doesn't give their consent,' he said . Lobel said prison officials should look for alternatives, including providing the inmates with a liquid diet of fruit and vegetable drinks as they have requested, or negotiating with inmates over their demands. Prison officers in California will be allowed to force-feed inmates, including at Sacramento State Prison, pictured . Lobel said he will not seek to overturn Henderson's order. Prison officials said inmates are free to consume a liquid diet, but will be counted as having ended their hunger strike if they consume anything more than water, vitamins and electrolytes. The most high-profile case of force-feeding prisoners has been the involuntary feeding of several dozen terrorism suspects held at Guantanamo Bay through nasal tubes. Other federal judges have turned down bids by the Guantanamo Bay inmates to stop the force-feeding. U.S. District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer said in a ruling last month that numerous courts said it is the government's duty to prevent suicide and to provide life-saving nutritional and medical care to people in custody. California incarcerates about 3,600 inmates in what are known as Security Housing Units, some because of crimes they committed in prison and others for indefinite terms if they are validated as leaders of prison gangs. Four prisons have the units: Pelican Bay in Crescent City, Corcoran, California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi and California State Prison-Sacramento. The highest-ranking gang leaders are held in what is known as the 'short corridor' at Pelican Bay. Four leaders of rival white supremacist, black and enemy Latino gangs have formed an alliance to promote the hunger strike in a bid to force an end to the isolation units.","Judge allows Californian prisons to force-feed inmates .

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:49 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 19 August 2013 . For much of the nine years that Shane Salerno worked on his J.D. Salinger documentary and book, the project was a mystery worthy of the author himself. Code names. Hidden identities. Surveillance cameras. Until 2010, when The Catcher In the Rye novelist died at age 91, only a handful of people were fully aware of what he was up to. Even now, with the release date of the film Salinger less than three weeks away, little is known about a production that draws upon more than 100 interviews and a trove of documents and rare photographs, and that promises many revelations about an author who still fascinates millions. ‘I have worked more than 200 documentaries in my career and Salinger was the most secretive and the most intense film I have ever worked on,’ said Buddy Squires, the film's cinematographer and co-producer who has worked on such Ken Burns documentaries as Jazz and The Central Park Five. Scroll down for video... Mysterious: Famously secretive author of The Catcher in the Rye J.D. Salinger left the public eye in his later years and much speculation revolves around what he did with himself in the decades before his 2010 death . ‘This film was not run like a film production,’ said Jeffrey Doe, a co-editor and co-producer. ‘It was run like a CIA operation. Everything was compartmentalized, top secret and on a need-to-know basis. It was really intense.’ More than three years after Salinger's death at his New Hampshire home, numerous questions remain unanswered, notably what – or if – he wrote during the self-imposed retirement of his final decades. The new Salinger book and movie are not the first projects ever billed as cracking the Salinger code, and the author's literary estate did not participate. But Salerno has won some important converts. The Weinstein Company quickly signed up the movie after seeing it earlier this year, as did PBS, which reportedly paid seven figures and will air the documentary in January as the 200th installment of its ‘American Masters’ series. Simon & Schuster reportedly paid seven figures for the book, which runs 700 pages and was co-authored by Salerno and David Shields. Revelations? An undated photo shows Salinger near his New Hampshire home with his New Yorker editor's wife Emily Maxwell. Rumors are swirling that the new film will reveal previously unknown details about the writer . The film, which opens September 6, is expected to be shown on more than 200 screens nationwide, a high number for a documentary. The book's planned first printing is for more than 100,000 copies. Salerno, 40, is best known as a screenwriter, with credits that include ‘Savages’ and a planned sequel for ‘Avatar.’ Salerno, who declined to be interviewed, reportedly spent some $2 million of his own money for the project and traveled around the country and in Europe to research it. As if internalizing the Salinger legend, he made secrecy not just a priority, but an obsession. Virtually everyone involved had to sign non-disclosure agreements, including Shields, Doe and Squires, and even Squires' wife. At Technicolor, where post production took place, the film was called ‘Project Y’ and stored in a vault, as if in homage to the vault where Salinger allegedly stored unpublished manuscripts. The Technicolor vault was kept in a room under the watch of seven surveillance cameras. Recluse: Pictured is the Cornish, New Hampshire home of the reclusive writer. He died here in 2010 . Lock and key: Salinger reads from his classic novel The Catcher in the Rye in this 1952 photo. Like the writer, the documentary's filmmakers worked in total secrecy for fear of internet leaks and of alienating their informants . The film's ending was added just in the past few days. ‘Everything was on a very strict `need to know' basis and the only person who knew everything by design was Shane,’ Squires said. ‘Crew members knew about their part and not other parts of the film. Some crew members brought on for a particular sequence walked away thinking they made a film about World War II or 1940s Hollywood or Charlie Chaplin. Promotion: The poster for Shane Salerno's documentary film Salinger mimics a paperback copy of one of the author's books, with all their requisite plainness . ‘This was the first film in my career,’ he added, ‘where I checked into hotels under a fake name.’ There have been reasons all along to value secrecy. The Salinger crew worried that early publicity would make some interview subjects reluctant to talk. They also cited the example of the Michael Moore documentary ‘Sicko,’ which leaked online in advance of its release. For Salinger, emails were often sent under fake headers and online correspondence in general was minimized. Whether working on the book with Shields, or recruiting associates for the film, Salerno preferred handling business in person. ‘When Shane first called to hire me, . he did not tell me the subject matter of the film. He just said `If I . get you a plane ticket, will you come to Los Angeles to talk with me . about a film project?'‘ Squires said. ‘After I arrived in Los Angeles . and signed a phone book size confidentiality agreement, Shane revealed . to me that he was underway with a film about J.D. Salinger.’ ‘For years I couldn't tell anyone what I was working on,’ Doe said. ‘It wasn't just friends. My own family didn't know!’ Access . was restricted even for the movie's soundtrack composer, Lorne Balfe, . who won a Grammy for his score for ‘The Dark Knight.’ In liner notes he . wrote for the Salinger soundtrack CD, Balfe recalled that his job was . ‘very complicated’ in part because he had to score many scenes he was . not permitted to see. Once . press screenings begin for Salinger, and copies of the books are . shipped to stores, keeping all the secrets could prove highly . challenging, especially in the age of Twitter. Weinstein publicity head . Dani Weinstein (no relation to company founders Bob and Harvey . Weinstein) said journalists seeing the movie will be asked to sign an . embargo agreement. Jonathan Karp, who heads Simon & Schuster's . flagship imprint, said the publisher was taking ‘extraordinary measures’ to ensure early copies were not sold or obtained. No advance editions . will be sent to the media and stores will be required to sign agreements . not to sell the book before its Sept. 3 release date. But publishing embargos have rarely held, even for such highly restricted releases as the final ‘Harry Potter’ book and Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, a Simon & Schuster release. Karp acknowledged that he had doubts over how long the Salinger book would remain unseen, saying that it could well become public a few days early.","The secrets will finally come out when the film by Savages writer Shane Salerno is released September 6 .

The fork of lightning struck a major bank of transformers at the Rector Station, just outside Visalia on Road 148 and Caldwell, causing it to burst into flames. Firefighters battled for an hour to control the blaze but thousands of homes were without power last night and for many, it will not be restored until this evening, according to ABC30.

Southern California Edison (SCE) said in a statement damage to its facilities from the storms was 'significant' and it was working to quickly restore power to homes in the area. The company also warned that more scattered thunderstorms were expected to continue for a few days. Violent thunder storms were experienced across many parts of California yesterday, as the hot weather continued. Giant forks of lightning were captured striking the ground close to Barstow, about 250 miles south east of Visalia, and San Francisco was also lit up by electrical storms overnight. Inferno: It took an hour for firemen to bring the blaze at the electricity substation under control, after lightning struck yesterday cutting power to 120,000 customers . Nearly 4,000 additional homes and businesses lost power in the Barstow area, according to local news service, The Sun. The lightning also caused more than a dozen small brush fires in the San Bernardino Mountains, in and around the arid San Bernardino County, close to Barstow, which is around 150 miles north east of LA. SCE said it received reports of additional power outages in San Bernardino, Cedarpines Park, Lake Arrowhead, Fort Irwin, Perris, Lake Elsinore and other areas due to the lightning. The local forecast for Visalia is for hot sunny weather, with temperatures reaching 39C (102F) today and tomorrow. The forecast is for thunderstorms today, but not tomorrow. SCE spokesman David Songg, told local media: 'The storm weather pattern is expected to continue for the next few days.'

Former Morgan State student, Alexander Kinyua, 22, entered the plea for the first-degree murder of Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, whose body parts were discovered four days after he vanished last year. Agyei-Kodie, 37, had recently moved from Ghana and was staying with Kinyua's family in Joppatown, a suburb of Baltimore when he was attacked. Kinyua spoke softly as he responded to questions from the judge in Bel Air, Maryland on Monday, saying he had agreed to the plea and that medications he had been taking were helping him. Killing: Alexander Kinyua, left, has pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible in the first-degree murder of Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, right, who he stabbed to death and dismembered in May 2012 . Judge Stephen Waldron said he had concerns about agreeing to the plea, but had to accept determinations by psychiatrists for the defense and prosecution that Kinyua could not be held criminally responsible. He expressed condolences to family and friends of the Agyei-Kodie. 'My heart breaks for you,' Waldron said. 'I am very, very sorry.' Kinyua, whose father is a physics professor at Morgan State, has been held at the state's maximum-security psychiatric hospital and returned there after the hearing. It is likely he will remain there for the rest of his life. Percess Veronica Mattison, a longtime family friend who knew Agyei-Kodie, revealed how devastated the victim's family are as she spoke to the court. Horror: Some of the victim's body parts were found in a dumpster in a church parking lot, pictured . Scene: The house in Joppatowne, Maryland, where he killed Agyei-Kodie before eating his heart and brains . 'We all could see him soaring to great heights in the world. This was not to be,' Mattison said. 'He was slaughtered in the most brutal, inhumane fashion by Alexander Kinyua. This is an irreplaceable loss accompanied by much pain.' Murderer: Kinyua, originally from Kenya, ranted about human sacrifices on Facebook before the killing . She also noted that Kinyua carefully tried to conceal evidence. 'Someone acting with such care to conceal evidence, and demonstrating the capacity to cover his tracks so competently does not appear to be experiencing a mental deficiency,' Mattison said. 'Alexander did not impulsively commit the crime, he prepared Kujoe for consumption.' Harford County State's Attorney Joseph Cassilly told reporters after the hearing he had concerns about the planning before and after the crime. 'But we went out and consulted with another psychiatrist that we'd used in other cases, had him review this evidence, and we really had no evidence, no testimony or opinion from other medical personnel that would dispute the findings of the doctors at Clifton Perkins that he was not criminally responsible at the time he committed the crime,' Cassilly said. Kinyua, a U.S. citizen originally from Kenya, told detectives that he killed Agyei-Kodie with an axe while he was sleeping. He also said he dismembered the body, consuming his heart, hiding his head and hands at the home and placing the remaining body parts in a trash bin in a nearby church parking lot. Agyei-Kodie, a native of Ghana, had been staying with the Kinyua family for about six weeks at their townhouse in a Baltimore suburb when he disappeared in May 2012.

Horrified, Jarrod Kinyua brought his . father down to the basement where Antony said he saw Alexander Kinyu . cleaning out the containers. Kinyua then directed police to Towne Baptist Church on Trimble Road, where they said they found the rest of Agyei-Kodie’s remains. Authorities say Kinyua ranted about 'human sacrifices' and ethnic cleansing on Facebook before the slaying. In a separate case, Kinyua pleaded guilty but not criminally responsible in a baseball bat attack at Morgan State days before the killing of Agyei-Kodie. First victim: He also allegedly attacked Joshua Ceasar in the days before he killed his roommate . The victim, who has been left partially blind, is now suing Morgan State University saying they knew Kinyua was a danger to others and they did nothing to stop him. In the weeks and months leading up to . the first attack, Kinyua had been caught punching out walls at the ROTC . office and writing satanic rants on Facebook. One of his own ROTC instructors even told police after the fact that he was a 'Virginia Tech waiting to happen', in a reference to the 2007 shooting massacre that left 37 people dead.","Alexander Kinyua hacked Kujoe Bonsafo Aygei-Kodie, 37, to death as he slept before eating his heart and brain and hiding his body parts .

Two sources told ABC 10 News that Filner's attorneys were in a mediation session Monday morning with City Attorney Jan Goldsmith and Gloria Allred, who is representing some of the women who have made sexual harassment claims against Filner. A retired federal judge is reportedly presiding over the mediation, which includes a review of a potential resignation deal, according to the station's sources. 'The meeting was at an undisclosed location, but Team 10 discovered Filner entered 101 West Broadway Monday morning,' the station reported. 'Sources said the mayor was on the 15th floor, where the U.S. Attorneys office is located. However, it was not clear if that was where the mediation was to be held.' San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has returned to City Hall after undergoing an intensive two-week therapy program . Attorney Gloria Allred speaks as demonstrators gather to begin their recall campaign protest against San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's refusal to resign . The meeting was reportedly held as Filner was set to return to City Hall after undergoing a two-week program for behavioral counseling. Over the last month, 16 women - including a university dean and a retired Navy rear . admiral - have gone public with accusations that he sexually harassed . them. Many claim that he cornered them, groped them and slobbered them with kisses.

The protestors are also collecting signatures that they hope will lead . to the recall of Filner - they need to get more than 101,000 by September 26 . As . part of the recall effort, protesters - including attorney Gloria . Allred and some of the women accusing Filner - rallied at City Hall on . Sunday, Day 1 of the official recall effort. 'There is no excuse for abuse and there is no excuse for you to stay in power,' Allred told the crowd. She was joined by one of her clients, 67-year-old Peggy Shannon, a volunteer city worker who assists senior citizens and the latest person to accuse Filner of sexual harassment.

The video by U-T TV was criticized for making light of a serious situation. Before going into therapy, Filner asked voters to be patient while he gets help. ‘Before I even think of asking for forgiveness, I must demonstrate that my behavior has changed. And that will only happen over time and only if such incidents never, ever happen again,’ Filner said. He vowed when he returned that his ‘focus will be on making sure that I am doing right by the city in terms of being the best mayor I can be, and the best person I must be.’ Filner has agreed not to meet with women alone on city business and has delegated broad authority to a new interim chief operating officer, Walt Ekard, a highly regarded former county administrator.","Bob Filner's attorneys reportedly held a mediation meeting on Monday that included a review of resignation deal .

Widow: Eileen Battisti talks about a ruling . which has given her a new chance to win back her home as she sits on the . stairs in front of the house yesterday . A widow whose $280,000 home was seized and sold off over $6.30 in unpaid tax has won a court decision allowing her a fresh opportunity to argue she should not lose her home. Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court ruled it was a mistake for a Beaver County judge to rule against Eileen Battisti of Aliquippa, near Pittsburgh, without first holding an evidentiary hearing. 'This was particularly inappropriate because the outstanding liability was small and the value of the home was far greater than the amount paid by (the) purchaser,' wrote Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt. She said the state Supreme Court has 'emphasised that due process under both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions must be satisfied whenever the government subjects a citizen's property to forfeiture for nonpayment of taxes.' Mrs Battisti's lawyer says she still lives in her Aliquippa home, even though it was sold nearly two years ago to S.P. Lewis of Imperial for about $116,000. Messages seeking comment weren't returned yesterday by Mr Lewis and his lawyer, or by the Beaver County solicitor's office. Mrs Battisti bought the home outside Pittsburgh in 1999 with her husband, who managed their finances. After he died in 2004 she paid off the mortgange on the property with proceeds from his life insurance policy. The opinion by Judge Leavitt said Mrs Battisti had difficulty taking over the financial matters, in part because of a series of personal setbacks. She fell behind on various tax bills, but believed she had paid them all off, even though some were late. The $6.30 penalty was added to her tax bill in 2009, which grew with interests and costs to $235 by late 2011, when the home was sold at auction. She appealed the sale to county court, which ruled in May 2012 that she received all notices required by law.

An attorney for Mr Lewis offered to settle the dispute last year for $160,000 from Mrs Battisti. David Holland wrote in a court brief that Mrs Battisti did have notice of the tax sale, and that she made arguments in the appeal that legal procedures should not permit. Mrs Battisti's lawyer, Ed Santillan, said his client was elated by the court's decision yesterday. 'The facts are clear that she didn't receive adequate notice and there was a lot of intervening circumstances that the court should have taken into account,' Mr Santillan said.","Eileen Battisti's home was sold under her feet after it was seized by Pennsylvania tax authorities over the minuscule bill .

A wealthy hedge fund manager who used $113million of his clients' money to fund a life of luxury has been fined and banned from the finance industry for five years after agreeing to settle over the charges. Phil Falcone was famous for rising from a humble background and dramatically falling from grace in the wake of the financial crisis. His hedge fund, Harbinger Capital, once managed assets worth $26billion, although that has now fallen to a fraction of its former value. Ban: Phil Falcone has been barred from the finance industry for five years and fined $11.5million . The five-year ban brings an end to Falcone's controversial career as an asset manager, although he is still able to run non-financial companies. He is said to have borrowed clients' cash to pay for his estate on the Caribbean island of St Barts and a $10million renovation on one of his two Manhattan homes. The money allegedly kept the hockey team he owns in business and paid for the running of his private jet. And some was also reportedly used to finance wife Lisa’s film production company Everest Entertainment, which made the 2010 Samuel L. Jackson movie Mother and Child. The new settlement agreement comes after the SEC rejected an earlier proposal because it was too lenient, lacking any admission of wrongdoing or a full industry ban. Phil Falcone, pictured with his wife Lisa Marie, left, is accused of illegally using $113million of his company's money to maintain his life of luxury . 'Falcone and Harbinger engaged in . serious misconduct that harmed investors, and their admissions leave no . doubt that they violated the federal securities laws,' said Andrew . Ceresney of the SEC. 'Falcone . must now pay a heavy price for his misconduct by surrendering millions . of dollars and being barred from the hedge fund industry.' The . 51-year-old, who made a hugely successful bet against the subprime . mortgage market before racking up steep losses from a failed wireless . startup, said in a statement he was 'pleased' to reach a settlement. 'I believe putting these issues behind me now is the best course of action for me and our investors,' he said. To . settle the charges, Falcone will have to admit to the SEC charges, . paying around $11.5million in fines, while Harbinger will pay $6.5 . million. New York home: Phil Falcone is said to have borrowed the cash to pay for his estate on the Caribbean island of St Barts and a $10million renovation on one of his two Manhattan homes . The charges mark the latest step in the downfall of one of Wall Street's most colorful investors who has been profiled in Vanity Fair and a string of business magazines. Last year, He was named the 1,075th richest man in the world by Forbes magazine with a fortune of $1.1billion - but that was not enough to save him. The SEC complaint states that in 2009 Falcone ‘fraudulently’ borrowed the $113million from a $2.4billion fund operated by Harbinger to pay his personal tax bill. Ironically, the fund had banned anxious investors from taking their own cash out. Falcone is said to have kept his actions quiet for months until June 2010 when it became overwhelmed by investor demands for their money back, and an SEC investigation was begun. The complaint states that the same time Falcone ‘undertook significant personal expenditures’ including paying for his own personal security detail. Left to right: Joshua David, Lisa Maria Falcone, Edward Norton, Robert Hammond and Philip Falcone attend the First Party on the High Line at High Line Park on June 15, 2009 . There were ‘extensive’ renovations on his $49 million Upper East Side townhouse he had bought from former Penthouse publisher Bob Giuccione. He also had to maintain his $10million townhouse a few blocks away complete with Vietnamese potbellied pig which had been bought one Halloween as a present to his twin girls. The SEC however claims that it was not until it began investigating that Falcone finally got his financial affairs in order - and by then he had allegedly broken the law. Falcone, a father-of-two, was the son of a utility superintendent who came from a working class family in Chisholm, Minnesota, before he began his rise to riches. He was educated at Harvard and was a Varsity hockey player before entering finance and earning $1.7billion betting against sub-prime mortgages in 2007. Splurge: Falcone is said to have borrowed the cash to pay for his estate on the Caribbean island of St Barts and a $10million renovation on one of his two Manhattan homes . With the money he and his socialite wife Lisa Marie splashed out and lived a life few could dream of. He spent millions to become the minority owner of his beloved Minnesota Wild hockey team while she devoted herself to becoming a member of society New York and became famous for her designer clothes and penchant for Christian Louboutin heels. She became a board member of the New York City Ballet and paid $50,000 for a seat at the American Friends of Versailles Tour in 2007. In 2009 however, Lisa Marie put noses out of joint by storming on stage during the gala for the High Line park in which she seized the microphone and gave an impromptu announcement that she and Falcone would be giving $10million on top of the $1.4million they had pledged already. Falcone’s luck started to run out when his $3billion wireless network company LightSquared went into bankruptcy because regulators ruled it could not go forward as it would mess up GPS navigation systems.","Phil Falcone, 51, borrowed money from hedge fund clients to pay for renovating Manhattan home and buying a Caribbean estate .

Charges have been dismissed against a West Virginia man accused of torturing his wife, in part because the woman denied the allegations and refused to cooperate with prosecutors. On Monday, Stephanie Lizon had a joyful reunion with her husband, Peter, outside the Jackson County Courthouse in Ripley, holding their 4-day-old baby daughter in her arms. About a year ago, Mrs  Lizon fled from her husband and told domestic violence shelter workers she had been captive for the better part of a decade — beaten, burned and shackled. Happy couple: Peter and Stephanie Lizon stand with their newborn daughter outside the Jackson County Courthouse, in Ripley, West Virginia, after a judge dismissed charges of torture against Mr Lizon . The woman even claimed at one point that she had delivered a stillborn baby while she was being held captive. Peter Lizon, 40, was arrested and charged with malicious wounding and domestic battery. Jackson County Circuit Court Judge Thomas Evans tossed out those charges. Lizon's attorneys contended authorities waited too long to prosecute him and said the original prosecutor who brought the charges had a conflict of interest. ‘It feels good to have this hurdle behind us,’ Mr  Lizon said. ‘But we have a long way to be done with this.’ Mason County Prosecuting Attorney Craig Tatterson, who is serving as a special prosecutor, left open the possibility for future charges, saying the case was still under investigation. Tatterson also requested the charges be dropped, saying there wasn't enough evidence. In court documents, Tatterson said Stephanie Lizon denied the allegations against her husband and refused to cooperate. He also said the couple was the victim of an overzealous prosecution and unfounded stories by people who don't know them. The original prosecutor, Kennad Skeen, removed himself from the case last month due to a conflict of interest because he previously represented the Lizons in criminal and civil matters. 'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies . Last July, Mrs Lizon fled from her husband while at an equipment rental company, looking gaunt and limping. When . she told staff she was trying to escape, an employee gave her the . number for a domestic violence shelter and cash for a cab ride. At . the shelter, Stephanie Lizon told of being held captive. The criminal . complaint said she had ‘mutilated and swollen’ feet, and dozens of . photographs showed burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying . pans. She also had scars on her wrists and ankles. Peter . Lizon, a native of the Czech Republic, was under home confinement while . awaiting trial and barred from having contact with his wife. The judge allowed Lizon to be present for the birth of their daughter last week. Stephanie . delivered a baby girl on her husband's farm last Thursday. The couple . named the newborn Bozena, which means 'from God' in Slovak, WV Metro News reported. On . Monday, another judge removed the restrictions against the Lizons . seeing each other, and the couple was together with the baby outside the . courthouse. ‘That's a great . relief to see these charges dismissed,’ Stephanie Lizon said. ‘We've . been waiting for this for a very, very long time.’ Earlier . this year, the Lizons were arrested on charges they violated a custody . order for their 2-year-old son, Mojmir. Stephanie Lizon's parents in . Alexandria, Virginia, now have custody of him. A custody hearing is set . for Friday. Stephanie Lizon said ‘the celebration can't really happen until we have our son back with us.’ The . Lizons' home on their Jackson County farm burned to the ground in May . and three people were charged with arson. Stephanie Lizon said the home . remains off limits because of the arson investigation, although the . family remains on the property. ‘This . certainly was an interesting year for us and very hard,’ Peter Lizon . said. ‘We pretty much lost everything we had and then some. We're ready . to rebuild and start our life over, I guess.’ Lizon's wife escaped the house of horrors on July 2 and hid in a Zumba dance facility while her husband was running an errand . Mrs . Lizon arrived at the shelter in Leroy, West Virgina, with mutilated . feet and burns on her back that appeared to have a come from a frying . pan. But last July, . she claimed that her feet were injured in a farming accident and the . frying pan injuries were frrm accidental contact during an argument with . her husband. She said: 'It was an accident. My husband and I were arguing. We collided with each other.' When . she was shown a picture of her foot injury - allegedly caused when her . husband intentionally ran over her - she said farming was dangerous and . her husband did not know the tractor was close to her feet. She said she did not seek medical treatment. 'I didn't think it warranted it,' she testified. However prosecutor Katie Casto said the causes of the bruises were obvious. Mrs Lizon fled her husband while they returned farm tools to a rental shop. Staff at . Bosley Rental & Supply said she came into their office while her . husband was in another part of the building and told the staff: 'I'm . trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few . minutes.' Lingering legal woes: Peter Lizon, pictured in Jackson County Magistrate Court last year, still faces a charge of violating custody order for his son . Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want . to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic . violence shelter and called it, the store employee said. She also called family to ask for . money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a . Western Union office and the shelter. The . woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the . store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad. The employee also told investigators that . the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her . her husband had broken her fingers. Mr Lizon did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said. At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint. The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account: . She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan. She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things. 'Mutilated': The Czechoslovakian allegedly ran over his wife's feet with a tractor and delivered the couple's baby himself while she remained chained up . The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room. The . wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child . while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm. Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention. She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh. The complaint says investigators . confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's . Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to . document her injuries. Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were . arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for . cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet. Court records also show that Mrs . Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore . County. She pleaded guilty and got probation.","Judeg dismissed charges of malicious wounding and battery against Peter Lizon .

Jailed alleged murderer Aaron Hernandez has shared his worries with a 'pen pal' that his infant daughter will forget him if he stays in prison. Facing the grim possibility of a lifetime behind bars, the NFL star hand-wrote a two-page letter to Collin Imm saying that he desperately missed his nine-month-old daughter Avielle Janelle, with fiancé Shayanna Jenkins. Sitting in a Massachusetts jail cell with time to kill, the former New England Patriots tight end also declared he was a 'good dude' and had always wanted to play basketball. Sentimental: Accused killer Aaron Hernandez has written to a pen pal that he fears never knowing his baby daughter . Hernandez, 23, specifically asked in the  letter obtained by RadarOnline that the correspondence remain 'private'. The NFL star, accused of killing . semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd on June 17, has pleaded not . guilty to murder and is being held without bail. Deadspin reports the undated letter was passed to Imm by the Bristol County Sheriff's Office. This is reportedly the third 'pen pal' letter from Hernandez to appear online. It is not clear who Imm is. Hernadez wrote, as transcribed by RadarOnline: . 'Collin,Hey brotha, let me start by saying thanks for the support, it definitely means alot! Everything happens for a reason in life in both of our situations. Whatever obstacles/struggles will only make us stronger. We actually have something in common because my dream as a kid was to play in NBA an is still my favorite sport but had a better chance in football!

Hernandez’s letter was postmarked July 17 from Inmate No. 174594 – his jail identification number. While the fiancé of the fallen football star has not been charged in connection with Lloyd's slaying, authorities have alleged that Jenkins 'made overt attempts to hide evidence, render assistance for suspect to elude law enforcement and to hinder and mislead' the investigation.

An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer in Las Vegas for his bachelor party has been killed trying to stop a carjacker who stop his pickup truck from a car valet on the Strip. Jesus Manuel Magdaleno Jr. was loading his suitcases into his Ford F-150 with his brother-in-law Felix Cruz to return home on Sunday, when a man jumped into the running vehicle and took off with Cruz still in the bed. Magaleno, 33, ran after the pickup, shouted that he was a CHP officer and jumped into the cargo bed with his sister's husband, Mr Cruz, while the driver sped wildly away from the Flamingo hotel-casino, according to a police report. Horrific: The carjacker crashed into an SUV and totaled Jesus Manuel Magdaleno Jr.'s truck as he was trying to flee the scene on the Las Vegas Strip . Mourned: Jesus Magdaleno Jr., 33, was an eight-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol. He was set to be married next month and was in Las Vegas for his bachelor party . Magdaleno and Cruz had been loading luggage with the engine running and the driver door open. 'They were heading home after an enjoyable time, and they became victims of a horrible crime,' Las Vegas police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said. 'A vehicle is being stolen. His friend is in the bed of the vehicle. He runs to the aid of his friend who is in danger,' Steiber said of Magdaleno. 'He gave his life for someone else.' A witness on the 17th floor of a nearby casino heard the commotion and told police she saw the white 2009 Ford F150 accelerate away from the Strip, mow down construction cones and speed through red lights on an Interstate 15 overpass. The woman heard the two men in the back of the truck shouting for help before the pickup collided with a 2001 Ford Escape SUV and slammed into a traffic signal pole about 11 a.m. Sunday in front of the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino, about a mile west of the Flamingo. Magdaleno and Cruz were thrown from the bed of the truck. Five people, including the car thief were injured in the crash. Magdaleno's brother-in-law was critically injured and is not expected to survive . Magdaleno, 33, an eight-year CHP veteran from Visalia, was killed. He was due to be married in September. Cruz, 31, was in critical condition Monday at University Medical Center in Las Vegas. He is not expected to survive, authorities said. The alleged car thief, James Robert Montgomery, 29, of Tustin, California, was arrested and hospitalized after the crash and booked into the Clark County jail on felony murder, kidnapping, auto theft, battery and robbery charges pending an initial court appearance. Three people in the SUV were treated for minor injuries, police Officer Laura Meltzer said. Montgomery told police he remembered walking around the Flamingo and being in a car crash, but couldn't remember anything in between, according to the arrest report. The car thief smashed into an oncoming SUV at high speed. Magdaleno and his brother-in-law, who was both in the back, were thrown from the truck . Montgomery spoke with a taxi driver before climbing into the driver's seat of Magdaleno's pickup, the arrest report said. Surveillance footage showed Magdaleno chase the vehicle and jump in the bed when it stopped for traffic. The videos were impounded as evidence and not made public. Flamingo owner Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokeswoman Debbie Munch issued a statement extending sympathy to the families and friends of the two men. She said the company was cooperating with the police investigation. The incident was latest in a series of violent acts on the Strip, including a shooting one week earlier involving an off-duty Las Vegas police detective and a man accused of trying to steal a car in a loading zone outside the Excalibur hotel-casino. Saul Villegas, 27, of Bellflower, California, faces an attempted auto theft charge after police alleged he got into Detective Bernard Plaskett's wife's car and refused to get out. Plaskett, 54, a 20-year department veteran, shot Villegas once in the wrist, police said. Plaskett is on paid leave pending a departmental review of the shooting.","Jesus Magdaleno Jr, 33, an eight-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol, was in Las Vegas to celebrate his bachelor party .

The nuclear deterrent base in Scotland would be designated as sovereign United Kingdom territory under plans drawn up by the Ministry of Defence. The move comes amid warnings of the ‘enormous’ costs of trying to relocate the Trident missile system away from Faslane if Scotland breaks away from the rest of the UK. But David Cameron today moved to quash the idea, warning it was not a ‘credible or sensible’. One the move? One of the Royal Navy's Astute Class attack submarines sailing into the naval base on the Clyde . The future of Britain’s nuclear deterrent has become a key area of dispute in the run up to the referendum on Scottish independence next year. The submarines and missiles are housed at a naval base on the Clyde but the SNP wants rid of the system. Officials in Whitehall have been looking at alternatives to ensure Britain can maintain its at sea deterrent. Under the plan to reclassify Faslane, the base would be given the same status as the British sovereign military bases in Cyprus, the Guardian reported. A defence source said: ‘It would cost a huge amount of money, running into tens of billions of pounds, to decommission Faslane. Warning: Downing Street made clear that David Cameron did not think the plan was sensible . ‘Those costs would be factored into any negotiations on an independence settlement. The sovereign base area is an option. It is an interesting idea because the costs of moving out of Faslane are eye-wateringly high.’ The government has always officially insisted it is not working on alternative options for siting Trident because it expects Scots to vote to stay in the UK. Earlier this month Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned that moving the base for the continuous at-sea nuclear deterrent would ‘cost a significant amount of money’. An MoD spokesman said: ‘No contingency plans are being made to move Trident out of Scotland. The scale and cost of any potential relocation away from Faslane would be enormous.’ However, Downing Street today insisted Mr Cameron would not support proposals to designate the Clydeside home of the Trident nuclear deterrent as sovereign United Kingdom territory. A Number 10 spokesman said that no such idea had been presented to Mr Cameron or to Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, adding that it would not be a ""credible or sensible"" course of action. Scottish National Party defence spokesman Angus Robertson described the sovereign territory idea as ‘an extraordinary attempt by Westminster to bully Scotland’. Mr Robertson added: ‘Neither the people nor Parliament of Scotland want nuclear weapons dumped here, and we are clear that Trident would have to be removed as quickly as possible - only a Yes vote next September will empower Scotland to get rid of Trident, and the money saved will help build a fairer society and stronger economy. ‘A key argument for independence is that Scotland will no longer have to pay for nuclear weapons that we do not want. A No vote, by contrast, means a new generation of nuclear weapons on the Clyde for another 50 years.’","Idea floated as a contingency if Scotland breaks away from the UK .

Thousands of former patients of the dentist are being contacted by health chiefs warning them of the risk and offering them an HIV test. Medical experts say there is a 'slight risk' that those treated by the individual may have been exposed to the virus. The former dentist practised at Kelburne Dental Surgery in Paisley, Renfrewshire. Around 3,000 patients registered with the surgery have been treated by the dentist between January 2004 and March 2013 . The former dentist practised at Kelburne Dental Surgery in Paisley, Renfrewshire, until March this year. Approximately 3,000 NHS and private patients registered with the surgery have been treated by the dentist at some point between January 2004 and March 2013. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have contacted the vast majority by letter however there are around 250 NHS patients and 230 private patients who we have been unable to trace. The former dentist also provided locum Sunday Emergency Dental cover at Nithbank Hospital, Dumfries between April 2004 and 2007. It is thought 247 patients may have received treatment from this dentist during this time. Experts say there is a 'slight risk' those treated by the dentist may have been exposed to the virus (pictured) NHS Dumfries and Galloway has identified and written to most of the patients involved, however 14 patients no longer reside in the region and it has not been possible to trace them. A confidential helpline has been set up to offer advice to patients who may have been treated by the dentist. Dr Syed Ahmed, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Consultant in Public Health Medicine, said: 'It is very rare for HIV to be passed from a health care practitioner to a patient because all work follows strict 'infection control' measures. 'These measures are designed to prevent infections like HIV being passed between people and through our investigations into this case we are confident that all appropriate infection control measures were followed by the dentist. 'Whilst we therefore think the risk is extremely low we cannot guarantee that there is no risk, so we have set up a freephone help-line where patients can ask questions and then decide if they want to have an HIV test. 'If anyone has been treated at the Kelburne Dental Surgery and has not received a letter but has concerns we would ask them to call the helpline number and we will be able to check their name against the list of individuals who we have been unable to trace.' Dr Derek Cox, Director of Public Health, NHS Dumfries and Galloway, said: ""We have identified that 247 patients were treated by this dentist. Of these we are unable to find addresses for 14, almost certainly because they no longer live in Dumfries and Galloway. 'If you were seen at a Sunday Emergency Dental clinic at Nithbank between April 2004 and April 2007 and have not yet received a letter, it is unlikely that you were treated by the dentist in question. 'Nevertheless, if you are concerned that you may have been missed off the list please contact the helpline."" In the last 25 years, 30 practising health care practitioners have contracted HIV leading to similar patient alerts. Around 10,000 people have been tested as a result and not a single person was found to have caught HIV as a result of medical or dental treatment. Last week, the government announced it is to lift a ban that stops healthcare staff with HIV performing certain medical procedures. Healthcare staff in England, Wales and Scotland having HIV treatment will be able to take part in all tasks, including surgery and dentistry.

Caroline Kennedy has . been forced to reveal her net worth by submitting financial statements . in order to be considered as the next American ambassador to Japan, and . it is believed she may be worth up to $500million. The . former first daughter's wealth has been a closely-guarded secret for . decades, but now that President Obama has nominated her to represent the . United States abroad, she has to list the sources of her massive . income. 'She’s very rich, . probably worth between $250million and $500million,' said one legal . expert who had seen the financial disclosure forms. In the spotlight: Caroline Kennedy's name has been submitted to be the first woman appointed as American ambassador to Japan . Caroline, . who is the sole surviving member of former President John F. Kennedy's . immediate family, has avoided calls to publicly release her financial . statements in the past, but as the Senate must now approve her . appointment to be an Ambassador, she has no choice. The . closest she came to revealing her millions came in 2008 when she asked . then-New York Governor David Patterson to suggest she take over Hillary . Clinton's empty Senate seat. At . the time, she said she would reveal what board positions make her how . many millions and exactly how much her family trusts earn in interest, . but only if her takeover of the Senate seat was going to happen. It didn't, so the curtains surrounding her bank accounts remained closed. Now . there is no such justification for privacy, as she needs to reveal what . ties she will be willing to cut in order to take the prestigious . position. 'I understand . that a heightened prospect of a conflict of interest could exist as to . companies that maintain a presence in Japan,' she wrote in a letter . accompanying her disclosure statements. According . to The New York Post, said conflicts could include a number of board . and trustee positions that she olds with Harvard University's Kennedy . school, her husband Edwin Schlossberg's foundation, and the arts . foundation created by her mother and father. Connections: Caroline has supported Barack Obama in both presidential elections, seen left in 2008 and then with First Lady Michelle Obama at her uncle's funeral in 2011 (right) The . biggest source of her income is from the extensive trusts that her . grandfather Joe established for each of his children and grandchildren. The untimely deaths in her family have led to a piling up of respective estates, as her mother Jackie inherited her father's trusts after he was assassinated in 1963. After leaving the White House, Jackie Kennedy married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968, though he died less than seven years later in 1975. When he passed away, Jackie was not entitled to as much as she would have been as a result of Greek estate laws, and after two years she agreed to accept a $26million settlement from her late-husband's daughter Christina in return for giving up all claims to the family fortune in the future. People Magazine reports that her later relationship with financial planner Maurice Tempelsman helped her build that payout from the Onassis family into an estimated fortune of anywhere between $100million and $200million, though it is unclear where that money went exactly as her final estate that was passed on to her children was significantly lower. Camelot: Caroline, seen on her mother Jacqueline's lap beside her then-Senator father Jack in 1960, inherited the vast majority of her wealth . Second marriage: Jacqueline Kennedy married Aristotle Onassis in 1968, and fought with his family for two years following his death in 1975 over her payout. All told she agreed to accept $26million from his estate . Back in New York: She spent her final years in the company of Maurice Tempelsman, who helped her grow her fortune that she eventually left to her two children . Key address: Since leaving the White House, Jacqueline Kennedy spent much of her later life in her 15th floor apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York's Upper East Side . Jacqueline was diagnosed with cancer in 1994 and died four months later. She left her children an estimated $43.7million, including several pricey properties including her 15-room apartment on Fifth Avenue which had a view of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the 366-acre Kennedy estate on Martha's Vineyard. In May of this year, Caroline listed 90 waterfront acres of the property for sale- with no homes included- for $45million though it does not appear to have sold yet. She is still holding on to three lots of land for herself and her children, two that pay off the cost of estate expenses, and one that has been designated as open space. The Boston Herald reports that the lots she is keeping for her family include the home that her mother lived in and designed. This isn't the first time that Caroline has made a parcel off her mother's property. Jackie bought the 15th floor of her Fifth Avenue apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side in 1964 following the president's assassination, she paid $250,000. It sold for $9.5million in 1995 after her death to billionaire David Koch. Kennedy curse: John Jr., seen here with his wife Carolyn just months before their death, left his estate to his sister Caroline and her children and they had to pay the Bessette family $15million following the fatal plane crash . 'Mrs. Onassis was very conservative financially, and she didn’t spend much on it. We gutted the apartment and redid everything,' he said to The Observer after he decided to sell it for .$32million in 2006. On top of her own piece of the Kennedy pie, Caroline also inherited her brother John Jr.'s trusts when he died in a plane crash in 1999. He left his $50million to his relatives and a few charities, but the Kennedys are also believed to have paid the Bessette family $15million as a result of the crash. John Jr. was the one piloting that fatal flight in his plane with his wife Carolyn and her sister Laura as passengers; investigations into the crash reported that all three died on impact and the cause of the crash was pilot error. Seclusion: The massive Kennedy estate in Martha's Vineyard keeps their family foothold in Cape Cod . Private property: Even though Caroline has listed large portions of the property for sale, she will still have well over 100 acres to her name, not to mention the family house . Selling off land: In May, Caroline listed two parcels of land totaling 90 acres for sale for $45million from the 366-acre property that her mother bought in Martha's Vineyard back in the 1970s (shown in 1981) 'From . the figures, it looks like she earns between $12million and $30million a . year from her trust and from her investments,' an unidentified legal . expert told The Post. The interest yielded from those funds is hefty, but the 55-year-old has not just been resting on those laurels. She has stakes in banks like Goldman Sachs, Blackstone, JP Morgan and two oil companies that her family's assets own. On . top of those eight-figure sums, she also brings in an additional . $1million from paid speeches and book royalties on a yearly basis. Branching out: Edwin Schlossberg's design firm is based in New York so he is not expected to move to Japan alongside his wife of 27 years if she is confirmed as the Ambassador to Japan .

Their . 26-year marriage has been the subject of speculation over the years . since they are rarely seen together, but they were seen enjoying a beach . vacation in St Bart's over the girls' spring break earlier this year.

He was never a household name, yet he was the very definition of a household face. Louis the chimp, who has died at the grand old age of 37, was famous up and down the land as Brooke Bond, the secret agent just as debonair as Sean Connery’s 007 — with even more chest hair — in the Eighties adverts for PG Tips. It may be stretching a point to suggest Brooke Bond became as iconic as his human alter ego, James, but then again, it may not. With his catchphrase ‘The name’s Bond. Brooke Bond’, he was voiced by the suave actor Michael Jayston, and became an instant hit when he first appeared in 1981. Little wonder that six years ago, the PG Tips chimp adverts, which ran from 1956 to 2001, were voted the most memorable in TV history, narrowly ahead of the aliens advertising Cadbury’s Smash instant mashed potato, who laughed so rudely at earth people peeling potatoes with our metal knives, boiling them for 20 of our minutes, and then smashing them all to bits. Moreover, we didn’t have to get used to a series of different faces playing Brooke Bond, as with 007. It was always Louis. And yet the fame never went to his head. ‘He was quiet and calm, which is quite unusual for male chimps,’ said Dr Charlotte Macdonald, curator at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire, where Louis died on Monday following a short illness. ‘He was sociable and popular with the keepers.’ Scroll down for video . Dignified: Louis passed away at his home at Twycross Zoo in Warwickshire following a short illness on Monday . Golden age: Louis became famous as the debonair Brooke Bond - the secret agent even hairier than Sean Connery . His 43-year-old partner, Choppers, is bearing up well, Dr Macdonald added. ‘They were together a very long time, and chimps can pine just like humans, but she’s eating well, which is good.’ Choppers was not, of course, offered that time-honoured British palliative to ease the shock of a long-term companion’s death — a cup of sweetened tea. But like Louis, she also appeared in the PG Tips commercials, and therefore played a part in one of TV’s longest-lasting and most effective campaigns. Perhaps the most affectionately remembered of all was the one in the Seventies (not featuring Louis) in which two chimps cast as father and son removal men accidentally dropped a piano down a flight of stairs. The pay-off — using dubbed human voices — entered the annals of popular culture . . . ‘Dad, do you know the piano’s on my foot?’ ‘You hum it, son, I’ll play it.’ Instant hit: Brooke Bond's catchphrase became almost as famous as his human alter ego . WATCH: BROOKE BOND STARRING IN A PG TIPS AD FROM THE 1980S . Such was the impact of those adverts that another of them is said to have undermined the popularity of the tandem bike. Also dating from the early Seventies, it parodied the Tour de France in the days when the British were nowhere near as strong in the venerable race as they are now, and thus considered it ripe for mickey-taking. A chimp playing a sexy Frenchwoman made eyes at another, playing a stricken cyclist, who asked, in a Yorkshire accent: ‘Can you ride tandem?’ 'Sociable animal': Louis, pictured aged five playing with a Rubik's cube, was popular with his keepers . That gave rise to a catchphrase which . remained the bane of cyclists’ lives for some years on British highways . and byways. The tandem, which had once been considered rather a dashing . machine, practically overnight became a joke. It was another marker of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign, which was inspired by the chimps’ tea parties held at London Zoo in the Fifties. TV advertising was born on ITV at precisely 8.12pm on September 22, 1955, during a variety show hosted by bandleader and DJ Jack Jackson. Viewers saw a tube of Gibbs SR toothpaste embedded in a block of ice. Within months, the PG Tips chimps were added to the burgeoning mix of commercials to promote a brand of tea which Brooke Bond (the company, not the chimp) had launched in Britain in 1930. Two years after the adverts were launched, PG Tips had moved up from fourth place to be the top-selling tea in the UK. The idea of ‘talking’ animals was an instant hit — as were their  costumes — and while it is the norm now, at the time it was a delightful innovation. It helped, too, that the chimps were voiced over the years by luminaries such as Peter Sellers, Cilla Black and Bob Monkhouse. But the real stars, of course, were the animals themselves. In 1977, Mail photographer Mike Hollist photographed a preview of the latest commercial at Twycross. ‘Molly Badham, the director and founder, had turned Twycross into a world-leading centre for primates,’ he recalled. ‘These chimpanzees were absolutely amazing. Molly directed the event. She talked to them, gave them things to hold and things to do. They were terrific show-offs really, and there was a bit of misbehaviour, but not more than you’d expect from a group of children. ‘In fact, working with them that day, I found that after a while I forgot they were chimpanzees and looked at them as if they were children. You can find as much emotion on a chimp’s face as you can on any six-year-old child’s.’ Stars: Chimpanzee actors Kip and Louis with Molly Badham who founded Twycross Zoo and trained the animals . Monkey business: The PG Tips ads were part of a clever and enduringly powerful campaign . But just as the chimps’ tea  parties once held at London Zoo fell prey to growing sensibilities about the perceived exploitation of animals, so too did the PG Tips commercials. In 2001, following complaints by animal rights activists, the axe fell. The decision reflected the political correctness of the times, but it was still widely lamented. It is hard to imagine similar anxieties now if, for instance, those infernal Russian-accented meerkats were killed off. But then TV commercials do not burrow into our affections as they once did, possibly because we can now wield our remote-control units to wind forward through the breaks. The irony is that there are infinitely more adverts on British TV now than there were in the heyday of the PG Tips campaign — when advertising was offered by only a single channel — yet they are infinitely less influential. My children know perhaps three or four catchphrases or jingles from TV commercials, yet at their age I knew at least 50. And I remember them just as keenly now. Most people over the age of 45 are still aware that Double Diamond works wonders, that nothing beats the great smell of Brut, and that Mackeson looks good, tastes good and by golly it does you good. Success: Adverts like this one for Hamlets cigars were hugely popular in the Seventies . Even those who celebrated the end of . those PG Tips ads, feeling that they demeaned the chimps, would surely . have to admit that they were brilliantly conceived and executed. And . while there is much dynamism in the advertising industry still, most TV . advertising now is either vacuously inane, or too complex and cynical . for its own good. Where is the simple humour? In the Seventies, TV advertising’s golden . age, humour sold enough Hamlet cigars and Cinzano Bianco to sink . battleships. Significantly, those were the years when several men . destined to join the ranks of Britain’s finest film directors were . cutting their teeth on TV commercials. The Cinzano adverts starring Joan Collins and Leonard Rossiter, which — like those for Hamlet — celebrated cack-handedness, were conceived by Alan Parker, who later brought us the movies Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. Music, too, was used more effectively than now. It used to be said the definition of an intellectual was someone who listened to Rossini’s William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger, and something similar might also be said of Tchaikovsky’s Dance Of The Reed Flutes, from The Nutcracker, which to the over-45s is far better known as ‘Everyone’s A Fruit and Nut Case’ from the Cadbury’s advert. Witty: Adverts like this one for Cinzano used simple humour to sell products . As for Dvorak’s New World Symphony, for millions of us that evokes only one thing: a young lad pushing a bike loaded with loaves of Hovis up a steep cobbled street. That seminal 1973 advert, incidentally, was directed by a certain Ridley Scott, who went on to create Gladiator. We don’t yet know whether any of this generation of commercial directors will end up being knighted for services to the British film industry, like Sir Alan Parker and Sir Ridley Scott. Perhaps some will. But they are plying their trade in less creative times. So, as we celebrate the memory of Louis the chimp and his simian mates, we should also celebrate not only one of the great advertising campaigns, but an entire era when TV commercials looked good, tasted good and by golly — if only by giving us so much collective pleasure — did us good.","Became household name starring in 1980s adverts as Brooke Bond .

It appeared along the Thames as crowds gathered for the five-day rowing event.

'Tenacious': Daphne Smallman, of Solihull, West Midlands, who died of cancer aged 78 in February, stood up to Tesco over the pricing issue . Tesco has been fined £300,000 in a landmark court case after it misled thousands of shoppers with a bogus half-price strawberry promotion. The supermarket admitted four offences linked to the sale of punnets of strawberries in 2,300 stores across the country at a ‘half-price’ figure of £1.99. Britain’s biggest grocer used an original price of £3.99 to justify the bargain claim. However, this higher figure only applied for a very short period. Tesco has admitted the claims of big savings were misleading and it has now been fined £300,000 and ordered to pay £65,000 in costs. The ruling will serve as a warning to all supermarkets, who stand accused of using a raft of underhand tactics to tempt shoppers through the doors. Birmingham Crown Court heard that the half-price promotion was instrumental in generating strawberry sales of some £52million with a profit of £2.3million. Judge Michael Chambers QC said: ‘The promotion was not a genuine bargain. It was false and misleading. The offer should never have been made in the first place by a national retailer. It was patently wrong.’ He said the case was ‘shocking by its very nature’ because consumers had a ‘high degree of trust’ in chains such as Tesco. As a result, he decided to levy what is a very large fine in terms of trading standards law. In court: Supermarket giant Tesco has been fined £300,000 for misleading the public over a half-price offer on punnets of strawberries . The case only reached the courts . thanks to the tenacity of elderly shopper Daphne Smallman, who saw the . strawberry bargain claims when in a Tesco at Sheldon, Birmingham, in the . summer of 2011. It turned . out that the £3.99 figure had applied for a very short period, however . the half-price deal ran for a much longer 14 weeks through the summer. This was at odds with guidelines in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations Act 2008. A . general rule of thumb is that an offer price should not carry on for a . longer period than an item was sold at its full price. Fined: The case concerned a Tesco store in Sheldon, Birmingham, after it was brought to trading standards officials' attention . Mrs Smallman . understood that the original price of £3.99 might have been fair at the . start of the strawberry season when the fruit was still in short supply. Praise: Daphne Smallman's friend Sonia Lewis (pictured), 79, said the late campaigner 'would be pleased to know something had been done' However, she knew it was . unfair to keep using this high figure when strawberries were plentiful . and farmers were supplying them at low prices. It . is exactly this tactic that all of the supermarkets have used for years . to give the impression they are offering bargains on seasonal fruit and . vegetables. Mrs Smallman . was identified in court as making the complaint, however, she died . earlier this year, aged 78, before the case was resolved. She . took up the matter with her local trading standards office which . pursued the case to the point that Tesco felt it had no choice but to . admit misleading shoppers. Birmingham . council’s head of trading standards, Sajeela Naseer, stressed the . ruling was significant for the way products were promoted in future. ‘Food pricing, presentation and the depiction of promotional practices . is a crucial issue for retailers, and in turn, consumers.’ Tesco . had tried to kill off the prosecution earlier this year by arguing that . Birmingham council did not have the power to pursue a case involving . offences outside its borders. Yesterday, . however the store admitted its guilt, although it insisted the . misleading promotion was the result of a one-off human error, rather . than a wider attempt to deceive customers. A . store spokesman said: ‘We sell over 40,000 products in our stores, with . thousands on promotion at any one time, but even one mistake is one too . many.","Customer Daphne Smallman stood up to Tesco in fight over £1.99 punnets .

Hardy: Jodie Madin, 24, was catapulted from the Tagada ride and landed on her head but didn't realise she had broken her neck until two days later . A hardy thrill-seeker who was thrown out of her seat on a fairground ride put in a six hour shift at work the following day without realising she had broken her neck. Jodie Madin, 24, was catapulted from the Tagada ride - which spins around and is tilted up and down as passengers sit along the inside of a wall without seat belts or straps to restrain them. She was thrown up in the air and landed on her head in the middle of the metal enclosure - smashing her fifth vertebra. Her friends said it was 'the funniest thing they had ever seen' but despite being in pain, Jodie shrugged it off and got back in her seat. She finished the ride unaware she had a broken neck and the following day did a six-hour shift at work as a cleaner. But after two days of being in pain she was unable to lift her head from her pillow and went to hospital where doctors diagnosed a fracture of the fifth vertebra on her spine. Stunned medics told her she could have been paralysed following the incident at Bentley Park in Doncaster. Jodie, of Scawthorpe, South Yorkshire, was with friends and her boyfriend David Porter on the ride on June 28. She said: 'You're supposed to hold on to the bars behind your head but when it's in motion the workers operating it tell you to put your hands up in the air and then bounce the carriages up and down along to the music. 'I bounced off the seat a few metres into the air at a vertical angle and did a little flip and landed on my head on the metal floor in the centre of the ride. 'They stopped the ride and asked if I was alright but because I was a bit embarrassed about it I put my thumb up and they just told me to get back on the seat. Diagnosis: Jodie only went to hospital two days after the incident, where she discovered she had a fracture of the fifth vertebra on her spine . 'My neck and my head were really painful but everyone was watching me and I was in shock so I got back on my seat and they set the ride off again. 'My friends were all laughing saying it was the funniest thing they had ever seen. They felt terrible for laughing when they saw me in bed with a neck brace a few days later.' The day after the incident Jodie woke up with a stiff neck and took painkillers thinking it might be whiplash and did a six-hour shift at work. She said: 'When I woke up the next . morning my neck was really stiff and sore but I had to quickly get ready . for work so I didn't have much time to think about it. Fairground: The Tagada ride spins passengers around and tilts them up and down as they sit along the inside of a wall without seat belts or straps to restrain them . 'At work my boss suggested I had . whiplash because of the way I was walking. I had been thrown forward by . quite a force so it made sense that I had whiplash.' Injury: Jodie was immobilised in hospital for three days and must wear a collar for at least six weeks . The next morning she could not lift her head from the pillow and went to hospital where medics immediately put a collar round her neck. A scan then showed part of the fifth vertebra had broken off and three others were bruised. She said: 'When I woke my upper body felt paralysed to the bed and I knew something was seriously wrong. 'When I got some feeling back in my body I drove myself up to the hospital because I still didn't think it was as serious as it was. 'At the hospital the doctor said I must have hit my head at some force.' Jodie was immobilised in hospital for three days and must wear a collar for at least six weeks. She said: 'I've been very lucky. It's scared me to death what might have happened to me. I used to love roller coasters but I think I'll be steering clear from now on.'

More than four-fifths of people cannot identify an ash tree from its leaves and almost half cannot recognise an oak, a survey has revealed. Members of the public are being encouraged to report signs of diseases which are threatening British trees, such as ash dieback, as part of efforts to tackle infection which could wipe out millions of trees across the countryside. But many people cannot even identify some of the UK's most common trees that are at risk, a poll conducted for the Woodland Trust suggests. Spot the difference: Four in five people could not identify an ash tree (left) by its leaves, while half did not recognise an oak tree (right), the survey by the Woodland Trust found . Only 17 per cent of those shown an ash leaf could say what tree it came from, despite the high profile of Chalara ash dieback, which experts have warned could have the same effect on ash trees as Dutch elm disease had on British elms. And 57 per cent could identify an oak, one of the country's most common and recognisable trees. Oaks are at risk from disease such as acute oak decline, which causes bleeding and lesions on stems and tree death. One in 10 mis-identified an oak leaf as coming from a sycamore tree, the survey of 2,050 adults by YouGov revealed found. The situation is most acute among young people who appear to be losing touch with nature, with less than two-fifths (39 per cent) able to identify an oak tree from its leaf and only one in 10 able to identify an ash leaf. Older people were best able to recognise trees, with more than two-thirds (68 per cent) of over-55s identifying an oak and almost a quarter (23 per cent) able to correctly name an ash leaf. The Trust said it needs people to report signs of disease, such as ash dieback (pictured) One in 10 of the adults asked thought an oak leaf (pictured) came from a sycamore tree . Those in north-east England and Northern . Ireland struggled most to correctly identify oak leaves, with just 40 . per cent getting it right, while less than one in 10 (9 per cent) people . in the North East could name an ash leaf. The Woodland Trust is warning that a lack of knowledge about trees among members of the public could hamper efforts to stop the increasing risk of pests and diseases which UK trees face. Austin Brady, head of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said: 'We are relying on people to report the signs of disease and pests in their local woods, so if more people were able to identify common trees like ash and oak, it would make tracking the spread easier. 'We are calling for increased education on native trees and disease identification before it's too late. 'We need to learn about and love trees and woods or we risk losing them.' He added that there was a clear trend from the findings that younger people were less engaged with nature. There were currently 15 tree diseases listed by the Forestry Commission as being present in the country, with another five with the potential to arrive here, he said. 'It is of massive importance that we give everyone the skills to help tackle tree diseases, otherwise our native trees will be under threat. 'In order to tackle diseases and pests and protect our trees from future threats, it's imperative we increase the nation's understanding,' he said.","Woodland Trust survey found 10% thought oak leaf came from a sycamore .

Scarred: A month after the attack, Mr Griffin's scar is healing and he is able to eat solid foods again . A diver says he is lucky to be alive after being attacked by a six-foot conger eel 25 metres below the surface. Jimmy Griffin from Galway was attacked by the giant eel while diving off the coast of Connemara. The 48-year old, who is the owner of the famous Griffin’s Bakery in Galway city, suffered a severe bite to the face when undertaking his first dive in two years last month. He had to undergo surgery for two and a half hours and is grateful to plastic surgeon Padraig Regan for helping him. A vastly experienced diver with over 200 dives completed in his 20-year diving career, Mr Griffin was left stunned when he was blind-sided by the eel 25 metres below the surface. 'I didn’t see it until it had attacked me. It was an awful shock and I had to wrestle it off my face,' he said. “It managed to knock my regulator out of my mouth during the attack, so the first think I had to do was get that back and keep it calm. Thankfully I managed to keep myself under control.' First instincts when under attack at that depth must be to immediately return to the surface, but Mr Griffin was thankful that his vast training kicked in instead. 'I knew I had to remain calm, that was the most important thing. I returned to the surface gradually to avoid the bends and I managed to get back into the boat. 'I knew by a few of the people that were on the dive with me that it was a pretty bad bite. 'To complicate things I had driven my young daughter and my Polish mother-in-law out to the beach for the day so I had to make plans to take care of them, but once I knew I was going to Galway hospital I knew things would be okay,' he said. His wife Bogna and his teenage son were holidaying in Poland but rushed home when the incident happened. The award-winning baker had to survive on baby food for several days because his mouth was so sore. 'My mouth was torn apart inside and it has been extremely tight. It has been a slow recovery. Unusual: The unprecedented attack is not in keeping with Conger eels' behaviour. Mr Griffin has both internal and external stitches (left) on his cheek to tighten the skin around his mouth . 'I have a huge amount of internal stitches as well as external stitches,' he added. After being subject to such a strange occurrence, Mr Griffin began to look into the history of attacks by Conger eels and he says he is yet to find a precedence. 'They are usually afraid of humans and shy away from life. They usually stay in their holes and come out during the night. We think this one must have been blind or something to attack me like that. 'I’ve had a good look online and I cannot find any other incident of someone being attacked by a Conger eel. And the fact that it happened in open water means it really was a freak incident. 'But it won’t put me off. I won’t hesitate in going diving again. It’s funny, it was two years since my last dive and for that to happen is strange. But I’ll give it a go again at some stage I’m sure,' he said.","48-year-old Jimmy Griffin needed plastic surgery on his torn cheek .

The Maryland home of NFL veteran Ray Lewis has hit the market and all four bedrooms and baths—and the rest of the uniquely appointed pad—can be yours for a cool $1.1 million. Lewis likely has no further need for the spacious house in the Baltimore area, having retired after the Ravens’ 2013 Super Bowl victory over San Francisco. While the 38-year-old called his championship 17th season his ‘last ride,’ his realtor is quick to remind prospective buyers that the home in Owings Mills is where Lewis’s ‘first ride’ began. Bargain: Recently retired Baltimore Ravens great Ray Lewis has put his Maryland home up for sale at $1.1 million . The realtor likely isn’t referring to Lewis’s other Super Bowl win back in 2000. The former NFL player became tied to an Atlanta double murder that occurred that night. Richard Lollar and his friend Jacinth Baker were stabbed to death outside a nightclub on the night of January 31, 2000. While some evidence tied Lewis to the crime and he was initially charged with double homicide, he cut a deal with prosecutors and got off in exchange for his testimony about two friends he was with that night. Beachy: The unique, four bedroom home features a built-in aquarium . Good times: The 17-year veteran helped take his team to the Super Bowl twice before retiring in 2013 . Trophy room: A hallway features some of the two-time Super Bowl champ's football memorabilia--though it's likely not included in the offering price . Retired: Lewis won his second Super Bowl in 2013, thirteen years after his first win in 2000 on a night that would become infamous for the linebacker . In addition to its former occupant, future owners of the home will have many reasons to boast about their abode. At least 52 reasons if you ask Keller Williams realtor Nicole Nichols. Built in 1995, the brick home features ‘lavish appointments of marble and granite,’ reads the listing. This includes the pristine granite countertops in the home’s sprawling, 1950s diner inspired kitchen. Cozy: The Owings Mills, Maryland home has four bedrooms and four baths . Modern: Posh bathrooms, one of which features a steam shower, adjoin the grand master suites . Squeaky clean: A contemporary, black tiled steam showers is helpful for potential buyers who often need to clean off championship ticker tape . Fun home: Humor abounds in the home, as seen in this kids bathroom that almost channels Pee Wee's Playhouse . Some of that fine stone can also be found in the bathrooms off the grand master suites, one of which features a contemporary steam shower lined with attractive glass blocks. One of the bathrooms channels Pee Wee’s Playhouse with tile and trim in a vivid fire engine red. The suites themselves are custom-designed in warm, welcoming safari hues and even more warmth can be had from the home’s two fireplaces. A jungle in there: One of the grand master suites has a warm, safari vibe . To die for: Like any self-respecting baller, Lewis keeps a walk-in closet that many a shoe lover would kill for . Classic: Clearly an oak man, Lewis's home abounds with the fine wood . Another persuasive reason to buy Lewis’s home: an Olympic-sized swimming pool in the back below a gorgeous first-floor promenade-style deck. Drying off is also a breeze because steps away from the pool is a cozy built-in sauna. For those more interested in cuddling up indoors, the den offers a high-tech entertainment system.

A once wheelchair bound mother-of-six says she has been given a whole new life after gastric bypass surgery has transformed both her health and fitness. Helen Jacobs-Grant, 42, from Medway, Kent, weighed 23 stone before going under the knife and felt life wasn't worth living at her heaviest. She told the MailOnline: 'When I was overweight I just wanted to die, I was in pain all the time. However, I would never have commit suicide as I have to be a mother to my children. I just used to wish that I would go to sleep and never wake up.' Transformed: Helen was unhappy and unhealthy at 23st, left, but has never felt better after shedding 11st, right . Helen, whose weightloss journey is featured in the first episode of the new Really TV show, Fat Surgeons, said she became a 'complete hermit' because of the pain and immobility her size caused. 'I didn't want to go anywhere so I . became a complete hermit. When people came to the house I would hide as I . didn't want to be seen. I felt like a complete and utter freak,' she said. When she did go out, pain from a hernia she had and the fact she was visually impaired meant she had to used a wheelchair to get around. She said it was 'soul destroying' not being able to go out with her older children or run around after her youngest, Harvey, six. Helen was born with albinism to Anglo-Indian parents and she said this always made her feel different and low in confidence. New lease of life: The mother-of-six used to live like a hermit but now goes running and to the gym regularly . She was often bullied and then became unhappily married age 20. She had three children, Joseph, 24, Lionel, 22 and Angelica, 16, with her first husband and her size gradually crept up. When her marriage broke down she turned to comfort eating and then met her second husband, Mason, with whom she had another three children, Imogen, 13, Ivan, 12 and Harvey. She suffered an abdominal injury when Harvey was born and a resulting hernia left her unable to even climb the stairs so she became 'trapped' in the living room of their family home - rarely able to even move off the sofa. 'If you'd have told me a year a go that I . would be running and doing Kung Fu I would have laughed my head off. I've completely transformed in every way' She said she knew she had to 'tackle my demons' and do something to change her health before it was too late. She said: 'I've either been having children or going . thorough emotional trauma and turned to eating for security. I've been . like this my adult life and I want a new life.' She began by eating a low fat, low carb diet and swimming twice a week. As a result she lost 7st but she still needed a wheelchair to get around and felt she couldn't lose anymore without help. She said: 'I couldn't do any cardio exercise because the hernia was giving me so much pain and I had pelvic complications. A gastric bypass was my only hope and thankfully I was suitable for the treatment and booked into have surgery on New Year's Eve 2012.' Surgeon Dr Shaw Somers carried out the procedure, fixing Helen's hernia before fitting the gastric band. Since then she has lost another 4st - taking her to an 11st weight drop in total - and is now a dress size 12-14. So long wheelchair: Helen no longer needs a mobility scooter to get around . Smiling again: Now Helen wants to help other people get healthy . She said she had never felt better. She no longer needs a wheelchair, is off disability benefits and has become a queen of fitness. She said: 'Now I spring out of bed at 6am in the morning. I go running and to the gym. I've got my first belt in Kung Fu and do belly-dancing. I'm even planning to do the London Marathon in 2014. 'If you'd have told me a year a go that I would be running and doing Kung Fu I would have laughed my head off. I've completely transformed in every way. 'The surgeons haven't given me my life back because I never had an adult life as I've always been overweight and unable to do anything. They have given me a new beginning.' Now Helen said she is 'truly living' for the first time in years and has never felt more confident. She said: 'I feel adored for the first time because I finally love myself.' Helen hopes her story can help other obese people find the drive to turn their lives around. She said: 'If there is anyone overweight who feels trapped and like they can't go on living, they need to know there is help out there, you just have to ask. It's not easy but it is achievable. Speak to your GP and see what is available in your local community.' Helen is now an advocate of healthy living and encourages her family to join her at the gym. She's also working as a volunteer with 'A Better Medway' - a council health initiative to support people in leading more active lifestyles - and is training to be employed in the health and fitness sector.

Prosecutors have withdrawn a plea deal to a Florida teen accused of having sex with her underage girlfriend after it emerged last week that the 19-year-old may have violated a court order by having sex with her 14-year-old victim as recently as two weeks ago. The deal was still on the table as recently as Friday when details of Hunt’s continued relationship with the unnamed teen had only just been reported, along with intimate details of the contents of some 20,000 text messages the two shared following Hunt’s arrest in February. While the deal offered Hunt the chance to avoid jail time and being branded a sex offender, the Sebastian, Florida teen could once again face both. Hunt goes to court on Tuesday where a judge will rule as to whether she must return to jail for the alleged violation. Revoked: Kaitlyn Hunt had a plea deal on the table until investigators accused her of violating her bond terms with continued contact with her 14-year-old lover . Prosecutors in the case are pushing for an immediate arrest, though it is unlikely that will happen before the emergency hearing. But if she’s found to be in violation of her bond, she’ll likely be led from the courtroom in handcuffs according to WPTV. The family hopes a new lawyer, William Korman, who the Hunts have just flown into Vero Beach from Boston, Massachusetts, will help avoid that. Court documents accuse Kaitlyn Hunt, 19, of Sebastian, Florida, of 'covertly contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it. Almost had it? Prosecutors in the underage sex case left a second, jail sparing plea deal on the table for Hunt for days after the sordid details of her continued relationship with the girl were revealed but have now revoked it . Read court documents listing Hunt's alleged bond violations... Some of the explicit messages contain footage of Hunt 'masturbating while moaning' and the state claims Hunt and the girl had sex as recently as two weeks ago. Meanwhile, her mom Kelley Hunt Smith may have helped her daughter cover her tracks. Hunt had not decided whether or not to take the plea deal when news of the renewed accusations broke. According to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend recently told detectives about the illicit contact they had while Hunt was out of jail on bond awaiting trial and that Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact.' The new evidence indicates Hunt and the girl, until recently, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day at Sebastian River High School in March. Violations: Hunt allegedly smuggled an iPod to her girlfriend and the two traded 20,000 text messages, including naked photos and masturbation videos from Hunt . Criminal? Hunt could be hauled away from an emergency hearing scheduled for August 20 in cuffs if a judge finds she violated her court orders to stay away from her 14-year-old girlfriend . 'I'm out of jail on bond,' Hunt told the girl in a May message warning her not to tell anyone they were in communication, otherwise, 'I'll sit in jail until trial starts.' 'No matter what,' Hunt wrote. 'If they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts.' The state claims to possess over 25 lewd photos the defendant sent to her lover's iPod, photos which show her fully nude and sometimes pleasuring herself. New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her . The girl's parents have remained adamant, from the time they first brought charges against Hunt earlier this year, that she should be prosecuted as a sex offender. The case garnered nationwide attention after Hunt's father Steven Hunt and mother Kelley Hunt Smith took the case public with social media campaigns and television appearances in support of their daughter, who had just turned 18 when her relationship with the girl began. On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship. 'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you . snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. Bye.' The two continued to converse, and on May 29, Hunt wrote, 'If my mom finds out we're talking, I'm blaming it on you.' Explicit: Prosecutors say that included in the 20,000 messages were photos of Hunt's vagina . Civil rights? Kaitlyn Hunt's parents took her case public after they claimed she was targeted because she is gay. While out on bond and barred from seeing the girl, Hunt may have had sex with her as recently as July . The . defendants mom, Kelley Hunt Smith, did find out. But the court . documents suggest that, instead of putting an end to the contact, Smith . tried to help her daughter cover her tracks. 'Delete . EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete . everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.' Incriminating messages from Kaitlyn's girlfriend were also included in the court filing. 'Chill out, I'm f***king with you,' wrote the girl. 'Babe, you need to like smoke a Black and Mild or something.' To which Hunt replied: 'KK rolling our blunt now.' Ms. Hunt was not immediately available for comment, but the court documents . make clear just how seriously the prosecution is taking these newest . revelations. Worldwide support: Thousands of people have protested against the prosecution of Hunt as a sex offender. But will they support her if she broke the terms of her bond with the aid of her mother? Thousands have signed petitions in . support of Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt after she was jailed and charged . with lascivious battery of a minor.

The man who was attacked by a polar bear last month in a Canadian national park, is back home in Maine and set to undergo jaw surgery today. Matthew Dyer flew into Lewsiton last Tuesday after spending three weeks recovering at a Montreal hospital from a polar bear attack at his camp in Torngat National Park on July 24. Thanks to the quick actions of his camping group, he miraculously survived and is back at his home in Turner, Maine. Miracle: The lawyer mauled by a polar bear last month in Canada returned to the U.S. last week and was pictured at his home in Turner, Maine Saturday . Back home: Matthew Dyer, pictured with his wife Jeanne Wells, is set to have jaw surgery today after being attacked by a polar bear July 24 . Dyer, a lawyer for Pine Tree Legal Services, was attacked during a Sierra Club guided tour of the Torngat Mountains National Park in the far Northern Labrador Mountains. Dyer's primary fear before going on the trip was that he wouldn't be physically fit enough. He trained all winter to make sure he would be able to cover the terrain. Polar bears are rampant in the park during the summer months when the melted ice confines them to land. But Dyer was unconcerned about the polar bears. Plus his group had an electrified fence used to surround the camp at night and keep the bears out. He even saw a few on the trip before the attack. One morning they witnessed a mother out with her baby cub. 'My god, they are cute, like a little stuffed animal,' Dyer told the Bangor Daily News. 'Then we had another big boy that came in and sat and watched us for a bit. We had to fire a flare at him to chase him off.' Deathly beautiful: Dyer was mauled while on a guided tour of the Torngat Mountains National Park led by the Sierra Club . But somehow the fence failed because a bear slipped through on July 24 while the rest of the camp was sleeping. Dyer was awake and saw the bear through his one-person tent. He yelled 'Bear in the camp! Bear in the camp!' before the beast latched onto his neck and wouldn't let go. Contrary to early reports by his wife that he fought back, Dyer says he did no such thing. His body went limp and he gave in. 'I thought I was dead,' he said. 'I could hear the bones crunching back in my head where he was chewing on me. I could see the bear’s legs. I was kind of under this belly with big white legs — no doubt what it was. I remember thinking to myself, it’s gotta happen to everyone. This is my time.' And then he saw the light. His group shot off flares at the bear as he was dragging Dyer down to the beach and the beast lost it's grip. Dyer believes it must have been a younger bear since an older one probably wouldn't have dropped him. Before: Dyer, a lawyer at Pine Tree Legal Services, pictured before the attack . His group carried Dyer back to the camp and performed what first-aid they could while they waited for emergency responders to arrive. It was a long wait. They were unable to communicate with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's telecommunications center until 6:30 a.m. the next morning. Seven hours after the attack a helicopter arrived take Dyer and a doctor form the group to a base in Northern Quebec that had a trauma clinic. They were later transferred by fixed-wing aircraft to Montreal General Hospital for further treatment. The rest of the group was left with an Inuit - the only people allowed to carry guns in the park. While Dyer suffered severe injuries to his back and head, it could have been a lot worse since the bear's bite didn't cause any spinal chord damage. 'If he had bitten any other way, I think I would have been dead,' Dyer said. 'Either I would have had a stroke or been paralyzed. But now, here I am, sitting in Turner. It’s pretty nice.' Lucky: The polar bear's grip surprisingly didn't damage Dyer's spinal chord, which could have had debilitating effects . Dyer's wife Jeanne Wells is glad her husband is home safe and sound. Wells was informed of the attack the afternoon after it happened and flew into Montreal to be by her husband as he recovered. ‘The Canadians did an amazing job of getting him transported. There was a doctor in the group who took care of him right from the start,' she said. Land locked: Polar bears became more populated in the park during the summer when they are confined to land due to the melting of ice . A spokesperson for the park said this is the first time an attack like this has happened since it opened in 2005. 'There are high densities of bears in the park and you are at very high risk of encountering a bear. That said, this is the only incident we have had of this seriousness since the park was established,' said Peter Deering, manager of resource conservation for Parks Canada in Western Newfoundland and Labrador. Torngat National Park is a 3,700-square-mile Canadian National Park located on the Northern Labrador Mountains in Newfoundland and is home to seal-hunting polar bears, caribou and remnant glaciers. Dyer is expected to make a full recovery.","Lawyer Matthew Dyer was attacked by a polar bear in Torngat National Park on July 24 when an electric fence surrounding his camp failed to keep the beast out .

Republican Scott DesJarlais, pictured with his second wife Amy, told an 11-year-old girl that the law would be upheld in the deportation of her father . A Republican congressman told a little girl in front of an audience that her father should be deported as members of the crowd cheered. The 11-year-old girl stood up in front of a Tennessee, US, town hall meeting and asked: 'I have a dad, and he’s undocumented, what can I do so that he can stay with me?' But she was told by Republican Scott DesJarlais that the immigration laws would be upheld. He said: 'Thank you for being here and thank you for coming forward and speaking. This is a big intimidating crowd and appreciate you coming forward and asking your question, but the answer still kinda remains the same. 'We have laws, and we need to follow those laws and you know, that’s where we’re at,' he said. As he spoke at the Murfreesboro event, Tennessee, the little girl sat down and hung her head. Around her members of the audience cheered and whooped at the congressman's response. The exchange was captured on a low quality camera and footage was posted on rawstory.com. The little girl, named Josie Molina, was speaking at Rutherford County Tea Party’s 'Conservative Conversation and Cocktails' meeting, the news service said, which was attended by around 200 people. Rawstory claimed the congressman made no attempt to 'assuage the girl's fears' and pointed out that the child was in therapy to try to cope with the stress ans anxiety of dealing with losing her father. Comments on the website mostly show dismay for the congressman's 'heartless' response. One person questioned why the politician didn't reply by telling her what steps her father needed to take to apply for a visa. Others claim the girl was wheeled out as part of a political stunt. The far right congressman says on his website that he believes illegal immigration 'burdens taxpayers, compromises national security, increases criminal activity, and erodes the significance of being an American citizen'. Rep DesJarlais, pictured with his wife and Mitt Romney, was filmed answering the little girl's question at a town hall meeting in Murfreesboro, Tennessee . He adds: 'We must secure our border and devote resources to enforcing current immigration law, which includes partnering with state and local law enforcement organizations.' The pro-life republican, a former physician, was re-elected in Tennessee in 2012 despite fending off charges before he entered politics that he impregnated a 24-year-old mistress - one of his patients - and pressured her into having an abortion. His first wife also had two abortions, according to divorce records. During those proceedings, DesJarlais said one case was related to a drug his wife took for a pituitary gland disorder; the medication was not considered safe for pregnant women. On his campaign website, the politician takes a firm stance on abortion. He says: 'All life should be cherished and protected. We are pro-life.'

Sparking a Twitter storm can help TV programmes boost their ratings figures, new research claims.

Looking at minute-by-minute trends, researchers found the volume of Tweets about a programme caused statistically significant . changes among 29 percent of the 221 episodes analysed. Flop: Ben Elton's sitcom The Wright Way was dropped after receiving a Twitter panning . Guilty pleasure: Tom Daley's show Splash! was the subject of Twitter jokes but went on to draw big audiences . Providing an instant, if sometimes vicious, platform for review, the 'Twitter reaction' has increasingly become a measure of a whether a show is deemed a success or not. Last month, Ben Elton's sitcom for the BBC The Wright Way was dropped after been panned by critics on Twitter. The show, set in the health and safety department of a local council, was described by one commentator as 'the worst sitcom ever'. But perversely, a stream of negative comments is not always a bad thing. Many took to Twitter to poke fun at last year's ITV Saturday night show Splash! which featured celebrities being taught to dive by Olympic star Tom Daley. Variously described as 'a joke', 'embarrassing' and 'a new low for television' - the Twitter verdict was a resounding dive bomb. But the influx of comments made sure that #Splash! began trending, and the conclusion appeared to be that it was so bad it was good. The show was the most-watched on its Saturday debut, drawing more than 6million viewers. Twitter meltdown: Farcical made-for-TV movie 'Sharknado' drew 5,000 Tweets a minute .

The farcical horror about opportunistic sharks which are sucked into a tornado and then fall down onto Los Angeles killing everything in their wake garnered an estimated 5,000 Tweets a minute at its peak. Even celebrities got in on the attack with Mia Farrow Tweeting: 'Omg omg omg #sharknado' Makers of the film SyFy are already in talks to make a sequel.

A 'Jurassic rat' that lived 160million years ago may have been the earliest known example of evolution's most successful mammal. Rat-like multituberculates filled a multitude of ecological niches and survived on Earth for more than 100million years. Eventually they were replaced by more modern rodents, but no other mammal has had such a long history in the fossil record, according to scientists. The newly discovered species, Rugosodon eurasiaticus, is thought to be the oldest ancestor in the multituberculate family tree . The newly discovered species, Rugosodon eurasiaticus, is thought to be the oldest ancestor in the multituberculate family tree. Despite living before the heyday of the dinosaurs, the creature already bore many of the features that made its descendants so successful. The ancient creature, found in eastern China, had teeth adapted to eating both plants and animals, and highly rotatable ankle joints. When a 'mass extinction' event wiped out the dinosaurs some 65million years ago, the multituberculates survived. How? They adapted to eating angiosperms - flowering plants. The multituberculates evolved into a diverse group of animals ranging in size from that of a mouse to a beaver. They only eventually vanished from the Earth about 34million years ago after losing out to other mammals such as primates, hoofed species and rodents. Multituberculates were distributed across the world and more than 200 species are known, some as small as the tiniest of mice and the largest the size of beavers. Some, such as Lambdopsalis from China, lived in burrows like prairie dogs while others, such as the North American Ptilodus, climbed trees as squirrels do today. Dr Zhe-Xi Luo, from the University of Chicago, a member of the American and Chinese team who described the find in the journal Science, said: 'The later multituberculates are extremely functionally diverse. 'Some could jump, some could burrow, others could climb trees and many more lived on the ground. 'The tree-climbing multituberculates and the jumping multituberculates had the most interesting ankle bones, capable of ""hyper-back-rotation"" of the hind feet. 'What is surprising about this discovery is that these ankle features were already present in Rugosodon, a land-dwelling mammal.' The fossil's teeth were very similar to those of Late Jurassic multituberculates from Portugal, Dr Luo added. This suggested that the animals spread themselves across the whole of Eurasia. Rugosodon measured about 6.5 inches, not including its tail, and would have been most active at night. The location of the fossil bones suggests that the creature found by scientists lived on the shores of a lake.","Multituberculates filled a multitude of ecological niches and survived on Earth for more than 100million years .

Joshua Obasuyi, 49, and Julius Oweka, 48, were part of a Nigerian gang who tricked U.S. Professor Marie Lowery, 80, a retired lecturer at the University of Houston, Texas, into handing over £245,000. She was strung along by the London-based conmen for nearly four years, after responding to a spam e-mail that told her she had won the jackpot in a prize draw. Conmen: Joshua Obasuyi (left) and Julius Oweka.convinced American victims they had won a lottery and duped them into paying fees to release the winnings .

She said.'You were both involved in fraudulent activities with others, and there is evidence of more than one victim,' 'In view of Prof Lowery, who was of course vulnerable, she was taken advantage of over many years - remorselessly and without mercy. 'This type of fraud takes advantage of the hopes, dreams and gullibility of others, and is very common and very harmful to our society.' The court heard that in April 2005, Prof Lowery received an e-mail claiming to be from the fictitious 'Great British Lottery', in which she was congratulated for winning a £5.7m jackpot. She initially agreed to pay £180 to process her winnings, and later complied with a string of demands for greater sums to be transferred via Western Union. Throughout the scam, she was presented with bogus certificates and court documents in an effort to convince her that the arrangement was legitimate. In November 2008, Prof Lowery was e-mailed by a man calling himself Chris Ascuncion, who told her he was a 'claims attorney' acting on behalf of the lottery company and asked for even more money to be transferred.

"By . Saurabh Shukla and Abhishek Bhalla . PUBLISHED: . 18:53 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:43 EST, 20 August 2013 . Mail Today's exposé that the missing coal ministry files pertain to companies linked to Congress politicians created a storm in Parliament that stalled Sonia Gandhi's pet Food Security Bill on Tuesday. The coal block allocations to 13 companies now named in FIRs in the CBI's investigation were made between 2006 and 2009. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held the coal portfolio when several of these allocations were made. The Opposition uproar in Parliament forced the UPA to abandon attempts to introduce the Food Security Bill despite the government's elaborate preparations to bring the bill. Parliamentary affairs minister Kamal Nath had personally called on MPs to be present and a deal had been cut with the Samajwadi Party, BSP and JD (U) that the government would be flexible over their amendments to the proposed bill. Sonia Gandhi also had an emotional reason to get the bill introduced in Parliament on August 20: it is the birthday of her late husband, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But the Coalgate storm spoiled the party. Sources say she is unhappy that Congress party managers and the government failed to forecast the storm over the missing Coalgate files and wants to know why preemptive action wasn't taken to minimise damage. Mail Today had revealed in its Tuesday edition that many missing files crucial to the CBI's investigation of Coalgate belonged to companies related to a Congress MP. CBI director Ranjit Sinha had also told Mail Today that it was a big setback to the agency's investigation. ""The Government will have to come with cogent answers. They have said some files have gone missing before 2004. There was nothing before 2004, the real problem is only of allocation post-2004,"" BJP leader Arun Jaitley told Mail Today. ""Why should we distract from the food bill? This is a serious matter. Destruction of evidence is a crime, has an FIR been registered?"" Jaitley asked. 'A huge crime' Asked about the missing files, he said: ""It is a huge crime. The case is under investigation, how can files disappear like this? ""There are three powerful targets of investigation - the beneficiaries who benefited from coal blocks, the screening committee which allotted the mines and the minister, the minister's office and the Prime Minister's Office. ""And suddenly the files are found missing,"" Jaitley added. Asked about the party's strategy, he said: ""The party will have to take a collective decision."" Opposition members are worried that if the files are not found, the case being built by the CBI might collapse for want of evidence, and powerful people will be let off the hook. Of the 13 companies against whom the CBI filed FIRs, files related to 11 are missing. These include AMR Iron & Steel Private Limited, Nagpur, which was allocated Bander block in Maharashtra on May 29, 2009. The directors of this company - Arvind Kumar Jayaswal, Manoj Jayaswal, Ramesh Jayaswal, and Devendra Darda - have close ties to Congress MP Vijay Darda. Another Darda company's files are also missing. The company is M/s JLD Yavatmal Energy Limited, Nagpur. It was allocated Fatehpur East Block in Chhattisgarh on January 23, 2008. The directors are Vijay Darda, Rajendra Darda, Devendra Darda, Manoj Jayaswal, Anand Jayaswal and Abhishek Jayaswal. Another company, M/s Vini Iron & . Steel Udyog Limited, Kolkata, was allocated Rajhara (North, Central and . Eastern) in Jharkhand on November 20, 2008. The company was sold later to Vijay Joshi, a close aide of former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda (BJP). The . directors are Sanjeev Kumar Tulsyan, Prashant Tulsyan, Vaibhav Tulsyan, . Nisha Tulsyan, Vimal Kumar Tulsyan, Nirmala Tulsyan, Hemant Kumar . Aggarwal and Navin Kumar. In Parliament, the Opposition slammed the UPA government, sought a . response from the Prime Minister and forced the adjournment of both . Houses. The combined . Opposition said it was ""shameful"" on the part of the government and it . should explain what exactly happened and who was responsible. Cries of ""Shame! Shame!"" and ""Pradhan Mantri jawab do (Prime Minister, answer)"" were heard in Parliament. In . the Lok Sabha the charge was led by Leader of the Opposition Sushma . Swaraj who said the PM should come to the House and assure members that . the CBI probe would not be hampered due to the missing files. Claiming that the files included applications for coal blocks, she alleged that they have gone missing as some big shots in the Congress were involved. Swaraj wanted the Speaker to direct the PM to come to the House and make a statement. The Opposition forced three adjournments over the issue before lunch, asking coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal to recuse himself from replying and demanding that PM Manmohan Singh make a statement. They said propriety demands that Jaiswal abstain as the missing files reportedly relate to a beneficiary of coal block allocation who is linked to the minister. ""All efforts are being made to locate documents which are not readily available,"" Jaiswal said, adding that a total ""769 files and documents running into 1.5 lakh pages have been handed over to the investigating agency"". Raising the issue in the Rajya Sabha, Leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley referred to the Mail Today report, saying: ""There are media reports that one of the beneficiaries of the coal block allocation was somebody to whom the coal minister was related. ""If files relating to that allocation are missing, should he be making a statement on those files?"" In a letter addressed to the PM, the CPI's Gurudas Dasgupta said it gives rise to serious concern that the files have been deliberately removed ""so that people in high positions do not get involved and the role of the PMO does not come under the shadow of suspicion"". He urged the PM to initiate an ""effective, proper and neutral"" probe to discover the people ""sabotaging the investigation"" of the CBI. United Opposition . Coalgate united the Opposition with the Left also supporting the demand. The CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury said: ""The House must know how these files are missing. It is appropriate that the minister then in charge should make the statement on how the files went missing."" The committee is mandated to examine and review non-availability of files/documents and suggest appropriate action, he said, adding that it has held two meetings and documents are being located. Amid slogan-shouting by the BJP, Jaiswal said some documents belonging to a period prior to 2004 are missing and asked who had an interest in getting the files of the pre-2004 period to go missing; he was pointing the needle of suspicion at the NDA regime. However, the BJP members saw this as a ploy to shift the blame.","Mail Today's 'missing files' story spoils Congress's push for Food Bill .

The elderly mother and autistic son of a woman murdered at her Denver, Colorado home are being evicted from the property, just three days after her tragic death. Federal housing officials are condemning the decision by the Denver Housing Authority to evict Sandra Roskilly's family, saying there is room for compassion in federal law. Doris Kessler and 18-year-old Gregory Roskilly were locked out of their subsidized housing and Roskilly's belongings have been seized and handed to a public administrator. Housing and Urban Development spokesman Jerry Brown said Tuesday his agency hopes Denver will reconsider after the horrific death. Evicted: Doris Kessler, pictured right in 2011, and her grandson Gregory Roskilly have been evicted from their home after her daughter, pictured left, was murdered . Brown said federal lease agreements for subsidized housing with communities limit the ability of residents to turn over property to other people, but the rules aren't carved in stone. 'Our rules and guidelines are just that, and we would hope people would use compassion. They have discretion, which is why the city has a board to administer it. There was no notification on our end of an eviction, and we didn't have a say in it,' he said. Brown said his agency is reviewing the case to see what steps can be taken to help the family, including finding them another place to live. The Denver Housing Authority said it was forced to evict 70-year-old Kessler under federal law because Roskilly was the head of the household. Police said 31-year-old Daniel Abeyta killed Roskilly and shot a second woman in her leg on Friday. Abeyta is hospitalized and facing a first-degree murder charge. The Denver Housing Authority was apologetic about Monday's eviction and issued a statement to KMGH-TV saying they had no choice. Out: Gregory Roskilly, pictured in 2011 as a 15-year-old, has lost his mother and his home in the same week . Tragic: Sandra Roskilly, pictured in 2011, was shot dead by a neighbor last Friday . 'Under federal policies and regulations, once the head of household is no longer with us, a live-in aide no longer has rights to that unit. We understand the family is under duress, but we will be locking the unit because they have no legal rights. We know this is a very tragic situation and offer our condolences,' the agency said. The Denver Housing Authority owns and manages subsidized public housing under an agreement with the federal government. Denver agency spokeswoman Stella Madrid said the property was turned over on Monday to the public administrator, a private organization that determines disposition of assets when there is no will. 'We secured all property in the unit yesterday and we secured the unit,' Madrid said Tuesday. She refused further comment. Kessler is now sleeping on a couch at the home of one of her children. Roskilly's autistic 18-year-old son is being kept in a facility in Pueblo but friends say he often visited his mother. Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, says his mother and nephew were given the boot by the city after 20 years. Kessler had moved in a decade ago. 'She's been living here 10 years and now they're telling her she's just a visitor and she has no rights whatsoever,' Campbell said. Deadly outcome: Suspect: Daniel Abeyta (left), 31, is accused of killing his neighbor, Sandra Roskilly (right), and shooting his estranged wife in Denver . Crime scene: The deadly confrontation played out in the Harvey Park neighborhood of Denver in the 2200 block of South Irving . Daniel Markin has been friends with . Roskilly for 30 years. He said he still has a lot of questions, . including how his friend wound up in a gunman's sights. Markin said Abeyta was upset his neighbor's rose bushes were growing onto his property. He allegedly murdered Roskilly and wounded his own wife after he fired a gunshot at one of . several propane tanks that he placed in the middle of a street last Friday. Roskilly's brother, Campbell, spoke out for the first time about his sister's murder on Monday, saying that his sibling knew her neighbors had a tumultuous . relationship and were no strangers to domestic violence. According to Campbell, his sister would often console Abeyta's 26-year-old wife after fights, leading him to believe that when Roskilly heard gunshots and screams Friday, she rushed to her friend's aid. 'In her last moments, she was doing what she wanted to do,' he told the station 9News. '[She was] . trying to reach out to a neighbor that was in trouble.' Good Samaritan: Roskilly's brother, Dennis Campbell, said he believes his sister died trying to protect her neighbor from her husband . Police said Abeyta was being held for . investigation of charges including murder. The wounded woman was . reported to be Abeyta's estranged spouse, according to KDVR. Campbell . said on the day of the killing, he was on his way to his sister's . house for a visit, but became struck in a traffic jam. He never got to see Roskilly . alive again. 'In my mind, I just wish I had been there a little sooner. But, again, you never know,' Campbell said. The . incident started at 10:40 a.m. Friday in the Harvey Park neighborhood . in the 2200 block of South Irving, when police said Abeyta shot dead . Roskilly after wounding his wife. Officers who responded to the scene spotted a man, who then fired a shot at propane tanks set up in the middle of the street with gunpowder on top. The makeshift device 'activated,' but no one was injured. One of the officers then shot Abeyta in the chest. Police said the man was in critical condition, while his wife was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the leg. Before he was shot, Abeyta was seen walking with his weapons. Police alerted residents to stay inside and a high school was put on lockdown. Abeyta was shot within about a half hour of that warning. Police didn't immediately say whether Abeyta lived in the neighborhood, but Melissa Allen told The Denver Post that he has lived in the area at least since she moved in three years ago. She said he lived in a house with his wife and two children, who are in elementary school. Allen said she and her children saw him walk down the street Friday. Abeyta, an Army veteran allegedly suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, has had multiple run-ins with the law over the years. In 2007, he was arrested on charges of felony menacing with a deadly weapon and felony child abuse. War of roses: A friend said that Abeyta was upset that Roskilly's rose bushes were encroaching on his property . Strong-willed: Roskilly recently celebrated a major millstone after losing 220lbs in a single year . Court documents cited by ABC2News state that Abeyta's wife took out a restraining order against him and the couple filed for divorce, but it was never finalized. According to Roskilly's long-time friend, Markin, she and Abeyta had been in conflict in the past. Markin explained to The Denver Channel that the 31-year-old man was upset that his neighbor's rose bushes were encroaching on his property. 'Daniel was pretty much trying to get Sandy out of her house anyway he could,' Markin said. Loved ones described Roskilly as a loving and generous woman who would do anything for others. Earlier this month, the 47-year-old celebrated a major milestone in her life, according to 9News. After struggling with obesity for years, Roskilly managed to shed 220lbs in just one year. On Facebook, Roskilly joyfully boasted about her weight loss. On August 5, she wrote: 'I'm getting so close to my goal of 160 lb. that it scars [sic] me so time not jokin im now 199lb.'","Sandra Roskilly, 47, was shot dead last Friday, allegedly by her nextdoor neighbor Daniel Abeyta .
Abeyta had homemade bombs made from gunpowder-laced propane tanks and also wounded his 26-year-old estranged wife .
Just three days after Roskilly's death her mother, Doris Kessler, 70, and autistic son, Gregory Roskilly, 18, have been locked out of their home .

A joint hunt master and a terrierman pleaded guilty to interfering with a badger sett today after they caused the 'most severe' damage an RSPCA officer had seen in 25 years. Stuart Radborne, 28, was caught 'waist-deep' in the sett as he and Ben Pethers, 29, frantically excavated the animals' home to try and find a lost terrier called Jimmy. Members of the public suspected them of illegal hunting and alerted the police and the RSPCA. 'Damage': Stuart Radborne, 28, left, and Ben Pethers, 29, both seen outside court in Wiltshire, were caught 'waist deep' in a badger sett . They were charged with the badger set attack and jointly charged with breaching the Hunting Act along with Jonathon Seed, 54, the former master of the Avon Vale Hunt, and two other hunt staff, Paul Tylee-Hinder, 58, and Josh Charlesworth, 18. But today, at North Wiltshire Magistrates Court in Wiltshire, the RSPCA dropped the hunt charges after Radborne and Pethers pleaded guilty to interfering with a badger sett. Outside court an outraged Mr Seed condemned the RSPCA prosecution as a 'complete outrage' and a 'disgrace'. Mr Seed, a Conservative councillor for Wiltshire, said: 'It has been a complete outrage and I would hope that every single member of the public think as to whether they give their hard earned money to the society in order to waste it. 'The RSPCA has spent £50,000 pursuing this and they have been given £500 in costs. It is an absolute disgrace. 'The two members of our group who pleaded guilty to interfering with a badger sett is an unfortunate event but they were going after their dog and the sentence reflected the judges view.' Hunt: (L-R) Stuart Radbourne, Paul Tylee-Hinder, Ben Pethers and Joshua Charlesworth are seen leaving the court, some carrying evidence bags . District Judge Simon Cooper heard that on March 6 2012 the five men, who were out hunting, were alerted that their dogs had marked a fox in a nearby field. Radbourne and Pethers, who were riding on a quad bike, reached the area first and began to assess the situation. They let the inexperienced terrier, Jimmy, loose and it ran off and disappeared. The huntsmen located the dog in the sett after they heard barking from below the ground. They tried to use a location collar to pull him out but when that failed they began digging at the ground to free him, the court was told. Jeremy Cave, prosecuting, said: 'An onlooker saw the men digging in the sett and describes the digging as furious with soiling flying. Former hunt master: Jonathan Seed branded the court case a 'complete outrage', and claimed the RSPCA had spent £50,000 pursuing it . 'The police and the RSPCA turned up and the men were questioned. 'There had been considerable interference with the set, digging and filling in the entrances. In total there were 15 entrances to the sett, 11 of which had been blocked. 'RSPCA Inspector Ian Burns, who turned up at the site, described it as ""the worst find he has ever witnessed in his 25 years of being an inspector"".' He added that Radbourne had been seen by another onlooker waist deep in the sett digging.The traumatised terrier eventually resurfaced two hours after it had first become stuck, suffering deep cuts and puncture wounds to his neck and face. The RSPCA had originally brought charges against all five huntsman of breaking the Hunting Act ban, but decided to drop the cases after accepting the guilty pleas from Radbourne, of Chippenham, and Pethers, of Southwick. Mr Seed, of Bromham, Mr Tylee-Hinder, of Calne, and Mr Charlesworth, of East Tytherton, all denied any wrong-doing. Clive Rees, defending Radbourne, told the court: 'It was certainly a badger sett and it was accepted that he had been the one who was up to his waist in it and he took full responsibility for that. 'But it was out of concern for the terrier. 'Mr Radbourne accepted his responsibility from the beginning. Seeing it was an active badger set made him even more concerned about Jimmy.' Janet Gedrych, for Mr Pethers, said her client had accepted that it was 'reckless' to let Jimmy free. 'It was clear that Jimmy had escaped and it was reckless to allow the dog out of the cage before fully investigating,' he said. 'He accepts that he was digging in an effort to find his dog, he didn't intentionally set out to damage the sett but he acted recklessly to find his lost dog.' District Judge Cooper handed the pair a £300 fine and ordered them to pay £250 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. He told them: 'In my mind the main aspect of this case was a failure to control Jimmy. 'Reliable or not, he should have been kept in his box. He got out and disappeared down the sett. 'Why he did it is speculation, but that he should have been allowed to do it was wrong. You are both responsible and you both could have prevented it.' Tim Bonner, director of campaigns at the Countryside Alliance, accused the RSPCA of wasting money on a 'politically motivated' prosecution. He said: 'It is absolutely disgraceful that the RSPCA has spent 14 months and £50,000 of its members' money on a prosecution which was completely groundless and clearly politically motivated. 'It is even worse that the taxpayer has had to pick up the bill for the court and the defendants' costs. 'The RSPCA investigation set out to find evidence to justify a prosecution, not to seek out the truth. Even so it has now had to accept that there was absolutely no basis for the prosecution.' The RSPCA inspector who complied the case against the five men said he would have been 'heavily criticised' if he had walked away from prosecution. Inspector Ian Burns said: 'There was severe damage to that badger sett and with all the money it has cost I would have been heavily criticised if I had walked away and left it. 'I have had 25 years' experience as a wildlife officer and I have dealt with numerous badger cases and that is the biggest, deepest, hole that I have seen dug.' A spokesman for the RSPCA added: 'The RSPCA received a call that a group of men had been seen on and around a badger sett in Stockley Hollow at the time that the Avon Vale was riding in the vicinity. 'On examining the area, RSPCA inspector Ian Burns found that a large hole had been dug directly down into the active badger sett, breaking a tunnel and entrances had been blocked up. 'A small Patterdale terrier emerged from the sett, muddy, dazed and bleeding badly from his jaw. He was fitted with an underground location collar. 'The dog, which belonged to Pethers, was taken to a vet who found his injuries were consistent with having been attacked by the claws and teeth of an animal whilst underground. 'The defendants gave conflicting accounts at the scene including chasing foxes, rabbits and searching for a lost dog.' The badger sett where the men were spotted was in Stockley Hollow, near Calne, Wiltshire. The RSPCA was today unable to confirm the exact amount spent on the prosecution.","Stuart Radborne, 28, and Ben Pethers, 29, admitted interfering with sett .

Jade admitted that although her original thoughts were 'what the hell are we doing here?' she thoroughly enjoyed her big day. Jade, a lifeguard trainer, said: 'I didn't know what was going on but I trusted him. He did amazingly. We both got what we wanted. 'My dress was amazing and he got a lads wedding at the stadium. 'The worst part of it was being away from him for so long.

The head of an Oklahoma Indian tribe is being accused of physical abuse of his mistress and spearheaded a massive cover-up. Johnna Townsend filed a lawsuit Monday in an Oklahoma court against George Tiger, principal chief of the Muscogee (Creek) Indian Nation and two of his brothers detailing the affair and alleged abuse, as well as harassment from family members who learned of the affair. The charges leveled in the lawsuit include assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and false imprisonment, according to the Tulsa World. A conspiracy?: Muscogee Indian Chief George Tiger has been accused of abusing his mistress and conspiring with relatives to cover it up . Townsend has accused Tiger of throwing her to the ground and wrestling a phone from her hands shortly after she threatened to call his wife about the affair in one of many instances of abuse, reported the World. Additionally, tribe Attorney General Roger Wiley and Dennis Northcross, patrol captain, Lighthorse Tribal Police, are accused of helping their brother Tiger cover-up both the alleged incidences of abuse and the affair itself. ‘My focus is going to be just continuing to work on the positive things for the Muscogee (Creek) Nation,’ Tiger said when contacted by the World for comment on the suit, then declining when pressed for more information. Townsend's attorney told the paper that his client spent years in ‘a turbulent and emotionally manipulative relationship with Tiger,’ adding ‘she thought she was in love, and for him it was a game throughout.’ It was just a game: The mistress' attorney said his client was in love, but it was all just a game to Tiger . Additional harassment accusations have also been leveled against Kendra Root and Molly Moore, also relatives of Tiger. Among the occurrences of harassment cited in the suit, Moore and Root sandwiched Townsend’s vehicle between them, driving in two separate cars, the World reported. The spurned mistress asked for an order of protection against the two women and subpoenaed her former lover to appear at a hearing for the order – Lighthorse Tribal Police refused to serve the order, according to the World. Wiley explained the tribe’s resistance in a letter to the local county clerk, which Townsend characterized as part of the ‘cover up for the personal misdeeds of George (Tiger) and Kendra (Root),’ reported the World. ‘The Muscogee (Creek) Nation is not subject to the jurisdiction of the Oklahoma Courts and is not required, absent an order from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation District Court to give full faith and credit to the Okmulgee County subpoena,’ said the letter, according to the World. Tiger denied to the paper he had been served a subpoena, saying ‘I haven’t seen any paperwork.’ Townsend once worked as a consultant for the Muscogee tribe, both for the Indian nation’s housing division and Tiger personally.","The suit alleges abuse and harassment from Chief George Tiger and numerous relatives .

Four more people have died from the new strain, bringing to the total number of deaths from the H7N9 virus to 31, Chinese health officials revealed yesterday. Meanwhile, the number of infections has risen by two to 129, with health experts saying that the disease is probably being spread by poultry. Quick and easy: A crate of newborn chicks is tipped into a pot of boiling water as the mass extermination of poultry continues in China triggered by the current outbreak of H7N9 bird flu in the country . Desperate measures: Four more people have died from the new strain, bringing to the total number of deaths from the H7N9 virus to 31, Chinese health officials revealed yesterday . Boiled alive: The number of infections caused by the new virus has risen by two to 129, with health experts saying that the disease is probably being spread by poultry . Chicken farms facing official demands to dispose of as many birds as possible have now resorted to to killing off newborn chicks by plunging them in boiling water. These photographs were taken at a poultry farm in Qingyuan city, in Guangdong province, south-east China, where as many as 30,000 new born chicks were dumped into boiling water to be killed every day. Farm spokesman Fai T'ien said: 'Before this virus outbreak we were hatching around 100,000 chicks a day. We have now cut that down to 50,000 and it is still too many and we are having to kill most of them. 'We are putting a few aside to be vaccinated and sold onto the market but most are having to be killed by boiling them.' Desperate to live: These photographs were taken at a poultry farm in Qingyuan city, in Guangdong province, south-east China, where as many as 30,000 new born chicks a day were dumped into boiling water to be killed . Grim work: A worker fishes dead birds from the bubbling pot, as thousands more packed in crates behind him wait to meet their fate. The Chinese government has ordered the mass extermination of birds . Not much better in store for this lot: Farm spokesman Fai T'ien said some of the newborn chickens were being put aside for vaccination and sale for slaughter, but most of their birds are having to be boiled alive . Farmers say that boiling is the easiest and quickest way to kill the chicks but there has been criticism by animal-rights activists who say that has to be a better way to deal with the problem. The Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO) has said it has no evidence that the new strain of bird flu, which was first detected in patients in China in March, is easily transmissible between humans. Chinese scientists have confirmed that the H7N9 strain has been transmitted to humans from chickens. But the WHO has said 40 per cent of people infected with H7N9 appear to have had no contact with poultry. The Chinese government provided only scant details about the latest victims of H7N9. Two occurred in the eastern province of Jiangsu; one was from eastern Zhejiang; while another was from central Anhui, based on a Reuters analysis of the data provided by Chinese health authorities on Monday. The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the current strain of bird flu cannot spark a pandemic in its current form. He added, however, that there is no guarantee it will not mutate and become more dangerous.","Up to 30,000 chickens are being boiled alive every day at ONE FARM alone .

He then received five pictures of the men slaughtering and mutilating the sheep with a knife or blade. 'In another picture Davidson was stood in Sherratt's home holding up the lamb's head. Another text said: ""Lamb sorted. Only Yorkshires needed now"".' Mr Pover said other messages bragged about the brutal killing. One text from Davidson said: 'I hope we didn't scare you with all this. We were a bit (drunk) and thought about Sunday dinner. It was funny when the hammer went through that skull. Think I might have found my new career as a butcher not a builder'.' Another from Sherratt said: 'It was well funny. I held it down and said do not hit my hand with that hammer. What does he do, but on the killer blow hit my hand with the hammer. It hurt my knuckle. He is a lunatic.' The police found bags containing the animal's body parts and bloodied tools in a shed at Sherratt's home. Mr Pover told the court: 'Sherratt told police they were drunk at home and decided they wanted a roast dinner. He said he had hunted smaller animals. Sick pranksters: Davidson, 28, (left) and Sherratt, 33, pleaded guilty to criminal damage and theft of the sheep when they appeared before magistrates . 'They decided to kill a sheep and got a claw hammer and serrated knife. They went to a field during the night, caught a sheep by running alongside it, pushing it and pinning it to the floor. 'He said the first blow killed it but they took an extra two or three strokes to make sure. They both skinned the animal. 'Davidson told police he had spent three days at Sherratt's house and been drunk throughout. He couldn't remember much but recalled being in a field with a sheep.' Trevor Feehily, defending, said the incident had been triggered by alcohol. He said: 'It doesn't excuse what either of them have done. Both said it was drunken and complete stupidity.' Police wanted to charge Davidson and Sherratt with animal cruelty, but they could not prove the sheep had suffered. They will be sentenced on June 7.","Matthew Davidson, 28, and Kevin Sherratt, 33, admit mutilating the animal .

Confidence in the British economy is at its highest level since the Coalition came to power amid signs the recovery is gathering pace. A report published today by polling experts YouGov and the Centre for Economics and Business Research think tank shows the mood among UK households is the most optimistic since April 2010. It means confidence has returned to levels not seen since Labour was booted from office in May 2010 as the economy reeled from the aftermath of the financial crisis and the biggest boom and bust in British history. Growing: Confidence in the British economy is at its highest level since the Coalition came to power amid signs the recovery is gathering pace . The UK remains trapped in the longest downturn for more than a century with economic output more than 3 per cent below the pre-recession peak reached in early 2008. But official figures published today are expected to show the recovery strengthened this spring following growth of 0.3 per cent between January and March. Analysts believe that gross domestic product grew by around 0.6 per cent between April and June - the fastest pace since the Olympics boosted output last summer - although it is hoped the number could be even higher. A strong figure will come as a relief to George Osborne who believes that Britain is finally on the road to recovery. Relief: Chancellor George Osborne yesterday welcomed figures showing Britain attracted more investment from overseas than any other European country last year, creating thousands of jobs . The Chancellor yesterday welcomed figures showing Britain attracted more investment from overseas than any other European country last year, creating thousands of jobs. ‘In today’s global race this is very encouraging,’ he said. The report by YouGov and the CEBR puts its ‘consumer confidence index’ at 104.6 - the highest level for more than three years. It says the resurgence in consumer confidence is down to a number of factors - including rising house prices and improving job security. ‘British households are pulling out of a nosedive and consumers’ economic optimism is moving in the right direction,’ said YouGov’s Stephen Harmston. ‘With consumer spending accounting for so much of GDP, households have a key role to play in economic growth.’ But the report warns that many households still expect their financial situation to deteriorate over the next 12 months as rising prices eat into wages and savings. Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the CEBR, said the ‘key question’ was how long the ‘uptick’ in the economy can last. ‘There are fragilities beneath the surface,’ he said. ‘Nonetheless, we are seeing real, sustained improvement in the UK economy. 'It’s the first time we’ve been able to say that since the initial recovery from deep recession in 2009.’ A survey by the CBI yesterday showed factory output rose again this month as the manufacturing sector took a further step on the road to recovery. Firms won new orders at the fastest pace since April 2012. Domestic orders recorded the strongest growth in a year while export orders rose at the fastest rate in more than two years. But Annalisa Piazza, a senior economist at financial broker Newedge Strategy, said ‘exports remain a pocket of weakness for the UK economy’ as the crisis in the eurozone saps demand. A separate report by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors showed the outlook for Britain’s struggling builders is finally improving after years of decline. ‘It is clearly good news that the amount of construction taking place across the country seems to have turned a corner,’ said Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the trade body. ‘But this modest improvement comes after a long period of contraction and many businesses in the sector are still struggling to keep their heads above water.’ The construction industry was hammered in the financial crisis with output down by nearly a fifth since 2008.","Report shows mood among UK households best since April 2010 .

Lord McAlpine is to ask police to investigate Twitter users who made ‘malicious communications’ against him. The Tory peer plans to make a formal complaint today against potentially thousands who falsely named him as a paedophile – but who have failed to ‘repent’ for their actions. Up to 10,000 Twitter users are thought to have tweeted about the former Tory Party treasurer’s alleged – but subsequently disproved – involvement in child abuse. Lawyers said the Lord McAlpine, pictured, case could potentially involve the largest number of defendants in British legal history. It is unclear how many have now apologised and agreed to pay a nominal sum as requested to Children in Need, but two days ago just 40 had done so. The police complaint could lead to a mass prosecution, leading to fines, or even imprisonment for up to six months, and criminal records for the large numbers who wrote about the peer online. The inquiry is the latest escalation of the affair which began when the BBC2 flagship Newsnight commissioned research into claims that a senior Tory was involved in child abuse at a children’s home in Wrexham. The alleged victim later withdrew his claim, leading to the resignation of the BBC director general George Entwistle. The BBC has already settled with the peer for £185,000. Lord McAlpine is also understood to . be seeking up to £500,000 in damages from ITV after This Morning . presenter Phillip Schofield showed a list of alleged Tory paedophiles to . David Cameron. Now the peer’s lawyers are believed . to have identified 1,000 people who sent their own tweets implying or . directly saying he was a paedophile – and a further 9,000 who . ‘retweeted’ the claims to others. Among those potentially involved are . comedian Alan Davies, who tweeted about ‘this Tory paedophile’, and then . named Lord McAlpine, to his 440,000 followers. Guardian columnist . George Monbiot also tweeted about the peer. BBC controversy: Lord McAlpine announced last week that he is taking landmark legal action against internet gossips who falsely branded him a paedophile after BBC's Newsnight broadcast the wrong claims . Mistake: Sally Bercow took to Twitter to comment on speculation as to the identity of the Tory at the centre of a Newsnight investigation and could be sued . Lord McAlpine’s legal team claim that the offending tweets are criminal offences under the Malicious Communications Act 1988, or alternatively under the Communications Act 2003’s prohibition against ‘improper use of a public electronic communications network’. Earlier this month, nine people were prosecuted for circulating on Facebook and Twitter the name of a woman raped by a footballer. Each defendant was ordered to pay the rape victim £624 in damages. Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, is among those accused of revealing Lord McAlpine’s name after tweeting: ‘Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*’. This week she blundered again by tweeting the name of a schoolgirl who ran away to France with her teacher, risking a £5,000 fine for contempt of court. Yesterday Mrs Bercow’s Twitter account suddenly disappeared. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Lord McAlpine's lawyers have found 1,000 original tweets and 9,000 retweets .

Boris Kovalyov may only be 32 but he has spent most of his adult life serving in some of Russia's toughest prisons. Within months of being released early from a sentence for theft at a prison camp near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, he was sent back for drug-trafficking. There he endured one of the hardest penal regimes in the world. Daily chores: Inmate Boris Kovalyov, 32, was sentenced to eight years in a high-security prison camp for drug trafficking . Stark: The male prison camp outside Russia's Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk where some of the country's most serious or prolific criminals are jailed . Heightened security: Men considered especially dangerous are kept in a separate zone (pictured) with even stricter conditions . Exercise: Like most prisons, Krasnoyarsk works to a tight schedule. Here, inmates walk inside an enclosure at a high-security male prison camp for their daily exercise . Inmates: Prisoners at camp number 17 tend to be men who are serving their first sentences for serious offences. Pictured left, they stand in formation in the bitter cold . Penal system: Russia is thought to have about 850,000 convicts in its prison system. About 60,000 of them are women who are held in single-sex camps . Russian law means that if a convict reoffends, they must serve the time they were spared by release. He was sentenced to eight years in a high-security prison camp and after . two years at a prison near the village of Ariyskhe, he was moved back to the strict prison of Krasnoyarsk. Guards holding rifles can be seen watching constantly from observation towers as visitors move in and out of the 'zone'. Visitors must surrender their passports and ID cards before even stepping into the main buildings. The weather also does not help the feeling of isolation at the prison either. Siberia suffers long cold winters where temperatures inside the camp can fall to as low as -11C. Krasnoyarsk houses many inmates who have multiple convictions for serious crimes. But the Gulag tag is now, partially at least, in the past. The penal system that solely focussed on punishment has given way slightly to one of reform. Prisoners at camp number five work in wood and metal processing shops, . manufacture furniture, sew clothes and do other kinds of work. They can . also take part in educational, sport and cultural programmes. Unlike the Gulags of the past, inmates are encouraged to pray. Behind bars: Boris Kovalyov stands inside a cell as he receives a letter from his wife. He spent much of his adult life in prison . Competitor: Kovalyov plays an accordion as he prepares for an inter-prison talent contest. He earned a degree and captained sports during his incarceration . Anticipation: Kovalyov, 32, walks through the prison in the days leading up to his early release for good behaviour and participation in sports and cultural activities . A free man: Kovalyov, 32, walks out of the discharge procedure after completing six and a half years of his eight year sentence for drug trafficking . New life: Kovalyov, 32, (centre) could not hide his emotions as he met his wife Galina (right) and a relative after being released . A 19th century wooden church was disassembled on the suburbs of Krasnoyarsk and transported to the prison for the inmates. It is through the education programmes that inmates such as Mr Kovalyov are given their best chance at success - and early release. He finished high school while serving his sentence and received a degree through his study. Mr Kovalyov also threw himself into extra-curricular activities. Photojounalist Ilya Naymushin, who visited the prison, said Mr Kovalyov . learned editing and produced reports for his fellow inmates and worked . as a cameraman on the prison television station. He also became a joiner and machinist in the camp and also captained the football, volleyball and basketball teams. Mr Naymushin said it was that attitude which set him apart. He said: 'Boris adapted to this environment well, finding a common language with prisoners and personnel.' It was at one of his clubs that Mr Kovalyov discovered that he was being . released two and a half years before the end of his sentence in 2015. Mr Naymushin said photographing the inmate as he left the camp was very emotional. The former inmate, then a free man, was met by his wife Galina, who stood by him despite his years inside. Security: An officer searches an inmate at a control point between work and residential zones. Even visitors must surrender their ID cards and passports at the gate . Dinner time: The queue of inmates waiting for their meals at Krasnoyarsk prison stretches back across the entire room . Hungry: Inmates serve their fellow prisoners food such as soup, bread and vegetables . Religious life: An Orthodox priest leads the Easter service among inmates inside an Orthodox church set inside the high-security prison camp . Orthodox church: The 19th century wooden church was disassembled from the nearby city of Krasnoyarsk and transferred into the camp . Gloomy: They may not be furnished with the home comforts of the past but the prison is a far cry from the Gulag conditions last century . Jobs: A worker stands on his tip toes as he tries to hang out dozens of sheets. Prison inmates are given jobs including working at the bath and laundry building. Learning skills: Some prisoners take part in lessons at the metal processing shop within the prison camp walls . Mr Naymushin said: 'I saw him part with friends in prison and, 20 paces later, . greet others waiting outside the gate. They tried to restrain their . emotions, but he could not. 'Five and a half years in prison camp were behind him. Ahead – the . chance of a new life. Whether he will take it or end up behind the . barbed wire again is unknown.' Although improved, prisons in Russia are still suffocating places. Mr Naymushin said: 'I have been taking photographs in the prison camps of Siberia for about 15 years, so my first impressions were of the past. One can get used to a lot of things, prison among them, but even a short time inside these places brings on a stark, visceral feeling that the restriction of freedom is contradictory to human nature. Russia is thought to have about 850,000 convicts in its prison system, with many sentenced to forced labour. About 60,000 prisoners are women, held in single-sex camps. As of 2010, about 560 out of every 100,000 people in Russia were behind bars. Russia incarcerates more people than any country in the world bar the United States and China, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies.

A New York man has admitted to trying to extort $200,00 from embattled celebrity chef Paula Deen as dealt with a backlash over her admitted use of racial slurs in the past. Prosecutors filed a notice in U.S. District Court in Savannah last . Wednesday saying 62-year-old Thomas George Paculis 'has signed his plea . agreement.' A change-of-plea hearing was scheduled Friday afternoon . before Judge William T. Moore Jr. No details of the agreement were given . in the court filings. Paculis' defense attorney, Richard Darden, declined to . comment Monday. James Durham, chief assistant prosecutor for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Savannah, also would not discuss the deal. Thomas George Paculis, 62, has pleaded guilty to extortion charges after allegedly threatening to go to the press with statements made by Paula Deen unless she paid him off . Downfall: Paula Deen, pictured weeping during a recent appearance on the Today show, was fired from the Food Network last month after admitting to using the 'N-word' Paculis of Newfield, New York, pleaded not guilty July 16 to two counts . of using interstate communications to try to extort money from Deen. The . FBI says he contacted one of Deen's lawyers by email a few days after . Deen's culinary empire began to crumble when documents became public . showing that the former Food Network star acknowledged using the 'N-word' in the past. Deen made the statement under oath as she was questioned by . attorneys in a 2012 harassment and discrimination lawsuit by former . employee Lisa Jackson. In the June 24 email to . attorney Gary Hodges, Paculis said he was . about to go public with statements that were 'true and damning enough . that the case for Jackson will be won on its merits alone' and added . 'there is a price for such information,' according to a criminal . complaint filed in the case. Hodges contacted the FBI, which directed . the attorney to communicate with Paculis by email and later by phone. Details of Deen's alleged remarks and the relationship between Paculis and Deen remains unclear. Strangers: FBI agents investigating the extortion case showed Deen photos of Paculis, and she didn't recognize him or his name . Authorities say Paculis initially asked that Deen pay him $250,000 to . keep quiet, but Hodges negotiated the amount down to $200,000. Paculis . told Hodges he was house-sitting in New York, didn't have a car and . didn't know how he was going to collect the money, the complaint says. Federal agents arrested Paculis in early July and brought him to . Georgia. After entering his initial plea, Paculis was granted a $10,000 . bond and allowed to return to New York on the condition that he stay . away from Deen and her businesses. Records in the case don't say . specifically what information Paculis claimed to know about Deen. The . FBI said it showed Deen a photograph of the suspect and she said she . didn't recognize him or his name. The civil suit filed last year by Jackson, a former manager of Uncle . Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House, says she was sexually harassed and . worked in an environment rife with racial slurs and innuendo. The . restaurant is owned by Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers. Asked . in her deposition if she had ever used the N-word, Deen replied: ‘Yes, . of course.’ But she also insisted ‘it’s been a very long time.’ Threat: Paculis wrote several emails to Deen's lawyer, telling him that the information in his possession 'would damage your client in so many ways that it would sink your ship before it left the dock' Dark past: In 2004, Paculis (far right) had a run-in with the law in connection to an apparent DUI incident that landed him in jail for 14 days . On . his Facebook page, Paculis got into an argument with another user about . the scandal surrounding Paula Deen's racially charged statements, . writing in a post from June 29: 'the woman is a raceist [sic].' Like Deen, Peculis owns a restaurant in Savannah. His establishment is called the Troupe Square Cafe. Photos on his Facebook page show the 63-year-old sporting a white double-breasted chef's jacket and posing against the background of a kitchen. Before going into the restaurant business, the 62-year-old worked as an EMT. In 2004, he had a run-in with the law in connection to a DUI incident that landed him in jail for 14 days.

A four-year-old boy was allegedly beaten to death with a belt by his mother and step-father after a computer glitch at the Department of Child Services failed to pick up abuse claims against them, it has emerged. Little Ty'Reke Evans, from Chattanooga, Tennessee, died in December 2011 with rib fractures, lacerations to his liver and bowels, needle punctures, brain swelling and bruises and welts that looked as if he had been beaten with a belt, doctors said. Ty'Reke's younger brother, who was then three, was also admitted to hospital with liver abrasions and bruises to his body but survived. He is now in protective custody. Their mother, Patricia Brewer, 25, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Coleman, 23, have been charged with child abuse, child neglect and murder and are due in court for a preliminary hearing on Monday. Victim: Four-year-old Ty'reke Evans was beaten to death in December 2011 even though the Department of Child Services in Tennessee had received numerous calls about potential abuse . It has now emerged that the DCS had received calls about the family, but that a glitch in the computer system meant staff did not connect the cases, the Tennessean reported. In the weeks before Ty'Reke's death, the DCS received at least three claims of child abuse from family and pre-school teachers - with one noting his bruises and saying the 'situation is escalating'. But one child abuse report made on November 11, 2011 was given to one caseworker, while two further reports made on December 7 and December 8 were given to a different worker. It meant that the two caseworkers were unaware of the other calls or that the family was already under investigation; if they had known, there could have been swifter actions, the paper noted. Accused: His mother, Patricia Brewer, and her boyfriend, Kenneth Coleman, were arrested after the death . DCS records point out that there were 'technical challenges' with the $27 million data system, the Tennessee Family and Child Tracking System or TFACTS. 'The TFACTS system, for some reason, did not make the connection when the reports came in,' read the records. 'With the volume of referrals that are assigned on a daily basis there were no opportunities to make the connection.' The records also show that some entries showing the department's investigation of the family were not entered into the system until five months after the boy's death - rather than the 30 days required. Spokesman Rob Johnson told the paper that some records show that staff had been meeting with law enforcement and prosecutors, who were deciding whether to go ahead with criminal charges. TFACTS, which was created in August 2010, . underwent a $4 million system upgrade after legal advocates complained . its problems had reached a 'crisis' stage. Hurt: Ty'reke's little brother Donamiche also suffered lacerations and bruising but survived . Other issues included failures to issue payments for foster families or being unable to track child deaths. Children's Rights noted there had been significant improvements earlier this year. Brewer and Coleman will appear in court on Monday to hear if they will be tried separately. Ty'Reke's biological father is now seeking custody of his surviving son. His attorney, Tabitha Finch, said: 'I am very disappointed by how this case has been handled by DCS. People look to DCS for protection for children. If policies had been adhered to, this situation may have ended differently.' Brewer's attorney said she was a caring mother who did not harm her children.","Ty'reke Evans died of blunt force trauma in December 2011 .

Bill Edwards, 21, was arrested for attempted murder after confronting a metal thief on his property . A farmer accused of attempted murder after catching an intruder red-handed has been banned from keeping firearms - despite being cleared of any crime. Bill Edwards, 21, caught unemployed criminal David Taylor on his land stealing metal and fired his shotgun at the thief's vehicle as it was speeding towards his mother Louisa Smith, 50. He then chased the van until it was stopped in the next village by police. But it was Mr Edwards who endured a horrendous ordeal at the hands of police who arrested him on suspicion of attempted murder and confiscated his guns. Taylor, from Scarborough, later walked free from court laughing with just a £100 fine for theft, after claiming he was 'traumatised' by the incident. But Mr Edwards' firearms certificate has been revoked by North Yorkshire Police, who branded him 'a danger to public safety or the peace'. The former boarding school pupil has appealed against the decision to a crown court judge and faces ruin if it fails. 'It will stop me farming,' he said. 'If I can’t get my certificates back soon I won’t be able to continue farming. I have also lost my only hobby - shooting. 'In addition to losing my own farming, much of my work is for other . farmers who expect me to control pests for them too. 'Not doing this . makes me much less employable in a place where there are already too . many farm workers and not enough jobs. 'I am really struggling to find any work, and if it wasn’t for my father’s support I’d have had to stop already.' The young farmer has had his firearms licence revoked, despite being cleared of any crime . Mr Edwards relies on his guns for his livelihood and is now struggling to find any work . He added that his guns had been 'ruined' while in the hands of the police. 'It looks like they have played hockey with them - and kept them in damp storage conditions,' he said. The farmer, from Scalby, Scarborough, was arrested last summer on suspicion of attempting to murder Taylor. He always maintained he only turned his shotgun on the van because he feared for the life of his mother as Taylor sped towards her. His four shotguns and two rifles - worth at least £3,000 - were all confiscated when he was arrested in August. When he was finally released from police bail on December 20 he was given a letter from North Yorkshire Police saying they were going to review his suitability to hold a firearms certificate. Bill’s father Garry Edwards, 67, from Bradford, said: 'The police have finally revoked Bill’s certificates and passed his guns to me. All the guns are badly damaged. Unemployed criminal David Taylor (left) walked free from court in January with just a £100 fine, despite having allegedly driven his van towards Louisa Smith (right), forcing her son to fire the shots to protect her . 'In theory, I can finally now do his pest control for him. But even if I had enough time to do it properly it’s now far too late, the foxes are completely out of control and Bill will probably go out of business.' A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'As Mr Edwards has appealed against the decision to revoke his firearms certificate it would not be appropriate to comment until the court proceedings have been completed.' The British Association of Shooting and Conservation, the national representative body for shooting sports, has shown support for Mr Edwards. Senior Firearms Officer Matt Perring said: 'A gun is absolutely essential to a farmer. There is nothing like having your own gun to control the land.' He said employers needed farm workers who were trusted to carry guns to stop pests and vermin attacking crops. 'Otherwise, it’s like asking someone to put up a fence with a broken arm,' Mr Perring added.

More than 270 government staff are employed on zero-hours contracts, despite Nick Clegg warning they cause ‘worrying levels of insecurity’ for workers. Five ministries admitted having employees working in departments and agencies on contracts that give them no guarantee of a regular income. It leaves the coalition at risks of being accused of encouraging the use of the controversial deals, which are also in use at Buckingham Palace, the National Trust and several big name high street chains. Uncertainty: More than 270 staff in Whitehall and quangos are on contracts which do not guarantee any work . According to latest figures released in Parliament, there are 278 people employed by departments and quangos on zero-hours contracts. It includes 172 at the Ministry of Justice, five at the Foreign Office and two at the Department for Communities and Local Government. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that its agencies have 48 people on the contracts and the Department of Health said its quangos employed 51 without guaranteeing them any work. The revelation is embarrassing for Mr Clegg, who this week warned families needed to know what hours they will be working in order to plan their bill payments. Criticism: Deputy PM Nick Clegg said he was concerned that the use of zero-hours deals meant families could not plan their income . The Deputy PM said the government was reviewing the use of zero-hours contracts and a decision on whether to limit them could be made this autumn. He said: ‘I am a huge advocate of flexibility in the British labour market, it’s one of the reasons we have not suffered the spikes in adult unemployment that we have seen in other countries. ‘But there has to be a balance. There can be a really worrying level of insecurity if you are employed on zero-hours contracts. ‘People with families have got to pay bills. We have all got to plan about what income we have and what we have got to pay out.’ He said Vince Cable’s business . department was reviewing the use of the contracts this summer ‘to see if . we need to make any adjustments’ to employment law. This week it emerged Buckingham Palace had around 350 part-time workers on zero-hours contracts. They . were drafted in to cover the opening of the Queen's London home this . summer but denied usual rights like holiday and are not certain of a . single hour's employment. Zero-hours . contracts do not set a minimum number of hours that have to be worked, . with staff on call all the time, not knowing whether they will have work . from one week or month to the next. Unlike . the self-employed who can work for who the like, workers on zero-hours . contracts must ask for permission from their bosses if they want to earn . cash elsewhere. And although workers are able to turn down work, many fear that doing so means they will not be asked again in the future. Popular: People queue every year to enter Buckingham Palace for its annual Summer Opening, but it emerged this week that temporary staff are on controversial zero-hours contracts . Temporary staff working in the . Buckingham Palace shop, meeting and greeting visitors and monitoring . some of the Palace's grandest rooms are on deals like this to keep down . costs. Royal officials have denied these are zero-hours contracts because they rota staff a month in advance, not at the last minute. It . has previously emerged that employees at other national institutions – . including 3,700 staff at the National Trust – are also on the deals, . meaning that workers at many of Britain’s grandest stately homes are not . guaranteed a single hour’s paid employment. It . has also been alleged that cinema giant Cineworld's part-time workers . and catering staff at the Tate galleries in London, Liverpool and in St . Ives, Cornwall, are similarly treated. Some 20,000 staff at Sports Direct, which is controlled by billionaire founder Mike Ashley, are also on the same contracts. Uncertainty: Some 90 per cent of workers at 396 stores are now on zero-hour contracts with the company . More than 90 per cent of the company’s UK shop workers are on part-time contracts that do not guarantee them a single hour’s paid employment. Employment lawyers warn the contracts make it difficult to manage family and childcare commitments, and present problems when budgeting to pay household bills or getting a mortgage. Yesterday the Office for National Statistics revealed 250,000 were employed on zero-hours contracts last year, 50,000 more than previously thought. A recent report by the Resolution Foundation into zero-hour contracts concluded: ‘The benefits these contracts provide for employers come at too high a price for the majority of those employed on them.’ On its website, the Citizens Advice Bureau says: ‘The problem with zero [hour] contracts is that you are only paid for the time you work, so even if you have to wait on work premises or be at home waiting by the phone, you may not be paid for this waiting time.’","Around 278 temps do not get guaranteed hours or holiday pay .

His personal life is in disarray after he drunkenly attacked a fan at a five-course dinner. Now Gregg Wallace’s professional affairs have also come under strain as the hotel chain that hosted the event has dropped his restaurant from another of its luxury hotels. The MasterChef judge will close Gregg’s Bar and Grill, in London’s Bermondsey Square Hotel, following a series of scathing reviews by critics who branded it a 'travesty' and a 'joke'. The premises are run by Bespoke Hotels, which also owns the four-star Wood Norton Hotel near Evesham, Worcestershire, where Wallace was involved in Saturday’s brawl. The 48-year-old punched magazine publisher Paul Bates while hosting a £75-a-head question-and-answer session. Wallace claimed Bates had fondled the bottom of his 27-year-old girlfriend Anne-Marie Sterpini. A . source close to Wallace said: ‘Gregg wanted to…concentrate on other . business interests.’ The restaurant had a rocky start when it was set up in February last year receiving poor reviews. It went through a major rebrand just months later . Originally named Gregg’s Table, the restaurant was forced to appoint a new head chef just two months after opening its doors. Its offerings of ‘good, honest food’ - inspired by 1970s British classics such as avocado prawn and Chicken Kiev - proved unpopular with critics and diners alike, who found it hard to justify the £80 per head cost of a meal. Clear up: Gregg's Bar and Grill - formerly Gregg's Table - is set to close . Meanwhile, Wallace blamed the collapse of Secretts Direct on catastrophic farming conditions, adding: ‘It is really disappointing. Everyone knows how close the greengrocer business has been to my heart – it put me on the path to where I am today.’ He added: ‘I’m still a greengrocer. I supply restaurants in London. I’m a very good salesman. I could sell sand to the Arabs.’ Mr Wallace also runs a café and brasserie in Putney, west London, called Wallace & Co. Yesterday, a spokesmen for Gregg Wallace and the Bermondsey Square Hotel issued a joint statement: ‘As was always the case and both parties had discussed over a month ago, the two-year agreement with Gregg Wallace at Bermondsey Square is coming to a natural end later this year. ‘There is no change to this arrangement and any suggestion to the contrary would be entirely unfounded.'","Gregg's Bar and Grill in London's branded 'travesty' and 'joke' by critics .

This isn't the first major arrest for 32-year-old Beezow. He became an unpronounceable household name when he was arrested in January 2012 in a Madison, Wisconsin park. His jazzy name was the talk of local news stations and the punchline of late night comedy shows. Jimmy Kimmel famously made fun of the way anchors struggled to say his name in the news. Scroll down for video . The name game: Beezow became a household name when he was arrested in Madison, Wisconsin in January 2012. Now he's back in jail on drug possession charges again . Beezow was arrested July 20 after police pulled over a turquoise minivan weaving between lanes in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Deputies found .60 ounces of marijuana in a mason jar as well as drug paraphernalia on Beezow and his passenger Zacahary Marinan. He faces a felony charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, possession of drug paraphernalia and operation of a motor vehicle without registration according to Iowa court records obtained by the Wisconsin State-Journal. His trial is set for September 17 on the felony charge . If convicted he could face five years behind bars . Born Jeffrey Drew Wilschke, Beezow changed his name two years ago to something 'more fitting' for himself. In an interview with the State Journal last year, he explained the deep meaning behind each of his taken names. Back in the news: Beezow's original mugshot from his January 2012 arrest. The newest charges in Iowa could put him behind bars for as much as five years . He explained that his first name represents 'the explosion of awareness of the interconnectedness of the infinite love in the universe' and that Doo-doo 'is the struggle of our daily lives with that awareness, that with love comes chaos.' His last name, Zopittybop-bop-bop 'is the outcome of that struggle, which is often ironic, especially because all life ends in death.' While his name may sound funny, his two arrests are evidence of a much sadder story. A diagnosed schizophrenic, Beezow has been in and out of the mental health system. Beezow doesn't believe the diagnosis and refuses to take anti-psychotic drugs, saying instead he suffers from severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from abuse he suffered on the street while homeless. Still, in the past he has expressed interest in being treated at a mental health facility. 'I'd really benefit from a stay in a mental hospital if I could persue treatment at my own pace and not with drugs,' he said.","Zoppittybop-bop-bop was born Jeffrey Drew Wilschke, but changed his name two years ago to something 'more fitting'

Rock etchings uncovered in a dried-up Nevada lake bed dating back at least 10,000 years could be the oldest in North America. The carvings in the desert were found on boulders that formed the shoreline of Winnemucca Lake, and could even be up to 14,800 years old. They are believed by scientists in the Journal of Archaeological Science to be older than carvings in Long Lake, Oregon that date back 7,600 years. Ancient: These limestone boulders in northern Nevada are covered in North America's oldest etchings . Mysterious: Because of their location they are thought to be drawn by the Paiute Tribe but scientists are yet to confirm who carved them . Those carvings were preserved in ash from the Mount Mazama volcano eruption but have now been  overtaken as North America's oldest. Later drawings usually depict weapons and animals such as spears or antelopes, but these Nevada carvings are deeply-carved geometric designs. Because of their location they are thought to be drawn by the Paiute Tribe, who occupied the area 35 miles north of Reno. They could even be as much as 14,800 years old, said Larry Benson, the curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Natural History Museum and geochemist who co-wrote the paper. His testing shows that the limestone . boulders were exposed to air between 14,800 and 13,200 years ago and . then again between 11,300 and 10,500 years ago when they were above the . lake's water line. He used radiocarbon testing to date them and explained that even if they turned out to be the conservative estimate of only around 10,000 years old they would still be North America's oldest carvings. Geometric: Later drawings usually depict weapons and animals such as spears or antelopes, but these consist of large, deeply carved grooves and dots . Complex: Scientists believe the etchings may represent meteorological symbols such as clouds and lightning, and perhaps the Milky Way . Dennis Jenkins, an archaeologist at the University of Oregon, said that the biggest challenge is now trying to determine who carved them. 'If you speak with Native Americans they will tell you they were made there and that is obviously their people and their artwork,' Jenkins explained. 'But approaching it from a scientific point of view, it is impossible to connect these to any tribal group.'","Ancient geometric shapes were found in a dried-up lake in Nevada .

Ms Griffiths has already lost all of her 15lbs of baby weight and is now back at home with Isla, who is feeding well and growing at a healthy rate . Ms Griffiths (pictured two years before she developed anorexia) blames her eating disorder on the pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes . Recalling her first pregnancy Ms Griffiths, from Greenwich, south London, said: ‘I was so lucky he was OK.’ ‘I felt so guilty I had put his life at risk. 'I didn't ever expect to get pregnant. I think it is pretty rare. 'I was at my darkest point when I got pregnant with Dylan. I was the thinnest I had ever been. I was the sickest I had ever been. Ms Griffiths is determined to continue treatment and reach a healthy weight to be a good role model for her two children. Image shows Isla at her 20 week scan . 'I had this massive guilt every time I ate because the anorexia still had a massive grip on me. And then I had massive guilt for not feeding, or not considering feeding my child.’ Ms Griffiths, who is 5ft 7ins was eight when she started battling with her weight. She blames her condition on the pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes. During her first pregnancy, with Dylan (pictured), Ms Griffiths suffered broken ribs because her frame was too small for the growing child . By 12 she had been admitted to a children's psychiatric clinic weighing just 5st 5lb - about 3st underweight. Holly has now increased her daily calorie intake to 1600 calories and is even managing to enjoy treats like cake, something she wouldn't have been able to eat during her pregnancy. ‘In the future I'm going back to treatment as and outpatient and I hope to kick it for good, it's really important for me to be able to be something that my kids want to emulate,’ she said. ‘I'm desperate to recover so I can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food. ‘I couldn't bear it if they had body issues like me, so I'm continuing to fight the voices in my head and get better for them.’","Holly Griffiths, 21, gave birth to Isla after 37 weeks of pregnancy .

A blundering crook made the worst decision of his criminal career when he decided to pull a knife on Florida's top policeman. Larry Jackson, 56, thought Timothy Liberatore would be an easy victim after spotting him walking near the Marion County courthouse in Ocala. He approached his target with one hand wrapped up in a towel, which he flicked off to reveal a folding knife with a 5"" blade. Blundering crook Larry Jackson is back behind bars after attempting to mug Florida's top law enforcement officer . However he hadn't reckoned with the fact that Mr Liberatore was not only a Sheriff's Corporal but had just last week been named the Florida Sheriffs Association's law enforcement officer of the year. Cpl. Liberatore just pulled out his handgun, pointed it at Jackson and after identifying himself ordered him to drop the knife, before calling for help. Jackson was soon sitting handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser and was later charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. State records show he has been in and out of prison for the past 10 years for offenses including burglary, grand theft and petty theft. He was last released from a Florida prison in June 2012, Ocala.com reports. Meanwhile Cpl Liberatore has served with the sheriffs office for 10 years working as a patrol deputy, a drug agent and is currently assigned to the Tactical Investigations Unit in the Crime Suppression Division. Last year alone he made a staggering 260 arrests which resulted in 115 felony and 167 misdemeanor charges, according to the Sheriff's Office. In addition to the rank of corporal, he also is considered to be a master deputy.","Larry Jackson tried to mug Sheriff's Cpl. Timothy .

As a star of Britain’s oldest television soap, he has been involved in some dramatic storylines. But it is clear that Charlie Condou’s life off-screen is equally colourful. The gay actor, who plays midwife Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, has spoken of how he became a father of two after making a pact with his straight female friend Catherine Kanter. Modern family: From left Cameron Laux, Charlie Condou, Catherine Kanter and their daughter Georgia . They agreed that if she didn’t find her ‘Mr Right’ by the time she was 40 they would embark on parenthood together. Thrown into the equation is Mr Condou’s partner Cameron Laux, 49, with all three sharing the responsibility of raising Georgia, four, and two-year-old Hal, who were born by IVF. Mr Condou, 40, said: ‘I always wanted to be a dad. When I came out to my parents as a teenager, their only concern was I might never be a father and they knew how much I wanted to be. ‘Catherine and I had the conversation I’m sure thousands of women have with their gay friends, a sort of plan-B pact – to have a child together should Mr Right not appear. I’d had other female friends ask me and it never felt right. But with Catherine it did.’ Mr Condou said he was lucky his family were supportive, as were Miss Kanter’s. He joked that the 45-year-old actress’s father had heard a similar story on The Archers, which had helped his understanding of what his daughter was doing. Miss Kanter said: ‘I was never one of those women who saw a baby and thought “I want one”, but I also knew I didn’t want to not have children. ‘When Charlie first brought up the . subject of having kids together I wasn’t opposed to the idea, but it . wasn’t how I wanted to do it. ‘I . still had hopes of The One appearing in a shaft of light and told . Charlie to come back when I was 40. Then I turned 40 and Mr Right still . hadn’t materialised, so it started to take on more meaning. I couldn’t . shake the fear that I might hit 50 and regret not trying. Strong figures: Charlie Condou, right, with partner Cameron Laux attending a Diversity Role Models Event in order to raise awareness of homophobic bullying in schools last year . ‘We had both been single when we discussed this, but then Charlie started seeing Cam. It was clear if we were to go ahead, Cam would need to be involved. And so there were three.’ Recalling their visit to the IVF clinic, Miss Kanter said it was ‘surreal – we were the only threesome in a waiting room of couples’. It took a year and four cycles of IVF before the first positive pregnancy test. Although Miss Kanter, Mr Condou and Mr Laux initially moved in together, they now live separately. Mr Condou said the children spend half their time with him and Mr Laux at their home in Islington, North London, and the rest with Miss Kanter, who lives nearby. Mr Condou said the only negative response appears to have come from a couple of gay friends, with ‘one accusing us of trying to fit into some kind of heterosexual stereotype’. In his professional life, he has been involved in a ‘gay dad’ storyline. Mr Condou joined Coronation Street in 2007 as Marcus Dent, boyfriend of barman Sean Tully, but left after three years to spend more time with his daughter. He was tempted back to the ITV soap last year to feature in a story where they looked after Sean’s son Dylan. But in recent months viewers have seen Marcus fall in love with Maria Connor, the character’s first heterosexual relationship. In the interview for Red magazine, Miss Kanter, who has appeared in EastEnders on TV and also works in the theatre, admitted the hardest part for her was dealing with the unexpected loneliness her circumstances brought on. On screen: Pictured here in 2012 as midwife Marcus Dent alongside co-stars Toby Sawyer, as Aiden Lester, left, Ryan Thomas as Jason Grimshaw, right, and Samia Smith as Maria Connor . ‘It felt like I spent the first 12 weeks of my pregnancy holding my breath,’ she said. ‘And I found it surprisingly lonely. Charlie and Cam had each other to bounce fears off, but I was on my own. Charlie was supportive, but it wasn’t the same. Those first months were harder than I anticipated. But we’ve all had our moments. ‘Charlie is the middleman, so he has to placate two people. And Cameron sometimes felt isolated because, biologically, it was happening to Charlie and me. ‘Towards the end of the pregnancy we agreed it made sense to be living together: practically, so we could all be hands on; emotionally so we all felt involved.’ Mr Condou added: ‘Something I realised early on is that I’ll never be the one who feels compromised: I’m in a relationship with Cameron and I’m the biological parent with Catherine, so my position is clear. ‘Catherine is single, so she doesn’t have someone to talk to about the kids in the way Cam and I do.’For Mr Laux his modern family set-up is a marriage with three people. ‘Or at least it’s like a friendly divorce, where the kids split their time between two homes!’ he said. ‘It works well, though.’","Charlie Condou, who plays Marcus Dent, made pact with friend Catherine Kanter to be parents together .

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 20:32 EST, 18 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:49 EST, 19 August 2013 . A Florida businessman who bought a prime lakefront lot for $760,000 claims he was shocked to learn after building his dream home that the land was saddled with a $12.6million debt. The debt prevents him from ever seeing a cent if he sells the property and has sparked a fierce legal battle. Gary Jensen, a successful Orlando builder, is now suing a real estate broker and the high-powered lawyer who drew up the legal papers, claiming they knew - or should have known - about the massive lien filed against the property. Not a penny: Home builder Gary Jensen will not receive a penny if he sells his $3.45million dream home because of a $12.6million debt on the property . Mr Jensen invested at least $1.4million in the property when he built this sprawling 85,000-square-foot one-story mansion. It features an in-ground swimming pool, three bedrooms and gated driveway . Phillip Kobrin, and the lawyer, Todd Kobrin, are a father-son team. They are also the men who sold the property and, Mr Jensen alleges in his lawsuit, they were involved in the deal that led to the massive debt being placed on the land. Mr Jensen is seeking $12.6million in damages, plus interest. He says he wants to pay off the $12.6million lien so he can sell the house and be done with it, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The defendants in the case declined comment to the Sentinel. They could not be reached by MailOnline Sunday. Mr Jensen bought the two-acre parcel, which sits in a wealthy subdivision on Lake Berry in Winter Park, in 2011 for $760,000. He then invested at least $1.4million on a home. The sprawling 8,500-square-foot one-story mansion features a massive in-ground swimming pool, three bedrooms, an outdoor summer kitchen and a driveway guarded by a gate. In the lawsuit, Mr Jensen, who owns contracting company Terra Firma Construction Management Inc.,says the property is now worth $3.45million. Mr Jensen said he bought title insurance, but the policy only covers the cost of the land - not the massive $12.6million debt encumbered on the property . The house has lakefront access and is situated in an upscale subdivision of Winter Park, an Orlando suburb . Mr Jensen said he has title insurance, but it only covers the cost of the land - a fraction of the massive lien. The debt against the property was laid down in a neighboring county, so a routine title search in Orange County - home of Winter Park - didn't show an encumbrances. If Mr Jensen sells, the entire sum will go toward the $12.6million debt against the property. As with most bad land deals in Florida, this one traces its origins back to the collapse of the U.S. housing market. The property originally belonged to Albert Kodsi, a major Florida real estate developer. In 2008, Mr Kodsi borrowed $650,000 from Phillip and Todd Kobrin and offered the two-acre Winter Lake parcel as collateral, the Sentinel reports. When Mr Kodsi's $20million hotel redevelopment project in Daytona Beach failed in the housing crash, a judge entered a $12.6million judgement against him and placed a lien against the property, according to the newspaper. Mr Kodsi's lawyer declined comment to the Sentinel. He could not be reached by MailOnline Sunday. Because Mr Kodsi also owed the Kobrins money from the $650,000 loan, they took ownership of the parcel - and the $12.6million lien along with it, the Sentinel reports. The lawsuit alleges that because the Kobrins were involved with Mr Kodsi, they had to have known about the debt when they sold the land to Mr Jensen. Or or they didn't, Mr Jensen alleges, they should have.","Gary Jensen bought the two-acre Florida property in 2011 and built a $1.4million house on it .

Giants for wrongful dismissal after his sacking over a picture of a teammate's bottom posted to his Twitter . A rugby league star is suing his former club for £300,000 after he was sacked over a tweet featuring a picture of a teammate's backside. Keith Mason, 31, has taken Super League side the Huddersfield Giants to court following his dismissal last October for gross misconduct. The prop, who was one of the Giants' highest paid players, was sacked weeks after a picture of teammate Scott Moore's behind was posted to his Twitter account, where it stayed for around 48 hours. The hearing, which started today at Leeds High Court and is slated to last two days, heard the photograph was taken as Mr Mason, of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was celebrating after the final game of last season. The court was told that after Mr Mason returned home from the party on September 18 last year, his girlfriend came across the picture, which Mr Mason claims was taken without his knowledge, while looking through his phone. She then uploaded the picture on to his Twitter account, to which he had around 4,200 followers, with the comment 'what the hell is this', the court heard. The court heard many of Mr Mason’s followers would have been Giants fans or rugby league fans in general and could have potentially seen the Tweet. Mr Mason went through the club’s disciplinary process and was dismissed for gross misconduct. The court was told the club thought the content of the Tweet was contrary to their family values and Mr Mason’s position as a role model. Martin Budworth, for Mr Mason, said: 'He has a considerable number of followers and the club believe the image could have been viewed by a considerable number of people.' At the time of his dismissal Mr Mason was one of the team’s highest paid players. After playing seven seasons for the West Yorkshire team he was sacked with nearly three years left on his contract. Mr Mason, who has brought a case of wrongful dismissal against the club, does not believe all the facts of his sacking add up, his lawyer said. The court heard that just days after he left, the club had hired two new players to fill his position on a lower salary than his. Giving evidence, Mr Mason, who has also played for Wakefield, Melbourne and St Helens and is currently in his second spell with the Castleford Tigers, described himself as 'respected' and a 'professional athlete' and agreed that as a player with the Giants he was 'immersed in holding up family values'. He told the court that ‘Mad Monday’, . when the photo was taken, was a time for the players to let their hair . down and that he was out from Sunday until Tuesday afternoon and had . consumed alcohol. When he . got back home he said he was 'rather worse for wear and with no sleep' and didn’t know his girlfriend had posted the picture. Mr Mason arriving at Leeds High Court today: The prop, who was one of Huddersfield's highest-paid players, has brought a case of wrongful dismissal against the club, claiming all the facts of his sacking do not add up . 'If I’d seen the Tweet in the right frame of mind I would have taken it down straight away,' he told the court. 'I’ve never Tweeted anything of this nature. 'There is no way ever I would leave a picture on my Twitter to offend anyone, especially someone’s backside.' Mr Mason denied deliberately keeping the picture up until his agent told him to take it down. He said his agent never notified him about it and he took it down when he got over his hangover. He said: 'When I came round I took it off. I never thought at the time I would be getting a sacking two or three weeks later.' The hearing continues.","Keith Mason, 31, claims he was wrongfully dismissed by Huddersfield Giants .

The two men Jonathan Bowling,22 and Ashley Foster 22, were jailed by a judge at Sheffield Crown Court. Police have since arrested a 24-year-old woman on suspicion of assault and attempted robbery. Mrs Greaves, a Church Army evangelist, said after the trial that she forgave her husband’s killers and was unsure whether to press for prosecution of her alleged attacker. She added: 'I want the police to find out more about her background before it goes any further. I’ve been told she may have mental health problems, so I want them to look into that and make sure she is being monitored. 'If she is mentally ill, we can take a course of action which is best for her. The aim is to stop her doing it again.' She says her husband used to warn her about the dangers on the street and told her to take care when she was out and about. She added: 'Alan often told me to walk with someone I knew and to be careful. It is so ironic it was Alan who was attacked and killed.' A South Yorkshire Police spokeswoman said: 'A file regarding the woman has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration pending psychiatric reports.' Mr Greaves was brutally beaten in the motiveless attack on Christmas Eve as he walked to church to play the organ at midnight mass. He died later in hospital. Last month Jonathan Bowling,22 admitted murder and was ordered to serve a minimum of 25 years in prison. Ashley Foster, 22, who was found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, was sentenced to nine years .
