"The 27-year-old graphic designer who hid under a sink and texted vital information to police as the terrorist Kouachi brothers were holed up inside a printing works has spoken for the first time. Emotional and at times wiping away tears as he was shown footage of his boss telling how he pushed him into hiding, Lilian Lepere, told France 2 TV: 'I want to say thank you. 'He gave me the seconds I needed to hide. It is thanks to him that I am here.' Scroll down for video . Emotional: Lillian Lepere, who texted vital information to police from under a sink in the printing works where the Kouachi brothers were staging their last stand, has told the story of his survival for the first time on TV . Mr Lepere (left) previously said he is 'no hero', while print works owner Michel Catalano (right, with wife Veronique)  told how he joked with the killers to divert attention from Mr Lepere's hideout . Cherif and Said Kouachi, armed with Kalashnikovs and a rocket launcher, fled to the family-run factory as police and security forces closed in on them following the Hebdo massacre. Owner Michael Catalano saw them just before they burst through the door and told Lepere to run and hide so that one of them might live. Lepere fled to the canteen kitchen. He said: 'I hid under a sink in a cabinet with two hinged doors 70cm by 90cm and 40cm deep. 'Most of the time they were in the boss's office next door. I heard shooting and then one of them opened the cupboard next to mine. 'Then he opened the fridge he was only 50cm away. I thought he was going to open every cupboard. The printworks owner was sitting in his first-floor office at 9am when he heard a ring on the doorbell . 'He took a drink from the sink and I could see his shadow. My back was against the pipe and I could feel the water flowing. 'It was like you see in the movies. At that point the brain stops thinking, the heart stops beating, you stop breathing.' But the young designer knew that he had to somehow communicate what was happening to the outside world. Carefully he texted his father first: 'I am hidden on the first floor. I think they have killed everyone. Tell the police to intervene.' For eight hours the terrified Lepere guided police in a series of text messages describing everything he could hear and where the terrorists were moving. Carnage: The building's blown-out windows. Mr Lepere texted his father: 'I am hidden on the first floor' The scene at the factory in Dammartin-En-Goele, which was stormed by the two gunmen during the siege . Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said he sent vital tactical information as he crouched under the sink. At that stage he did not know that his boss had calmed the brothers, made them coffee and even dressed a wound one of them had sustained, before they let him go. As the Kouachis faced police in a final bloody stand off, Lepere stayed hidden until police came and found him. 'I couldn't use my mobile at first,' he said. 'I was in the foetal position and couldn't get to it easily. 'Then I took the risk. My first instinct was to turn it to silent, then vibrate but I had to make sure it wasn't touching the cabinet. 'The vibrations would have been heard. 'When I got messages to my family one of them was beside the police so I was immediately reassured to know I was in touch with the outside world. Murderous: The brothers get ready to escape after their killing spree at Charlie Hebdo last Wednesday . Solidarity: Mr Lepere did not feel ready to joined the mass marches in Paris, but his spirit was with them . 'I knew then I could give them information with my knowledge of the plant. 'And I knew that a team would come for me.' Visibly moved by remembering the hours he waited for the start of the assault, always in fear of being discovered, he described the moment he heard the operation begin. 'I curled up well, protecting my head. I'd been warned they would come for me and that I wasn't to move. 'But when I realised the police were about to enter, I disobeyed. I was too scared that the brothers had booby trapped the building and bombs were placed in the corridor by me. 'I fled to the end of the room. The explosions and gunfire ceased and he said: 'Then I heard voices, then the door opened and I saw the light. They guided me to a window and brought me out where a doctor was waiting.' He said he would have loved to join yesterday's march in the capital but hadn't the strength. 'But my heart was with the people. I am in solidarity with the famililies in Vincennes and Charlie Hebdo who didn't have our luck.'","Lillian Lepere revealed his ordeal in first interview with French TV .

"Choosing a stunning red carpet gown for a high profile awards ceremony can be a daunting task so how do you do it when you have to factor a baby bump into the equation? It's a style dilemma that a number of women attending last night's Golden Globes awards and after-parties had to consider. Keira Knightley, Terri Seymour and Molly Sims were among the stars on the red carpet at various stages of pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Pregnant Keira Knightley wore a butterfly print Chanel gown with a high waistline and embroidered frills . The nominated actress said her small, black clutch carried her real essentials - nuts to nibble on . Is it a nightdress? Style and colour consultant for women Jules Standish thought Keira's outfit was too frilly. The actress is pictured here with husband James Righton, keyboardist for The Klaxons . Keira, 29, who is expecting her first child with husband James Righton, chose a butterfly print Chanel gown. The actress, who was nominated for an award for her role in The Imitation Game, often wears dresses cinched in at the waist to show off the slim frame. But with a blossoming baby bump to accommodate, this time she opted for a high waist. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight's Nancy O'Dell on the red carpet she said of her pregnancy style: 'The waistline goes up somewhat. There is no waist any more, so it's risen.' She added that she only had room to carry the essentials in her small black clutch, so make-up was out in favour of nuts. She said: 'I don't have lipstick. I only have nuts in here. It's the wonderful thing about being pregnant. You just need to make sure you have snacks. So this is a snack bag.' Baby on board: Benedict Cumberbatch and fiancée Sophie Hunter are expecting their first child . A hint of a bump can be seen under Sophie's floral Erdem dress as she supports her nominated partner at the awards but with a big glass of water it's clear she had to say 'no' to the flowing Champagne . Style and colour consultant for women, Jules Standish, author of How Not To Wear Black, told FEMAIL she was not entirely won over by Keira's choice of maternity wear. She said: 'It looks like a nightdress. Frills and ruffles swamp her tiny frame, however empire line is very flattering in pregnancy. I love the butterfly accessory, overall it's a very girlie, young look.' Another mother-to-be at the awards was Benedict Cumberbatch's fiancée Sophie Hunter. The couple revealed last week they they are expecting their first baby. Sophie wore a floor-length floral gown from Erdem's pre-fall 2015 collection as she supported her nominated fiancé, who missed out on winning the best actor trophy to fellow Brit Eddie Redmayne. Benedict, Sophie and Marchesa designer Georgina Chapman (centre) chat to friends Keira and James . Catherine Hudson, fashion and beauty editor at Prima Baby & Pregnancy magazine and content editor for Junior online said Sophie was a clear winner in the style stakes. She said: 'Theatre director Sophie Hunter looked timelessly elegant in a winter floral jacquard maxi dress by Erdem. 'A plunging V-neck is a good choice to highlight your décolletage, and a sleeveless dress will accentuate toned arms. 'The wide waistband is comfortable for a growing bump and the pleating detail from the waist down is super flattering to skim over and out. 'The colours of the dress have been reflected in the pink tones of Sophie's make-up and the blue of her eyes. 'This is our favourite look.' Keira and Sophie could have asked fellow awards attendee Rosamund Pike for tips on how to get back into shape after having a baby. The British actress, who was nominated for best actress for her role in Gone Girl, appeared on the red carpet just five weeks after giving birth. Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike wore this daring gown just five weeks after giving birth to her second son . Not everyone was fan of the Rosamund's Grecian-style Vera Wang gown that left a lot of skin exposed . And while some new mothers may feel self-conscious about their post-baby body, the 35-year-old appeared to have no such reservations. She flashed the flesh in a white low-cut Vera Wang  gown that was cut away at the sides and exposed her back. The 'brave' choice of dress drew both admiration and criticism from viewers. While many praised her slim figure, news website Mic said her 'outfit choice left a lot to be desired from a fashion perspective'. The website's lifestyle editor Ellie Krupnick continued: 'The white Vera Wang gown was a beautiful Grecian style but noticably ill-fitting. 'The slightly baggy top and droopy neckline were not the most flattering, nor was the overly loose bodice. As many fashion writers noted, when it comes to red carpet style, fit is key.' But Rosamund revealed her dress got the seal of approval from most important man in her life - her new son. She told US TV presenter Ryan Seacrest who was interviewing the stars on the red carpet for E!: 'He was looking at me getting ready. He didn't cry; he seemed to approve.' More baby bumps were on show at the Golden Globes after parties. Terri Seymour posed hand on bump at the Weinstein Company and Netflix Golden Globes After Party . Mother-to-be Terri wore a flattering black floor-length dress,  flashing some flesh with her plunging neckline . Presenter Terri Seymour, 41 - a former flame of Simon Cowell - is in her final trimester and will soon give birth to her first baby with boyfriend Clark Mallon. As she attended the Weinstein Company and Netflix Golden Globes After Party, she wore a flattering black floor-length gown that wrapped around the top of her bump. She kept the outfit daringly stylish with a plunging neckline with two strips of fabric covering her chest. Prima Baby's Catherine Hudson said of the look: 'No stranger to a revealing outfit, Terri wore a similar (non-maternity) number to the awards last year. 'While some may say that it is a touch too much, she does at least prove that it is possible to keep your own sense of personal style while pregnant.' Model Molly Sims showcased her baby bump in her flowing acid  yellow dress with embroidered detailing . Meanwhile model turned actress Molly Sims summed up the term pregnancy glow by wearing an eye-catching bright yellow gown to the InStyle Post-Golden Globe Party. The 41-year-old, who is expecting a sibling for her two-year-old son Brooks in March,  posed with her hand resting on her blossoming baby bump. Jules Standish said Molly's look was her winner when it came to the best dressed baby bump. She said: 'It's a great colour that stands out in the crowd. It's well cut and pretty and she shines in it, showing off her pregnancy without flaunting herself.' Catherine agreed. She said: 'We are big advocates of wearing colour while pregnant or as a new mum. 'Wearing a bright colour can really enhance your mood and lift your confidence. The vertical detail on Molly's dress lengthens her proportions and the loose fit skims over her bump. A winning combination.' She added: 'No matter what your body shape or size, it is the fit and proportions of the clothes that will make all the difference. 'Make trends work for you rather than being a slave to fashion, and find out what flatters you and your body type, so make the best of your assets and skim over the rest. 'If you have slim legs, show them off. If you have toned arms, like Rosamund or Sophie, go sleeveless. Classic styles, like Keira's empire line are classics for a reason. 'Just make sure to choose colours that suit your skin tones, and don't shy away from brights: the key is to have confidence in what you are wearing.'","Keira Knightley, Terri Seymour and Molly Sims all had a baby on board .

"A new father  was burned to death at the wheel of his car when it exploded after a 100mph chase in which he was shot at by three gunmen on mopeds, it emerged today. The unnamed 32-year-old electrician who died in his sportscar may have been a victim of a failed car-jacking, friends have said. He died when his vehicle careered into a bus stop and burst into flames on the Old Kent Road in south London. Part of the black Audi RS4's engine block was thrown several metres down the carriageway by the force of the explosion. Tragedy: A 32-year-old man died at the wheel of his car after a high speed chase down the Old Kent Road in south London . Attack: Witnesses said they heard gunshots just before the car crash and friends of the dead man fear it was a car-jacking that led to the death . Witnesses reported shots being fired at the vehicle in the moments leading up to the crash at 2.30am on Sunday morning. Devastated friend Donald Homan, 33, was laying flowers at the scene refused to name his pal who he knew since school. He said 'We can't understand what's happened here, his partner is devastated, they have a ten-week-old baby together and we are all grieving. 'I've been in close contact with his girlfriend, she's obviously very upset, he loved his family and was so happy and proud to be a dad. 'He was an electrician, self employed and worked hard for his family and drove a nice car. 'We are in really deep shock, he was just a really lovely guy, just 32-years-old and we had been friends since school. 'As for what happened, it's an absolute mystery to us, we don't even know why he was out at that time. 'All can think it was a case of mistaken identity or they could have been trying to steal his car. 'He had nothing criminal about him and a ten-week old baby boy at home and a partner who loved him.' Carnage: Witnesses described how the incident unfolded like something 'out of a film' when the man died at 2.30am on Sunday . Murder squad detectives appealed for witnesses. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said forensic officers were trying to establish if holes in the vehicle, which had been speeding at up to 100mph, were caused by bullets. Witnesses said a passer-by tried to pull the victim from the burning car but was beaten back by 12ft flames before it exploded. They said the driver appeared to be trying to escape three men on mopeds, who reportedly fired at least three shots. Residents woken by the explosion called 999 and firefighters quickly extinguished the flames, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Residents of the Avondale Square Estate where the car crashed said bystanders tried to rescue the driver from the burning sports car. 'There was a huge bang and the screeching sound of metal on metal,' said one resident who preferred not to be named. 'At first we thought it was something to do with the storms, but there was a huge woosh straight after as the car went up in flames. 'We called the fire brigade and they were here in five or ten minutes, but even if the station was 200 yards away they wouldn't have stood a chance. 'Our kids were hysterical, the fireball was so immense half the tree was on fire. 'There was nothing that could be done for him, there were passers-by who tried to help. I watched a guy trying to open the passenger side door but it was blistering hot and he was pushed back, a woman with him was screaming ""there's someone in there."" 'It was horrific, whoever was in there either died on impact or very quickly afterwards. 'There were a few explosions and bangs go off before the fire brigade arrived and the flames were out quickly, but it was too late. The father-of-three continued: 'In the light you could see absolute devastation. There was debris strewn all over the green. 'The motor was metres from the car itself, it must've been thrown out in the crash or blown out by an explosion. 'You couldn't even recognise the car. It was just a melted lump about waist height.' Collision: Part of the black Audi RS4's engine block was thrown several metres down the carriageway by the force of the explosion . Malt Street: The spot where the victim's Audi RS4 crashed and exploded after the high-speed chase . Another resident of the block of flats told how the car burst into flames just yards from her home. Margaret Tompkins, 67, said: 'It was like a war zone, frightening. It was a very loud bang which I assumed afterwards was an explosion - it could have been anything on the Old Kent Road. 'It happened so close and it could've been so much worse for us. 'As the day went on we saw forensics searching every little inch. I saw the car, what was left of it. It didn't look like a car at all - it looked like when they crush motors in those yards. 'It looked horrific. Absolutely horrific.' After the crash Old Kent Road was closed between Burgess Park and Rotherhithe New Road in south Bermondsey. No arrests have been made and a post-mortem examination will take place today. Detective Inspector Dave Reid, who is leading the inquiry, said : 'At this stage our forensic team are working to establish the cause of the holes that were found in the car that had crashed. 'One line of enquiry, which we are unable to confirm until those tests are complete, is that the holes were caused by shots being fired at the car. 'I would appeal for anyone who saw a Black Audi RS4 car being driven early that morning around that area or along the Old Kent Road to contact us.'","Driver, 32, died at the wheel of his Audi on Old Kent Road on Sunday .

"Senator Dianne Feinstein has gone on record saying she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells present in the US laying in wait to carry out an attack similar to the deadly incidents that rocked Paris last week. The California Democrat and former Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman made the ominous comments while appearing on CNN's State of the Union Sunday to talk about the waiver program, which allows foreign nationals from 38 countries to enter the US for up to 90 days without a visa. Calling the waiver program 'America's Achilles heel,' Feinstein noted that the people suspected of shooting up the offices of the French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo and attacking a Kosher grocery store in Paris were French citizens - and people from France are permitted to enter the US without a visa. Scroll down for video . Ominous remarks: Senator Dianne Feinstein said on CNN she believes there are terrorist sleeper cells present in the US . Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured here January 11 at an International meeting against terrorism in Paris, said the US is keeping track on suspicious individuals . While brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi, 34 and 32, responsible for the murders of 12 Charlie Hebdo staffers, were on a no-fly list, Senator Feinstein pointed out that had they wanted to enter the US, they could have done so using a fake passport. ‘They can come back from training, they go through a visa waiver country, and they come into this country,’ Feinstein said. ‘We have a big problem here.’ Feinstein, who has long been a vocal critic of the waiver program expanded under President George W. Bush to boost tourism, issued a warning against terrorist sleeper cells on US soil. ‘I think there are sleeper cells, not only in France, but certainly in other countries, and, yes, even in our own,’ Feinstein said. ‘So I think this calls for vigilance. It calls for seeing that the national security organizations of our country -- the intelligence community -- is funded fully, is directed ably, is cooperating with ... British intelligence, French intelligence, German intelligence, as we do.’ The attacks in France last week left a total of 17 people dead over the course of three bloody days, including 12 cartoonists and staff at Charlie Hebdo and four shoppers shot dead inside a grocery store during a hostage crisis perpetrated by the Kouchi brothers’ accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly. Perpetrators: Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right) targeted Charlie Hebdo magazine after it repeatedly published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive . Attackers: The brothers fled Paris (pictured) on Wednesday last week then led police on a chase across northern France before they were shot and killed in a print works near the capital . Al Qaeda's branch in Yemen said it directed the attack by the masked gunmen to avenge the honor of the Prophet Muhammad, a frequent target of the weekly's satire. All three suspects were killed by French police during near-simultaneous raids at a suburban printing plant and the Kosher market in Paris. Recent polls show that Americans are deeply concerns about a similar terrorist attack at home. A Rasmussen poll released Sunday found that 65 per cent of Americans believe it is at least somewhat that an attack on 'those critical of Islam' in the US will occur over the next year, reported the Washington Times. During his appearance on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday, Attorney General Eric Holder tried to reassure the public that the Obama administration is doing everything possible to keep tabs on suspicious individuals. United they stand: Fifty world leaders march during a rally in Paris Sunday honoring the 17 victims of three days of bloodshed . ‘We have a universe of people who we focus on using legitimate means and keep track of them,’ Holder said, adding that they have no information at this time on specific threats. Congressman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said over the weekend that the House Homeland Security Committee, which he chairs, plans to launch an investigation to identify potential security loopholes in the visa waiver program. ‘I think we need to take a look at the visa waiver program again, and see what we can do to prevent this kind of thing from happening, because I believe it will happen, if it hasn't already,’ McCaul said. The White House also announced that President Obama will host an anti-extremism summit February 18 to discuss ways to stop the radicalization and recruitment of Americans by terrorist groups like al Qaeda and ISIS.","The former Senate Intelligence Committee chairwoman called program that lets certain foreign citizens enter the country without a visa 'America's Achilles heel'

"A British doctor who appeared on Sunrise late last year has sparked a debate online with the co-hosts, accusing the program of reducing her to 'an instrument of rank media opportunism'. Dr Qanta Ahmed, a Muslim woman who appeared on the weekend edition of the show in November penned a post on The Spectator claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her while she was discussing Project Rozana - a humanitarian effort training doctors treating children at Israel's Hadassah hospital. 'In my ignorance, I had unwittingly collaborated in my own exploitation by the Australian broadcaster. '(They) chose to cast me not as an anti-Islamist Muslim physician, volunteering in pursuit of coexistence, but as a vapid tool serving the malignant media construct of a two-dimensional anti-Semitic caricature of Zionism,' Dr Ahmed wrote in her strongly-worded piece. Scroll down for video . Dr Qanta Ahmed (left) is a Muslim woman who appeared on the weekend edition of Channel Seven's Sunrise in November, with hosts Monique Wright (centre) and Andrew O'Keefe (far right) Weekend Sunrise hosts Andrew O'Keefe and Monique Wright have posted a response to her claims with a letter titled: 'Right to reply - Dear Qanta Ahmed: What ambush? Where?' The duo explained that they were partially behind the decision to invite her to speak as they had in fact long been admirers of her work. The presenters insisted that they had remained sympathetic to her plight throughout the interview and insist Channel Seven's breakfast show has a long history of promoting reasoned discussion. The journalists feel that the inference that they were pushing an agenda, with a plan to debase Dr Ahmed, is 'insulting in the extreme.' Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright explained that in the wake of Dr Ahmed's accusations, they are feeling saddened, shocked and offended, particularly as Dr Ahmed had told them she was pleased with the interview on the day. Dr Ahmed has penned an opinion piece claiming the breakfast program misrepresented her when they rolled footage of injured Palestinian children and images that depict Israel as 'a terrorist state' In her opinion piece, Dr Ahmed explains that she believed it had been a positive experience until she later watched the segment, at which point she felt physically ill, shocked by what she felt was exploitation. Dr Ahmed alleges that Sunrise chose to broadcast footage of what she calls 'Israel as a terrorist state' which 'detonated her truthful and universal message'. She took issue with the overlay that was used during the program, which she describes as showing injured Palestinian children, 'decimated North Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war' and the Security Wall from the Palestinian side - not the Israeli side. Dr Ahmed is outraged, accusing Weekend Sunrise of misrepresenting her, writing that they 'prostituted my goodwill in the service of personal or official anti-Israeli and pro-Hamas propaganda.' The Sunrise team argue that they gave Dr Ahmed's cause, Project Rozana, positive exposure and sympathetic treatment. 'Your objection to the segment appears largely to be centred around the overlay footage of the Gaza conflict which accompanied some of your responses.' The hosts of the program insist that they wanted to interview Dr Ahmed as they admire her work, they did not come with any agenda and wanted to give exposure to Dr Ahmed's work and her perspective . The pair proceed to analyse the footage that accompanied their interview. 'Some of the footage we used showed children in Palestinian hospitals without referencing the conflict at all,' they wrote. 'Admittedly, we did use some footage that was inappropriate to what you were discussing at the exact moment it was played.' However, they maintain that the footage was a fitting illustration of the points Dr Ahmed had just made while discussing the physical and psychological toll of the war on children. Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright admit that the timing of images on screen was sometimes at odds with the discussion, but insist it is an easy and common occurrence in breakfast television, with no malicious intent. 'As a “veteran media commentator” you must know that, from time to time, especially when the hosts veer off script to follow a particular train of thought of the guest, the wrong vision goes up at the wrong time. For that, I apologise. Sometimes these things happen on morning television. Ms Wright and Mr O'Keefe say they were very sad and surprised when they first heard about Dr Ahed's accusations. They find the 'baseless and libelous' comments 'insulting to the extreme' Both parties ended their letters with angry, impassioned addresses to the other. 'I felt intensely angry,' wrote Dr Ahmed. 'To be whored out as I strive as an ambassador for a philanthropic mission with universal reach, to be debased as an instrument despite my decades long authority as a physician and Muslim humanist is nothing but obscene.' The Sunrise presenters, after presenting a calm and rational argument, also expressed anger. 'Taken as a whole, we cannot see how any reasonable person could argue that we exploited you in any way. 'To suggest that we came with any agenda, either designed to promote Hamas or to debase you, is insulting in the extreme.' After apologising for their 'minor mistake', Mr O'Keefe and Ms Wright called for Dr Ahmed to apologise for her defamatory and 'baseless' remarks. The stunned Weekend Sunrise presenters concluded civilly by congratulating Dr Ahmed for her work with Project Rozana and wished her well. Dr Ahmed says she feels 'intensely angry' as she believes she was misrepresented .","Dr Qanta Ahmed appeared on Sunrise in November to talk about 'Project Rozana' - a project to train doctors treating children at an Israel Hospital .

"A father-of-five held a knife to his girlfriend's throat and raped her, while live streaming the abuse to a chat room on the internet. Sean Johnstone, 43, punched his then girlfriend Samantha Miller, 35, so hard in the stomach when she was pregnant that their child was born brain damaged. Miss Miller, who has waived her anonymity, said she was raped countless times by Johnstone, hit with heavy ornaments and callipers and often went without food when they lived in Hartlepool and County Durham. Sean Johnstone (left) raped his girlfriend Samantha Miller (right) and live streamed it on the internet. The 43-year-old also punched her so hard while she was pregnant their baby was born with brain damage . She said her two year relationship with Miller, during which he threatened to kill both her and their child was like 'spending two years in a horror film.' He also threatened to kill her unless she performed a sex act on his dog. Johnstone, of Hartlepool, was found guilty of 27 charges which included rapes and violent attacks on Miss Miller and has been jailed for 17-and-a-half years. The charges also included possessing hundreds of images of child pornography and extreme pornography featuring animals. But the mother of one said she fears once he is released he will come and find her and her daughter. 'It was like spending two years in a horror film,' said Miss Miller. 'I would wake up with him on top of me. 'The laptop was on in front of me and he said people were watching, that it was connected to a seedy chat room. 'I was pregnant at the time. He punched me in the stomach, then he raped me. I was too scared to go to sleep at night.' Miss Miller endured the abuse for two years from 2006. She added: 'Many times I went without a meal. He stubbed out cigarettes on me. 'He had knives and screwdrivers all over the house, he would hit me with heavy ornaments, throw buckets of wee over me. 'I wasn't allowed to go out, I was rarely allowed to hold my child. I got a hiding if I answered him back. He would say 'I'm going to kill you and kill that baby'. 'I can't remember how many times I was raped by him. Every day, in the end, I was being abused. It was continuous, day and night. I was walking on egg shells, constantly.' Miss Miller moved to the north east from Chelmsford, Essex in 2002 and met Johnstone four years later. But shortly after they got together he began to control her life, throwing out her make-up and telling her what clothes to wear. Samantha Miller has waived her right to anonymity to speak about the repeated rapes and violence and told how the two year cycle of abuse led her to develop post traumatic stress syndrome and self harm (right) He then began physically abusing her. Their daughter was born with brain damage which doctors said was caused by a serious impact while in the womb. The week before Christmas, 2008, she finally managed to escape after suffering two years of violent abuse. She grabbed her six-month-old daughter, her changing bag and just £2, and managed to catch a bus to the local police station. Mother and child then spent the next 18 months sheltering in women's refuges. As well as brain damage her daughter was later diagnosed with neurological condition Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, which she inherited from her father. The case was at first hampered after police said there was not enough evidence to prosecute Johnstone, but two years later Johnstone's second victim came forward and they corroborated each other's stories. He was convicted unanimously of every charge. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton jailed Johnstone in 2012 and said he had a 'deeply unhealthy interest in sexual depravity'. Miss Miller, who lives in Washington with her six-year-old daughter, suffered post traumatic disorder because of the abuse and started self harming. She added: 'I still see him every night and every day, coming at me with a knife,' she said. 'Sometimes if something touches my head I feel him grabbing my hair. I have nightmares. 'I believe he is the devil. He is not just a criminal. It was like he was possessed.' She said the abuse also makes her paranoid, fearing when people say they recognise her that they have seen her being raped online. She added: 'My life has been taken. I may be alive but because of what's happened, I'm not me any more. I want to stop that happening to other people - there is a way out.' Miss Miller is planning to change her name and move out of the area with her daughter, before Johnstone, formerly of Hartlepool, is released from jail. 'He is going to come for us and I know he is,' she said. 'He told me if I ever left him, he would find me and he would kill me. He still controls my life. My life, to this day, is controlled.'","Sean Johnstone raped his former girlfriend and live streamed it on internet .

"A fake groom has been jailed for a year after a suspicious registrar tipped off police when he used an iPhone translation app to talk to his Eastern European bride-to-be.

Two weeks later Singh, who is Indian, married the woman but the registrar called police after noticing the bride’s dress was dirty and that the couple were giving a ‘choreographed performance’. 'Wedding': Avtar Singh (left), 38, married the unnamed woman (right), in the presence of wedding fixer Robert Miko (top right), who was jailed 16 months for assisting unlawful immigration. Singh was jailed for 12 months . Police discovered Singh, who was living in Wolverhampton, paid thousands of pounds to a crime gang who supplied Eastern European women to men from countries outside the European Union. Officers discovered the gang had organised a string of sham weddings in Shrewsbury and Manchester between 2012 and 2013. Another man, Elohor Eruotor, 34, was found to have married Czech-born Angela Balogova, 32, at the Scottish village of Gretna Green, which is famous for hosting runaway weddings. Officers discovered Balogova was one of four Eastern European women who were paid to marry men from abroad who were desperate to stay in Britain. Singh and Eruotor, a Nigerian man who was also living in Wolverhampton, were arrested last March and both admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law. Jailed for a year: Singh (left), from India, and Eruotor (right), a Nigerian man, were arrested last March and both admitted conspiring to facilitate a breach of immigration law . They were each jailed for 12 months when they appeared at Manchester Crown Court last Friday. Registrar Paul Ainscough, who alerted police to Singh’s sham wedding, told the court the wedding was a ‘choreographed performance’. He added: ‘The hem of the bride’s dress was soiled and she wore it without any deportment or sense of occasion.’ Members of the gang, mostly from Manchester, who arranged the fake marriages were jailed for between 16 months and five years. The court heard Singh and Eruotor aimed to get permission to stay, work and claim benefits by abusing rules that allow immigrants to remain in the UK if they are married to EU nationals living in the country.","Avtar Singh, 38, registered a notice of intention to marry a Czech woman .

"John Kerry said  he will now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks attended by 40 world leaders and a million people . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said he will now travel to Paris after the U.S. government was shamed for not joining a rally yesterday for victims of the French terror attacks. The rally was attended by 40 world leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, and a million people. A staggering 3.7 million people gathered across France today to stage further defiant marches in a moving tribute to the 17 people killed in hostage sieges last week. Kerry said at a news conference that U.S. officials had been 'deeply engaged' with French authorities almost immediately after the first attack occurred and had offered intelligence assistance. As to criticism about the lack of a senior U.S. official at Sunday's March, Kerry said: 'I really think that this is sort of quibbling a little bit in the sense that our Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland was there and marched, our ambassador was there and marched, many people from the embassy were there and marched. 'As everybody knows, I have been here in India for a prior planned event,' he added. 'I would have personally very much wanted to have been there but couldn't do so because of the commitment that I had here and it is important to keep these kinds of commitments.' Kerry was in the Indian city of Ahmedabad on Sunday for a long-scheduled appearance at an international investment conference, and to prepare for President Barack Obama's trip to India later this month. But another high-ranking administration official, Attorney General Eric Holder, was in Paris at the time for a terrorism summit, and he didn't attend the march, either. It it not known why Holder didn't join other world leaders on the streets of Paris. The Department of Justice did not return DailyMail.com's request for comment on the matter. The outgoing AG did have time to appear on four different American news shows on Sunday that aired during the rally, though it was not immediately clear if the interviews were pre-taped. Scroll down for video . Calling France the United States' 'oldest ally,' President Obama said Friday, 'I want the people of France to know that the United States stands with you today, stands with you tomorrow.' Two days later no U.S. officials, save for the relatively unknown deputy secretary of state and U.S. ambassador to France Jane Hartley, stood with the French at the unity march against barbarity, however. According to an administration official, President Obama spent part of his Sunday afternoon watching a National Football League game on television. The White House did not release any details on the president's activities yesterday nor did it respond to DailyMail.com's request for confirmation that Obama's took the afternoon off to watch the playoffs. Both games were broadcast hours after the march. More than 40 world leaders from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and even Russia attended the historic rally in Paris, but President Obama was conspicuous by his absence. Even Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas put aside their differences and linked arms. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Sergei Lavrov  made the same unifying gesture in the march down the Place de la Concorde in defiance of the Islamist terror attacks that rocked the city last week. The absence of a strong U.S. presence at the event rankled Republicans, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a likely 2016 presidential candidate, calling it 'dangerous' and 'symbolic of the lack of American leadership on the world stage.' 'The attack on Paris, just like previous assaults on Israel and other allies, is an attack on our shared values,' Cruz wrote in a Monday op-ed in Time. 'Many of our allies gathered together in Paris yesterday in an admirable display of determination. Our President should have been there, because we must never hesitate to stand with our allies,' he said. ''We should never hesitate to speak the truth. In Paris or anywhere else in the world.' An estimated 3.7million people marched across France today, the majority gathering in Paris (above) to pay tribute to those killed by terrorists in a swathe of attacks across the capital last week .

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left,  is greeted by Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif shortly after arriving in Islamabad, Pakistan today for an unannounced visit. Kerry won't travel to Paris until Thursday, but he made time today for a stop in Pakistan . Echoing Obama's words on Friday, Kerry said today that he would go to France to reaffirm U.S. solidarity with country's longtime ally. He said as soon as he heard about the march, he asked his team what the earliest time was that he could go. 'That is why I am going there on the way home and to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,' he said. 'I don't think he people of France have any doubt about America's understanding about what happened, about our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trial.' While in Paris, Kerry will be meeting with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and pay tribute to the victims of last week's attacks, which killed 17 people. Kerry is a fluent French speaker, has a well-known affinity for France and has visited Paris more than a dozen times since becoming secretary of state. He will arrive in Paris on Thursday after stops in Islamabad, Pakistan and Sofia, Bulgaria and Geneva, Switzerland. The previously unannounced drop-in to Islamabad dovetails Kerry's meetings in India, Pakistan's geopolitical foe, and a Dec. 16 terror attack  that claimed the lives of 134 children and 16 adults at an army-run school in Peshawar. 'The secretary's engagement will be very critical to advancing our shared fight against militant extremism,' a senior official at State told Agence France-Presse. While there Kerry will assess whether the country is truly committed to a 'real and sustained effort' to thwart terrorism, U.S. officials travelling with Kerry told CBS News. In Geneva, on Wednesday, Kerry will meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif to discuss the status of nuclear negotiations that are to resume the next day.

Kerry will be the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit France since the terrorist attacks on a French newspaper and a kosher supermarket. Authorities say one of those involved in the attacks pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group in a video. He and two other suspected extremists were killed during police raids. 'I want to emphasize that the relationship with France is not about one day or one particular moment,' Kerry said. 'It is an ongoing longtime relationship that is deeply, deeply based in the shared values, and particularly the commitment that we share to freedom of expression.' 'No single act of terror, no two people with  a AK-47s, no hostage-taking at a grocery store is ever going to prevent those who are committed to the march for freedom to continue to march and to ultimately see all people enjoy their rights, to be able to enjoy the protections that come with that freedom,' he said. Obama offered condolences last week at the French Embassy in Washington. 'We stand united with our French brothers to ensure that justice is done and our way of life is defended,' he said. The U.S. president will host British PM Cameron at the White House on Thursday and Friday to discuss counter terrorism measures in addition to other global issues that include international trade, cybersecurity, Iran, ISIS and Russia's continued occupation of eastern Ukraine.

"An ex-Playboy model says her mother-of-two friend lost a custody battle over her children because female judges 'are the girls in high school who never got that guy' and want 'vicious payback' over good-looking women. Bridget Marks, 48, believes there is a lot of 'bias' in the courts against 'pretty women who marry or are involved with wealthy men'. She spoke out after her friend Lisa Mehos, 39, lost her two children, aged four and six, in a bitter custody battle with her financier husband Manuel Mehos last year. 'Payback': Former Playboy model Bridget Marks, 48, (left) says there is a lot of 'bias' in the courts against 'pretty women who marry or are involved with wealthy men'. She spoke out after her friend Lisa Mehos (right) lost custody of her two children following a bitter custody battle with her financier husband . The judge said she 'deliberately' lied about her pill and alcohol use during the hearings which was a key factor in coming to her decision. Mrs Mehos is now appealing the decision, with her attorney's claiming she has been sober for more than three years and has admitted making mistakes in the past. The appeals court will issue a ruling in the coming months. Mrs Marks similarly lost a custody battle over her twin five-year-old daughters in 2004 when a female judge determined that she coached her children to say their father sexually abused them. Speaking to the New York Post outside a Manhattan court of appeals last week, she said: 'You walk in and you've got the blown-out hair, the nice clothes, the pretty children and the fairy book, and that makes them angry. 'In a way, it becomes a vicious payback for the guy they didn't get in high school. I pray the justices read the record carefully and see this is a good mother.' According to The Post, Mrs Meho's lawyer Tom Shanahan told the appeals panel that Mrs Mehos' two children are effectively being raise by nannies while their father runs Green Bank in Houston. Eleanor Alter, the lawyer for Mr Mehos, reportledy said her client is a 'loving and capable and honest person' compared to his ex-wife, whose life is 'chaos on every level.' Battle: Her ex-husband Manuel, pictured, had argued that her abortion after their divorce showed her up as a hypocrite when she said she wanted to be with her children on Easter Sunday. Justice Lori Sattler (right) ruled in March 2014 that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example from 2012 where she passed out and her son, then two, ran around without pants or a diaper . Response: Mrs Marks, who lost her children in a custody battle 10 years ago, claimed that if you walk into a court looking pretty with your 'hair blown out', it makes a female judge 'angry' Mrs Mehos divorced her banker Manuel, or 'Manny' in 2011, and claimed she started taking antidepressants after the split. But subpoenaed records showed she had actually been reliant on them since she married her husband in 2006, according to the court ruling seen by the New York Daily News. It revealed that she has been prescribed drugs, including Xanax and Valium, by 28 different doctors since 2008 . She would allegedly even pick up prescriptions from two different doctors on the same day. Justice Lori Sattler ruled in March 2014 that the drugs use endangered her children, citing one example from 2012 where she passed out and her son, then two, ran around without pants or a diaper. She also admitted to having sex with a friend a year after her marriage to Mehos, then 59, came to an end. The fling resulted in her being pregnant and having an abortion. Fabrication: The judge said Mrs Mehos lied about her problems with pills during the hearings which was a key factor in coming to her decision . Speaking to the New York Post in 2014, a devastated Mrs Mehos said:  'I’m divorced. I’m not Mother Teresa! I feel like I’ve been beaten up and raped. I had sex with someone I knew for 20 years, and I’m somehow this terrible, bad parent!' She now only sees her children on Mondays and alternate weekends. 'It just breaks my heart. They're so confused,' she said. In 2013 Mr Mehos was arrested and accused of battering his wife but charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence after he claimed her black eye was from a Botox injection.","Bridget Marks was at a Manhattan court supporting her friend Lisa Mehos .

"Placard: Josie Russell brandishes a Welsh slogan . After almost 20 years of trying to live out of the public gaze, hammer attack victim Josie Russell joined a public protest yesterday against quarrying near her picturesque home. Josie, 27, was one of 40 protesters who wore dust masks at a planning meeting to campaign against the removal of 150,000 tons of slate waste from a quarry in Snowdonia. The textile designer – who made headlines in July 1996 as the sole survivor of a hammer attack in which her sister Megan, six, and mother Lin, 45, were killed as they walked home from school – joined the campaign against the quarry over concerns about noise and dust, fearing pollution could cause the lung disease silicosis. Yesterday, after brandishing a poster in Welsh urging Gwynedd planners to say no to ‘sound and silicosis’ she celebrated as they voted against the scheme at Talysarn, adding: ‘Our lives would have been ruined.’ Gwynedd councillors rejected an amended application for permission to remove 150,000 tons of slate waste from a tip at Talysarn in the Nantlle Valley over eight years. Nearly 300 objectors had signed a petition with fears about the impact on the landscape and wildlife and about noise and dust. Josie added: 'I'm really, really glad. It would have been terrible. I work at home almost every day and the view from my window would have been horrible and dusty. 'There is loads of wildlife, untouched, and it's how it should be kept.' Andrew Owen-Smith added : 'We need to move away from harming the environment. I run an outdoor centre 100 metres from the proposed development. 'It's that close we would have lost customers. All it takes is a few bad reviews.' The textile designer made headlines in July 1996 as the sole survivor of a hammer attack in which her sister and mother were killed. Pictured, Josie with her mother Lin in 1989 . But councillor Eurig Wyn urged at Caernarfon support for the application to provide jobs for locals. He was worried about protecting the Welsh language. He said: 'Unless we develop businesses and promote the economy with this sort of plan, the language will deteriorate permanently. This development ticks the appropriate boxes.' Councillor John Pughe Roberts also backed the plans. He said: 'What hope does a deprived area such as Dyffryn Nantlle (the Nantlle Valley) have to prosper while every objection is made to helping the economy.' Local councillor Craig ab Iago said the plans had split the rural community. On one side a farming family wanted to diversify but on the other neighbours were worried about noise and disruption. It was claimed that five jobs would be created. But planning officers advised councillors to refuse permission. After almost 20 years of trying to live out of the public gaze, Josie Russell joined a public protest. Pictured from left, mother Lin, Josie, father Shaun and Megan Russell on a family picnic . Megan, six, and mother Lin were killed as they walked home from school. Pictured, the family with their dog . Previously Josie had warned: 'If the proposals go ahead it will destroy local wildlife, ruin the peace and air quality of our valley, and cause no end of destruction to the environment so dear to my heart. 'My father Shaun brought me back to the Dyffryn Nantlle area following the terrible events of 1996 which changed my life forever. 'It has always been a place of great safety and peace, and for many years provided me with a much-needed retreat from the larger world.' She added: 'The slate tips are home to many varieties of trees and plants, which form the habitat of birds, bats, and other small mammals such as squirrels. It is abundant in amphibians such as frogs, toads, lizards and newts, as well as countless insects and invertebrates. 'All these animals will either be displaced or killed, either by the workings, or in their endeavours to find a new habitat.' Josie and fellow villagers from Tanrallt, Gwynedd, north Wales, pictured right, were protesting against the proposed re-opening of a nearby ancient slate mine, pictured left .","Josie Russell was one of 40 protesters who wore dust masks at the protest .

"Security order: David Cameron has put SAS troops on standby following last week's Paris horror . SAS troops will be deployed on the streets if Islamist fanatics launch a Paris-style gun attack in Britain. David Cameron has put them on standby to head off the ‘fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence’. The elite soldiers will take part in training exercises in which firearms police will re-create the horror witnessed in France last week. A defence source said: ‘Special forces will be involved in re-enacting the Paris attack because they are the ones who will be deployed immediately should there be a terror threat. ‘They are always on standby but if there is an attack, armed police and the SAS will be ready. Who would you want swooping in through a window rescuing you from a terror attack? You would want special forces – and that is who would come.’ Ministers and officials never confirm the involvement of the SAS in operations. However, there has been speculation the military helped the police respond to the 2005 attacks in London on July 7 and the failed plot of July 21. As well as expertise in specialist weapons and hostage-rescue, SAS units can be used for surveillance operations or for ‘spotting’ suspects. Security officials believe this could be crucial in the immediate aftermath of an atrocity. In Paris, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi managed to escape the scene of the Charlie Hebdo magazine shooting, where they killed 12. While they were being hunted by hundreds of police, fellow fanatic Amedy Coulibaly took customers and staff hostage at a Jewish supermarket in Paris, killing four. Shift in position: On Sunday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he did not think an attack was ‘likely’ but yesterday urged parents to look out for signs of children being radicalised . Police will also be asked to carry out contingency planning on how to track down suspects who flee after a mass-shooting. Meanwhile the Metropolitan Police Commissioner appears to have shifted position on the terror threat. On Sunday, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he did not think an attack was ‘likely’, despite the head of MI5 warning of an increasingly complex threat and that not every plot could be stopped. But yesterday the police chief said officers had worked with the intelligence services to foil several plots in London over the past few months, and ‘the drumbeat of terror had intensified’. Police officers protect themselves with riot shields as a fiery blast explodes at the entrance to the supermarket in Porte de Vincennes on Friday . He also urged parents to look out for signs of their children being radicalised or preparing to travel overseas to fight. Sir Bernard said: ‘You may be worried about talking to the police or the security services but surely it’s got to better if you’re worried about your child going to a horrible place where they get killed or get involved in a crime.’ Meanwhile Professor Michael Clarke, of the RUSI defence think-tank, said he expected terrorists to try attacks similar to the ones in Paris. He told BBC Radio 4: ‘This fashion not so much to attack aircraft and airports but to go for marauding attacks is likely to increase.’ Armed police swarm the entrances and exits to the Hyper Cache in eastern Paris after several shoppers were held hostage for several hours during this week's terrorist aassault spanning over three days in Paris .","SAS troops to be deployed on streets in event of Paris-style attack in UK .

"Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are. Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet. The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting -  are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle. Scroll down for video . An example of a male chimpanzee  drumming a large tree root, which they use to tell others their location . But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual. Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them. Scientists studying the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools. The analysis began when one chimp called Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female. Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges. Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way. The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge. A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first. By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'naïve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour. This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role. The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts. Dr Katie Slocombe, a psychologist at the University of York who led the study, said she found she was able to identify individual chimps from their drumming style. She believes her findings may also provide clues about how musical rhythm first began among humans. She told the Mail Online: 'I wanted to know why the chimps choose to drum with some pant hoots and not others and whether drumming rhythms were individually distinctive. The drums contain cues to individual identity – so chimps hundreds of meters away should be able to use drums to understand the location of individuals in the forest. 'The sound they create makes it ideal for long distance communication. 'We think drums help coordinate movement and grouping patterns, so advertising to others your location when travelling may entice others to join you, and other chimps may pant hoot and drum back, which may influence where the caller decides to travel to.' Speaking to the journal Science, she added: 'This shows that rhythmic abilities are not uniquely human.'Coordinating movement over very long distances might have been why the earliest humans started to drum.'Chimpanzees can roam over territories the size of Manhattan Island, which can make it difficult for the chimps to find each other.They are known to use a series of hoots and bellows to communicate with each other, but some scientists have seen some males aggressively beat tree roots too.It was thought that this might be a way of showing dominance by the male chimpanzees. However, Dr Slocombe and her colleague's research, which a troop of chimpanzees for three years, suggests that this is not the case. Their study, which is published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology, analysed the social context of 293 hooting and drumming events by the troop's 13 males. They found that while the older more experienced males did drum more than other troop members, their rank and whether other males or females were nearby played little role. Instead, the decision to drum seemed to be more influenced by what the group were doing. Male chimps in Budongo Forest, Uganda, tended to drum more often when they were travelling in their territory . Male chimps like this one above tended to drum on trees more when they were on the move through the forest . If they were travelling, chimps drummed buttresses in 75 per cent of pant hoots but only 40 per cent of the time when resting and 10 per cent of the time when eating. Dr Slocombe found that travelling males tended to have their own distinctive flair. Recordings showed that the length of time each chimp spent drumming, their use for doublets and pauses and the number of beats varied by each animal. Using computer software the researchers were able to identify the drummer 47 per cent of the time. Dr Slocombe said: 'Drumming sequences produced with pant hoots may have contained information on individual identity and that qualitatively, there was individual variation in the complexity of the temporal patterns produced. 'We conclude that drumming patterns may act as individually distinctive long-distance signals that, together with pant hoot vocalizations, function to coordinate the movement and spacing of dispersed individuals within a community.' She added that such behaviour could also be important in helping to allow rival chimpanzees keep their distance by knowing who is where. The root drumming behaviour was only seen to be carried out by male chimps like the one above, but did not appear to be intended as a way of exerting dominance over others in their group in the area or to attract a mate . Magdalena Babiszewska, a PhD student at the University of Wrocław in Poland who also took part in the study, said: 'Chimps are amazing with their drumming ability, so we cannot say that they lack of musicality. 'The jungle is pretty busy and loud place so I assume that loud, structured drum is better recognised than vocalization, so why not to use it when you are away from your friends for several days. 'We have still a lot to discover in terms of chimpanzees behavior and music evolution.'","Biologists at University of York studied chimps in Budongo Forest, Uganda .

"Crayola is apologizing after hackers filled its Facebook page with off-color content. The Forks Township, Pennsylvania-based crayon and marker manufacturer regained control of the page late Sunday and removed the offending posts.

"Texas and 23 other states trying to block President Barack Obama's recently announced immigration orders are holding up the costs of providing unemployment insurance, education, health care, driver's licenses and other programs to illegals as evidence that the directives will cause them 'irreparable damage' if allowed to take effect. The states made the case in a filing submitted to a Texas court ahead of a hearing on Thursday at which they hope to obtain a preliminary injunction barring the Obama administration from proceeding with its plans to give more than 4 million illegal immigrants work permits. Wisconsin is also claiming that illegal immigrants residing in The Badger State will be able to get concealed carry permits as a result of Obama's unilateral action. States say that President Barack Obama's immigration directives will cost untold millions, and they are trying to get them blocked through the courts . 'States will have to pay millions of dollars to remediate the problems created by the Directive,' the brief states. 'It will be difficult or impossible to recover those costs from the federal government.' Driver's licenses alone will cost millions, states participating in the legal challenge argued. Using Texas' population of 1.6 million illegal immigrants as an example, the brief claims that the state would face a net loss of $174.73 per license if a third of its immigrant population sought IDs. If just two percent applied, it would still cost Texas taxpayers close to $131 per license. In just the last two years Texas says it has spent $1.313 billion on administering medical care to illegal immigrants and $303 million in Emergency Medicaid money. The costs of educating illegal immigrant children in Texas are nearly $9,500 a pupil, annually, the briefing asserted. 'Texas is not unique,' it goes on to explain. Also listed as plaintiffs in the Texas suit are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Separately, Wisconsin is claiming that Obama's executive order will allow otherwise qualified illegal immigrants to apply for concealed carry permits for handguns. 'The cost to the state are immense,' Wisconsin's then-Attorney General, J.B. Van Hollen, said last month during an appearance on Fox News host Neil Cavuto's show. 'We have certain things that under this law we have from provide to these four to five million national illegal immigrants such as drivers licenses, they will get Social Security Numbers, the ability to get work permits, they will get unemployment benefits,' he claimed. In addition, Van Hollen, who exited office last week, said, 'very importantly in Wisconsin, where we have permits for concealed carry of firearms, they are going to be able to lawfully carry firearms when they are not even lawfully in the country.' A spokeswoman for the AG's office confirmed to MailOnline at the time of the appearance that illegal immigrants who meet the requirements for concealed carry will be able to apply for permits in Wisconsin.. But one of the documents applicants must provide is a proper license for the gun, and an undated copy of Department of Justice guidelines once posted to the agency's website and obtained by DailyMail.com states that its a crime for illegal residents to have guns, let alone purchase them. DOJ has not returned DailyMail.com's requests for confirmation that the policies outlined in the document are still in effect. However, Second Amendment Foundation founder and firearms expert Alan Gottlieb told DailyMail.com that illegal immigrants are still barred from buying or owning guns in the U.S., contrary to Wisconsin's claims. Former Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, left, shakes hands with newly inaugurated Attorney General Brad Schimel at the state Capitol on Monday, Jan. 5,  in Madison, Wisconsin. Van Hollen has argued that illegal immigrants will be eligible for concealed carry permits under Wisconsin law but that may not be true . The president announced his immigration measures in late November, but they will not take effect until this spring, giving Republican politicians at both the state and federal levels ample time to challenge the directives before the Department of Homeland Security begins issuing work permits. In addition to the state-based strategy to undo the immigration orders, lawmakers opposed to Obama's executive actions are looking to link appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security through the end of the fiscal year to legislation barring funds from being spent on immigration services they believe are unlawful. Congress passed, and the president signed, a large spending bill in December that allotted money to every area of the government but DHS through the end of September. Appropriations for the department will run out on Feb. 28 unless Congress acts. The House of Representatives is considering legislation this week that would effectively cut off funding for Obama's directives and stop DHS agencies from spending the money they collect from fees on those immigration services while approving the bulk of the department's budget. The White House said Monday that it would veto any legislation that tampers with the president's executive order. 'There's never a good time for Republicans to do something like this, but right now it seems like a particularly bad time to do so,' the president's spokesman said. If the White House and Republicans can't agree on a compromise before the end of next month, DHS will go into a partial shutdown and non-essential staffers will be put on unpaid leave until the the legislative and executive branches resolve the situation. House and Senate GOP leaders have said they won't let that happen, though.","'States will have to pay millions of dollars to remediate the problems created by the Directive,' a court filing states .

"It could have been the handset that took on Apple and Google. Mark Zuckerberg and Xiaomi Inc CEO Lei Jun discussed a potential investment by Facebook in China's top smartphone maker ahead of its $1.1 billion fundraising last month, it has been revealed. The firm has been dubbed the 'Apple of China' - and enraged Apple who believe the firm simply copies their work. Xiaomi has enjoyed success with smartphones like the Mi-2A and Mi-2S after it was founded by Lei Jun (above) four years ago although the company has drawn criticism for copying some of Apple's products . Xiaomi achieved success in just four years by producing a range of low priced mobile phone handsets that have attracted millions of customers. It is now worth more than Uber, the taxi app - which went on the market valued at more than $18.2 billion (£11.7 billion). Investors now believe that Xiaomi it has the potential to become a global consumer brand and as a result they have poured in cash in recent months. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer recently became the most successful tech start-up in the world after being valued at $45 billion (£29 billion). However, a deal never materialized, several people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The discussions, at a private dinner when Zuckerberg visited Beijing in October, were never formalized, three of those people said, as the two CEOs weighed the political and commercial implications of Facebook - which has been banned in China since 2009 - buying into the Chinese tech star now valued at $45 billion. One individual with direct knowledge of Xiaomi's fundraising said the mooted Facebook investment was 'not huge,' but the talks underscore how ties between U.S. and Chinese companies have deepened as China's tech industry matures. A Facebook investment in Xiaomi would have raised the international profile of the popular handset maker dubbed 'China's Apple' by its fans and linked it to a U.S. social networking phenomenon with more than 1.3 billion users. Facebook, for its part, has long harbored ambitions to expand into the world's most populous country, potentially with partners. One of the individuals said Facebook and Xiaomi began discussing a possible investment in mid-2014. Xiaomi's Lei was partly put off by the potential for political fallout at home of selling a stake to Facebook while the U.S. social network is still banned in China, two of the people said, adding Xiaomi also feared a tie-up with Facebook could threaten its relationship with Google Inc, a crucial business partner. Xiaomi's phones are built on Google's Android operating system. Zuckerberg has eyed China as a critical piece of his vision to connect the global population. Xiaomi ultimately announced last month it raised $1.1 billion from investors including Hong Kong-based tech fund All Stars Investment; DST Global, a private equity firm that has invested in Facebook and Alibaba Group; Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC; Chinese fund Hopu Management; and Alibaba founder Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital. The fundraising valued Beijing-based Xiaomi at $45 billion just three years after it sold its first smartphone. The company had revenue of close to $12 billion in 2014. Similarities in the design of Xiaomi's products and those of Apple have earned the company the unofficial title as 'the Apple of China'. It even produces a MiTV similar to AppleTV and its own version of Apple's iCloud called MiCloud. Executives at Apple, which is valued at around $651.5 billion (£418.6 billion), have reacted badly to these, with its vice president of design SirJonathan Ive effectively accusing Xiaomi of theft. Apple's head of design hit out Xiaomi at the recent Vanity Fair New Estalishment Summit in San Francisco. Asked what he felt about the company being described as the 'Apple of China', Sir Jonathan Ive criticised them for copying his company's designs. 'I don't see it as flattery,' he said, 'I actually see it as theft.' Sir Jonathan  said seeing knockoff designs made him think of the lengthy development cycle that went into producing the originals. He said: 'When you're doing something for the first time, for example with the phone, and you don't know it's going to work, and you spend seven or eight years working on something, and then it's copied — I have to be honest, the first thing I think isn't 'ooh, that was flattering'. 'All those weekends I could have had at home with my lovely family but didn't, but the flattery made up for it.' However, Xiaomi's global vice president Hugo Barra said such accusations were 'sensationalist'. He told the Verge: 'If you have two similarly skilled designers, it makes sense that they would reach the same conclusion.' Zuckerberg has eyed China as a critical piece of his vision to connect the global population. But, like Google and Twitter, the social networking giant has been blocked by China's internet censors, who cite national security concerns. 'Facebook wants to get into China, and Xiaomi is keen to expand outside, so they both recognize the importance of working together,' said one of the knowledgeable individuals, none of whom wanted to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Xiaomi and Facebook declined to comment for this article. The two CEOs knew each other previously and deepened their relationship last year. In October, Zuckerberg was invited for dinner at Lei's Beijing home along with Facebookbusiness development chief John Lagerling and China head Vaughan Smith. The next day, Zuckerberg, whose wife is Chinese-American, addressed the prestigious Tsinghua University and won plaudits for speaking in Mandarin during a 30-minute Q&A session. The Xiaomi Miui 6 handset, which many have said is simply a copy of the iPhone 5S and uses its own apps, has helped turn Xiaomi into the third biggest smartphone producer in the world behind Apple and Samsung . As Xiaomi sought financing last year, ICONIQ Capital, a San Francisco-based fund that manages several individuals' personal wealth, including Zuckerberg's, also considered buying shares, but ultimately did not, several people with knowledge of the matter said. Talks about ICONIQ taking part in Xiaomi's financing were not led by Zuckerberg himself. Xiaomi is China's biggest smartphone maker, according to some industry analysts, and trails only Samsung Electronics and Apple in global market share. A strategic partnership with Xiaomi would give Facebook another avenue to distribute its apps and potentially provide a powerful ally in its bid to overturn its China ban. Xiaomi Redmi phones have been the company's best selling products in China, Singapore, Taiwan and India . For Xiaomi, access to Facebook's vast banks of user data would be valuable as it seeks to grow into a global internet company providing comprehensive online services. But Lei thought it would be 'too sensitive' to sell an equity stake to Facebook given its uncertain political status in China, said one of the people with knowledge of the matter. China's top internet censor, Lu Wei, has warned that social media, particularly foreign services, could be a destabilizing force for Chinese society. Lu, however, visited Facebook's U.S. headquarters last month, prompting speculation that relations between Facebook and China's government were warming.","Xiaomi was founded just four years ago by Chinese businessman Lei Jun .

"Outraged: Aristocrat fashion designer and Titanic survivor Lucy Duff-Gordon's angry letter about her mistreatment at the hands of British investigators and tabloids is hitting the auction block . A wealthy survivor of the Titanic sinking complains in a letter being auctioned this month of 'disgraceful' treatment in the press during a British inquiry into the disaster. The May 1912 letter by aristocratic fashion designer Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon is being offered by RR Auction of Boston. Duff-Gordon and her husband were among a dozen people who survived in a lifeboat built for 40. Tabloids dubbed it the 'Money Boat' because scuttlebutt had it that her husband bribed the crew to row away from the sinking ship faster. In a private letter to a friend, Lady Duff-Gordon writes, 'We didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all! Isn't it disgraceful.' According to RR Auction, the letter was composed the couple's Knightsbridge resident as a British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry into the accident was taking place. The couple were the only two passengers called to testify at the inquiry. In spite of their grilling in the press, the Duff-Gordons were cleared by the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry, which found only that more passengers may have been saved had the lifeboat turned around. 'Correspondence from prominent passengers with such exceptional Titanic content is rarely encountered—especially written so soon after the tragedy,' said Bobby Livingston, Executive VP at RR Auction. While little-known outside of fashion historian circles, Lady Duff-Gordon’s contributions to the fashion industry far exceed her limited notoriety. Lucile was not simply just a purveyor of hyper feminine clothes. It was a game-changer in the realms of fashion business practices, as well as marketing. Lady Duff-Gordon (who often went by Lucile, professionally) created the first-ever designer collaboration with a two-season run for Sears, Roebuck & Co. Appalled: The letter from Duff-Gordon reveals her anger over presumptions she and her wealthy husband paid off crew members to quickly row away from the sinking Titanic. She was rescued in a lifeboat that held 12 people despite being built for 40 . 'We didn't seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all! Isn't it disgraceful,' she tells a friend in the strongly worded May 1912 letter . She was also one of the first designers to stage runway shows, release a branded perfume, and issue coupons in magazines as a way to draw customers into her handful of international boutiques. Lucile was founded in 1893 according to Randy Bryan Bigham, author of the self-published book Lucile- Her Life by Design, as a way to support herself in the aftermath of her first marriage. Lady Duff-Gordon built Lucile’s name on attention-grabbing antics. She was the first designer to utilize celebrity culture as a method for attracting public recognition. Lady Duff-Gordon’s sister, the novelist and film producer Elinor Glyn, offered the designer an inside track to famous entertainers and the more renowned members of the Ziegfeld Follies, whom she dressed in a time when performers were still considered painted lady-type figures. Successful: Despite the shrill tone the Lady strikes in her letter, Lucy was a shrewd and cunning business woman who gained renown in the fashion world in her day . Lady Duff-Gordon’s many publicity stunts earned her label a certain sense of notoriety—one which was tempered by her lofty social title, which she earned in her second marriage to Scottish landowner and Olympic fencer Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon. ‘How she presented herself went a long way in the business, the whole idea that she was aristocratic allowed her to be so suggestive,’ said Beth Dincuff, a fashion history professor at Parsons, The New School for Design. Lady Duff-Gordon’s influence hit its peak in the Belle Époque era, a time when ruffled extravagance was de rigeuer among the world’s wealthy. But when the First World War hit, a need for simplified elegance suddenly arose. Tasked with maintaining her relevance, Lucile decided to expand her potential reach to the everyday person. In 1916, two years after the war began, Lady Duff-Gordon teamed up with then mail order-only business Sears, Roebuck & Co. on a small co-opted collection. The designs--which included daywear, special occasion items, outerwear, and even suits--were ‘very close to her couture aesthetic, super feminine with lots of ribbons, lots of layers, lots of lace, and sumptuous material like velvets, chiffon, and silks,’ said Calahan. With inflation, the garments (priced from $25 to $40), would cost between $500 and $900, which Calahan says is ‘very comparable to the cost of high-end ready-to-wear today.’ The designs, which were still custom-tailored (customers had to fill out forms with their full-body measurements), were remarkably less expensive than Lucile’s couture pieces that, with inflation, would run in the ballpark of $5,000. Lucile continued to design into the Twenties, but ‘she didn’t groom a successor, at that time once a designer would pass away the whole business would close. Those who had diversified later on, like Chanel, made sure there was someone to take over the business,’ Dincuff added. The house of Lucile entirely dissolved by 1933, and lay dormant until 2005 when her great-great granddaughter decided to reinvigorate the house for the modern era. Moneyboat: Despite their lifeboat being fit for 40, the Duff-Gordons' only held 12 survivors after the wreck. That, paired with speculation that Lucy's husband bribed crew members to speed away without letting the boat fill, won Titanic lifeboat No. 1 the nickname Moneyboat in the press .","Aristocratic fashion designer Lady Lucile Duff-Gordon wrote of the 'disgraceful' treatment she and her husband received in 1912 .

"Hunting for clothes in a busy shop can be a nightmare, but shopping online can be a bit hit-and-miss. This has led to a number of company's coming up with a compromise - interactive mirrors in shops that let you virtually try on different outfits, explore colours and patterns, and even order food. The latest to be rolled out in the US is the MemoryMirror that uses augmented reality to show how clothes will fit, and lets shoppers change outfits with the swipe of a hand. Other mirrors include eBay's interactive shopping assistant that finds different sizes and accessories, and Panasonic's 'flaws and all' mirror that helps people buy products to improve how they look. Scroll down for video . Red or green? MemoryMirror, or MemoMi (pictured) creates avatars of the shopper wearing various clothing. These clothes can be shared with friends, to ask for feedback, or viewed instantly to help make an in-store purchase. Using hand gestures, shoppers can also scroll through different colours, patterns and sizes . MemoryMirror, or MemoMi, was founded by California-based Salvador Nissi Vilcovsky. MemoMi uses Intel integrated graphics technology to create avatars of the shopper wearing various clothing. These clothes can be shared with friends on social media or via email, to ask for feedback, or viewed instantly to help make an in-store purchase. App: The app allows shoppers to check in to a store so staff can see their personal profile and suggest clothes that they will like. Shopping wall: Shoppers can see inspiring digital content on huge mirrored walls and send clothes they like to a fitting room to initiate a digital styling session. Magic mirrors: Touch screen mirrors in the fitting rooms identify clothes in different sizes and colours that are in stock. It can hint at matching items too. Using hand gestures, shoppers can scroll through different colours, patterns and sizes, and the smart mirror remembers previous outfit choices, so the shopper can compare and contrast. It also lets people add accessories, and see outfits from different angles without straining their neck or using a wall of mirrors. Initially unveiled last year, the technology is now being introduced into Neiman Marcus stores in San Francisco, and later,Texas. MemoMi works in a similar way to an interactive mirror announced last year from eBay. The online retailer teamed up with Rebecca Minkoff to transform her shop in Soho into a high-tech shopping hub, with shops in San Francisco and Los Angeles to follow shortly.

The system features ‘connected walls’, which are mirrored displays showing video content designed to inspire shoppers. Users swipe through looks and touch the screen to ask store staff to fill dressing rooms with the clothes they like - and even order drinks. An interactive fitting room mirror then acts as a personal stylist and suggests matching accessories to go with an item of clothing that a shopper has in the room with them.

Last week, Panasonic unveiled a similar mirror - although it's not quite as flattering. The Japanese firm's mirror analyses a person's face using built-in high-definition cameras, and points out every flaw. The mirror also lets people try on different makeup - and even facial hair (pictured) Other shops have, in the past, experimented with technology in fitting rooms that have been used for everything from scanning a person’s body to find clothes that fit, to allowing users to have their chosen items delivered to their home so they don’t have to carry them. There is also a new generation of smartphone apps that put colour-matching and ‘digital stylist’ options in users’ hands no matter which shop they are in. The Snap ColourPop iPhone app, for example, lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice. While stores might be getting smarter, there is already a free app that lets shopper find matching clothes at different price points and in precise shades. The Snap ColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice. Users of the app take a photograph of their chosen object using their smartphone camera and the app searches for clothes and accessories from 150 UK fashion retailers such as Net-a-Porter, Miss Selfridge and M&S, to find fashion items in exactly the same shade. The Snap ColourPop iPhone app lets users search for clothes and shoes in exactly the same colour as any object or inspirational landscape of their choice. On the left, a user photographs a sweet and on the right, the app suggests a dress in the same colour that a shopper can buy instantly from one of 150 stores . It does this using a specially developed algorithm that combs through over 120,000 products in seconds to find an exact, or close, colour match. The app claims to match shades of colours as closely as possible to the original photo, which means it could prove a quick solution for people wanting to find perfectly matching shoes to go with the rest of their outfit, without being restricted to a single shop. When the items found by the app are displayed, they can be filtered by clothing types, such as dresses or shirts, and can either be purchased immediately or saved for later in a ‘wishlist’ which can inform shoppers if the price of the item drops. The app is the first commercial product to use visual search technology to help people shop and Jenny Griffiths, a 27-year-old computer scientist, believes it will change the way people buy clothes in the future.

"It's a question that sparks endless debate among Star Wars fans; who exactly was the inspiration behind the legendary Yoda? Some believe the Jedi master was modeled on Albert Einstein, while others suggest the character's creator, Stuart Freeborn, designed Yoda based on himself. Now one biologist is arguing that Yoda was in fact based on a tiny, wide-eyed creature, named the tarsier, which can be found in the trees of Indonesia, Philippines and Borneo. Scroll down for video . The tasier is tiny, weighing around 0.3lb (150g). They can grow to just 15.2 cm (6 inches) in length. These creatures have incredibly large eyes, with each one the same size and weight as its brain . And it's easy to see why. They some of the biggest eyes relative to body size in the animal kingdom. They are incredibly small in size and have mysterious form of communication. According to Matt Simon at Wired, one of the world's experts on the creature, Myron Shekell, from Washington University believes the similarities between Yoda and the tarsier are striking. 'I work closely with a guy who knows Harrison Ford, and Harrison Ford of course knows Lucas, so we've been trying to get the actual answer for a while,' he told Wired. 'But we don't have it really confirmed.' There are believed to be around 10 species of tarsier. Growing to just 15.2 cm (6 inches) in length and weighing less than an average wristwatch, the tarsier is one of the smallest primates in the world.

While they are famous for not saying much at all, research several years ago found that they are real chatterbox' – in ultrasound. The tasier is tiny, weighing around 0.3lb (150g). They can grow to just 15.2 cm (6 inches) in length. These creatures have incredibly large eyes, with each one the same size and weight as its brain. Their main diet is insects. They commit suicide during captivity due to trauma from touching and loud noise. Research several years ago found that they are real chatterbox' – in ultrasound. This means they effectively have their own secrete language. Once found across the world since its evolution 45 million years ago, the mammal - which is in fact not classed as a monkey but a mammal akin to a lemur or bush baby - is now endangered. Researchers from Humboldt State University in California in fact found that the 'minimum frequency' of its call is 67 kHz - higher than any land-based animal bar rodents and some bats – and occasionally rising to 70 kHz. Anything above 20 kHz is inaudible to a human, with dogs able to detect sounds pitched up to 23 kHz. This means that the creatures effectively have a secret language that they can use to warn each other of predators. Reports suggest that if they get stressed, for example by being kept in captivity in a small enclosure, they commit suicide by smashing their heads against anything hard and handy. Once found across the world since its evolution 45 million years ago, the mammal - which is in fact not classed as a monkey but a mammal akin to a lemur or bush baby - is now endangered. The unwelcome attention of feral cats and the loss of habitat are to blame, but in some areas they are also caught and kept in captivity as tourist attractions. Dr Myron Shekell from Washington University believes Yoda (left) in Star Wars was based on the tiny tarsier (right) due to its huge eyes, tiny frame and the fact that it speaks a secret language .

"He's made an inspirational move from his street upbringing to become a bona fide pop star, so it was only a matter of time before Dizzee Rascal was hired as a talent show judge. The East London born chart-topper, 24, will be putting his musical knowledge to perfect use when he joins Sharleen Spiteri and Jamie Cullum on the judging panel for Sky1's Must Be The Music. The lyricist will be helping to find the UK's best new musical act, with hopefuls from every genre encouraged to audition for a chance to win the £100,000 cash prize. Singing for England: James Corden and Dizzee Rascal give it their all as they film the video to England's unofficial World Cup song . Mills said: 'I know how hard it is to break into the music industry and am giving all you fellow musicians out there a chance to come and show me, the other judges and the rest of the UK that we really do have some of the best musicians in the world right under our noses, who deserve a break. I'm here to give you that break.' Dizzee, real name Dylan Mills, has had a meteoric rise to fame since his debut album Boy In Da Corner won the Mercury Music Prize in 2003. Just last weekend his latest release Dirtee Disco hit the number one spot in the UK singles charts, giving him his fourth number one single. Hoping for success: Proceeds from the duo's single will be donated to Great Ormond Street hospital . The music maker started making music at school, graduating to priate radio where he performed with his former crew Roll Deep - which included ex-friend and fellow chart-topper, Wiley. The two worked together on his debut LP, which was released seven years ago to critical acclaim. Success soon followed, with hits including Dance Wiv Me, Sirens, Bonkers and latest number one Dirtee Disco, which features X Factor singer Daniel Pierce. So it must be said that, with his tough background, which saw him . expelled from four different schools, and subsequent climb into the . music industry Dizzee is more than qualified to dole out advice to the . show's hopefuls. Meanwhile, Dizzee could be set for another big hit after recording a World Cup track with comedian James Corden. Hoping for victory: Dizee will no doubt be hoping for another number one with the new single . The duo have recorded an unofficial England anthem (a cover of Tears for Fears song Shout), which they recorded on last Saturday's Britain's Got Talent final, and stills from the video have been released in anticipation of the new single. In the video, recorded at Rugby Union side Harlequins' London ground, Dizzee and James wear red England tops emblazoned with their names on the back. They are seen singing along in the crowd for the track, which has been masterminded by X Factor mogul Simon Cowell, 50. Tears for Fears singer Curt Smith also helped to rework his 1985 hit, with all royalties going to Great Ormond Street Hospital. Other stars, including Freddie Flintoff, Denise Van Outen and Vernon Kay, have also lent their support. It has been said that Dizzee's section on the track could well eclipse John Barnes' famous rap from the New Order 1990 anthem World In Motion. The single is available for download from tomorrow.",New unofficial World Cup anthem expected to top the charts .
"Combing through the bushland in Northern Territory, Jayden Provost set off on a hunting adventure to a remote cattle station, west of Katherine when he heard a noise coming from a scrub nearby. The 20-year-old took the safety off the weapon and started running towards the noise while holding the crossbow towards the ground. It wasn’t long before Provost, who now lives in Central Coast on the north coast of Sydney, stopped to look down to see what was holding his foot back. Jayden Provost was taken to hospital after shooting himself in the foot with his crossbow while hunting . ‘I had shot myself with the crossbow – pinning my foot to the ground,’ Provost told Daily Mail Australia. Trying to remain calm, the keen hunter pulled his foot up to look underneath his thong and noticed the end of the bolt had pierced right through and out the bottom. ‘I started to hop on one leg for about one kilometre back to the homestead before making my way to my room to put my crossbow back in its box,’ he recalls. ‘I was worried about telling my manager at the time and I didn’t want to go to his home because he didn’t know I had purchased one [crossbow]. ‘So I thought I would try and pull it out myself but when I tried, it didn’t budge at all.’ The end of the bolt had pierced right through his foot and back out the bottom of the thong . The incident happened in 2013 but he has made a full recovery after he was told he couldn't walk for months . It was the winter of June 2013, when his hunting experience had gone horribly wrong one evening. ‘There was not a drop of blood and believe it or not, it didn’t really hurt too badly – it was just throbbing a lot and felt really tight. ‘It started to hurt a bit when I walked to the kitchen and then I collapsed on the ground so I yelled out for help. Shortly after, the chef heard me so he came onto the veranda and looked shocked. ‘He yelled at me, saying: “Is that a crossbow bolt through your foot you silly p***k?”. Provost, who now works at a seafood export company, was taken to the nearest hospital by his colleague, which was an hour and a half away. ‘I was lying in the back seat and I started to feel a lot of pressure building up and honestly, I just wanted it out already. ‘It took us an hour and a half to get into town so my colleague chucked me a packet of smokes and said to get them into me. ‘It helped take my mind off the pain and I ended up smoking about 20 on the way.’ Provost, who works at a seafood export company, said the incident hasn't deterred him from hunting . The 20-year-old hopped on one leg for one kilometre back to his room to hide the weapon in a box . When Provost arrived at Katherine Hospital, 320 kilometres south-east of Darwin, he got out of the vehicle and hopped on one foot to the emergency room. ‘I went up to the reception desk and told the lady I had a sore foot so she asked to take a look,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. ‘I took a few steps back and held my foot up in the air and the look she gave me – it was like she had seen a ghost. ‘She started to panic and immediately took me to a bed. ‘I had doctors, nurses and paramedics coming in and asking for pictures – so I put on a smile and took some pictures with them.’ When the doctor arrived, he told Provost: ‘I’ve never seen anything like this before in my years as a doctor’. Provost went on an adventure to a remote cattle station to test out his new weapon on his day off from work . The 20-year-old accidentally shot himself with a crossbow when he was running to do some hunting . After putting a ‘numbing block’ on his leg to ease the pain, the doctor gave him two options – to be asleep during the procedure or awake while the arrow gets removed. ‘I told them to just do it while I’m awake,’ he said. ‘They got a scalpel and put a cut on either side to release some pressure and then he started to pull and yank on the arrow. ‘The pain started to get too much and I got really aggressive so I told the doctor to put me to sleep.’ When Provost woke up after the surgery, he said he felt ‘good and ready to go back to work’. ‘The doctor told me I was lucky that I didn’t break any of my bones but at the time, I couldn’t feel two of my toes so they sent me to the Royal Darwin Hospital for another surgery to try and repair my digital nerve but it was unsuccessful. ‘I got told it would take a few months before I could walk on it again but two weeks later, I was up and going again and made a full recovery. Provost tried to pull the arrow out but couldn't get it to budge so he hopped one kilometre to safety . When Provost woke up after the surgery, he said he actually felt ‘good and ready to go back to work’ Despite the dangerous accident, Provost said the incident hasn’t deterred him from hunting in the future . Despite the dangerous accident, Provost said the incident hasn’t deterred him from hunting in the future. ‘My accident didn’t turn me off mustering at the cattle station and it is one of my favourite jobs. But I’m living in NSW with my family and have a partner here. When asked what advice he would give to someone who might experience what he encountered, Provost said ‘don’t try and pull the arrow out if you accidently shoot yourself’. ‘I personally don’t think crossbows are dangerous because it was my own fault for not having the safety on,' he said. ‘It’s not like the movies so just go to the hospital and they will yank it out for you. ‘I would have been out hunting the next day if I could have.’","Jayden Provost shot himself in the foot with his crossbow while hunting .

"The European Parliament is today expected to clear the way for controversial ‘Frankenfood’ crops to be grown in Britain. MEPs will vote to clear the block on growing controversial genetically modified (GM) crops that has effectively stopped commercial cultivation for a decade. The new rules will allow each country to decide for itself whether or not to grow a GM crop – once it has been ruled safe by EFSA, which is the EU’s food safety body. The deal has been engineered by the British government, which wants GM crops to be grown here, following a series of secret briefings with GM companies and their trade body. The British government wants to be able to grow genetically modified crops that are banned in European countries such as Germany and France. Above, former Tory Environment Secretary Own Paterson views a genetically modified crop trial in Hertfordshire . The net effect is that even if a GM crop is banned in Germany, France, Italy and other European states, the Westminster government can allow it to be grown here from as early as next year. The Conservatives, Labour and Lib-Dems in Westminster support GM crops, however, the administrations in Scotland, Wales and many English councils remain opposed. There is also concern among consumers amid suspicion the crops pose risks to human health and the environment. At the same time, organic farmers and green campaigners point to the damage caused by the growing of GM crops on an industrial scale in North America. There, superweeds have developed that are difficult to control, leading to the need for ever more powerful chemical weedkillers, while important species like the Monarch butterfly are under threat. Critics fear that pollen from GM plants will spread to other conventional and organic crops, as well as honey, so polluting the entire food chain. The first GM crops to be grown here could be varieties of corn or maize created by the labs of Syngenta and Monsanto, which are modified to give them protection from the weedkiller glyphosate, also known as RoundUp Ready. The idea is that these crops can be blanket sprayed with the chemical which will kills off any weeds but allows the corn to grow. Advocates of genetically modified crops say that the technology can increase production and nutrition while opponents point to dangers to the environment . Advocates claim that in the future GM technology could be used to produce more food in areas of drought, or develop plants that are high in beneficial nutrients. The new legal regime that is expected to be adopted today  is at odds with the principles of the EU and single market, which has previously insisted that all member states should apply the same rules on food and farming. Despite that, it will be voted through because countries opposed to GM will be able to ban them, while those in favour, such as Britain and Spain, can go ahead. The arrangements have been hailed as a success for the pro-GM campaigner and former Tory Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, who was sacked last year. He, along with ministers from Spain, led the drive in Brussels to speed the commercial growing of GM crops. The policy sprang out of a series of secret briefings between ministers, their civil servants and the GM industry’s Agricultural Biotechnology Council, which began in the summer of 2012. Ministers subsequently promised incentives for investment, a strategy for biotech and, most significantly, efforts to reduce regulation and speed up GM crop approvals, which will come to fruition today. The details of these meetings were revealed following a series of Freedom of Information Act requests by the campaigning group GeneWatch. Its director, Dr Helen Wallace, said: ‘This EU deal arose from secret meetings between the UK Government and the GM industry, which wants to plant its RoundUp Ready GM crops in England, despite opposition from the public. ‘Massive environmental problems with these crops in the USA include the devastating loss of 90per cent of Monarch butterflies and the spread of resistant superweeds, due to blanket spraying of the crops with weedkiller. ‘Growing GM in England would risk contamination of non-GM crops, pushing up food prices and risking loss of export markets. The Scottish and Welsh governments will say no to GM crops, but in England people will have to fight for local regions to opt out.’ Liz O’Neill, the director of GM Freeze, said: ‘Contamination incidents all over the world show that seed and pollen will spread wherever the wind, wildlife and human error take them, right along the supply chain. ‘This directive offers no meaningful protection to people who want to make informed choices about what they are eating or to farmers who want to protect their fields from the superweeds and biodiversity loss associated with the kind of GM crops likely to be heading our way.’ Last week, the government’s new Environment Secretary Liz Truss confirmed her support for GM. She told a farming conference in Oxford: ‘I think GM crops have a role to play here in Britain.’ However, her counterpart in Scotland, Richard Lochhead, a member of the SNP, said: ‘The jury is still out on the environmental and scientific case for GM. We don’t want to see GM ruin Scotland’s reputation as a clean, green country.’ The European Parliament reached a deal on genetically modified crops despite opposition from campaigners after a push from the British and Spanish governments .","Rules will allow Britain to grow crops banned in other European states .

"Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. A group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking (pictured), have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. Elon Musk previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to 'summoning the demon' But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. 'Our AI systems must do what we want them to do,' the letter says. 'Many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of AI while mitigating adverse effects, which could include increased inequality and unemployment.' Other signatories to the FLI's letter include Luke Muehlhauser, executive director of Machine Intelligence Research Institute and Frank Wilczek, professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Nobel laureate. The letter comes just weeks after Professor Hawking warned that AI could someday overtake humans. Google has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence. The . search giant has recently bought several robotics companies, along with . Deep Mind, a British firm creating software that tries to help . computers think like humans. One . of its founders warned artificial intelligence is 'number one risk for . this century,' and believes it could play a part in human extinction . 'Eventually, . I think human extinction will probably occur, and technology will . likely play a part in this,' DeepMind's Shane Legg said in a recent . interview. Among all forms . of technology that could wipe out the human species, he singled out . artificial intelligence, or AI, as the 'number 1 risk for this century.' The ethics board, revealed by web site The Information, is to ensure the projects are not abused. Neuroscientist . Demis Hassabis, 37, founded DeepMind two years ago . with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans. Speaking at event in London, the physicist told the BBC: 'The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.' This echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating AI 'would be the biggest event in human history, [but] unfortunately, it might also be the last.' In November, Elon Musk, the entrepreneur behind Space-X and Tesla, warned that the risk of 'something seriously dangerous happening' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence, could be in as few as five years. He has previously linked the development of autonomous, thinking machines, to 'summoning the demon'. Speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AeroAstro Centennial Symposium in October, Musk described artificial intelligence as our 'biggest existential threat'. He said: 'I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence. If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that. So we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence. 'I'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish. 'With artificial intelligence we're summoning the demon. You know those stories where there's the guy with the pentagram, and the holy water, and … he's sure he can control the demon? Doesn't work out.'

"A video of a precocious five-year-old doling out some sage advice to his crying sister has scooped an impressive $10,000 prize on America’s Funniest Home Videos. The clip shows Charlotte Carr, two, sobbing at her family's kitchen table in Canal Winchester, Ohio, only to be reprimanded by her exasperated older brother Wesley. 'Did you have a nap today?' he asks matter-of-factly, while glaring at his emotional sibling. Straight talk: Wesley (left) has given his crying sister Charlotte (right) some practical advice in a funny new video . 'I didn't!' she responds, sobbing. Rather than asking what has upset her, Wesley delivers some tough love, simply replying: 'Well, you need one.' Charlotte remains unimpressed with Wesley's advice, grabbing his arm while insisting: 'No, I don't!' Important question: 'Did you have a nap today?' Wesley calmly asked Charlotte as she sobbed . Pillow talk: 'Well, you need one,' Wesley advised after Charlotte admitted she hadn't had a nap . The children's father, Jared Carr, told Daily Mail Online that Wesley has always had a 'great relationship' with his little sister. 'They certainly have their moments of fighting, pestering and competing like most young siblings, but are mostly pleasant with one another. Wes has a tender heart and it's not uncommon for him to run to his sister to comfort her if she's upset.' Mr  Carr added: 'Wes is wise beyond his years. He’s had a lot of experience with little ones. He has two small cousins close by. He's pretty sharp and soaks up a lot of what mom and dad say. I do think he doesn't like to see her cry…especially if it's because she's in trouble. A lot of times he’ll advise her on what to do, trying to steer her out of trouble.' The reason for Charlotte's tears, he added, was a lack of interest in the dinner options he was offering her. Popular: The video won a $10,000 prize on America's Funniest Home Videos last week . While Mr Carr doesn't usually record his children crying, he wanted their mother to witness Charlotte's stubborn reaction when she returned home. 'Most parents know that sometimes your kids are having such a meltdown it's almost funny,' he added. Both children were very excited about winning a prize on America's Funniest Home Videos - but Wesley more than Charlotte. Mr Carr said: 'He had some ideas on how we should spend the money. Charlotte was probably more excited about the plane ride and candy backstage.' The 13-second video has garnered nearly 1.8 views on YouTube since it was posted on January 5.","Charlotte Carr, two, was crying at her family's kitchen table in Canal Winchester, Ohio, when her brother Wesley delivered some tough love ."

"Staff at a bakers that was forced to close after the bin lorry crash in Glasgow which killed six people were told their wages would be docked if they did not turn up for work. Greggs in George Square in Glasgow was at the centre of a police cordon after the crash and was unable to open the next day. But staff working at the bakery claim they were told if they did not turn up for work the day after the tragedy and agree to work at a different store, they would lose money. Staff at Greggs bakery in George Square in Glasgow claim they were told their pay would be docked if they did not work the day after the bin lorry crash, when their store had to be closed because it was in the cordon . A worker at the bakery, who did not want to be named, said: 'The day after the crash the shop here was closed and staff were told of they didn't go to another shop they would not be paid.' Six people were killed and 10 injured when the truck, with a driver and two colleagues on board, mounted a pavement packed with Christmas shoppers near George Square on December 22. The bin lorry hurtled through a busy junction, ramming a taxi, just seconds before it crashed into the Millennium Hotel in Glasgow's George Square. Teenager Erin McQuade and her grandparents, childhood sweethearts, Lorraine and Jack Sweeney, from Dumbarton, were killed in the crash. Jacqueline McQuade, mother to Erin, is believed to have gone to take out money from a cash machine during the Christmas shopping trip when her 18-year-old daughter and parents were struck by the out-of-control bin lorry.

"Leaker: WikiLeaks staffer Sarah Harrison says the  FSB approached Snowden while he was stuck in the transit area of Sheremetyevo airport for six weeks . A close ally of Edward Snowden reportedly told filmmakers that Russia's intelligence agency sought to recruit the former NSA contractor, but he declined the offer. WikiLeaks staffer Sarah Harrison said the Russian FSB intelligence security service approached Snowden while he was stuck in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport for six weeks in 2013, the Associated Press reported. At the time, Snowden was unable to enter Russia or fly elsewhere because his passport had been canceled by U.S. authorities seeking to arrest him for leaking secret documents. According to the AP, Harrison told German filmmakers in a documentary airing late Monday that the FSB asked only once, and he 'didn't give anything to the Russians at all.' The FSB did not respond to a request for comment. Russia granted Snowden temporary asylum in August 2013. However, WikiLeaks spokesman Kristin Hrafnsson issued a clarification Monday. Speaking to Sputnik News, Hrafnsson said 'I talked to Sarah [Harrison] and she wants to reiterate that she simply said that we confirm that [Snowden] was approached by the Russian Security Service while at the airport. As he actually indeed confirmed himself in his testimony to the EU parliament in January last year.' Hrafnsson also told the website that FSB at no time attempted to recruit Snowden. Hrafnsson stated that 'She [Harrison] never used the word ""to recruit"" and neither did [Snowden].' The news comes after Snowden praised Russia and called the country 'great' in a NOVA interview, a transcript of which was published online last week. Snowden said in the interview 'It was funny because [Mike Hayden, former Director of the National Security Agency and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency] was talking about how I was—everybody in Russia is miserable. Russia is a terrible place. And I’m going to end up miserable and I’m going to be a drunk and I’m never going to do anything. 'I don’t drink. I’ve never been drunk in my life. And they talk about Russia like it’s the worst place on earth. Russia’s great.' According to The Washington Post, Hayden said he expected Snowden to 'end up like most of the rest of the defectors who went to the old Soviet Union: isolated, bored, lonely, depressed – and most of them ended up alcoholics.'

"With her flawless skin, soft smoky eyes and rouge lips, Amal Clooney was the epitome of Hollywood glamour at the Golden Globes on Sunday. Amal, 36, dazzled in a black custom Dior gown with cross-shoulder train and elbow-length gloves, in a look reminiscent of screen legend Audrey Hepburn. The human rights lawyer, who is married to Hollywood stalwart George Clooney, called on the best beauty buff in the business to make her over for the awards - and FEMAIL has the step-by-step guide to creating her look at home. Scroll down for video . Amal Clooney had a makeover courtesy of Charlotte Tilbury using her products at Sunday's Golden Globes . Amal called on Charlotte Tilbury, who also works with Kate Moss, Kim Kardashian and Cara Delevingne, to get red carpet-ready. Speaking about working with the star, Charlotte said: 'Amal knows and loves my products - she wears my Matte Revolution Lipsticks in Walk of Shame, Bond Girl and Amazing Grace. 'I went into knowing what she likes, so I created a retro beauty look inspired by the silver screen sirens that fits her classic style.' This isn't the first time the pair have worked together; Charlotte gave Amal her bridal beauty look when she tied the knot with George in September last year. Want to emulate Amal? Charlotte shared her step-by-step guide to getting the look using her own product range, which is loved by a plethora of A-listers. Charlotte started by prepping the top lawyer's skin with one of her new and soon-to-be-released products: the Goddess Skin Clay Mask, which she used to create a 'veil of perfection' on the skin. UK make-up guru Charlotte, who also beautified Amal for her September wedding to George Clooney, Instagrammed this snap of the lawyer saying what a 'pleasure' it was to work with the 'stunning' star . Speaking about creating Amal's make-up, Charlotte said: 'I went into today knowing what she likes, so I created a retro beauty look inspired by the silver screen sirens that fits her classic style' Charlotte then applied her Magic Cream -  named by the supermodels backstage at Fashion Week - to the entire face followed by her Wonderglow to create a flawless soft focus and an instant 'spotlight' effect, which acted as the perfect base to foundation. She concealed any dark circles with her retoucher concealer and rid the face of any unwanted oils with a dusting of her powder down the middle of the face only to keep Amal’s skin dewy and fresh. Next, she used her Brow Lift in Cara D - named by none other than her close friend and brow queen, Cara Delevingne - to perfect Amal's brows and shape the face. To bring out the golden highlights in Amal’s eyes, Charlotte applied the glittery 'pop' shade from her Luxury Palette in The Dolce Vita across the lids. Eyeliner was applied around the eye and to soften the liner followed by three coats of mascara to the top lashes and only one coat to bottom lashes to create an open-eyed look. Charlotte also squeezed in Sienna Miller and transformed her into an ethereal red carpet beauty . Charlotte got Downton Abbey star Laura Carmichael ready for the BAFTA Tea Party in LA on Saturday . To add an unbeatable red carpet-worthy glow, she used her popular Filmstar Bronze & Glow to highlight and sculpt the cheeks, nose, jawline and temples. Khloe Kardashian also used this ahead of her red carpet appearance at a party over the weekend. To create perfectly dewy cheeks, Charlotte used both Cheek to Chic in Love Glow and First Love across the cheekbones. She completed the look with a velvety-looking red lip by using Lip Cheat Lip Liner in Savage Rose along with a mixture of Charlotte Tilbury K.I.S.S.I.N.G. Lipstick in Night Crimson and Matte Revolution Lipstick in Red Carpet Red. Finally, she applied her Multi-Miracle Glow, £45, for moisture and a dewy finish followed by her Supermodel Body to sculpt and illuminate the limbs. Kim Kardashian, 33, famed for her curves, also uses the £45 product to define and enhance her legs. Speaking about the lotion, which is described as the perfect way to cheat your dream body without the workout, Kim said: 'It's legendary! I used it on my legs.' Make-up maestro Charlotte said of the product: 'I have poured all my make-up artist know-how into creating this incredible slimmer shimmer that acts like shapewear lingerie for the skin.' The product is enriched with FermiProtect, a wild shitake extract that protects the collagen fibres in the skin, aiming to make the skin look and feel firmer, toned and supple, to create the contouring effect. It also contains precious metal highlighter mix to recreate Charlotte's secret 'celebrity limb trick' - the technique whereby she highlights along the centre of legs and arms to create the illusion of leaner, longer limbs. Charlotte is friends with all the A-listers, seen, left, with Kendall Jenner and, right, with Victoria Beckham . Rihanna, Kate Moss and Charlotte seen hanging out together . The Kardashians are huge fans of Charlotte Tilbury's range of products and Khloe, pictured, used the Filmstar Bronze & Glow ahead of her appearance at a party this weekend . The product also contains  caffeine, which promises to detox the skin tissues, reduce unevenness in the skin and any bloated puffiness, while menthol works to promote micro-circulation and blood-flow. 'It's easy body make-up in a minute,' adds Charlotte, who applies it by twisting the applicator and rolling the cooling-metal massager down the centre of limbs to  promote lymphatic drainage, then blends out with her hands. Charlotte added: 'Any stylist will tell you that wearing black slims, streamlines and contours, but white widens. They’re basic laws of art, photography and make-up artistry. I always use the same principles when body contouring. 'You can elongate and slim by highlighting down the centre, and shading at the edges. I’ve using this trick on the glorious angels of the runway and stars on the red carpet for years.' It certainly worked wonders on Amal. As a modern day power woman who battles in world-changing human rights cases by day and wears Valentino by night, this Golden Globes appearance is another style triumph for the impossibly elegant star.","Charlotte Tilbury created retro beauty look inspired by old Hollywood .

"A ‘bruised and defeated’ Jeannette Bougrab will not attend the funeral of her lover Charb – the slain editor of Charlie Hebdo. Her decision comes after an extraordinary intervention by his family who denied the couple had any committed relationship and demanded she ceased speaking about him. Charb’s brother, Laurent, issued the ‘one-off’ statement from the family on Saturday, following a series of emotional interviews given by the former minister of State. Scroll down for video . Miss Bougrab (centre) claimed she was the partner of deceased Charlie Hebdo editor, Charb, and said they had lived together for three years . The editor of Charlie Hebdo, Stephane Charbonnier, also known as 'Charb' pictured with Jeannette Bougrab and her three-year-old daughter . Now Miss Bougrab – mother of an adopted three year old daughter May – says: ‘In the morning I was with his parents at the Forensic Institute to see the body of my companion. ‘But now I’ve agreed to remove myself and I will not go to his funeral. I do not have the strength to fight for that. I am bruised and defeated. ‘But they won’t take away my fight for secularism.’ Bitterly, Miss Bougrab said of her decision not to attend the funeral: “The family have deprived me of a last reunion with my love. ‘By doing that they’ve killed him a second time.’ Earlier, on hearing of the family’s terse denial, Bougrab phoned Paris Match to say: ‘Human nature is ugly. We loved each other because we were both independent personalities. Stephane Charbonnier - 'Charb' (pictured), the editor of Charlie Hebdo, was among six of the magazine's journalists to be killed in the attack . Miss Bougrab, pictured crying outside the Charlie Hebdo offices on the day of the massacre, has said she loved Charb 'because of the way he was - because he was brave' The former Secretary of State was pictured weeping for her lost love outside Paris City hall . The daughter of Algerian immigrants, Jeannette Bougrab (pictured) was a fierce critic of religion - particularly Islam . ‘We didn’t do a press release to announce our relationship but we weren’t hiding it. He had met my mother, my daughter called him dad.’ Now she says they’d been involved for a year although earlier reports implied much longer. Several friends of the couple have since backed her claims of a relationship. Bougarb, a 41 year old lawyer, quickly became the public face of France’s mourning soon after the killing of 12 people, mainly journalists, at the office of the satirical magazine. Grief stricken, frequently in tears, she gave a series of emotional television interviews saying she knew he would be killed and describing how she begged him to leave France. ‘ My companion is dead because he drew in a newspaper.’ ‘He never had children because he knew he was going to die. He lived without fear but he knew he would die.’ The former French Secretary for Youth and Community Life described to French TV station BMFTV how she got the news he was killed. ‘I was at a state meeting and I learned there had been a shooting. ‘Then I sent him a text, a second text, third text, and then I phoned him and he wasn’t answering and he never did that. ‘When I got there, there were the cordons and we weren’t allowed to get in and I learned there that he was dead.’ An emotional Jeannette Bougrab  rushed to the scene of the shooting (pictured) when her boyfriend, Stephane Charbonnier, did not reply to her texts . Anger: Miss Bougrab slammed the 'inadequate' security around the Charlie Hebdo offices, saying: 'We could have avoided this massacre' Lost: Jeannette Bougrab (right) had lived with Charb (left) and her adopted daughter May for three years . Proudly, Bougrab added: ‘He died standing. ‘He defended secularism. He defended the spirit of Voltaire. ‘He, in fact, was really the fruit of this ideal of the Republic that we’ve almost forgotten. ‘He died, executed with his comrades, as he would say.’ Bougrab, a member of the French National Council of State who served under Nicolas Sarkozy’s administration has been described as a ‘hard secularist’. The daughter of Algerian immigrants she is known as a fierce critic of religion, particularly of Islam. She admitted herself that she and Charb were an unlikely pairing although she’d been fascinated by him before they met. He was a communist, she a member of UMP, the centre right party. ‘I have lost my love, lost a part of me. I was with a hero I admired. We tried to live normally but it was complicated.’ Six of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and staff members killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and  Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Harsh truth: Jeannette Bougrab said of the 'Je Suis Charlie' movement: 'I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life' Hitting out at the inadequate security given to the satirical magazine and its staff, she later told TF1: ‘I haven’t lost Charlie Hebdo. I’ve lost a loved one. I am here not as a former government minister, but as a woman who has lost her man, who has been murdered by barbarians. ‘I admired him before I fell in love with him and I loved him because of the way he was, because he was brave. He thought that life was a small thing when he was defending his ideals. ‘Do you know people capable of dying for their ideas today? No. Because they’ve just died, they’ve just been murdered. That’s the reality, we could have avoided this massacre. We could have avoided it and we didn’t.’ Asked if she had been comforted by the world’s adoption of the ‘Je Suis Charlie’ symbol and that it could be seen as a sign of victory, of hope, Bougrab said passionately: . ‘Absolutely not, because he’s dead. It’s absolutely not a victory. It’s a defeat. It’s a tragedy for our country and I refused to rejoice in the idea that people are demonstrating in the streets because they have torn away the precious being who accompanied me in life.’ Now she would like to see all the murdered cartoonists buried in the Parthenon where Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau lie. ‘They died defending freedom of expression, secularism. They died so we can stay free in this country in France in 2015.’","Jeannette Bougrab, 41, claimed she was 'partner' of Charlie Hebdo editor .

"France is today mobilising 10,000 members of its security forces to station around 'sensitive sites' after last week's terror attacks left 17 innocent people dead in Paris. Interior Minister Bernard Cazaneuve said 5,000 people will be sent to protect the country's 717 Jewish schools, adding that troops would also be sent as reinforcements over the next two days. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the Minister for Defence, confirmed the deployment will begin from tomorrow following a security briefing this morning. Scroll down for video . Around 10,000 security personnel will be deployed across the country from tomorrow with 5,000 sent to protect Jewish schools with troops sent in as backup (pictured, troops in Paris last week) French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the 'threat is still present' after last week's attacks left 17 people dead, plus three gunmen killed by police (pictured, police patrol Gare du Nord station in Paris) The news comes as French authorities said they are hunting for another accomplice of Deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who posted his suicide video online after he was shot dead . The French Prime Minister Manuel Valls insisted the extra security was necessary because 'the threat is still present' after last week's attacks. Journalists, civilians and three police officers were killed after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi attacked the offices of magazine Charlie Hebdo, before accomplice Amedy Coulibaly shot a traffic officer and took hostages inside a Jewish supermarket. Mr Valls told BFM television today that France is at war against 'terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam'. The news comes as David Cameron was briefed on the threat posed to Britain by security chiefs in Downing Street this morning. A No 10 spokesman said that future counter-terror training exercises will include scenarios similar to the Paris attack. Mr Valls also told BFM television this morning that France is at war against 'terrorism, against jihadism, against radical Islam' Authorities say that Britain should seek to learn from what happened in the French capital. Mr Cameron, who joined French president Francoise Hollande and more than a million marchers on the streets of Paris yesterday, emphasised the need for the police to be able to call on military assistance in the event of a major emergency. He also stressed the importance of international co-operation to prevent the cross-border smuggling of firearms and other weapons. Meanwhile French authorities said they were hunting another 'probable accomplice' to Amedy Coulibaly, 32, who shot a policewoman before leaving another four people dead inside a Jewish supermarket. Police say they want to speak to whoever edited and posted a suicide video which appeared online after Coulibaly was shot dead by police. Detectives say the footage was edited after the attacks. Colibaly's girlfriend, Hayat Boumedienne, is on the run after managing to evade French officers, cross Europe, and enter Turkey. Mevlut Cavusoglu, Turkey's foreign minister, told the state-run Anadolu news agency today that Hayat Boumedienne arrived in Turkey from Madrid on January 2, ahead of the attacks. He added that she had stayed at a hotel in Istanbul before crossing into Syria on January 8. It is believed Boumeddiene evaded capture in the Turkish capital because French intelligence services did not share details of her identity with their Turkish counterparts. A source told MailOnline: 'She just slipped through the net. It is that simple. It should not have happened. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian (centre) announced that security forces were being deployed this morning after a security briefing alongside Francois Hollande . David Cameron, who attended a solidarity march in Paris yesterday, was also given a briefing today on the threat posed to the UK by terrorists in the wake of last week's attacks . 'She should have been on the radar of French intelligence, and they should have told their contacts about her movements – but they failed to do that. 'If the security services had done their job properly, they would never have let her leave the country. 'But once she left France and arrived in Turkey, she had the opportunity to go anywhere. It is unbelievable she has got away so easily.'","5,000 personnel will be sent to protect country's 717 Jewish schools .

"Despite delighting British taste buds for 52 years, it seems the Creme Egg recipe isn't sacrosanct to its new American owners. They’ve tinkered with the traditional formula by getting rid of the much-loved Cadbury Dairy Milk shell and instead using what critics say is an inferior and nasty chocolate. The swap has left a bitter taste in the mouths of Creme Egg fans, with many taking to Kraft’s Twitter feed and Facebook page to express outrage. Cadbury has reportedly changed the shell of the Creme Egg, pictured, and is now using a standard cocoa mix rather than Dairy Milk . ‘They taste really cheap and poor quality this year – #refund,’ wrote one yesterday. Another complained: ‘Why oh why did you sell out to Yanks? Their sweeties are awful.’ And Luke Keenan asked the question on most people’s lips: ‘Why mess with the Creme Eggs? No need!’ Kraft, which makes 200 million Creme Eggs a year, met each complaint with the same reply: ‘Our eggs still consist of the Cadbury milk chocolate and yummy creme centre fundamentals they always have.’ The Chicago-based company denied the new chocolate was a cheap substitute – insisting it was virtually identical to Cadbury Dairy Milk in that it was a blend of the same milk, cocoa and sugar. However, analysis of the ingredients reveals there is less cocoa – 14 per cent compared with 20 per cent in Dairy Milk – so it is probably cheaper to make. And the difference certainly hasn’t fooled consumers. Creme Egg fan Mark Bardney blasted: ‘It’s not the same chocolate recipe – please stop lying to us!’ Chocolate giant Cadbury have downsized its boxes of Creme Eggs and are now selling them in packs of five . Previously, the chocolate treats were sold in boxes of six and making the boxes smaller has angered some chocolate fans . Many Cadbury customers took to to Twitter to complain about the reduction in Creme Eggs found in each box . Creme Eggs have been part of British culture since 1963, when they were introduced by Cadbury as Fry’s Creme Eggs. The name was changed in 1971 but the taste of the iconic Easter treat had remained the same. Now Kraft has not just meddled with that recipe – it has also changed the size of the popular multipacks. Yesterday the Mail told how the number of eggs in each pack has been cut from six to five, meaning the cost per egg has risen from 50.8p to 57p. The new recipe was taste-tested with consumers before the eggs went on sale this month, a Kraft spokesman said. ‘The fundamentals of Cadbury Creme Egg remain exactly the same – delicious milk chocolate and the unique creme centre that consumers love.’ He explained that the decision to use a new recipe ‘meant we could utilise our chocolate supplies within the factory more efficiently’. It’s not the first time that Kraft, which paid £11.5 billion for Cadbury in a controversial 2010 deal, has come under fire for undermining the historic British brand. Bosses have never been forgiven for reneging on a promise to keep open a Cadbury factory at Keyn-sham, near Bristol, in 2011. They were also criticised for shifting large parts of their chocolate production to cheaper facilities in Poland. Cadbury chocolates have been getting smaller, too, with the 140g bar of Dairy Milk shrinking to 120g, and tins of Roses being pruned from 975g to 753g. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .","Cadbury has reportedly changed the recipe of the shell of Creme Eggs .

"An engaged, pregnant mother has claimed she was fired by her Baptist Church employer because she was not married. Apryl Kellam, 21, had been employed at the daycare center at Staples Mill Road Baptist Church in Henrico County, Virginia since September. However Miss Kellam, who lives with her fiancé, James, her five-year-old stepdaughter and two-year-old daughter, lost her job on Monday for 'violating policies'. Mother Apryl Kellam, pictured with her fiancé James, claims she was fired from her job at a Baptist church daycare center because she was living out of wedlock . Miss Kellam, pictured with her daughter  alleged that the employee handbook tells workers they need to be married in order to work in the daycare center but that she did not sign the document. Details of why she was fired were not explained to Miss Kellam but she told Daily Mail Online today that she believed it was because of her living situation about which she had been repeatedly questioned by her daycare boss. She said: 'I was told, ''you are not Christian if you decide to keep taking your life this way.''' The 21-year-old was employed as a 'floater teacher' at the daycare in September. She said that on her resume it stated that most of her experience for the job came because she had her own children. When asked to fill out a form of employee details, she then ticked the 'single' box, stating she lived with the girls and her fiancé. After she got the job, Miss Kellam said she was shown an employee handbook by co-workers which said she needed to be married in order to work in the daycare center. However she did not receive the handbook on getting the job, nor had she signed it. Miss Kellam found out in November that she was expecting another baby and told her boss who   realized she was not married. 'She wanted us to go to the court so we could have the marriage certificate on file,' Miss Kellam said. At her review last Thursday, her employer praised her work but once again raised the problem of Miss Kellam not being married. The boss said that if she didn't set a date to get married by Monday. she would be out of a job. The Staples Mill Road Baptist Church in Virginia fired an employee for 'violating policies' on Monday - but she suspects it is because she is pregnant and living with her partner out of wedlock . Pastor Jim Booth would not comment on specific employee matters on Monday but added that the church 'do not have any policies against single mothers' The pregnant mother was fired today for as yet undisclosed reasons. The mom, who is 25 weeks pregnant, admitted that having to live off only her fiancé's pay check would be 'stressful', but she was hoping to get another job soon. The church's pastor, Jim Booth, told Daily Mail Online on Monday that he could respond to a specific personnel matter. However he said that the church 'certainly do not have any policies against single mothers. We have a number of single women and single mothers employed and faithfully serving in our ministry'. He added: 'Due to personnel confidentiality I am not able to share the specific cause for the termination of an employee.' Although the federal Family and Medical Leave Act prevents pregnant women being discriminated against, the Supreme Court has ruled that religious organizations can enforce a religious contract on its employees.","Apryl Kellam, 21, was employed at the daycare center at Staples Mill Road Baptist Church in Henrico County in Virginia since September .

"Gentlemen really do prefer blondes. According to new research, the average American male would describe their 'perfect woman' as having blonde hair, blue eyes and - perhaps surprisingly - a graduate degree. The survey, which was conducted by dating auction website WhatsYourPrice.com, also revealed that the majority of men prefer non-smokers, and, in an ideal world, would rather that their date was more of a social drinker, rather than someone who indulged in alcohol on a regular basis. Celebrity status: The average U.S. male's ideal woman has blonde hair and blue eyes, like supermodels Gigi Hadid (L) and Candice Swanepoel (R) Each of the 145,000 men who took part in the poll, were asked to attach a specific financial value to each attribute in order to come up with a total 'cost' for their ideal first date. For example, blonde hair was valued at an average of $59.31, while a slender body came in at $55.43. But the most valued attribute of all was a graduate degree; the average price men were willing to pay to date a woman who had boasts a post-graduate qualification was a whopping $59.90. 'The perfect woman must possess both style and substance,' says Brandon Wade, Founder and CEO of the site. Blonde ambition: The majority of men surveyed prefer non-smokers who only indulge in alcohol during social situations . 'The study confirms that men are willing to spend just as much on a woman's intellect and education as her physical qualities.' Models Gigi Hadid and Candice Swanepoel possess the same physical ideals that were highly ranked throughout the study. In addition to meeting the strict physical criteria, Gigi, 19, is currently studying for a degree in Criminal Psychology at The New School in New York City. WhatsYourPrice.com calculated how money money its male members were willing to offer to date a woman with specific traits. According to the data, men would pay an average of: . $59.31 for blonde hair . $54.92 for blue eyes . $55.43 for a slender body . $51.16 for a non-smoker . $49.67 on someone who is a social drinker . $59.90 for a female with a graduate degree . WhatsYourPrice.com offered participants a wealth of different attributes to choose from, including hair color, eye color, body type, smoking and drinking habits and level of education. The site calculated how much money the men were willing to offer to date a woman with specific traits, and then the qualities were ranked in relation to the average price paid for a first date.

"An obsessed 24 fan who changed his name to Jack Bauer cut a taxi driver’s neck in a bizarre planned attack. The 26-year-old, who changed his name from Carl Ennis to that of the TV drama’s star, donned a balaclava and padded vest before asking his girlfriend if she would still love him if he hurt someone. Bauer, from South Shields, who had no previous convictions, told taxi driver David Pearson he was going to a fancy dress party before attacking him as he drove in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear. Attack: Jack Bauer (left), who changed his name from Carl Ennis to that of the TV drama’s star (right, played by Kiefer Sutherland), donned a balaclava and padded vest before taking a taxi and attacking the driver . Newcastle Crown Court heard Bauer pulled out a flick knife and pressed it against Mr Pearson’s neck. Judge John Milford described the incident as ‘extraordinary’ as he jailed him for 16 months. Bauer had been drinking heavily before the incident, in the early hours of November 30. Following a night out, he got out of bed shortly after midnight. And when his girlfriend went to see where he was, she found him dressed in combat gear in the lounge, holding a weapon. Michael Bunch, prosecuting, said: ‘He said: “Would you still love me if I hurt someone and got arrested?” He left the house and it would appear he took with him an extendable baton which had been by the bed and a flick knife.’ Bauer’s partner was so concerned by him she called the police. But Bauer had already left the home and got into Mr Pearson’s taxi, which he had booked. As Mr Pearson drove along the Felling Bypass in Gateshead, he noticed Bauer was slipping down in his seat, the court heard. Location: Bauer told taxi driver David Pearson he was going to a fancy dress party before attacking him as he drove along the Felling Bypass (above, file picture) in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear . And then as he slowed to approach a set of lights the driver suddenly heard a ‘rustling’ sound and felt a sharp object get pushed against his neck. ‘He immediately pulled away and grabbed the defendant’s arm,’ said Mr Bunch. ‘He said his heart was pounding and he was petrified.’ Mr Pearson jumped out and called the police. Bauer was arrested soon after and pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing an offensive weapon at Gateshead Magistrates Court the following day. He was remanded in custody and the case was sent to crown court for sentencing. Joe Hedworth, defending, said: ‘This a man who has never ever been to prison. He’s asked me to convey publicly his sincere apologies. ‘Since that night he has attempted to recall the events of that night but failed.’ Judge Milford sentenced him to eight months for each offence to run consecutively. The court heard Bauer took the name of Kiefer Sutherland’s counter-terrorism agent character in the TV series because he wanted to make a fresh start after a family bereavement.","Baeur, 26, changed his name from Carl Ennis to that of TV drama's star .

"Death: Helric Fredou is said to have been depressed when he shot himself with his police-issue weapon . A French police commissioner has reportedly taken his own life after meeting the relatives of a victim murdered in the Charlie Hebdo massacre. Helric Fredou, 45, shot himself in his office with his police-issue gun on Wednesday night in Limoges, a city in central France, according to France 3. Commissioner Fredou began his career as a police office in 1997 and had been the deputy director of the regional police since 2012. Colleagues told France 3 he was 'depressed' and overworked, and said he was single and had no children. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people dead at the Charlie Hebdo offices on Wednesday before seeking refuge in a print works. They were killed on Friday afternoon during a shoot-out with police, as was their alleged accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket in Paris. France's national police union has expressed its 'sincere condolences' over Commissioner Fredou's death and said they were thinking especially of his colleagues. A statement the morning after the death read: 'It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges. 'On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are new both hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own. 'The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric. Scroll down for video . Colleagues told France 3 that Commissioner Fredou was 'depressed' and overworked and said that he was single and had no children.

Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and  Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . 'In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues and classmates, many of which we expressed their emotion and grief. 'We will keep you informed of how his funeral will be organized and the initiatives we take to honor his memory and support his family.' In the days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, which left police officer Ahmed Merabet dead, the union said it was in a 'war' with religious fanatics and would do everything in its power to defeat them. A statement added: 'We are proud of the courage of our colleagues and comrades, who facing seasoned and heavily-armed fanatics have tried at all costs to protect and assist our citizens at risk. '[Armed officers] managed, with exceptional courage and self-sacrifice, to enable the release of hostages despite abominable complexity.' Surviving Charlie Hebdo staff have revealed this week's edition - to be published on Wednesday with a circulation of 1million, up from the usual 60,000 - will contain pictures of Mohammed . The surviving members of the magazine's staff decided to print images of the holy figure in defiance of Muslim extremists who slaughtered their colleagues. The cover will be unveiled tonight. Mourning: Volunteers pray as they prepare for the burial of four of the Jewish victims in the city . Tribute: A stream of flowers and candles has built up outside the doors of the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris . The satirical magazine, its offices still adorned with tributes, will release a million copies on Wednesday . Lawyer Richard Malka said this week's issue will 'of course' contain images of the Prophet. Mr Malka told France Info radio: 'We will not give in. The spirit of 'Je suis Charlie' means the right to blaspheme. He added: 'We will not give in otherwise all this won't have meant anything. A Je Suis Charlie banner means you have the right to criticise my religion, because it's not serious. 'We have never criticised a Jew because he's a Jew, a Muslim because he's a Muslim or a Christian because he's a Christian. 'But you can say anything you like, the worst horrors – and we do – about Christianity, Judaism and Islam, because behind the nice slogans, that's the reality of Charlie Hebdo.' Demonstrators showing solidarity with the Charlie Hebdo victims have also held banners declaring Je Suis Ahmed - in honour of the Muslim police officer Ahmed Merabet, who the Kouachi brothers mercilessly gunned down last Wednesday. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people dead at the Charlie Hebdo offices on Wednesday before seeking refuge in a print works . Footage of the officer lying injured on a pavement and raising his arms in defence, before one of the gunmen shot him dead at close range, caused horror and outrage around the world. During an emotional news conference on Saturday Mr Merabet's brother Malik broke down when asked about graphic images. 'He was committed,' he said. 'He looked after his mother and his close family. He was a pillar of the family. He was a very protective father, a lovely brother, a loving companion. 'I am addressing myself to all racists - the Islamophobes and the anti-Semites: You must not mix up extremism with Muslims. 'The madmen have no colour nor religion. Stop ... having wars or burning mosques or burning synagogues because you are attacking people.'

"Pope Francis has slammed 'deviant forms of religion' following the deadly attacks by Islamist militants in France last week which left 17 people dead. 'Losing their freedom, people become enslaved, whether to the latest fads, or to power, money, or even deviant forms of religion,' he said, laying the blame on 'a culture of rejection' which leads to 'the breakdown of society and spawning violence and death.' 'We see painful evidence of this in the events reported daily in the news, not least the tragic slayings which took place in Paris a few days ago,' he said in his yearly speech to the members of the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis slammed 'deviant forms of religion' following deadly attacks by Islamist militants in France last week which left 17 people dead . 'Religious fundamentalism, even before it eliminates human beings by perpetrating horrendous killings, eliminates God himself, turning him into a mere ideological pretext,' he said. Francis also denounced the 'abominable' kidnapping and enslavement of young girls by Boko Haram militants in Nigeria and the slaughter of 'unspeakable brutality' of more than 100 children by the Taliban in Pakistan. Referring specifically to the U.S., Francis welcomed the planned closure of the Guantanamo prison and the recent U.S.-Cuba rapprochement that he helped to facilitate. He called for a change in attitude toward accepting refugees, noting the many unaccompanied Latin American children migrating to the U.S. are 'are all the more at risk and in need of greater care, attention and protection.' He said he hoped 2015 would bring progress toward a new climate change agreement, saying in a brief deviation from his text that it was 'urgent.' His comments came as France deployed 15,000 police and security forces to bolster security around 'sensitive' sites and Jewish schools in the country, in the wake of the killings. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said 10,000 soldiers will be called up from Tuesday to protect 'sensitive sites in the whole country from tomorrow (Tuesday) evening', given the 'scale of threats' on France. The troop deployment would come on top of 5,000 police and security forces already mobilised Monday to protect some 717 schools and Jewish sites in the country. Le Drian unveiled the fresh measures after an emergency meeting called by President Francois Hollande as attention turned to preventing a repeat of France's bloodiest attacks in half a century.

'This is the first time that our troops have been mobilised to such an extent on our own soil,' the defence minister said, adding that he would prefer not to list the sites which are deemed sensitive. Le Drian said the mobilisation is going on 'thanks to a high level of reactivity of our forces and the professionalism' showed by the team. Authorities are still hunting for possible accomplices of the three gunmen who carried out the three-day killing spree that began with a massacre of 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical weekly.

"A new petrol price war erupted yesterday on the back of falling oil prices and the first 99p per litre forecourt in Britain for more than five years. Asda sparked a 2p per litre price cut as the three other ‘Big Four’ supermarkets - Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco – swiftly followed suit. Price cuts will ‘ripple’ through the nation’s forecourts by putting pressure on other retailers to match them or lose business. But it also led to calls for the Chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years. Pumps at the Harvest Energy's forecourt in Kings Heath, Birmingham run empty of unleaded fuel after the service station reduced the price of unleaded petrol to 99.7p a litre . The price drop prompted Asda to cut prices by 2p per litre and Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco quickly followed suit . The Tesco cut took affect yesterday while reductions by the other three companies will kick in today. For Asda customers, the latest reduction means they will pay no more than 103.7p a litre on petrol, with diesel at 110.7p a litre. The reductions have come after a chain of three Harvest Energy filling stations in Birmingham and the west Midlands cut the price of petrol to 99.7p a litre. The RAC has been forecasting for weeks that petrol prices would dip below the £1-a-litre mark and welcomed the news of the Birmingham service station price cut. As average prices continue to fall closer to the £1 mark, the RAC said the 99p charge could soon become the rule rather than the exception. Fuel price trackers Experian Catalist said the average price before the supermarkets announced their cuts was 108.9p per litre for unleaded and 115.98 for diesel. Ironically however, as the price of the fuel product itself falls, the proportion of the pump price which is tax going to the Chancellor has increased - and represents now more than 70 per cent of the price of unleaded petrol now goes to the chancellor in tax. This is because duty is levied at a fixed rate of 57.95p and does not fall in line with the falling cost of the product. VAT is then levied on the total price including duty, accounting for around 18p per litre. So even though the price is dropping, the Chancellor’s tax take remains largely unaffected other than a drop in VAT. Asda said the 2p price reduction across its 245 filling stations was the fifteenth fuel cut since end of September, taking a total of 23p per litre off unleaded and 19p per litre off diesel, Asda’s senior vice president Barry Williams said: ‘Asda once again are leading this next round of price cuts. Harvest Energy petrol station's owner smiles after his unleaded petrol has run dry due to price cuts. The RAC said the 99p charge could soon become the rule rather than the exception . ‘No matter where customers live, they will benefit from the same fuel price with our national price cap of 103.7ppl for unleaded and 110.7ppl for diesel.’ He said: ‘Whilst other supermarkets will follow the fuel price drop, Asda is the only retailer that has a national price cap on fuel at all 245 filling stations.’ RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ‘The decision of three forecourts in the West Midlands to sell petrol for under £1 a litre – last seen in 2009 – is clearly having a ripple effect on the supermarkets as they are continuing to bring their prices lower still.’ He said that with a barrel of oil now costing around $47 ‘we are surely only weeks away from the milestone price of £1 a litre being a common sight at petrol stations up and down the country’. ‘This will also have a very positive effect on reducing the average price of both petrol and diesel for motorists everywhere.’ But he added:’We are now getting to a point where the share that the Treasury takes from the forecourt price is nearing 75per cent which is a bitter pill for motorists and retailers. We should perhaps be seeking a commitment from all the major political parties that they will not look to increase fuel duty in the next parliament.’ But price cuts also led to calls for the Chancellor to cut fuel tax which now accounts for more than 70p in every pound spent at the pumps – the highest proportion for six years . Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, agreed: ‘An astonishing 70p in every pound we spend at the pumps is now destined for government. ‘Because fuel duty is set at a flat rate and makes up the bulk of fuel taxation, the Chancellor is able to rely on his tax income from fuel remaining quite steady even as the underlying price of petrol and diesel falls. ‘Last week the Chancellor again publicly urged fuel companies to pass on oil price reductions to motorists. Clearly he thinks the price of fuel is still too high. Well he has an easy solution. Cut duty further.’ Professor Glaister estimates that UK drivers collectively are £330million better off each month compared with last summer because of price reductions at the pumps: ‘Yet they could be better off still, and have more money to spend on the high street, if the Chancellor revised downwards the huge proportion of tax he takes from motorists and hauliers.’ AA president Edmund King said: ‘There remains a postcode lottery out there when it comes to fuel prices. Drivers in rural areas are still paying much more than the £1.09 average price and in some places £1.18. ‘It will still take some time to get down to an average of £1 per litre, particularly as 70per cent of the pump price is tax (57.95p duty and 18.3p VAT).","Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco followed Asda's price cut .

"Transgender teen Leelah Alcorn's distraught best friend didn't attend was her funeral after a furious phonecall from the girl's Christian parents following her death, DailyMail.com can reveal. Abby Jones supported Leelah through her struggles and was one of the first people she came out to as trans - but has been unable to pay her last respects after her mother reportedly accused Abby over the phone of sharing pictures of Leelah wearing a dress online. The photograph, a selfie showing Leelah, 17, in a black and white dress, was shared worldwide alongside a note explaining her suicide, which she lined up to be published after her death on December 27. Scroll down for video . Best friends: Abby Jones, left, met Leelah Alcorn, right, while the two worked as caricature artists at an amusement park. Leelah confided in her about her struggle with her gender identity . Accusation: The parents of Leelah Alcorn, pictured, the transgender teen who killed herself last month, accused her best friend of posting her writings - and this picture of her in a dress - online . It was a public rejection of her identity as 'Joshua' - her given name, which Carla and Don Alcorn continue to use when speaking about their 'son'. The image helped propel her to international fame as her story was shared - culminating Sunday night in Leelah having a Golden Globe dedicated to her memory by the cast of Transparent - a TV series which helped bring trans issues to the mainstream. As a result of the accusations Abby, also 17, was left out of arrangements for Leelah's funeral, according to her parents. The ceremony was moved to an undisclosed location at the last minute. Leelah was meant to be buried at the Northeast Church of Christ in Cincinnati, but trans activists who wanted to pay their respects to Leelah found a note on the door saying it had been moved to a small, private service. The family held the ceremony on the morning of Friday January 2 - and Abby had no idea until after it had finished, leaving her with no formal way to say goodbye to her friend. A minister at the church later explained that 'threats' forced the move - though he wouldn't say what they were. Abby's mother, Danielle Pieper-Jones, told DailyMail.com: 'Her mom called and blamed her for everything that got posted online even though Leelah's page was public. Phonecall: Abby Jones's mother told DailyMail.com that her daughter received a furious phonecall from Leelah's mom Carla, right, after her suicide became public. Pictured left is her father, Don . Struggle: Leelah wrote how her parents reacted 'extremely negatively' when she came out . 'My daughter just wanted to say goodbye to her best friend. They did not allow her to go to the funeral.' ‘It was obvious after the call - Carla had no right to call and harass my daughter.' Abby's father, Brian, said his daughter was distraught over the snub. He said: 'Leelah was her friend – and I was upset because I felt that [the funeral] was a way for her to at least start to move on.’ 'Abby wanted to go to the funeral – but it happened in private and there was no mention of it beforehand.' He suggested the family may neglected to invite Abby because they were so caught up in the media scrutiny of Leelah's death and note - which unequivocally blamed them for the suicide. He said: 'They were embarrassed – which anybody would be. They lost their child – I can’t imagine how much that hurts. I understand that – they wanted to get it done and move on with their lives.' Shared with the world: Leelah's parents though that Abby was behind her 'suicide note' post on Tumblr, above, which caught the attention of people around the world . Appreciation: Leelah's message - and her selfie - reaches an enormous audience, prompting supporters to create artworks such as the above. Her parents were furious when the images were shared . Dedication: The cast of Transparent - which won a Golden Globe for best TV series - dedicated the award to Leelah . In the note, posted to Leelah's Tumblr account before her death, she said that her life 'isn't worth living... because I'm transgender'. Leelah then recounts how her mother reacted 'extremely negatively' when first told her daughter was transgender. She remembered being told: 'that it was a phase, that I would never truly be a girl, that God doesn’t make mistakes, that I am wrong.' She then begged other parents never to do the same thing. She wrote: 'Even if you are Christian or are against transgender people don’t ever say that to someone, especially your kid. 'That won’t do anything but make them hate them self [sic]. That’s exactly what it did to me.' The note, and all Leelah's other posts, have now been deleted after her parents told Tumblr staff to take them down. Leelah also wrote a second post, which mentioned Abby by name. She said: 'Abby: Thank you for dealing with my pathetic problems, all I did was make your life harder and I’m sorry.' To her parents, she wrote: 'Mom and Dad: F**k you. You can’t just control other people like that. That’s messed up.' Abby and Leelah, who live 20 miles apart met at work, where they were both caricaturists at the Kings Island amusement park outside Leelah's hometown of Kings Mill, Ohio. They would spend time together after work - and eventually Abby got so close to Leelah that she revealed to her she was transgender and had always wanted to live as a girl, Cincinnati.com reported. Around the world: Leelah's suicide note was read by thousands - and the teenager's plea to spread understanding was taken up by celebrities such as Mia Farrow . Famous backers: British comedian Stephen Fry, who often champions LGBT issues, also wrote about Leelah . She said her friend, who was taken to Christian therapists in an effort to convince her to live as a male, was often upset about her life. Abby said: 'She would get really down, there was just no talking her out of it. 'She always said, ""Nothing is going to get better, I am never going to transition successfully, I am never going to be the pretty girl I want to be.""' But the suicide still came as a shock to her. In another interview, with the Washington Post, she said that on Christmas day she spoke with Leelah, who seemed upbeat and was looking forward to the year ahead. Abby said: 'She was talking about her New Year’s resolutions... It was a really light-hearted conversation. And then on Sunday, when I heard what happened, I was just in shock.' But she has since taken heart at the huge outpouring of sympathy and support for Leelah, expressed through online petitions, celebrity support and vigils across the world. Brian Jones said: 'We live in a very conservative part of the country. But all of this wonderful stuff has happened because of [Leelah's death] - and word has got out to a much larger audience than I thought possible.' 'But I still want to ask her family: 'Will there at least be a marker for Leelah so Abby can go there and pay her respects?""' Brian and Carla Alcorn could not be reached for comment.

"The Ohio State Buckeyes made college football history on Monday as they stormed to National Championship victory  over Oregon in the first College Football Playoff Championship - but in the adrenaline-pumped excitement managed to trample one of their own cheerleaders as they ran onto the field. A cheerleader, who was enthusiastically shaking her pom-poms, ended up face-down on the field as she tried to scramble out the way of the rushing players. The young woman had been carrying the 'O' flag to complete the waving banner for Ohio which also ended up being trampled into the field at Cowboy Stadium in Arlington, Texas. As she struggled to escape, one player then tripped over her, almost causing a domino-effect among the rushing team. The cheerleader was rescued by a teammate and was reportedly fine following the incident, watching the game from the sidelines. Some 80,000 screaming fans turned out to the stadium to watch the tense game which saw Ohio crush the University of Oregon with a 42-20 win - a surprising victory for the underdog team which sparked wild celebrations in Columbus with around 40 small fires lit in the streets and police forced to use pepper-spray on some of the thousands of revelers. Scroll down for video . Pushover: An Ohio State cheerleader was trampled by players from the team as they run onto the field ahead of the National Championships on Monday night in Arlington, Texas . Obstacle: As she hit the floor at Cowboy Stadium, the cheerleader immediately tried to get up (still clutching her pom-poms). However one of the players then tripped over her, causing a near disaster . Escape: In the end, one of her male teammates came to her rescue and pushed her away from the path of the team's tunnel. The young woman was reportedly fine following the incident and watched the game from the sidelines . The two teams were playing the first College Football Playoff championship in Arlington - and among those in the stands was basketball superstar (and Ohio State fan), LeBron James, who tweeted: 'On this bird celebrating a great night for OHIO!! THE Ohio State Buckeyes are National Champions!! #OH.' Ohio blew away the Ducks, beating them 42-20 with third-choice quarterback Cardale Jones. Oregon had been considered the favorite in part due to their star quarterback Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy this season. Ohio State made it to the championship despite losing two talented quarterbacks to injuries this season and went into the game being very much seen as the underdogs. Ezekiel Elliott ran for 246 yards and four touchdowns for Ohio State, who become the first university to claim a national football title via a knock-out playoff competition. The national collegiate title has long been a coveted commodity in a sport that sparks pride and passions across the United States often greater than those produced by professional teams. But the one thing lacking from the spectacle has been the kind of playoffs so beloved of US sports enthusiasts -- head-to-head competitions that let fans point to the last team standing as true and deserving champions. Instead, for decades, rankings or polls determined the national collegiate football champion. For the last 16 years, the Bowl Championship Series system pitted two top teams in a title game based on a combination of human polls and computer rankings. Confetti was sprayed onto the field as the Ohio Buckeyes celebrate being crowned national champions. They went into the game as underdogs . This season, a selection committee of 13 chose and seeded four teams to play in semi-final games. The University of Oregon steamrolled defending national champions Florida State 59-20 in the Rose Bowl, which served as one playoff semi-final. Ohio State rallied to beat top-ranked Alabama 42-35 in the Sugar Bowl - which was the other semi-final game. And on Monday, Ohio State powered past the Ducks in front of 85,689 fans at AT&T Stadium, the billion-dollar home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys. Oregon boasted quarterback Marcus Mariota, winner of the coveted Heisman Trophy as the country's top collegiate player. But it was the Buckeyes' second-year running back Elliott who starred, putting the game away with three touchdown runs in the second half. Ohio State defender Eli Apple punctuated the victory by intercepting a Mariota pass on the final play of the game. The victory capped an improbable championship run for Ohio State, who lost star quarterback Braxton Miller before the season. Backup J.T. Barrett kept the ship on course, but broke his ankle in November, leaving third-string quarterback Cardale Jones to lead the Buckeyes to the Big Ten conference title and their Sugar Bowl victory. Mariota threw two touchdown passes, including a seven-yard strike to Keanon Lowe on their opening drive. Mariota connected with Byron Marshall on a 70-yard catch and run for a touchdown in the third that cut Ohio State's lead to 21-17 in the third.

Even before Monday's game the new playoff format had been widely hailed as a success. The two semi-final games produced high-scoring, entertaining contests that drew more than 28 million television viewers apiece, sparking talk of expanding the playoffs from four to eight teams. Following the surprise win, chaotic celebrations broke out in Columbus, Ohio as hundreds of fans gathered in the downtown streets with police struggling to keep order in a city gripped by football fever. Police and SWAT teams dressed in full-camouflage gear and Kevlar helmets used tear gas to disperse the crowds after earlier urging fans to show they 'have class'. Thousands of fans cheering and blowing car horns converged on Ohio State University's stadium shortly after the win, only to be turned away by police. That forced them back to an area of bars around the campus where most of the trouble took place, with between 30 and 40 fires lit in trash cans and dumpsters. One image taken from social networks showed a man pouring fuel on to a sofa which sat burning in the middle of the road. Social media users posted images from the streets of SWAT teams marshaling crowds, and fires burning in the middle of intersections while patrol cars pushed through massed fans.

"Comedian Margaret Cho's North Korea-mocking Golden Globes bit immediately earned her scorn from outraged viewers who called it cartoonish and racist. Now the Korean-American funnygal, whose goose-stepping General Cho Young Ja character managed to stir more controversy than Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's Bill Cosby jokes, has hit back at her detractors. 'I'm of mixed North/South Korean descent - you imprison, starve and brainwash my people you get made fun of by me #hatersgonhate #FreeSpeech,' Cho tweeted Monday morning. Scroll down for video . Racist? Korean-American actress and comedian Margaret Cho was called out on Twitter following a Sony-hack inspired bit in which she played a cartoonish North Korean general at the Golden Globes . No regrets: Cho hit back at the accusations Monday morning on Twitter, where she refused to apologize . 'Rice card': More than just unapologetic, cho responded to criticism with another joke that some might see as racially insensitive . For those who missed the controversial comedy bits, they began at the top of the show when Fey and Poehler introduced the general. ‘The Hollywood Foreign Association comprises journalists from all around the globe and we would like to now introduce you to our newest HFPA member. A contributor to Movies Wow magazine and a North Korean army general; Cho Yung Ja. Welcome.’ Movies Wow, it turned out, featured none other than supreme leader and the alleged vengeful mind behind the recent Sony email hacks--Kim Jong-un. As Cho Yung Ja, Ms Cho demanded a photo opportunity with Streep, who gamely stood with the faux soldier and smiled for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton. From behind, actor Benedict Cumberbatch leapt up for a photobomb. Too cartoonish? Cho has long imitated her Korean immigrant mother, but some viewers were appalled by her act on Sunday night . Goose-stepped: Adding a bit of flare to her act, Cho goose-stepped off-stage following the second Cho Yung Ja bit . After the snap was taken, Fey said: ‘Thank you, crisis averted. God Bless.’ In a room full of movie stars - many affected by the embarrassing Sony hack - it all seemed like good fun. But then the Twitter reaction came hard and swift. 'I've always loved margaret cho but she needs to stop shuckin' for white folk,' wrote @LordeBarrington. @HoJoLego agreed: 'This is the worst Margaret Cho joke ever. #GoldenGlobes' As did @BougieBlackGurl: 'Margaret Cho that was freaking awful. Is she going to shuck and jive too? #GoldenGlobes #whenthechecksstopcoming.' The tweets kept coming. The Cho Yung Ja sketch did, too. Stoking controversy? As Cho Yung Ja, Ms. Cho demands a photo opportunity with Meryl Streep, who gamely stands with the faux soldier and smiles for a photo snapped by Michael Keaton . Good sport Meryl Streep poses with Cho as Cho Yung Ja while Benedict Cumberbatch photobombs in the background during the awards show . Later in the show, Cho appeared onstage in costume and shared her thoughts on the lesbian plot line between Orange Is The New Black characters Alex and Piper, calling their relationship 'very toxic'. She then proceeded to goose-step off stage. And as their final act in their final Golden Globe hosting gig together, Fey and Poehler even gave Cho the last words of the entire show. 'Show over. I host next year. Good night,' she said in character as Cho Yung Ja while credits rolled. On Thursday, Cho was quick to defend her jokes, which she insisted weren't racist. Margaret Cho had previously appeared in Tina Fey's creation 30 Rock as North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il and his son Kim Jong-Un in 2011 (Cho is pictured left with Fey and right, with Tracy Morgan) 'I'm not playing the race card,' she tweeted. 'I'm playing the rice card. #hatersgonwait #winnersgonpun' Cho appeared in 30 Rock in 2011, the NBC comedy series created by Tina Fey. The 46-year-old actress played North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il in one episode for which she received an Emmy nominaton for Outstanding Guest Actress. She later returned to the show to play Kim Jon-Il's son Kim Jong-un.","Cho refused to apologize Monday for the gag in which she donned military garb and a powdered face .

"Two 10-year-old girls with plaited hair blew themselves up in a market in Nigeria, killing four people. The suicide attack in Potiskum, in the north east of the country, is the latest in a string of deadly blasts that have rocked Nigeria. It took place yesterday afternoon at an open market in the town that has frequently been targeted by the militant Islamist Boko Haram group. A trader at the market, Sani Abdu, said: 'I saw their dead bodies. They were two young girls of about 10 years of age...you only see the plaited hair and part of the upper torso.' The suicide bomb attack killed four people and wounded at least 26 people, according to witnesses. Two female suicide bombers targeted the busy marketplace Potiskum, in the north east of Nigeria, yesterday . The deadly blast killed four people and injured dozens more, according to witnesses in Potiskum . The attack follows a similar incident on Saturday, where a bomb was strapped to a girl aged about 10, which left at least 19 people dead in the city of Maiduguri, in Borno state. 'The explosive devices were wrapped around her body,' a police source told Reuters. In other violence reported on Saturday, a vehicle in Yobe state (northern Nigeria) exploded at a checkpoint near a police station, killing at least two people. The blast follows heavy fighting in the Yobe state capital Damaturu on Friday night, with buildings destroyed and civilian casualties reported. Last week, hundreds of people were killed in an assault by Boko Haram on the town of Baga, after they seized a key military base there on January 3. Boko Haram fighters razed the town and at least 16 surrounding settlements on the shores of Lake Chad. Yahaya Takakumi, a 55-year-old farmer, told the Premium Times in Nigeria he escaped from Baga with one of his wives and spent four days traveling to safety through the bush, but does not know the whereabouts of four of his children, his second wife and his elder brother. 'We saw dead bodies especially, on the islands of Lake Chad where fishermen had settled,' the newspaper quoted Takakumi as saying. 'Several persons were killed there like insects.' Nigeria's defence spokesman Chris Olukolade said: 'The attack on the town by the bloodhounds and their activities since January 3 should convince well-meaning people all over the world that Boko Haram is the evil all must collaborate to end, rather than vilifying those working to check them.' More than 13,000 people have died in the Boko Haram insurgency in northeast Nigeria since 2009 and hundreds of thousands more have been made homeless. The group have been fighting to establish an Islamic caliphate in the north-eastern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. Boko Haram has killed up to 2,000 people in the northeast Nigerian town of Baga in the past few days - pictured is the leader of the Islamist extremist group Abubakar Shekau (centre) delivering a speech . Nigeria's military - west Africa's largest - has faced repeated criticism for failing to end the Islamist insurgency, as well as allegations of human rights abuses. Soldiers have complained of a lack of adequate weapons and even refused to deploy to take on the better-armed rebels. The UN children's fund said harrowing reports from survivors of the attack and the use of 10-year-old girls as human bombs 'should be searing the conscience of the world'. 'Words alone can neither express our outrage nor ease the agony of all those suffering from the constant violence in northern Nigeria,' UNICEF executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement. 'But these images of recent days and all they imply for the future of Nigeria should galvanise effective action. For this cannot go on.' The violence of Boko Haram began soon after 276 schoolgirls were abducted from the Borno town of Chibok in mid-April. Nine months on, 219 are still being held.","Suicide bomb attack took place in Potiskum, in the north east of Nigeria .

"It has long been thought that stress can hinder a woman’s chances of getting pregnant. But now science may have an answer to the problem. Researchers discovered that cutting levels of a recently discovered hormone called RFRP3 stopped stress from affecting pregnancy rates. The breakthrough offers hope of a drug that could switch off the effects of stress on the body. One in six couples today have trouble starting a family naturally so an effective treatment could have a huge impact. RFRP3 is produced in the brains of all mammals and has the effect of switching off the reproductive system before puberty. Scientists have found a hormone associated with stress, RFRP3, that affects the body's ability to get pregnant, even after life returns to normal . The hormone is thought to protect the body at times of stress – so it shuts down reproduction when it might be harmful for a woman to conceive. The team at the University of California, Berkeley, at first tested whether the hormone can also shut down reproduction later in life. They put female rats under psychological pressure for several hours a day for almost three weeks and then tried to mate them. The stressed-out creatures were less interested in mating and when they did get pregnant, they were more likely to miscarry than usual. As a result, their odds of giving birth plummeted to a quarter of the usual number. Importantly, the effects of stress continued to be felt long after the animals’ lives returned to normal. Those given four days’ recovery from stress – the equivalent of a month for a woman – had birth rates just as poor as creatures that were still highly stressed. Crucially, their levels of RFRP3 remained high. Researcher Daniela Kaufer said: ‘Our study shows that the dramatic decrease of reproductive functions lingers well beyond the end of stress and beyond the time when we see high levels of stress hormones in the blood. ‘This can explain the high incidence and long-lasting effects of stress on human infertility.’ Professor Kaufer then showed that reducing RFRP3 stopped stress from affecting fertility. Rats with low amounts of the hormone were just as likely to get pregnant as others, despite being stressed. The professor said: ‘That was extremely surprising. It was the best-case scenario you could imagine.’ The study’s lead author Anna Geraghty said: ‘A strikingly high proportion of healthy women struggle with fertility and our findings provide a new focus for the clinical study of human reproductive health.’ Hopes are rising that there may a drug to cut levels of RFRP3 and help stressed women more easily get pregnant . The technique used to lower levels of RFRP3 in the study may not be suitable for use in women. But scientists can now look for a drug that has the same effect. Professor Kaufer, who is also a yoga instructor, acknowledges that it may well be questioned whether a stress-busting drug is appropriate, when a change in lifestyle can aid relaxation. But she said: ‘It is not always as easy as that. ‘I can tell people to beat stress but it is not always feasible.’ Professor Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create Fertility clinic in London, agreed that stress can affect fertility. She said: ‘Most women are multi-tasking and modern life is stressful. ‘This is an interesting study. If the results can be reproduced in humans, it could have positive implications in addressing stress-related infertility.’ But Professor Charles Kingsland, of the Hewitt Fertility Centre at Liverpool Women’s Hospital, said that everyday stress has the potential to harm fertility only if worries become so overwhelming that a woman has trouble eating and sleep. The research was published in the journal eLife.","Hormone RFRP3 protects body during stress but prevents pregnancy .

"The new series of Broadchurch is providing millions of TV viewers with a weekly cliffhanger. But fans following in the footsteps of the stars are in danger of creating their own drama. Hundreds are flocking to the 80ft cliffs at West Bay in Dorset, where the ITV show is set, risking a fatal fall from the crumbling edge or creating a landslip that could kill anyone passing below. Despite signs warning sightseers to stay away, one group of three was photographed with legs dangling over the edge. Scroll down for video . The shocking photos, taken by a local, show people sat right on the edge of the 80ft cliffs in West Bay . Passers-by stopped to take pictures of the shocking scene which put both the people on the cliff and anyone standing under it at risk . The photograph of the three thrillseekers was taken after the first episode of the second series was screened last week. The photographer, who asked not to be named, said yesterday: ‘I was walking towards West Cliff when I saw the scariest sight. Perched right on the edge were three people taking photos. They were sat with their legs dangling over the edge for at least ten minutes. ‘At ground level, others were concerned about their reckless, shocking and irresponsible behaviour.’ Mark Collins, from West Bay Coastguard, said: 'Anyone going that close to the edge is risking themselves, anyone below them and us if we have to go and rescue them. 'I don't understand why people don't heed the warnings, there have been several accidents there. 'People tend to want to look over the side and they don't quite realise they are just stood on turf with nothing below. 'It's hard to say what effect the new series of Broadchurch will have. Local people know how unstable the cliffs are, it's visitors that don't understand the risks, but there are signs at every entrance to the cliff walk so people should see them.' Tourists standing at the edge of cliffs can dislodge rocks that could fall and injure people below . Ironically, the show’s TV crew were themselves criticised for taking ‘silly risks’ as they set up their cameras just yards from a cliff edge while filming the current series. One hotel booking website said interest in Broadchurch had already led to a 200 per cent increase in holiday searches for Dorset and Somerset, following the airing of the second season. Meanwhile, the show is also having an effect on property prices. The 100-year-old chalet in West Bay used in the series as the home of Detective Inspector Alec Hardy (Tennant) is for sale at £275,000. The price is an example of what local estate agent Malcolm Gill calls the ‘Broadchurch effect’, which added up to £50,000 to its value. The ITV drama, starring Olivia Coleman and David Tennant, has returned to screens for a second series . The West Bay and Bridport area experienced an increase in visitor numbers after the first series was aired in February 2013. Fans flocked to the area to view the now famous spots, including the cliffs where 11-year-old Danny Latimer was found dead at the start of the first series and the West Cliff chalet which was later revealed to be the murder scene. This influx of visitors is expected to start again after the second series started airing on ITV last Monday. Geologist Richard Edmonds, from Dorset County Council, said the main risk was to people on the beach below if rocks at the top are dislodged. In July 2012, 22-year-old holidaymaker Charlotte Blackman was killed by a rockfall at nearby Hive Beach at Burton Bradstock. Mr Edmonds said: 'People don't seem to think these continuous safety warnings apply to them but that is very much the case. 'The main thing to be concerned about is that they might dislodge rocks and hit people below on the beach. 'The top of the cliff is quite weathered and climbing around by the edge could cause rocks to tumble down and really hurt someone. 'We want people to enjoy themselves, it's just a matter of being sensible. 'They might think they are not going to fall but that's not the main risk. They should think about other people and not do anything stupid.' The mystery drama has a;ready prompted a tourism boom to both Dorset and Somerset, where it is shot .","Photos show two people sat right on the edge of the perilous sandstone cliffs in West Bay .

"A former Vietnam-era Army helicopter that was given to a police department for free has ended up costing the force more than $2million, it has emerged. The 42-year-old Bell Kiowa chopper was one of two hand-me-downs taken by the Newark Police Department to help track carjackers and fugitives. One was to be flown and the other used for spare parts. But public records have emerged that show the cash-strapped force has spent more than $2million on refurbishing, maintaining and operating the aircraft. The revelations are likely to anger many in the city after then-Mayor Cory Booker was forced to sack 167 police officers in 2010 over mounting budget problems. This Vietnam-era Bell Kiowa helicopter has ended up costing Newark Police Department more than $2million to refurbish, maintain and operate since it was handed to the force for free from the U.S. Army . Documents obtained by NJ Advance Media show maintenance contracts alone approved by the Newark City Council have totalled $1.13million in the past five years. This included a $27,412 invoice to strip, apply corrosion coating and paint the aircraft, plus new rotor blades cost that $143,386. Other costs include annual storage and hangar fees of $3,600 and insurance premiums of $30,000 a year. Then there was is $961,000 that has been spent on pilot salaries, it was reported by NJ.com. Anthony Ambrose, the then chief of police and the city's acting police director, defended the decision to acquire the helicopters, saying it was effective in tackling crime. He said: 'A helicopter can reduce the crime rate by 7 to 14 per cent. The downside is the cost. 'But if we only stopped carjackings, we would be getting our money's worth.' Documents show the initial aircraft - given the call sign Able-1 - was delivered to the city in 2005 from the U.S. Army base at Ft Drum, NY. The figures will also raise new questions about the hidden costs of the controversial U.S. Department of Defense program which came under fire last year after police in Ferguson, Missouri (above), responded to demonstrators with armored combat vehicles and tactical armor over the shooting of a black teenager . A second one, to be stripped for spare parts, was received in 2007. Able-1 was grounded in 2010 due to budget cuts, but reintroduced a year later after a sharp rise in crime. A spokesman for Newark police did not respond to questions about the helicopter or its total cost to the city. NJ.com notes that the figures will also raise new questions about the hidden costs of the controversial U.S. Department of Defense program has provided billions in surplus military gear to police forces across the country. The program was criticised last year after police in Ferguson, Missouri, responded to demonstrators with armored combat vehicles and tactical armor following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer.","Vietnam-era Bell Kiowa chopper taken by Newark police in bid to cut crime .

"Donald Trump, no stranger to noisy publicity, is complaining again about the roar of jets in a $100 million lawsuit over air traffic he says is purposely being directed to fly over his ritzy Palm Beach club. Trump filed the suit against Palm Beach County last week, claiming his history of conflict with Palm Beach International Airport has led officials to spitefully redirect air traffic over his historic Mar-a-Lago estate in south Florida. 'I am saving one of the great houses of this country and one of its greatest landmarks,' he said in an interview Monday, 'and it's being badly damaged by the airplanes.' They're doing it on purpose! Donald Trump has filed a $100million lawsuit against Palm Beach County, claiming air traffic controllers are spitefully directing air traffic over his Florida estate mar-a-Lago. Picted above at the ritzy club with wife Melania (in white, right) on January 4 for the Trump Invitational Grand Prix . The above map shows Mar-a-Lago's location in comparison to the nearby Palm Beach Airport . Rather than fanning air traffic in multiple directions, Trump says the county's airports director — who has been named in prior litigation filed by the real estate mogul — has successfully pressured the Federal Aviation Administration to have controllers direct almost all flights due east, directly above Mar-a-Lago, the lawsuit claims. It calls the actions 'deliberate and malicious.' Noise, vibrations and emissions from the planes are causing cracks and other damage to porous stone construction, antique Spanish tiles, roofing, floors and columns, not to mention disrupting 'the once serene and tranquil ambience,' the lawsuit says. Trump says even his own Boeing 757 — emblazoned with his surname in gold — has been forced to take a flight path over Mar-a-Lago, where he has a home. 'It's doing tremendous damage to the No. 1 landmark in the state of Florida, between the vibration, the soot, the noise, all of these elements,' Trump said. Historic: Mar-a-Lago was built in 1927 for cereal tycoon Marjorie Merriweather Post. Trump purchased the estate in 1985 and turned it into a private club for the Palm Beach elite . The County Attorney's Office said it hadn't been served with the lawsuit and had no comment. A 1995 lawsuit by Trump over airport noise ended with the county agreeing to lease Trump the land where he later built Trump International Golf Club. A 2010 lawsuit by Trump over airport noise was dismissed. The Mediterranean-style Mar-a-Lago, completed in 1927 for cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, is a National Historic Landmark. Trump bought it in 1985 and after extensive restoration, opened it 10 years later as a private club. About 450 of the island's elite are members. 'There's no place in the world like it — it's one of the great places in the world,' Trump said. 'And I have to protect it. I have to protect it.'","Trumps says bad blood he has with Palm Beach County has led officials to make air traffic controllers redirect the traffic over his club .

"Mr Burnham said the proposal was 'the start of the road' for improving public health . The Labour Party will this week issue a stark warning that the public can no longer expect the NHS to ‘do everything’ and people will have to take better care of themselves. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will announce plans on Thursday to get half the country active by 2025 - claiming it is the 'key' to improving public health. Mr Burnham told MailOnline: ‘In a century of rising demand, rising cost of health, it is the most cost-effective way we can give people the keys to their own health. 'People will have to take more responsibility for their own health.’ He added: ‘The NHS won’t be able to do everything. It’s maybe a message that people haven’t heard from Labour always. ‘There’s sometimes a sense that we can just do everything top-down to improve people’s health – well that’s clearly not the case in the 21st Century. ‘We have to send out a tougher message to people about saying, look, if we are all going to live to our 90s we have to take care of ourselves, if we are going to get the most out of life as we get older. ‘We have to be honest and say the NHS won’t be able to do everything.' Mr Burnham is preparing to unveil a host of measures to improve public health - including better food labelling and legal limits on the amount of sugar in what children eat and drink. He said: ‘Think about mandatory food labelling – there has been too long a debate about this. We just need to get on with this. You need a chemistry degree to read a cereal packet. This can’t come a moment too soon.’ It comes after Mr Burnham last night revealed plans to ban super-sized bottles of cheap cider in a bid to tackle teenage drinking. The shadow health secretary  wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles. Mr Burnham told MailOnline products like Frosty Jacks, White Ace and White Strike were fuelling under-age binge drinking and alcohol addiction and needed to be tackled. The Labour frontbencher said the high-strength ciders were cheaper than they used to be – meaning children could 'cobble together' enough money to get drunk all nights of the week. He said children as young as '11 or 12' were regularly boozing after school in a way their parents' generation would not have been able to afford. Mr Burnham told MailOnline that rising demand for health services - as witnessed in the current A&E crisis - meant the most cost-effective way of keeping health costs under control was to get people active . Many ciders available at pocket money prices have an alcohol content of 7.5 per cent – well above the strength of mainstream cider products – costing as little as 20p a unit. He said the cost and strength of cider made it 'very attractive to under-age drinkers, and it is also a major drink of choice for addicts and street drinkers'. Mr Burnham said: 'These cider products are particularly used by children because of their low price and high strength. 'We've worked it out at 20p a unit. We're talking about which can be up to 7.5 per cent in strength but are retailing at £1.99 or less – and this is a two or three litre bottle. 'Young people can cobble together the money to get hold of them. 'What we are trying to signal [is that] coming in with a sledgehammer approach and just hitting everybody – that just loses people. They think why is everyone being punished – what's fair about that?' He added that the proposal was 'the start of the road'. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham wants to outlaw 'high-strength, ultra-low-priced white ciders' sold in three litre bottles . But Mr Burnham all-but admitted he had gone boozing with his friends as a teenager. The former health secretary said: 'I think we all grow up, don't we, and we learn as we go. 'I wasn't whiter than white in that respect. I did normal things that teenagers in the North West do.' Mr Burnham pointed to a survey of white cider drinkers by Alcohol Concern which found 50 per cent saying they drank more than three litres a day, and 42 per cent saying they had been drinking it for more than ten years. The shadow health minister is considering banning the sale of cider in bottles of more than one litre in size, or by taxing larger volume cider containers more heavily. The party is also looking at proposals to create a new cheap cider tax to increase the cost of cheap booze. A proposal to increase the minimum apple juice content that cider is required to contain will also be considered. This would increase the cost of producing white cider – forcing up the price in the supermarket. Labour said the ballooning cost of treating alcohol related illnesses meant tackling problem drinking was essential. The harmful use of alcohol costs the NHS in England around £3.5 billion a year and alcohol-related crime costs £11bn per year, the party said. One in five children who drink now consume 15 or more units per week – twice an adult woman's weekly recommended limit. Binge drinkers by 15 are four times more likely to be addicted in later life, and almost half of young people excluded from school in the UK are regular drinkers.","EXCLUSIVE: Labour warn public to take better care of their own health .

Despite the plethora of weird and wonderful gadgets from the world’s best startups, the most talked about brand of CES was Samsung. It featured in significantly more tweets than any other brand, including Panasonic and Intel. The most talked about trend of this year’s show was 4K TVs . Hotwire’s Insights and Analytics team analysed tweets posted using the hashtag #CES015. Its findings revealed that one in three tweets mentioned Samsung. And with 18,643 tweets in total, this was more than double the number of the second most talked-about brand, Panasonic. Samsung announced a washing machine with a sink on the top called ActiveWash, a range of 4K and HD TVs that will run the Tizen operating system, and demonstrated its virtual reality headset at the show. By comparison, Panasonic unveiled a concept in-flight entertainment system that features a seatback system that automatically recognises passengers as they board the aircraft. 1. Samsung - 18,643 tweets . 2. Panasonic - 8,312 tweets . 3. Intel - 7,444 tweets . 4. IGN - 6,875 tweets . 5. Audi - 3,966 tweets . 6. Android - 3,757 tweets . 7. LG - 3,758 tweets . 8.

Panasonic also unveiled a range of 4K TVs. 4K, also known as 4K ultra HD TV, is the next stage in television picture quality. A 4K ultra HD TV picture is 3,840 x 2,160 pixels, more than 8 million pixels in total, which is four times the number in 'normal' high-definition (1,920 x 1,080). Intel unveiled a host of products, including a tiny wearable computer, called Curie, that is the size of a small button. It also demonstrated the reversible Type-C USB cable on its stand, as well as dancing, spider-like robots called Hexapods that run on Intel processors. And this saw a total of 7,444 tweets being posted mentioning the Californian tech giant. In the battle of the car makers, Audi beat BMW with 3,966 mentions compared to 1,083 respectively. Hotwire’s Insights and Analytics team analysed tweets posted using the hashtag #CES015. It revealed that one in three tweets mentioned Samsung (its new range of household appliances pictured), and with 18,643 tweets in total, this was more than double the number of the second most talked-about brand, Panasonic . Samsung announced a washing machine with a sink on the top called ActiveWash, a range of 4K and HD TVs that will run the Tizen operating system, and demonstrated its virtual reality headset during the show . During the show, Audi announced that it had sent its self-driving A7, called Jack, on a 550-mile (885km) journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas. The firm also teased its first smartwatch. Audi board member Dr Ulrich Hackenberg used the watch to summon a self-driving car to the stage using an LG smartwatch. The watch is said to have been built in partnership with LG and runs a version of Android Wear. The German auto giant calls its self-driving technology Piloted Driving, and insisted the sensors and equipment demonstrated in the vehicle are ‘production ready’. In terms of trends, 4K TVs took the top spot with 15,912 tweets. This was ahead of wearables on 3,998 mentions. Sony's new KD-65X9000C 4K TV, announced at the show, will run Google's Android TV software and is just 0.2-inch thick. The firm boasted the TV set is slimmer than its smartphone . Werables at this year's CES ranged from smart dog collars (pictured left), to cycling helmets, new fitness trackers from the likes of Garmin and InBody (right), and even a belt that shames you into losing weight . As a result, the company claims it is on course to put driverless cars into commercial production as soon as next year. BMW showed that its i3 electric car could find a parking space by itself and keep a driver from hitting obstacles. The German car maker also demonstrated an M4 with laser headlights. These lights project beams as far as 650 yards (1,950ft) in front of the car. LG also made the top 10 list - in seventh place - after it announced a range of household products, TVs, software and phones. 1. 4K TV - 15,912 tweets . 2. Wearables – 3,998 tweets . 3. IOT – 3,816 tweets . 4. Car – 2,552 tweets . 5. Health – 1,411 tweets . 6. Smart watch – 1,087 tweets . 7. 3D printing – 1,022 tweets . The LG Styler wardrobe, for example, is fitted with LG's Clothes Care System, designed to refresh clothes without water or detergents using its TrueSteam technology. This consists of hot steam spray technology, which LG uses in washers and dryers, and is said to get rid of 99.9 per cent of the germs and bacteria. And the South Korean firm also announced its next-generation curved phone, the LG G Flex 2, as well as expanded its 4K OLED TV range. In terms of trends, behind 4K TVs in the top spot was wearables with 3,998 mentions on Twitter. This ranged from dog collars, to smart cycling helmets, new fitness trackers from the likes of Garmin, and even a belt that shames you into losing weight. This was a separate trend to smartwatches, which was in sixth place with 1,087 tweets. The Internet of Things (IoT) was a popular trend during CES, and was mentioned 3,816 times during the week-long show in Las Vegas. In the battle of the car makers, Audi beat BMW with 3,966 mentions compared to 1,083 respectively. During the show, Audi announced that it had sent its self-driving A7, called Jack, on a 550-mile (885km) journey from San Francisco to Las Vegas .

These lights project beams as far as 650 yards (1,950ft) in front of the car . IOT is the idea of connecting everyday objects to the web, such as fridges, washing machines and coffee makers. LG also made the top 10 list - in seventh place - after it announced a host of products including the dual-washing machine (pictured) For example, the Wi-Fi Coffee Machine by Smarter announced at the show can be triggered, via a smartphone, to not only make you a hot drink tailored to your individual taste, it can have it ready for you before you even wake up. Once it has ground the beans and boiled the water to a precise temperature, it will send an alarm to the phone to rouse the user. During the show, Samsung’s chief executive Boo-Keun Yoon said that in five years, every single one of Samsung’s products will be an IoT device. Samsung then said the company’s new smart-home Hub will work even when it’s offline, and that it plans to invest $100 million in the development of IoT apps. The AllSeen Alliance additionally announced it had developed a protocol that will make connecting devices together safer and more secure. Chip maker Qualcomm has been working on a similar scheme, known as AllJoyn, that makes it easier to connect various web-enabled devices together on one network. Qualcomm and Microsoft are among the tech firms that are supporting the AllSeen Alliance. And following on from the Audi and BMW announcements, as well as demonstrations from Toyota, Renovo and Elio, the word ‘car’ was the fourth most talked-about trend of the show, with 2,552 tweets. Hotwire's Alex Maclaverty said: 'As brands, vendors, media and increasingly tech-savvy consumers head to Vegas for inspiration around the hottest gadgets for 2015, social media continues to be the best way to follow the event. 'We’re quite used to improvements in the television viewing experience, so, for me, the most exciting technologies are all about how the internet of things - particularly through wearables and the connected car - will revolutionise the way we run our lives.

"If you started the new year with all good intentions to lose weight, but are already flagging, let your smartphone shame you into shedding the pounds. Carrot Hunger is the latest in a line of 'sadistic' apps designed to motivate people to get fit and lose weight by being judged and 'shouted at'. The Hunger app lets users count their daily calorie intake, tells them how much exercise they'd need to do to burn it off, and can even tell people to step away from their fridge or cookie jar. Scroll down for videos . Carrot Hunger (pictured) is the latest in a line of 'sadistic' apps designed to motivate people to get fit and lose weight by being judged and 'shouted at'. The free Hunger version lets users count their daily calorie intake (pictured left), either by searching a database or scanning a barcode (right) Carrot Hunger is the follow-up to Carrot Fit, and both were created by Pennsylvania developer Brian Mueller. His range of apps is designed to 'threaten, intimidate and ridicule' users into losing weight. Users add food to their diary either by searching the database, or scanning the bar code. Scientists in Southampton recently developed a 'smart bra' that can measure the wearer’s mood. The bra is fitted with sensors which monitor heart and skin activity. Researchers claim that by monitoring emotions, the bra can help prevent over-eating and potentially aid weight loss. Not only does the bra warn the wearer when she might be prone to reaching for food, but it gives her tips to help resist the impulse. For each food item entered, the app converts the calories into easy-to-understand terms. For example, the calories in a slice of pizza translate into a 90-minute walk. The app also tells someone how many miles they would need to run to burn off certain foods. If a user eats too many calories, or starts putting on weight, their avatar 'blimps' up, and the user is 'punished' into getting back on track. For example, Carrot will show fullscreen adverts, or send tweets about their weight gain. And, when used with an iBeacon inside the fridge, for example, Carrot knows when their reaching for food. It then reminds users to log any food they've taken out of the fridge, or will sound a loud alarm if they're nearing their calorie limit.

Users input their weight on a daily basis, and receive judgement from the ‘Carrot overlord’, yet equally, if they lose weight, Carrot offers encouragement. As well as encouragement, people who lose weight will be given rewards such as workout tips and advice. According to the app's description: 'Carrot is a sadistic AI construct with one simple goal: to transform your flabby carcass into a Grade A specimen of the human race. 'She will do whatever it takes - including threatening, inspiring, ridiculing, and bribing you - to make this happen. You will lose weight - or else.' As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit monitors their BMI and updates them on their progress. All weight loss is tracked on a graph that can be shared with friends and at each weigh-in, Carrot will let the user know how much they've lost and the difference compared to the previous weigh-in. As a user tracks their weight, Carrot Fit also monitors their BMI and updates them on their progress.

If the user gains weight, the app turns red (pictured left) but if they lose weight, it turns green (right) Users can set goal weights, share their progress with friends and set reminder to weigh themselves. Mr Mueller said he didn’t create Carrot Fit to make people feel bad, instead he wanted to make 'weight loss entertaining and funny.' The Hunger app is free, but the Fit app costs £2.49 in the UK and $2.99 on the US store. Mueller has previously created similar apps, called Carrot To-Do and Carrot Alarm, that both use an avatar to encourage users to be more productive, or active. A recent survey, commissioned for the start of National Obesity Awareness Week, has found that almost a third (28 per cent) of UK adults live a 'lethargic lifestyle.' A fifth said they rarely exercise, while eight per cent admitted they never exercise at all. Of those who don't exercise, 40 per cent said it was because 'they couldn’t be bothered'. Women were the idlest sex, with 44 per cent saying they were too lazy to exercise, compared with 29 per cent of men. While almost two thirds of 18 to 24-year-olds blamed laziness for their lack of motivation, making them the most lackadaisical age group. Among the adults surveyed, 16 per cent said they didn’t exercise as the people at gym intimidated them. Women were more likely than men to attribute their lack of motivation to this, with 20 per cent of females naming it as the core obstacle to fitness compared with 13 per cent of men. The study was commissioned by international group fitness brand Les Mills.","Carrot Hunger is the latest in a line of 'sadistic' weight loss apps .

"One of the most difficult parts of a trial, especially in front of a jury, is accurately describing the crime scene. A number of courtrooms have begun projecting 3D images of scenes onto walls - but these can only reveal a limited amount of information. To take criminal courtroom reconstructions to the next level, experts have created a 3D immersive system that virtually transports people inside the scene using an Oculus Rift headset. The setup uses an Oculus Rift headset (d), the OptiTrack optical tracker (e), laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. The computer system is shown at (a), (b) is the Oculus USB connector, and (c) is a wall-mounted tracker . It has been dubbed 'forensic holodeck' after the environment simulator used in sci-fi show Star Trek. The low-cost setup uses an Oculus Rift headset, the OptiTrack optical tracker, a laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. It also uses gaming software called Unity 3D. This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail - similar to Star Trek’s hologram setup. ‘In Switzerland, scenes are routinely reconstructed by combining 3D laser scans of the scene to post-mortem surface scans and medical images, such as CT and MRI,’ explained lead researcher Lars Ebert from the from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Zurich. To demonstrate the system, the researchers chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe (pictured). The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings. The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room .

This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail. Oculus Rift is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time, allowing for calculation of the scene with the correct perspective. Oculus Rift (pictured) is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time . The headset consists of a screen that is split in half, delivering half the 1280 x 800 pixel resolution for each eye. In the front of the screen, two plastic lenses help create a diagonal viewing angle of 110-degrees. The Rift is then connected to the PC using a HDMI cable, and a USB transfers information about the head orientation to a computer. Head orientation is measured using a combination of gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers. When used for gaming, the headset doesn’t typically need to use positional information of the head is usually not required. To overcome this problem for the forensic holodeck system, the researchers added an optical tracker to measure the user position. This meant they could freely move inside the virtual scene. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe. The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings.  The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room. ‘The purpose of these reconstructions is to create a visualisation of an event to make it possible for a state attorney or judge to properly assess a situation based on the bullet trajectories, visibility, speed and distance.’ Mr Ebert continued, however, that although the data used for these reconstructions are high resolution, and allow for a spatially correct display of the scene, they typically use a 3D reconstruction on a 2D display. This reduces the amount of spatial information available. The technology is similar to the fictional holodeck in Star Trek (pictured with  Deanna Troi played by Marina Sirtis left and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker right). Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes . And although 3D screens partially solve this problem, estimating distances is still difficult because the perceived depth depends on the size of the display. Mr Ebert believes his Oculus Rift system is a solution to this. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting. During the incident in an internet cafe, a known drug dealer was approached by policemen and women in civilian clothes as well as in uniform for the purpose of arresting him. A Holographic Environment Simulator, or holodeck for short, was a form of holotechnology designed and used by Starfleet in Star Trek. Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet institutions for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. A typical holodeck consisted of a room with a hologrid containing so-called omnidirectional holographic diodes. Holographic projections could be shown by manipulating photons contained within force fields. It was also used in an episode of The Next Generation, called A Matter of Perspective, to recreate the events leading up to a space station explosion for forensic investigations. Source: Memory Alpha . Despite being surrounded, the man was able to get up from his chair and draw a handgun. One of the policemen managed to grab onto the arm bearing the gun while the others attempted to take cover. In the course of the struggle, seven gunshots were fired and one of the bullets hit a policeman on his hand. The entire scene was recorded by a surveillance camera in one of the top corners of the room, and these recordings were used to reconstruct the sequence of events. The team then used a laser to scan the surroundings, and used to this to pinpoint the final position of the projectiles. This, along with the camera footage, were used to reconstruct every bullet fired. The aim of the reconstruction was to show how close the bullet trajectories came to severely injuring one of the people in the room. 'During a police congress, we were able to demonstrate the system,' continued the researchers. 'The comments by the police officers involved in the presented incident were promising.' Further work will be carried out to make the technology more accurate before it is used widely in courtrooms.

"David Cameron has been criticised for the ‘amazing’ omission of immigration from the top six issues on which the Conservatives will fight the forthcoming election. Neither Britain’s borders nor the health service merited a mention in his party’s pitch to voters in May, which includes cutting the deficit, jobs, tax, education, housing and retirement. This is despite polls consistently showing these are the two issues of greatest concern to voters, often eclipsing economic growth. David Cameron was criticised yesterday after omitting immigration and health care from the top six issues on which the Conservatives will fight the forthcoming election . Mr Cameron, who was addressing an audience party member in Nottingham yesterday, claimed it was not an oversight but would be addressed as part his offer on jobs and the economy. In a long-awaited immigration speech last November, Mr Cameron announced that migrants would have to work in the UK for four years before being eligible for state benefits – up from three months – under a future Conservative government. Yesterday the Prime Minister said immigration was part of his pitch that Britain ‘should live within her means’ and that the public could expect more detailed plans in the coming months. ‘These areas I am talking about are very directly related to people’s concerns about their lives and their security’, he said when asked about leaving it out. ‘It’s about people’s jobs, people’s taxes, the homes they want to buy, the schools they want to send their children to, and their retirement. Through this prism we will address every single issue.’ He said he had already set out ‘the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country’ to tackle European immigration through curbs on access to benefits. Immigration is one of the areas in which the Prime Minister plans to push for further reforms as part of his renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the European Union, if he wins a second term. It is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the EU will be blocked by German chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured here) and others . But his party are under pressure for failing to deliver on their pledge to reduce net migration to tens of thousands, with the latest figures showing it had leapt to 260,000. And it is clear that any restriction on the principle of free movement within the EU will be blocked by German chancellor Angela Merkel and others. In his pre-election speech about jobs - in which he may elaborate on George Osborne’s pledge to create full employment - he will lay out ‘exactly how we will deal with this issue of immigration’, he said. However Lord Green of Deddington, the head of the think tank MigrationWatch said the omission of it from his priorities was ‘amazing’. FOR WORKERS FROM THE EU: . No in-work benefits until they have been in Britain for four years . No social housing for four years . No child benefit or tax credits paid for children living outside the UK . FOR UNEMPLOYED EU MIGRANTS: . No support from the UK taxpayer . Deportation if they do not get a job for six months . Other measures include: . Impose restrictions on EU migrants bringing in family members from outside the EU . Longer bans on rough sleepers, beggars and fraudsters returning to the UK . Tougher rules on deporting foriegn criminals . Refusing to allow other countries to join the EU without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached UK levels . He said yesterday: ‘Immigration has now come top equal with the economy the past six months among the issues the public are most concerned with. 'It is amazing that the Conservative Party have not included it in their top six issues for the election campaign.’ Mr Cameron also insisted that the NHS was ‘at the heart of this commitment for Britain to live within her means’. Ed Miliband seized on its absence from the list yesterday saying it was the subject that ‘dare not speak its’ name’. The Prime Minister said his party had protected the NHS budget, while making cuts elsewhere, over the last five years and would make the same commitment for the next Parliament. ‘Not a penny will be cut from the NHS budget - instead it will carry on rising,’ he said. ‘I am a father, a son and a husband who has relied on the NHS many times. ‘When you are sick, when your loved ones are ill, when you feel at your most vulnerable, you need to know the NHS is there. That is why we are making this commitment. ‘That is the right thing to do for the sick, the frail and the vulnerable in our country. And the right thing for the NHS long-term is to get Britain back to living within its means.’ Last night a ComRes poll for ITV News put ‘managing the NHS’ as voters top concern – overtaking ‘controlling immigration’ for the first time in six months. Half of British people now list the health service as one of their top three priorities, compared with only 39 per cent last months. Immigration is a top three concern for 46pc of voters. Third on the list, chosen by 25 per cent of people, was ‘keeping down the cost of everyday items, such as food, energy and travel’ and fourth was ‘promoting economic growth.’","Cameron also left out health care from his party's pitch to voters in May .

"The final straw for me was when people at work started calling me 'Big Man' - I had to do something about my weight. I'm sure it was meant affectionately, but I was mortified as I'd never considered myself as 'big'. But the truth was last year, I tipped the scales at 16 stone - at least three stone overweight for my height (I'm 5 ft 11in). I'd tried and failed to shift the pounds that had crept on in the last three years. I desperately wanted to lose the weight for good, so why was I unable to see a diet through to the finish? Scroll down for video . Andy Leeks, at 16 stone, was 3 stone overweight for his height (5 ft 11in), in total he lost 30½ lb and his waist went from 38-40 inches to 34-36 inches . The answer was surprisingly simple: Boredom. I'd start a new diet with loads of enthusiasm, only to abandon my best-laid plans when the novelty wore off - usually once I'd learned all there was to learn about the plan and any weight loss started to slow. Which is why I came up with the idea of trying out ten different diets in 50 days. Would it be possible to lose weight by changing diets regularly - without losing interest? I've always had a short attention span and this seemed an interesting challenge. Fifty days seemed like a nice round number, and would mean I had to stick to each diet for only five days. My first step was a full health screening with my GP. I explained my plans and that I wanted to see the before and after health results - to my surprise she agreed and said she'd be interested to see what happened, not just for my weight but for my overall health. My starting blood pressure was 136/81 and my overall cholesterol reading was 4 - both within the healthy ranges, but with definite room for improvement. The GP did warn me that if I did lose weight, I might not be able to keep it off because people who lose weight rapidly - typical of more extreme diets - tend to put it straight back on. Nonetheless, I wanted to see if it was possible - and whether it would get round the tedium of dieting. Andy wondered if it be possible to lose weight by changing diet regularly - without losing interest . I picked diets I hadn't previously tried. The ten diets in order were: the 5:2 diet; the Special K diet, where two out of three meals are replaced by Special K cereal or snack bars; following NHS guidance for a healthy diet; a juice fast; the high-fat, low-carb Atkins diet; a raw food diet; the baby food diet (replacing two out of three meals a day with tiny jars of baby food, in order to cut calories); calorie counting using a mobile phone app; the grapefruit diet, which involves having either grapefruit or grapefruit juice before or after each meal, supposedly to boost fat-burning; and the cabbage soup diet. I started with the 5:2. The idea is to restrict calories drastically for two days and eat normally for the rest of the week - three days in my case. On both fasting days, I ate tomato soup for lunch, one slice of toast (with crusts cut off to shave off some calories) with a small helping of beans for dinner and an apple. I was worried I'd overdo it on the non-fasting days, as you can eat whatever you like. But, surprisingly, I found myself craving things like nuts and fruits rather than bacon sandwiches. I lost 5 lb in the five days - though I realised afterwards I'd been following the female version of the diet and eating 500 calories on fast days, rather than the 600 recommended for men. I could have had those crusts after all... I also lost 5 lb on diet two - the Special K diet, but it was much more boring. I couldn't wait to move on to the next diet and there's no way I could have stuck to it for more than five days. But at least swapping meals for low-calorie cereal was easy. The juice diet - diet four - by comparison, was a nightmare to follow. All the juices had to be made fresh and took ages to prepare. There would have been no way I could have lugged the required 3kg of fruit and veg into the office every day - fortunately my very understanding boss let me work from home that week. Some looked like swamp water and my five-year-old daughter Charlotte asked me to stop helping her with her homework because my 'voice was smelly'. I bailed out a day early. Nothing was as bad as diet six -  raw food . I did lose 4 lb on it, but I lost the same amount following the guidance for a balanced diet on the NHS website (diet three), and it was much more enjoyable, with plenty of wholegrains, lots of vegetables and fruit, some meat and fish and not too much fat or sugar. Nothing was technically off limits, and there was no calorie counting. I was surprised that this worked as it didn't feel like a diet. Counting calories using a tracker app on my phone (diet eight), the grapefruit diet (diet nine) and the baby food diet (diet seven) only shifted 1lb each. I hated the constant reminder that I was on a diet from logging everything I ate on my phone, the baby food was bland mush and I now like grapefruit a lot less than before. I lost a little more - 1½ lb - on the Atkins regimen (diet five) of eggs, meat, butter and cheese. With no starchy foods or sugar, your body is supposed to use body fat for fuel. The downside was that I was almost instantly bored and miserable. But nothing was as bad as diet six - the raw food diet. I was feeling really run down by this point and my throat was sore. But I persevered with the incredibly strict plan of food in its uncooked, unprocessed state - so raw fruit and veg, nuts and seeds, and not much else. Fans claim food in this unadulterated state allows the body to function at its best, helping shed excess weight. Of course, it helps that this sort of food tends to have few calories. By day three of the raw food plan, my throat was worse and I couldn't taste anything (no bad thing when nothing can be cooked). I woke in the middle of the night struggling to breathe, resulting in a 5 am trip to A&E. I was diagnosed with an infection, requiring antibiotics and rest. It seems foolish now, but I didn't mention my diet challenge. I spent the next two days in bed eating almost nothing - I lost 3 lb, although how much of this was down to illness rather than the diet is hard to say. I left the diet I'd been dreading most till last - the Cabbage Soup diet. Every meal was low calorie cabbage soup. It was awful. No amount of herbs and spices could mask the fact it was yet another bowl of soup made from cabbage, onions and water. And as many other cabbage soup dieters have reported, it gives you bad breath and terrible wind. I felt sorry for my poor wife, who had already put up with 45 days of my see-sawing moods. But for the first time in years, I'd managed to stick to my plan to diet for more than a couple of weeks - and in total I lost 30½ lb. I could see my feet for the first time in years and my waist had gone from 38-40 inches to 34-36 inches. I felt happy and healthy - although my doctor had news for me on that front. For while my blood pressure was a tiny bit lower, at 130/80, my cholesterol had gone up to 4.3, and this increase was down to a rise in so-called 'bad' LDL cholesterol. My GP explained that extreme diets essentially shock the body; and in its confused state subtle changes can happen - not all helpful - which might explain why my LDL was slightly up. She said people's exact reactions will vary, and added that if I keep the weight off, she would expect an improvement in my readings. There were other lessons too. Around the four-week mark, I stopped weighing myself every day - something I always used to do when I was on a diet, and then not at all when I fell off the wagon. Weighing myself daily meant I would often see no change or even a slight increase and it was demotivating. This time, perhaps because of the variety of the diets, I could stick it out long enough to see other changes that are more important than the number on the scale - my double chin was receding, my skin was better, I was finding my weekly run easier. There was only one way of eating out of the ten that I could stick to long-term - and that's the diet set out by the NHS. And now I know it can really work just as well as a plan with stricter, faddier rules. It's nearly two months since I finished my ten-diet whirl, and unlike any other time I've dieted, I still feel determined to stick to healthy eating. While I wouldn't recommend my methods to anyone, this was the first January in ages where I haven't been tempted by the latest New Year diet - in fact, I truly believe I will never do another diet again, thank goodness!

"Jack Nicholson fears dying alone because women don't trust him thanks to his reputation as a lothario . He once said he used to feel irresistible to women - and his impressive list of lovers suggests he had a point. But Jack Nicholson admits he fears dying alone because he can no longer captivate the ladies like he did in younger years. The 77-year-old says women do not trust him anymore thanks to his reputation as 'Jack the Jumper' - a reference to his well-known philandering. In comments published by U.S. magazine Closer, he said he would love 'one last romance' but said he was 'not very realistic' about that happening. He said he didn't believe that relationships are 'fixed things' because humans are 'necessarily complex and confused beings'. He added: 'We don't always do the right thing, say the right thing and behave the way we always want to behave.' Nicholson has made very similar remarks in an interview in 2011, suggesting that his outlook on the future has changed very little since then. A source also told the magazine that Nicholson was 'afraid of dying alone' in his Los Angeles mansion. Nicholson's lovers have included actresses and models such as Michelle Phillips, Bebe Buell, Lara Flynn Boyle, Anjelica Huston and Rebecca Broussard. He was married to Sandra Knight for six years between 1962 and 1968, a marriage she described as 'very beautiful and sweet'. But his  affair with Addams Family actress Angelica Huston was far more volatile, with him repeatedly cheating on her. It finally ended in 1989 after 16 years when when he announced over dinner that Broussard was going to have his baby. Scroll down for video . Nicholson's 16-year affair with Addams Family actress Angelica Huston (above) ended in turbulent circumstances when he announced over dinner that Rebecca Broussard was going to have his baby . In remarks published by Closer, Nicholson says he was 'annihilated emotionally', adding: 'I'm childish and I did make a mistake'. The magazine reports how Nicholson spends his time sleeping until 1pm, drinking milk to soothe his stomach, playing golf and going next door to the property that contains his art collection. He bought the adjacent house, once owned by Marlon Brando in Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles, largely so that he didn't have to cope with any neighbours.

"When Dr Philip Nitschke’s critics hear that he is going to do stand-up comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year they’ll be hoping his act dies on stage, but the voluntary euthanasia advocate is hoping for a much funnier ending. The 67-year-old is teaming up with UK comedian Mel Moon, who has been diagnosed with a brain tumour, in an effort to provide some entertainment by laughing at death. Dr Nitschke’s in need of a laugh as his medical registration was suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July 2014. An initial appeal to overturn his suspension from practising medicine was rejected earlier this month. Dr Philip Nitschke will make his debut in stand-up comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year . In his autobiography Dr Nitschke’s Damned If I Do he finishes it by saying that if his legal wrangles get too much he could always try stand-up comedy as ‘there are worse things than dying laughing’. After reading the autobiography Ms Moon, who is just 35 years old and was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011, got in touch as the final line resonated wither her. ‘Her illness forced her to think about her mortality which is why she read my book and contacted me,’ Dr Nitschke, who lives in Darwin, explained. British comedian Mel Moon with be the other half of the double act. Ms Moon was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2011 . ‘We talked a lot about death and the choices she has before we ever talked about comedy. We talked about her having a peaceful end to her life, but it was really a matter of giving her that reassurance that was she was back in control. ‘She was very grateful for the exchange we had. But she was also looking at getting back into stand-up after taking a year or so off, because of her serious illness. ‘It was then she brought up the last line of my autobiography and said how it would make a good premise for a show, and if I’d be interested in taking part in it.’ The upshot of it all is they’re set to perform for a month at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August where they’ll do a one-hour show six nights a week. No laughing matter: Dr Nitschke’s had his medical registration suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July 2014 . Dr Nitschke has a lot of experiences to draw upon. In 1996, he became the first doctor in the world to administer a legal, lethal voluntary injection under the short-lived Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT). Four of his terminally ill patients used this law to end their suffering before the law was overturned in March 1997 by the Australian Parliament. The same year, Dr Nitschke found the Voluntary Euthanasia Research Foundation (now called Exit International). Despite not practising as a doctor for well over a decade however, his medical registration was suspended by the Australian Medical Board in July last year after he admitted to supporting 45-year-old Perth man Nigel Brayley's decision to take his own life despite knowing he was not terminally ill. Dr Nitschke and MS Moon believe that there can still be laughs when it comes to death . But he has now a chance to put his latest travails behind him, and although Dr Nitschke’s work may seem like one that wouldn’t raise many smiles, he believes this isn’t the case at all. ‘I have given a lot of workshops to many people in their 70s and 80s and they turn out to be excruciatingly funny affairs. Elderly people have a much more sanguine approach to their own mortality and to death in particular,’ he said. ‘Over the years many people have got a great amount of entertainment out of this subject. For some time I’d wondered if it would translate to a younger audience. Mel’s been forced now to engage with this issue because of her illness and her observations on it all are very funny. ‘The idea then is to put it all together in a format that’s entertaining and for it to be informative to the younger audiences that will see it.’ The Fringe Festival in Edinburgh has unearthed many new comedy talents over the years . Both Dr Nitschke and Ms Moon are currently working on the scripts, and they’ll be doing some face to face work soon. ‘They tell me you sink or swim – or in our case, live or die – in the first few days at Edinburgh as the reviewers can be ruthless, so we’ll have to make sure we can make it as good as we can get it before then,’ he said. If it all works the Edinburgh Fringe Festival will be only the start for the duo and they hope to bring the routine to Australia and beyond if it proves to be successful. ‘It really was a stroke of great luck that Mel materialised and took an interest in what we’re doing at Exit in the first place. It’s a pretty universal theme so we’ll just see how it goes,’ he said. Dr Nitschke hopes that a successful run in Edinburgh could see the routine coming to Australia .","Controversial suspended doctor Philip Nitschke to try his hand at stand-up .

"Fans of box office hit Gone Girl will be delighted to hear author Gillian Flynn has said she is open to making a sequel of the psychological thriller. Flynn, who wrote the book and then produced the screenplay, says she would only revisit the plot if Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were happy to reprise their roles. Flynn, who was nominated for best screenplay for the film, told the New York Daily News: 'There could be a sequel at some point if everyone is game to get the gang back together, it could be really fun a few years from now. Scroll down for video . Gone Girl author Gillian Flynn, pictured at the Golden Globes on Sunday night,  has said she is open to making a sequel of the box office hit . 'We could pick it up and see what those crazy Dunnes are up to a few years down the road and if they got on — not well I don't think. 'I would have to have the exact same people to do it — I would want Rosamund, Ben and Fincher to do it.' The 43-year-old also admitted that it was Ben Affleck's choice to show as much as he did in the shower scene at the end of the film as she did not specify it in her screenplay. Box office hit: In the mystery thriller, Ben plays Nick Dunne, whose wife Amy vanishes on their fifth wedding anniversary . The scene in question: Affleck's nude scene became a hot topic in the interview . 'I was all for the cinema realite. He was a total method actor and in playing a man who got in the shower, he played a man who got in the shower. 'I didn't know exactly how they would film it. I think the screenplay says they get in the shower so I cannot take credit for that.' The film had four nominations at the Golden Globes - and became director David Fincher’s highest-grossing film in the U.S  - it took $365,322,000 at the box office worldwide. The author behind the psychological thriller of the summer, Gone Girl, has said her book about a marriage turning sour was inspired by her own successful marriage, and that her lawyer husband was, in fact, her 'muse'. The pop culture journalist-turned-horror author, said Gone Girl is so intensely creepy ('my goal is to make spouses look askance at each other') thanks entirely to partner Brett Nolan giving her licence to write anything she liked. Speaking to Oliver Burkeman in the Guardian, Flynn, said she wrote the book - which has now sold millions of copies worldwide - when the couple, who have a young son, were very newly married . Rosamund Pike arrives at the Fox Searchlight Golden Globes after-party at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday . She said: 'The funny thing, I guess is that my husband ended up being the muse of a book about the worst marriage in the world, because if he hadn't consistently said, 'Don't censor yourself, don't worry about me' - if he'd been anxious and worried about it - then it would never have gotten written.' Gone Girl - which follows Flynn's first books Sharp Objects (2007) and Dark Places (2010) - tells the story of a marriage gone horribly wrong, and questions whether you can ever truly know the person with whom you share your life. Set in Missouri, on the fifth wedding anniversary of 'perfect' couple Nick and Amy Dunne, the novel begins when Nick comes home to find his beautiful, trust-fund wife missing from their home amid and evidence of a struggle. Enter the police, the media, and Amy's overbearing parents - along with some revealing entries from the missing woman's diary - and Nick finds he must defend himself against accusations. Fynn, who grew up obsessed with horror films as a child in Kansas ('I watched Psycho a million times') and trained as a crime reporter, says people who have read her books expect her to be a sociopath, but that mystery writers actually tend to be the 'sanest and nicest people'. The former pop culture writer, who was fired from her job at Entertainment Weekly in 2009 due to budget cuts, added: 'It seems like the darker the books are, the nicer the person is. People say it's the romance writers you've got to watch out for.' While Gone Girl has been accused of misogyny (female characters in her writing are seldom very palatable), Flynn insists she is a feminist... just one who is wants to push against the idea that women are intrinsically loving and kind. She is 'weary of spunky heroines'. She wants to make her ladies ugly. She said: 'In literature they can be bad - trampy, vampy, bitchy types - but there's still a big pushback against the idea that women can be just pragmatically evil, bad and selfish.'","Would only revisit the plot if Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike were happy to reprise their roles .

"The flu season only kicked off in late December but there are already signs that the UK could be heading for an epidemic, with the number affected at its highest level for three years. Last week, doctors reported a 'significant rise' in the number of hospital admissions, while Flusurvey, a European-wide monitoring system, says reported cases across all age groups has doubled in seven days - a much bigger leap compared with the same time last year. With the flu season not set to peak for six weeks, many more people could be affected, so what's going on? Around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by Public Health England have been found to be 'drifted' strains - or mutations - of H3N2 . The problem is being blamed on the nature of this particular flu virus and the fact it has mutated. The jab is designed to prevent the most widespread flu virus, known as H3N2. However, the mutations of the virus appear resistant to it. In hospitals, around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by Public Health England have been found to be 'drifted' strains - or mutations - of H3N2. This rate of mutation is ten times higher than normal. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have announced that half of their samples are mutations. What does all this mean for you and your family? We ask the country's top experts for their advice. AM I SAFE IF I'VE HAD THE JAB? Every year the flu jab is different, protecting against the three flu types scientists have identified as being those likely to cause the most problems in the flu season. The scientists gather each February at the HQ of the World Health Organisation in Geneva and base their decision on what happened the previous winter in the southern hemisphere (when it was our summer); this gives an early indication of which flu viruses are likely to affect us next. The vaccines are developed and given in October or November, before the flu season starts in the northern hemisphere. Every year the flu jab is different, protecting against the three flu types . This year, scientists pinpointed one strain as the major cause of flu in 2015 - Influenza A type H3N2. Although H3N2 is not as virulent as some other strains, it mutates very easily, so the vaccine is not as protective against it. 'Around 20 per cent of patients are infected with mutated strains which is higher than we expect - this figure would usually be around 2 per cent,' says John Oxford, professor of virology at Barts and the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary University of London. 'For some reason, this year's strain mutates quickly - it's impossible to say why this virus behaves differently.' IS THIS 'MUTANT' FLU MORE RISKY? The short answer is no. 'It won't make any difference to healthy adults who have strong immune systems - and there's no reason to believe a mutated form of H3N2 will give you a worse dose of flu,' explains Professor Oxford. Nor are the new mutations more infectious. However, importantly, vulnerable people who've had the flu jab may not be as well protected and may develop flu symptoms. People considered at risk of flu are offered a free jab every year. They include: the over-65s; pregnant women; patients with certain medical conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including emphysema) and diabetes; those living in a care home; carers and healthcare workers. Children aged two to four are also offered vaccination (as a nasal spray). Last week, Dr Ben Marshall, a specialist in respiratory medicine at Southampton General Hospital, said they had admitted many more patients in the at-risk groups who should have been protected by their annual flu jab. 'We have seen the number of patients, mainly those with respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD, being admitted as emergencies increase from 25-30 a day to more than 50.' Around half have the H3N2 virus. 'The numbers have been far higher and there is no sign of that letting up any time soon.' WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO GET IT? This year's 'top' flu bug is more likely to a problem for older people and very young children, not because they are more likely to be infected but because their symptoms would be worse. 'Older people tend to have lowered immunity and other health issues, such as COPD or diabetes, which may make them more vulnerable to serious complications,' explains Professor Oxford. Flu can lead to pneumonia, which can be deadly. 'Small children are at a mechanical disadvantage because they have smaller airways, so inflammation can have a more serious effect and lead to dangerous breathing difficulties,' he adds. This year's 'top' flu bug is more likely to a problem for older people and very young children . IS FLU CAUSING THE A&E CRISIS? While Dr Marshall says the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses as an emergency has doubled, Professor Oxford says there is no evidence the mutant H3N2 viruses have been behind overcrowding in crisis-hit A&E departments. Instead, other respiratory infections and the norovirus have been mainly responsible. Figures from Public Health England revealed the winter norovirus season started early when there were 18 outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals across England in October - 17 led to ward closures. Three wards at Southampton General Hospital closed to new admissions due to outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting. Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, explains: 'Norovirus does happen all year round but the main season does seem to have started off a bit earlier this year. 'An earlier start will be having an impact.' Wearing a face mask, a popular preventative measure in the Far East, won't make a huge difference to whether you catch the virus, says Professor Oxford. 'These masks can stop transmission via large droplets, but the virus can still go straight through in an aerosol form, i.e. as a mist of tiny liquid particles. Masks should not be considered an alternative to having the jab.' There's no hard evidence that vitamin C can boost your immune system, although a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is good for general health. 'Wash your hands thoroughly, particularly before eating, and use an anti-viral gel regularly and often,' says Professor Oxford. For those worried about loved ones in care homes, the key is good hygiene practices, says Professor Oxford. 'And people should not visit a care home if they suspect they have the flu.' IS THE FLU JAB A WASTE OF TIME? No, says Professor Oxford, who points out that it protects against two other kinds of flu strains as well as H3N2. 'It also protects against the serious H1N1 strain (swine flu) which caused the pandemic in 2009, and B/Massachusetts/2, a strain which was active in 2012.' Also, while he can't say for sure, he believes that even mutated versions of H3N2 will be weakened by the antibodies in the jab. 'It may mean people get a less serious version of the flu virus with milder symptoms. I would be very surprised if the jab offered no protection at all.' Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at Public Health England, adds: 'Existing vaccine is likely to still provide some protection and getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect yourself from flu.' Clare Wenham, research fellow in Public Health Engagement at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who runs Flusurvey in the UK, says that no one should be put off having a jab because H3N2 mutations have been found. 'We want to encourage all vulnerable people to have the vaccine if they haven't already done so.' The best time is the autumn before the season starts, but it is possible to have the jab later, as long as stocks are left. Ask your GP. If you are not eligible for a free jab, you can pay for one at many pharmacists. WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN? From September 2013, flu vaccinations were added to the childhood immunisation schedule and children aged two, three and four are now automatically offered vaccination, although many are still to take it up. Older children with asthma may be eligible for a free jab - talk to your GP or practice nurse. Uptake among children is around 40 per cent. 'Not only is it important for the child's protection, but children are known to be virus spreaders and can easily transmit infection to grand-parents and other vulnerable family members,' says Professor Oxford.","The jab is designed to prevent the most widespread flu virus, H3N2 .

"Hackers are playing on the public's fear of a terrorist attack in Sydney by circulating a fake email that claims to reveal locations that ISIS plans to attack in 2015. Instead, the emails contain an attachment that downloads a malicious code which allows the attackers to gain access to and control their victim's computers and potentially steal various passwords. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) released a warning against the fake emails, which contain the subject line 'ISIS attacks in Sydney?' after receiving almost 100 reports from recipients on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Hackers have been circulating an email claiming to list locations in Sydney that are under threat from ISIS . 'We have had just under 100 emails reported to us by members of the Australian public. How many are in circulation we are unsure, but we would expect, based on those numbers, that they have been widely circulated,' Bruce Matthews, the manager of internet security programs at ACMA, told Daily Mail Australia. 'These emails encourage people to open an attached Word or RAR file by claiming the attachment includes an article naming the Sydney locations ISIS plans to attack in 2015,' the statement reads. ACMA also warned that the hackers have included the contact details of news website news.com.au in an effort to appear legitimate.

The circulation of the email has come as many Sydney residents remain shaken following the Martin Place siege by gunman Man Haron Monis which left two people dead. Australia's terror alert remains at level 'high', meaning a terrorist attack is 'likely', with Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently stating that 'there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege'. Hacking in the name of ISIS has been a common theme over the last few days, with the social media accounts of the US military's central command appearing to have been taken over by sympathisers on Monday.

"Scott Tinsley, who has been jailed for 40 months after he was discovered sleeping on a sofa inside the home of a family he was trying to steal from . A burglar has been jailed after he was discovered sleeping on a sofa inside the home of a family he was trying to steal from. Scott Tinsley was found snoring on the settee after breaking into the house in Stoke-on-Trent in the early hours of the morning. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how the 38-year-old from Cobridge, Staffordshire, had already taken electrical goods from the house and piled them up in the garden. He then returned to the house to get something to eat and drink but fell asleep on the sofa after taking drugs, leaving the gas turned on. Tinsley wasn't discovered until the next morning at 7.30am when he was found asleep in the front room. The court was told how the raid last November was supposed to be a quick burglary for easy money to sell on electrical goods. But the unnamed mother at the house alerted police after finding him snoring in their living room. Prosecutor Neil Ahuja said: 'She was particularly concerned as her three children were asleep upstairs. 'She alerted her husband and they woke the defendant up. He tried to leave but was detained by the husband. 'Various valuables had been removed from the front room and taken outside, including the television, games console and CD player. 'They were found by police in a back garden two doors further down.' The court was also told that Tinsley's relationship had broken down and he had relapsed into further drug use. Simon Leech, defending, said: 'He did not respond with any degree of violence. 'It would have been a very frightening incident for the family, including the children.

"John Galliano returned from fashion exile this evening to unveil his first collection in four years at London Collections: Men, and the fashion community lapped up his surreal creations. The designer's much-anticipated show for Maison Martin Margiela  was his first since he was fired from Dior in 2011, after a series of racist and anti-semitic offences. The 54-year-old designer's friends and supporters including Kate Moss and husband Jamie Hince, Jefferson Hack, Manolo Blahnik, Burberry's creative director Christopher Bailey and Natalie Massenet of Net-A-Porter fame were in the front row  as he showcased his first couture collection for the Belgian brand. John Galliano showed his new collection for Maison Martin Margiela at London Collections: Men this evening. It's the first show since he was found guilty of racist and anti-semitic abuse in 2011. The designer decided against an end-of-show bow but was pictured leaving the venue in a car after the show . His flamboyant creations included a jumbo-sized devil's mask worn with a red swing coat and red rubber leggings and a ghostly wedding dress. The fashion community took to Twitter in droves to share their views on the controversial comeback using the hashtag #MargielaMonday. 'A mixture of Belgian chic, Parisian couture and a Galliano wild streak this #MargielaMonday hasn't been a boring one!' tweeted Red magazine. Meanwhile, fashion bible Harper's Bazaar wrote: 'The clothes could only have come from one man', then added, 'Surrealist fashion from John Galliano  #MargielaMonday'. Editor of fashionista.com Lauren Sherman commented: 'Galliano’s demons were out there for all to see'. She commented, 'Many of the looks were like beautiful innards twisted outward, as if Galliano was using this collection to purge himself of his demons.' Kate Moss arriving at the Maison Martin Margiela catwalk fashion show with husband Jamie Hince (left and right). When Galliano left rehab Moss showed her solidarity by insisting that he continue to design her wedding dress, even though he was no longer at Dior . Big names in the fashion industry including Christopher Bailey, chief creative and chief executive officer of Burberry, (left) and shoe designer Manolo Blahnik (right) also attended Galliano's comeback show . Other creations included a high-collared, floor-length, red-velvet gown, which the model wore with futuristic eye make up and, in true Galliano style, skyscraper platforms. A black tasseled mini-skirt was worn with a structured jacket,  pulled off the shoulder and accessorised with a feather headpiece and tights that were half black and half white. The house described the collection 'artisanal' and many of the clothes were embellished with bric-a-brac - junk metal jewellery, shells and beads decorated one leopard print leotard while a tunic dress was adorned with black plastic toy cars. John Galliano was famous for his flamboyant end-of-show bows while at Dior, but the past few years have clearly had an effect on the designer - he skipped the catwalk and immediately left the venue in a waiting car when the show had finished today. Fashion blogger Simon Glazin told FEMAIL: 'The last four days of menswear fashion shows in the capital may as well never have happened - the comeback of John Galliano, after four disgraced years away from the fashion arena, has overshadowed it all. 'The Dior days of Galliano was all about fantasy, about whimsical, extraordinary, unattainable, incredible couture. And this is what we saw from him today.' Natalie Massenet (left) of Net-A-Porter fame and publisher Jefferson Hack (right) arriving at the London show . 'The name of the fashion house which he presides over is, essentially, immaterial. What Galliano does, translates. He does luxury and magnificence like no other,' he adds. 'Although the colour palette stuck to black, white and red, it was all about the detail. 'Toy cars used at trims, shredded chiffon trailing behind models, clear plastic pockets, robot-esque faces on dresses and coats, shells, beads and pieces of mirror adorning the closing dresses. 'The dimensions Galliano created stayed true to both his and Margiela's avant-garde routes. 'Having said all this, pick some of the looks apart and you're left with wearable pieces: a black jacket, denim shorts and evening gowns. 'His comeback is a pure triumph. 'Welcome back John.' Shamed: Fashion designer John Galliano sporting a clean look to publicise his new appointment in October 2014; Right: Arriving at court in 2011 following a video which emerged of him spewing anti-Semitic and racist abuse . Galliano was hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiela in October after being sacked by Dior. The  designer was asked to leave his job at Dior after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he loved Hitler and that her parents should have been gassed. He then allegedly ranted to an Asian man sitting with her: '****ing Asian b******, I'm going to kill you.' Two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-Semitic abuse at the hands of the designer. Face of Dior, Natalie Portman, was among those outraged by his remarks. At the time, the Oscar-winning actress said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way. 'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' Dior owners LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders. He was later charged in court and given two suspended fines totalling 6,000 euros (£5,250). Since then, Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013. Offended: Former Dior fashion designer John Galliano on the catwalk; Right: Face of Dior and actress Natalie Portman was amongst those who found his comments deeply offensive . Despite his humiliating fall from grace, Galliano's friends including Naomi Campbell and Anna Wintour are said to have encouraged the designer to make a comeback. Both Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell are rumoured to have been in contact with the designer during his darkest days of rehab in Arizona and supermodel Linda Evangelista made the journey to see Galliano in rehab on his first visitors' weekend. She told Vanity Fair: 'I just didn't want that weekend to go by without anyone reaching out to him.' When the designer left rehab, Kate Moss showed her solidarity by insisting that he continue to design her wedding dress, even though he was no longer at Dior. The designer said he chose London for his inaugural show because he wants to go back to his 'formative years and his beginnings in the industry - and it is intrinsically related to the city's traditional tailoring history and heritage.' A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his John Galliano brand, which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group. But Renzo Rosso, president of Only The Brave (OTB) group, which owns Maison Martin Margiela as well as jeans brand Diesel, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, would prefer not to dwell on the past. Left: Shamed designer John Galliano (with boyfriend Alexis Roche) showcased his first couture collection for Maison Martin Margiela in London this afternoon; Right: The designer with model Naomi Campbell, whom is said to have stayed in touch with Galliano during dark times . He said in a statement at the time of Galliano's hiring: 'This appointment marks a new era in the history of the Maison.' He also described Galliano as 'a visionary and non-conformist'. The line's founder Martin Margiela left his fashion house in 2009. Before that he kept a very low profile, rarely giving interviews. When he did, he preferred to do so in writing, and he would generally sign Maison Martin Margiela rather than his own name. His brand's products did not carry the Belgian fashion house's name but visible white stitches instead as a signature. At the time of Galliano's appointment, Bea Ercolini, editor-in-chief at the Belgian edition of Elle fashion magazine said: 'They hired the most visible designer to replace the most invisible designer, which is very ironic and funny and from that point of view, very much in the spirit of Maison Martin Margiela.' OTB acquired Maison Martin Margiela in 2002 and the brand, which now makes around 100 million euros in annual sales, has been profitable for just under three years. In 2013, OTB made total revenues of 1.6 billion euros.","John Galliano, 54, showed his new collection for Maison Martin Margiela at London Collections: Men this evening .

"A 17-year-old female student has been arrested after brutally beating up a male classmate because he passed gas in her direction, the NYPD has said. Joquasha Rosado allegedly attacked the unnamed 15-year-old boy after he suffered a bout of flatulence near her at South Richmond High School in Staten Island last Monday. She reportedly smacked him over head with a metal stool, before hitting him in the face 'ten to fifteen times with a closed fist'. The victim suffered 'a bleeding gash that required eight staples'. 'Beating': Joquasha Rosado has been arrested after brutally beating up one of her male classmates at South Richmond High School (pictured) in New York because he passed gas in her direction, the NYPD has said . It is unclear whether Rosado believed the boy had deliberately passed gas in her direction at the Pleasant Plains school, which caters for teenagers with special needs and disabilities. It is also unknown whether the alleged attack took place in a classroom or elsewhere. Rosado, from Mariners Harbor, has since been arrested on  a felony charge of second-degree assault and misdemeanor charges of third-degree assault and criminal weapon possession. She is also charged with a lesser count of harassment, according to the The Smoking Gun.

"Up to six Islamic terrorist cells may still be at large and ready to strike in mainland France, police warned last night. The alert came as French Prime Minister Manuel Valls placed an extra 10,000 troops on the streets of Paris and warned: ‘We are at war.’ He said there were ‘without doubt’ accomplices to last week’s killings in Paris, after security services on both sides of the Channel warned that further attacks are ‘highly likely’. Scroll down for video . Gun guard: A young girl leaves a Jewish school in Paris's Marais district yesterday . Keeping watch: Authorities deployed thousands of troops to bolster security at sensitive sites across France . Likely target: French army soldiers patrol Rue des Rosiers street, in the heart of Paris's Jewish quarter . Police sources put the number of potential cells within France at ‘up to six’. Officials said one suspect had been seen driving a Mini Cooper car registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, the partner of Amedy Coulibaly, who was killed by police on Friday after murdering a woman officer and four Jewish hostages. Boumeddiene is thought to have helped mastermind the Paris atrocities, which left 17 dead. The warning of more sleeper cells came as Mr Valls deployed thousands of armed police to guard Jewish schools around the clock, in response to Coulibaly’s attack on a kosher deli. The fanatic said he had deliberately chosen a Jewish shop, claiming his victims were legitimate targets in revenge for the deaths of Muslims in Palestine. Police later found he had maps showing the locations of Jewish schools in Paris. Security: Soldiers patrol at the base of the Eiffel Tower, as the West braces itself for more terror attacks . Crackdown: Soldiers patrol in the area around the Eiffel Tower, a popular tourist attraction . Sensitive sites: Soldiers patrol around the Sacre Coeur basilica at Montmartre district, in Paris . Announcing the new security measures yesterday, Mr Valls said: ‘With regard to these barbaric terrorist acts, the work for justice and the investigation continues. We think that there were actually probably other accomplices too – the hunt will go on to find them. He added: ‘I do not want there to be young people who identify with these barbaric terrorists who murdered journalists, police and French Jews just because they were Jews.’ Mr Valls said surveillance would also be improved and counter- terrorism officers given more resources following criticism of the security services. Vigilant: A soldier of the 1er Regiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes, patrols outside a synagogue in Marseille . Wary: Police sources put the number of potential Islamist terrorist cells within France at ‘up to six’ Police had stopped tracking Coulibaly and Said and Cherif Kouachi – the brothers who killed 12 in an attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine – six months ago because they were deemed to be low-risk. Official sources said scrutiny of the Kouachis and Coulibaly had been dropped to focus on other targets. The trio were put under 24-hour phone, internet and physical surveillance at the end of 2011, when Said returned from Yemen, where he trained with Al Qaeda and met Anwar Al-Awlaki, the group’s terrorist mastermind who was later killed in a US drone strike. CCTV footage emerged yesterday of the Kouachi brothers strolling into a petrol station with rocket launchers while on the run from police following the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The pair filled a black plastic bag with food and drink, their faces clearly visible despite their status as France’s most-wanted men. The owner of the garage duly recognised the brothers, and alerted police who flooded the area – but the fanatics abandoned their car and escaped on foot. They went on to take a hostage at a printing house near Charles de Gaulle airport, prompting a day-long stand-off that culminated in their deaths. Heavily armed: CCTV footage emerged yesterday of the Kouachi brothers strolling into a petrol station with rocket launchers while on the run from police following the Charlie Hebdo massacre . A day before he attacked the kosher deli, their accomplice Coulibaly shot dead newly-recruited policewoman Clarissa Jean-Philippe, 27, in the Paris district of Montrogue. Yesterday, it emerged that a Jewish school close to where the shooting took place may have been Coulibaly’s intended target. Interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve visited the Yaguel Yaacov school yesterday. He said: ‘We are determined to ensure the protection of all the schools and places of worship in Paris and in France so that Jewish children keep going to school in complete security.’ Roger Cukierman, of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, said: ‘We have our sadness and rage ... we also have urgent measures to take.’ Private Jewish security cars were also out in force in north-west London yesterday following the kosher deli murders. The cars look similar to police vehicles but bear the security group’s name Shomrim – Hebrew for guards – along the sides and back.","Prime Minister Manuel Valls put an extra 10,000 troops on Paris streets .

"A Turkish bus driver filmed dancing in the aisle with his passengers while his vehicle was doing 70 mph down a motorway has been banned from driving for two years.

In the clip Kandemir is seen singing and clapping wildly along to a fast paced local folk tune being played on the radio while his passengers whoop along enthusiastically. Scroll down for video . Turkish bus driver Metin Kandemir was filmed dancing in the aisle with his passengers while his vehicle was doing 70 mph down a motorway . After initially just dancing behind the wheel, Kandemir stood up and held hands with a passenger while dancing with her in the aisle . On two occasions Kandemir gets out of his seat and walks into the aisle where he holds hands with a passenger as they dance together. Police arrested Kandemir after the video - shot by one his passangers - became one of the most popular on social media in Turkey. The 34-year-old later apologised, saying: 'It was a mistake. I apologise to everyone. I will not repeat it. The road was empty at the time. This is the first time I've ever done it.' But after hearing he had 32 previous convictions for traffic offences, Turkish judges fined him £45 for reckless driving and revoked his bus driver's licence for two years. A court heard that the 34-year-old had 32 previous convictions for traffic offences . Kandemir said the incident 'was a mistake' that he would not repeat, but said the 'road was empty at the time' Police spokesman Kaan Tore said: 'He's lucky not to be in prison. He could have killed everyone in that bus and worse.' Turkey has one of the worst road safety records in the world largely based on the fact that many drivers believe it is out of their control if they have an accident. The belief - known as Kismet - is that when a person's time is up, that is it, and therefore there is no point refraining from drinking while driving, maintaining the basic mechanical standards on a vehicle, or even paying attention while driving.","Metin Kandemir was arrested after the video became a social media hit .

"Thousands of cancer patients will be denied life-prolonging medication after health chiefs decided to axe 21 drugs deemed too expensive for the NHS. The move by the Cancer Drugs Fund will affect almost 8,000 sufferers a year – with the big losers being bowel, breast, lung and prostate patients. Although the de-listed drugs will remain available for existing patients, doctors will be unable to prescribe them for new sufferers from March. The decision has sparked fury among cancer charities and doctors who say thousands will be denied ‘last chance’ medication that can give them extra months, if not years, with their loved ones. A review carried out by doctors, pharmacists and patients' representatives has concluded that 25 of the 84 treatments currently offered by the supplementary Cancer Drugs Fund should be dropped . Launched in April 2011, the £280million-a-year fund has led to around 55,000 patients in England receiving drugs banned on the NHS by rationing body NICE for not being value for money. The Government’s aim – a Tory election pledge – was to enable NHS doctors to prescribe any drug they believed could benefit a cancer patient. But NHS England, which took over administration of the fund last year, has found 21 drugs – used in a total of 25 treatments – provide ‘insufficient value for money’. Among them are three breast cancer drugs including Halaven, Jevtana used in prostate cancer, three bowel cancer medications including Avastin, and Alimta for lung cancer. Critics say the UK lags behind Germany, France and Italy in prescribing life-prolonging medicines to cancer patients and the situation will get worse. Mark Flannagan, chief executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘This is bad news for bowel cancer patients. ‘It’s likely that 65 per cent of patients with advanced bowel cancer face the probability of an earlier death by being refused innovative treatments that were available before. ‘These changes are a backward step in treatment for advanced bowel cancer. Anne Strange: Made it to her daughter's wedding . ‘Doctors will be forced to tell their patients there are treatments that can prolong their lives but they will no longer be available.’ The Rarer Cancers Foundation estimates 7,724 patients a year will lose out. Chief executive Andrew Wilson said both the drug companies and NHS England ‘bear responsibility for this mess’. He added: ‘If the Prime Minister is serious about his promise to cancer patients, he needs to bring together NHS England and the drugs companies to broker a deal to protect access to these drugs before the March deadline when patients will be denied treatment.’ Samia al Qadhi, chief executive at Breast Cancer Care, said: ‘Thousands of breast cancer patients have today been denied the chance of improved quality of life and extra time with their loved ones. This news is devastating for them. ‘The Cancer Drugs Fund is falling apart when there is still no long-term solution in place.’ Dr Alison Birtle, consultant clinical oncologist at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said that the decision to axe Jevtana was a travesty. She added: ‘As a doctor who treats men with advanced prostate cancer, I am deeply saddened. In my everyday experience, Jevtana has given some men with advanced prostate cancer extra time. Some of the men that I started to treat with Jevtana three to four years ago are still alive today. ‘Most importantly, this time has been of good quality, allowing them to carry on doing the things they enjoy despite their cancer.’ Professor Peter Clark, chair of the Cancer Drugs Fund, said: ‘We have been through a robust, evidence-based process to ensure the drugs available offer the best clinical benefit, getting the most for patients from every pound.’ But Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said that the fund remains merely a ‘sticking plaster’. He added: ‘NHS England’s decision is extremely disappointing and a significant blow to the health and wellbeing of future NHS patients.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘We want people to have access to the very latest drugs. That is why experts have made decisions to stop routinely funding drugs with limited clinical benefit.’","Government's Cancer Drugs Fund will drop 21 of 84 current treatments .

Prime Minister David Cameron unveiled the Conservative election priorities, including the deficit, jobs and housing but not the NHS or immigration, which are high up the list of voters' concerns . The Tory leader urged voters not to pass on a crippling 'legacy of debt' to their children and grandchildren. In a speech in Nottingham today, Mr Cameron sought to cast the general election in May as a choice between security and chaos. He urged voters not to pass on a crippling 'legacy of debt' to their children and grandchildren. And he brushed off dire warnings from Labour about the impact of spending cuts, insisting it only meant a reduction of £1 for every £100 – something every family or business could cope with. The six election themes which the Tories will focus on are the deficit, jobs, taxes, education, home ownership and retirement. Mr Cameron said: 'We don't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit, we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus.' Britain would be 'back in the black' by 2018, using extra money raised from tax to start paying down the nation's debts, he said.

And finally, as a country, we will be genuinely paying down our debt rather than increasing it. 'We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.' The Tories, in coalition with the Lib Dems, had promised to have eradicated the deficit by now. Latest polling shows that voters name the economy, health and pensions as the key issues facing them and their family, with immigration a key concern for the country . The absence of immigration and the NHS from the key Tory themes set out by David Cameron was seized on by rivals. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that for Mr Cameron the NHS was the subject that 'dare not speak its name'. MEP Steven Woolfe, Ukip's migration spokesman, said: 'Despite all his rhetoric last year, David Cameron's omission of immigration as a major topic during this year's election is yet another example of the Prime Minister running away from debating the big issues.' But the Prime Minister said: 'These areas I am talking about are very directly related to people's concerns about their lives and their security. 'It's about people's jobs, people's taxes, the homes they want to buy, the schools they want to send their children to, and their retirement. 'Through this prism we will address every single issue.' The Prime Minister said he had already set out 'the most radical set of actions that any government has ever contemplated in this country' to tackle European immigration through curbs on access to benefits. Mr Cameron also insisted that the NHS was 'at the heart of this commitment for Britain to live within her means'. He added: 'People can see a real track record, a real commitment and it's at the heart of what we are saying.' Instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election, and is now 5 per cent of GDP, half what it was in 2010. To eradicate the deficit, so the government raises more in tax than it spends, will require another £30billion of savings, Mr Cameron said. 'That is a lot, but it's doable. It requires us to continue the same rate of saving for the first two years of the next Parliament, as we have done for the past five years. 'It means reducing overall government spending by just one per cent each year. 'Put another way, we have to save £1 a year in every £100 that Government spends. 'I don't think there's a family or business that couldn't do that – and I don't think Government, seeing as it's your money, should be any different.' The Tory leader sought to personalise the election by asking parents and grandparents to consider whether, as a nation, they want to 'pass on a mountain of debt to the next generations that they could never hope to re-pay'. 'To every mother, father, grandparent, uncle, aunt, I would ask this question,' Mr Cameron said. 'When you look at the children you love, do you want to land them with a legacy of huge debts? Do you want to limit their future, to make life more difficult for their generation, because we refuse to do the right thing in our generation? 'I say we have a responsibility to act. We can get Britain back to living within our means in a way that is fair and sensible and secure.' The speech comes a day before a Commons vote which Tories hope to use to highlight differences with Labour over economic strategy in the years after 2015-16. Chancellor George Osborne has accused Labour of setting the scene for tax rises equivalent to 3p on income tax by refusing to match his pledge to balance the books by spending cuts alone. But Ed Miliband accused him of 'plucking figures out of the air' and said Labour would eliminate the deficit by 'common sense' spending cuts, tax rises targeted on the rich and a wage boost for the lowest-paid workers which he said would increase tax revenues and cut the bill for in-work benefits. MPs will be asked tomorrow to approve a new Charter for Budget Responsibility committing the Government to a goal of eradicating the structural current deficit on a rolling three-year horizon - which at the time of the next Budget will be 2017-18 - and ensure that debt is falling as a percentage of GDP by 2016-17. Labour has said it will back the plan, which it believes is compatible with its plans to eradicate the current deficit 'as soon as possible' in the next Parliament. Cameron says: We don't just want to eliminate the current budget deficit we want to clear the entire budget deficit and start running a surplus. Reality: At the 2010 election the Tories promised to 'eliminate the bulk of the structural deficit over a Parliament'. Instead it has fallen by around 40 per cent in cash terms since the last election, and is now 5 per cent of GDP, half what it was in 2010. The deficit will still be £91billion this year, requiring £30billion in spending cuts. Cameron says: 'Conservatives know the best way to help people out of poverty is not to hand them a benefit cheque; it's to help them get into work.' Reality: Employment has been one of the big success stories of the coalition, with a record 30.8million in work, 73 per cent of the working age population. Cameron says: 'This is about your family's money – about whether you get to keep more of your money each month with the Conservatives, or pay higher taxes with Labour.' Reality: The Tories have promised that no-one earning the minimum wage - equivalent to £12,500-a-year - will pay any income tax at all, while point at which the 40p tax rate is levied will rise from around £42,000 to £50,000. The £7billion bill is likely to be met from the planned surplus. Cameron says: 'For parents, the security of knowing your children are getting a decent education.' Reality: Latest OECD figures show the UK languishing in mid-table in global education rankings, with maths and reading rated better in China, Korea, Japan, Poland, Slovenia and Germany. Improving education standards and preparing young Britons for work will be vital to competing in the much-mocked 'global race' and to increasing competition for jobs currently taken by migrants. Cameron says: 'The security of having a home of your own – denied to too many for too long.' Reality: The Tories have long prided themselves on being the party of home ownership, but the facts speak for themselves. Latest figures show that just 65.2 per cent of people owned their home in 2012-13, the lowest level since the early 1980s. Cameron says: 'Real dignity and security for those in retirement. These are the things that are on the ballot paper in May.' Reality: The coalition introduced the 'triple lock' on the state pension, which means it rises by inflation, wages or 2.5 per cent whichever is higher. The Tories are committed to continuing it. But it comes at a cost, with the bill for pensions making up the bulk of the welfare state, rising from £87billion in 2010-+11 to £104billion last year.","Prime Minister sets out Tory themes for the general election in May .

"When a relative of an Illinois couple approached them offering to launch a fundraiser to help with their gravely ill son's medical expenses, the young parents were overjoyed and filled with gratitude. But then late last month the GoFundMe page benefiting 5-month-old Noah Knickerbocker suddenly vanished, along with the collected money, leaving the boy's parents, Rachel and Tyler Knickerbocker, baffled and saddened. Noah was born in August 2014 suffering from a congenital heart defect. At two and a half weeks, the newborn had a heart surgery and is currently on a waiting list for a transplant. Family in crisis: When a relative of Tyler and Rachel Knickerbocker approached them offering to start an online fundraiser to help with their newborn son Noah's medical expenses, they were overjoyed, but they soon discovered he had another plan in mind . The Knickerbockers say instead of giving them the $6,500 raised for their son (right) on GoFundMe.com, Ken Wills (left) pocketed at least some of the money . Speaking to ABC News this week, Rachel Knickerbocker said when she went on Facebook last month, she saw that the relative who had started the crowdfunding campaign for her son, Ken Wills, posted snapshots of three checks totaling $6,500 he supposedly donated to organizations that have been helping Noah without consulting them. It didn't take Mrs Knickerbocker long to figure out where Wills, her husband’s godfather, found the money to make such generous contributions. The husband and wife, who also have a 3-year-old, had been planning to use the money raised through the GoFundMe page to rent an apartment near their son's hospital. The Knickerbockers quit their jobs in Illinois and moved from their home in Huntley into the Ronald McDonald House across the street from the Wisconsin Children’s Hospital five months ago so they could be closer to their ailing son at all times. According to Rachel Knickerbocker, she and Tyler discovered that something was wrong with their unborn son 22 weeks into her pregnancy. Ailing: Noah Jordan Knickerbocker was born in August with a congenital heart defect rendering the left side of his heart essentially useless . Champion: Ken Wills, Tyler Knickerbocker's godfather, had emerged as a champion for baby Noah, taking to social media to raise awareness of the baby's condition and ask for donations . After meeting with a fetal cardiologist, the young parents learned that their child was gravely ill, suffering from critical aortic stenosis: a condition that prevents blood flow from the heart into the aorta, leaving the left side of the heart underdeveloped and unable to pump blood into the body. While Noah was still in the womb, doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital performed a procedure called balloon dilation to open his aortic valve in utero. As 12 hours old, Noah had his second balloon dilation, and three days after the boy was welcomed into the world he was placed on a waiting list for a new heart at 1A status - most urgent - where he has remained for the past five months. After learning of Ken Wills' decision to donate the money raised for Noah to charity, the boy's parents appealed to him asking to reconsider, and according to Mrs Knickerbocker, Wills promised his godsend to send the money to them, but it never arrived. Ken Wills had been actively spreading the word about the Knickerbockers' predicament for months, even though the parents say he's never met little Noah in person. After learning of Ken Wills' decision to donate the money raised for Noah to charity, the boy's parents appealed to him asking to reconsider, but he never sent them the money intended for their son (right) Noah's parents quit their jobs and moved into the Ronald McDonald House across the street from the hospital so they could be close to him . The relative has been busy tweeting Noah's hospital photos, sending messages to celebrities asking them to retweet #HelpNoah and appealing for financial help for the newborn's family. On the now defunct GoFundMe page and on his Facebook account, Wills repeatedly stated that he would be auctioning off autographs of famous people he had collected over the years, including Keanu Reeves, Matthew McConaughey, Walter Cronkite and Lauren Bacall, to raise money for his godson's child. Among the people who took interest in Noah's story were Jenna Dewan, the wife of Channing Tatum, and actor Jamie Dornan, the star of the upcoming film adaptation of Fifty Shades of Grey. After shutting down the GoFundMe page, Wills shared on his Facebook page images of checks made out to three organizations: $2,500 to the Ronald McDonald House; $2,500 to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin and $1,000 to Boston Children’s Hospital. Good news: After spending five months on the waiting list, Noah underwent a successful transplant surgery and is now recovering . According to the Knickerbockers, Ken Wills went so far as to send them a fake thank-you note from the Ronald McDonald House for the donation. On December 30, Ken Wills posted a lengthy status update on his Facebook page indirectly addressing the Knickerbockers’ allegations. ‘Some people are upset that I donated the auction proceeds to the Ronald McDonald House charity and also to the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin two wonderful charities that have been helping Noah and his family since birth,’ he wrote. ‘Noah's parents are under a great deal of stress, which is understandable.’ The family have another GoFundMe page set up by Noah's mother, which has collected just under $6,300 since October. On Monday, the Knickerbockers finally got some good news: a heart has been found for their baby. Noah underwent a successful transplant surgery and is now recovering. ‘We just got to see Noah and give him kisses while he was on the way to his room!’ his overjoyed parents wrote Monday afternoon on a Facebook page dedicated to Noah. ‘It will still be a few hours before we can be with him...patiently waiting!’","Rachel and Tyler Knickerbocker's son Noah was born in August with a congenital heart defect rendering the left side of his heart useless .

"A man charged with killing an Auburn University football player opened fire because the athlete also was shooting a gun during a party, a defense lawyer said on Monday. Markhale Hart, 22, was defending himself when 18-year-old Jakell Mitchell was shot to death in Auburn last month, said Mark Allen Treadwell, an attorney for Hart. 'It was absolutely self-defense,' he said in an interview after a hearing in Alexander City, Alabama on Hart's probation status. 'Today was a real glimpse of what this case is going to evolve into.' Auburn freshman football player Jakell Lenard Mitchell was shot and killed  at an apartment complex near the Auburn University campus last month . Football player Mitchell, 18, was expected to contend for a starting spot next season at Auburn University . Both men fired multiple shots during an argument, said Treadwell. 'It was like the shootout at the OK Corral,' he added. Treadwell represented Hart during a hearing in which a judge revoked probation for Hart, who was released early after serving six months in jail on a burglary conviction in 2012. A probation officer's report asking the judge to revoke Hart's probation said the man acknowledged killing the player during a late-night party at an apartment complex in Auburn last December 14. Testimony during the hearing showed that Hart and Mitchell both opened fire, and that Hart was moving away from Mitchell when the fatal shot was fired, said Treadwell. Hart later tested positive for marijuana use, but toxicology results aren't yet available for Mitchell, Treadwell said. Markhale Hart of Camp Hill, Alabama, was in custody following the shooting. His lawyer said today that he acted in self-defense . Authorities had not previously disclosed allegations that Mitchell was armed and opened fire, but additional evidence could be revealed during a preliminary hearing set for Tuesday in Alabama's Lee County, where the killing occurred. The probation report said a witness told police that Mitchell got into an argument with a brother of Tyrone Ware, who isn't otherwise identified. The brother pointed a gun at Mitchell and fired several times, according to the document. Treadwell said a statement by Hart and a police investigation showed that Mitchell fired several shots with a .45-caliber handgun, and Hart fired a .40-caliber weapon. The path of the casings fired by Hart was 'streaming away' from Mitchell, he said. Investigators found the gun Mitchell was using but the other weapon remains missing, Treadwell said. Mitchell was pronounced dead at a hospital, and Hart was arrested hours later at his home in Tallapoosa County, documents show. Mitchell was killed during a party at Tiger Lodge apartments, a large complex a few miles from the Auburn campus that caters to college students. The complex - since renamed and with what promotional materials describe as added security features - is the same place where one-time Auburn football players Ed Christian and Ladarious Phillips and a third man, DeMario Pitts, were shot to death during an argument at a late-night gathering in June 2012. Desmonte Leonard was convicted of capital murder in that case and is scheduled to be sentenced January 20. Family and friends mourn the death of Jakell Mitchell during a vigil in Opelika, Alabama last month .

"Inmates at a jail for teenagers represent 48 different gangs, inspectors have discovered, fuelling a 'constant juggling' by prison officers to keep the boys apart. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution (YOI), a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said in a report. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. There were high levels of 'unpredictable and reckless' violence among the 240 boys aged 15 to 18 at Feltham Young Offenders' Institution, a significant amount of which was gang-related, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons said in a report (file photo) The number of fights and assaults had reduced since the previous HMIP inspection, but remained 'too high' with 262 incidents in the six months before the visit, including 79 assaults on staff. Some incidents were deemed 'very serious' by inspectors and involved gangs of boys attacking a single boy or member of staff in a 'very determined way'. Feltham is divided into two sites, with boys aged 15 to 18 held in site A, separated from 400 young adults aged 18 to 21 in site B. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick said: 'The welcome reduction in the number of boys in custody means that those who remain are a more concentrated mix of very troubled boys who sometimes display very challenging and violent behaviour. 'As at other YOIs for this age group, staff in Feltham A still struggled to manage this behaviour in a safe and secure way. 'Staff need more help to do this and I repeat my call for the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to initiate an independent expert review of its policies and resources for managing behaviour, reducing bullying and supporting victims across all YOIs.' Use of force had increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good. Around a quarter of boys spent 23 hours a day locked up in their cell, which critics said amounted to solitary confinement. Around a quarter of the boys - most of whom are from the London area - were placed on so-called 'keep apart' lists to tackle gang-related violence, inspectors said. The number of fights and assaults has reduced since the last HMIP inspection (file photo) The report calls for 'new thinking' about how to tackle the 'debilitating and seemingly intractable' problem of gangs, violence and anti-social behaviour among young people. The site for young adults still faces significant challenges, inspectors said, particularly a high level of staff vacancies. However, the report did flag significant progress at site B, with a drop in fights and assaults and a decrease in use of batons against inmates. During the inspection, eight foreign national prisoners were being held beyond the end of their sentence - including one who had been inside for two years after the end of his sentence. Inspectors labelled this delay 'completely unacceptable'. Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'One in four boys in Feltham prison is spending 23 hours a day locked up in his cell in conditions which amount to solitary confinement. This is unacceptable. 'Despite some improvements, violence is endemic, including 79 assaults on staff in six months. It is particularly concerning that the use of force on children has increased dramatically since the last inspection. Use of force has increased dramatically at the site for boys, inspectors found, although supervision of, and accountability for, use of force was deemed good (file photo) 'However, the problems outlined in this report are not confined to Feltham - they mirror the findings of a series of inspections conducted across the country in recent months. 'Staff are rightly praised by the inspectorate, but they are working in challenging environments where they are being asked to achieve the impossible. 'It is high time we stopped locking up children in large, violent institutions and invest instead in what works in rehabilitating children whilst keeping them safe.' A previous inspection of site B in March 2013 called for a radical overhaul of the way the jail was run. Inspectors said it was one of the most concerning visits they had conducted. Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service (Noms), said: 'As this report makes clear the challenge faced by the governor and staff at Feltham should not be underestimated. 'Many of the young people in their care have strong gang affiliations and a history of violence. 'Managing their behaviour and supporting them to change and turn their lives around is a difficult and complex task. In this context the improvements achieved over the last 12 months are particularly impressive and the governor and his staff deserve huge credit for what has been achieved. 'There is no easy answer to the challenges presented by the young men in Feltham but we are committed to working positively with our partners in the YJB and in the wider community to reduce violence, prevent victims and support effective rehabilitation.'","Feltham Young Offenders' Institution saw violent incidents that were deemed 'very serious', Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons reported .

"Standoff: Goerge Pickering, pictured, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse . A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police.

"Residents heard a loud rumbling as a 3.3-magnitude earthquake rattled the border of Connecticut and Rhode Island this morning. The U.S. Geological Survey has confirmed that the quake hit Plainfield, Killingly and Norwich in Connecticut, and Coventry and Providence in Rhode Island at 6.30am on Monday. State police in eastern Connecticut said they received several reports of homes shaking but there were no reports of damage or injuries. Residents reported loud explosions and the ground shaking. 'Wow that was scary,' one resident, Cindy from Sterling, told NBC. She said the entire house shook and 'not just a little either'. Hit: A map from the U.S. Geological Study shows where the earthquake was felt in Connecticut and Rhode Island early on Monday morning. It shows that there was light shaking near the border . Site: A locator map shows where the small earthquake hit in New England on Monday morning . A Moosup resident told the channel that the earthquake shook her house for four to five seconds. Plainfield police have sent officers throughout the town to ensure everyone is safety and are working with the fire marshal's office to update the public, the department said. It comes just days after an earthquake with a magnitude of 2.0 to 2.2 was felt in Plainfield on Thursday. Homeowners reported that it was strong enough to shake picture frames off the walls. On Friday, residents reported another loud boom in the form of a tremor that registered at .4. In total, the Plainfield area has experienced four small earthquakes since October, according to data collected by the Weston Observatory at Boston College, the Hartford Courant reported. New England is no stranger to small earthquakes, which are felt in the area roughly twice a year, and it suffers moderate damage every few decades, according to the USGS. The Weston Observatory recorded fewer than 40 earthquakes per year between 1990 and 2005. But there were 80 in 2006, 94 in 2010, 154 in 2011 and 182 in 2012. Quake: The Weston Observatory at Boston College released this graph showing that movement was felt just after 6.35am on Monday. The USGS confirmed it was a 3.3-magnitude earthquake . Struck: Providence in Rhode Island, pictured, was one of the cities that felt the rumble of the quake on Monday . John E. Ebel, the chair of the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Boston College, told the Courant that the quakes have occured naturally and are not associated with fracking. The largest known New England earthquakes shook Vermont and New Hampshire in 1638 (a magnitude 6.5 earthquake), and in 1755, when a 5.8-magnitude quake hit offshore from Cape Ann northeast of Boston, causing severe damage to the city's waterfront. More recently, a 5.6-magnitude quake caused 'moderate damage' in 1940 in central New Hampshire, the USGS said. While scientists can often determine the name of the specific fault line responsible for earthquakes in well-studied areas like California, on the east coast, it is much trickier, according to the agency. New England is laced with numerous small or deeply buried faults, and many remain undetected, making it hard to know exactly which faults are responsible for an earthquake.","U.S. Geological Survey confirmed that a quake hit Plainfield, Killingly and Norwich in Connecticut, and Coventry and Providence in Rhode Island .

"Geoff Hunt killed his three children and wife with a shotgun before turning it on himself on their quiet NSW farm in a tragic murder-suicide last September, a coroner's inquest will confirm. Hunt, 44, drove down to the dam and took his own life after shooting Kim, 41, on the entertainment deck at the back of their family home, Watch Hill, near Lockhart - 80km south of Wagga Wagga. The couple's three children - Fletcher, 10, Mia, 8, and Phoebe, 6 - were shot inside the house. The shootings likely occurred in the evening of Monday, September 8. An insider familiar with the case has told Daily Mail Australia that the facts presented to the coroner will confirm a predicted finding that Mr Hunt, for  reasons which are currently being examined, carried out the shootings. Following the memorial held for the Hunt family two weeks after the deaths, there has been a persistent rumour among Lockhart's 1000 residents and surrounding communities about whether Mrs Hunt could possibly have carried out the shootings due to the stress and trauma of her recovery from a serious brain injury after a car accident in 2012. Scroll down for video . Family secrets: The Hunts of Lockhart - intensive care nurse Kim, 41, wheat farmer, Geoff, 44, and their children (from left), Phoebe, 6, Mia, 8, and Fletcher, 10, appeared to be a normal, happy rural family, but tragedy lurked beneath the surface of their existence . What the police found:  A visitor to the farm first discovered Kim Hunt and her three children dead from shotgun wounds. Police investigators described the scene as 'shocking and disturbing'. Manhunt: The day after the discovery of the four bodies, police fanned out over 442ha property to search for the missing father and husband of the dead, Geoff Hunt, 44 . Tragic discovery: After Geoff Hunt's car was discovered parked next to a dam on the property, police uncovered his body and a firearm from the water . Final farewell: Jenny Geppert kneels beside the coffin of her sister, Kim Hunt, and by those of her nephew and nieces, Fletcher, Mia and Phoebe at the funeral at a football oval in Lockhart, 80km south of Wagga . 'There was a a lot of talk about that story going around, but it wasn't based on anything but conjecture. It appears that [the father Geoff Hunt] was responsible,' an investigator told Daily Mail Australia. 'It appears the shotgun was used a few hours before the police arrived. most likely the night before.' The horrific accident which appears to have left an indelible mark on the Hunt family almost took Kim Hunt's life in July 2012. Driving along the Lockhart Boree Creek Road, which cuts a path through thousands of hectares of prime cropping land owned by her husband's parents and brother, Allen, Kim Hunt's car flipped twice while four-year-old Phoebe was strapped in the back. Ms Hunt was taken to Wagga Base Hospital - where she had been working as a registered nurse - with a broken neck; at the time, when she was transferred to Canberra Hospital and then on to Sydney, the expectations were that she might end up an organ donor. Immense strain: A friend of Kim and Geoff Hunt (pictured) said Kim's car accident two years earlier which left her with a serious brain injury had put an immense strain upon the family . On the surface: An aerial view of the family property in Lockhart where the tragedy unfolded . Behind the smiles: Kim Hunt (pictured with husband Geoff and their three children, above left) may have been robbed of empathy and love by the serious brain injury she suffered two years prior to the  murder suicide of her family which was uncovered by police (above, right) last September . The innocents: Phoebe, 6, (left) Fletcher, 10 and Mia, 8, (right) grew up on the Hunt family wheat farm 80km from Wagga . At Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney, where Ms Hunt experienced seven weeks of post-traumatic amnesia, she had to learn to walk and talk again. When she eventually returned home, her speech was still slurred and the family needed in-house carers to help look after the children. Ms Hunt later said the fact she had nearly died had made her a better nurse, although she could not physically return to shifts as  as an emergency room nurse, and was planning a  return to work as a partt-time nursing administrator in the months leading up to the tragedy. Following the murder suicide of her sister's family, Jenny Geppert astonished friends and locals by delivering a heartfelt statement in which she made a point of not blaming brother-in-law for the deaths. The Hunt family had farmed grain on the NSW Riverina district at Lockhart for three generations before Geoff Hunt is believed to have slain his family and then took his own life . Ms Geppert said she did not believe the shootings were premeditated, saying they were a consequence of the injury suffered by her sister and the toll it had left on the family. 'A brain injury robs a person of empathy and love. Unless you live with someone who’s gone through this you can’t understand – it dulls their emotions,' Mrs Geppert said in a selfless and inspiring announcement just before the Hunt family funeral. A close family friend, Paul Routley, told Fairfax Media that while Mr Hunt had been a 'rock' following the accident, in which then four-year-old Phoebe escaped with minor injuries, he wished his friend had asked for help. 'The stress that's been put on them from the accident was just immense, absolutely immense,' he said. A sister's forgiveness: Jenny Geppert (pictured when she appeared on the Nine Network's A Farmer Wants a Wife) astonished the community with her heartfelt and forgiving statement . Kim Hunt, pictured with daughters Mia (left) and Phoebe several years ago before the catastrophic car accident which left Ms Hunt with a  brain injury . Treasured moments: Photographs of the Hunt family - parents Geoff and Kim and their children, Fletcher, Mia and Phoebe - feature on the order of service at the family's funeral last September . Unimaginable grief: Family including Jenny Geppert (kneeling beside her sister's coffin) mourn before the grim reality of having to bury their dead loved ones . 'He was super, super patient. He would help her get out of the car, he would hold her arm. You couldn't get a better bloke. The most gentle, considerate bloke ... a pillar of society.' The tragedy came to light when a family friend called in Watch Hill, reportedly after being unable to contact Mrs Hunt and the three children had failed to turn up for school. From outside, the picture perfect homestead on the hillside looked normal, set between a paddock of bright yellow canola and fields of wheat. But beyond the row of newly pruned  trees bordering the house lay a gruesome discovery. Inside the house  lay the bodies of Phoebe, Mia and Fletcher, dead from gunshot wounds. At the rear of the dwelling, Kim Hunt was lying in the open with similar wounds to those of her children. Police immediately set out to search for Geoff Hunt and on finding his vehicle parked by a dam on the property, they retrieved his body and beside it a firearm belived to be the murder weapon. The news of the seemingly inexplicable tragedy devastated the Lockhart community, which seemed at a loss to explain why the superficially happy family had imploded. Daily Mail Australia understands that a short suicide note may have been written by Mr Hunt, whose third-generation grain growing business had survived and appeared to have prospered despite almost a decade of drought. 'Everything to look forward to': The Hunts were a family with their whole lives ahead of them before patriarch Geoff is believed to have taken up a shotgun on September 10 last year . Stunned and grieving locals gathered on a football oval in Lockhart (above) last September to try and come to tersm with the loss in violent cirumstances of the Hunt family (pictured in foreground) At the funeral of her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces, Ms Geppert spoke of Mrs Hunt's zest for life and devotion to her children. 'My big sister, my idol, my friend, what an amazing person you were, kind and caring, I feel lost in this world without you,' she said. A member of the Lockhart community who asked not to be named said that while 'country people were good at supporting each other they tend to ignore the underlying problems, hence the number of suicides in the bush.' Long road: A police vehicle guards the entrance to the Hunt family property last September while detectives gather evidence at a gruesome crime scene which shocked officers and ambulance workers who attended . Forensic accountants are examining his accounts and the finances on one of the properties of the Hunt family who own thosuands of hectares along Boree Creek Road at Lockhart, and which Geoff appears to have purchased for $1.2m in 2013 with a partial mortgage to his parents, John and Lynette Hunt.

"A dig is underway on a Virginia mountainside for the remains of two young sisters who vanished as they walked home from a mall nearly 40 years ago. Federal and state authorities began searching Taylor's Mountain on Monday morning for any signs of remains belonging to 10-year-old Katherine Lyon and 12-year-old Sheila Lyon. The sisters had walked from their home in Kensington, Maryland to a mall in Wheaton for pizza and to visit the Easter exhibits on March 25, 1975. They were seen walking home to meet their 4pm curfew but never made it back and have not been seen since. Last year, authorities named Richard Allen Welch Sr. and his nephew, Lloyd Lee Welch - a child sex offender serving time in Delaware - as persons of interest in the case. Scroll down for videos . Missing: Sheila Lyon, 12, (left) and her 10-year-old sister Katherine Lyon (right) vanished on March 25, 1975, after going to a Wheaton, Maryland. Police began a new search for their remains on Monday . Search: Investigators carry out a forensic dig on a central Virginia mountain on Monday to search for remains . Welch Sr., who is in his 70s, is believed to own or have owned property on Taylor's Mountain in Bedford, which is more than 230 miles from where the girls were last seen, CBS reported. The 'forensic dig' is expected to last a couple of days, Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown said. A Federal Bureau of Investigation evidence recovery team, a Radford University forensic pathologist and state and local authorities are involved in the search. Asked if it appears human remains will be found, Brown said: 'We would hope so.' Other searches have been carried out on the mountain in recent months but Sheriff Brown said certain information and evidence had led them to a specific area. 'The investigative work of this task force... will be as tenacious as humanly possible with the target of locating these children and providing the parents closure in this nightmare that no parents should be forced to endure,' Brown said. In October, Montgomery County Police Chief Russ Hamill said that authorities believed Richard Welch was a security guard in the Wheaton area at the time of the disappearance. Person of interest: Lloyd Lee Welch, 57, (pictured left around the time the girls disappeared and right in a recent mugshot) was at the mall the day the girls vanished and was seen paying attention to them . He is still alive and authorities say they know where he lives. Welch Jr., now 57, was seen at the mall that day and witnesses said he was playing close attention to the girls, WUSA9 reported. The man, whom police describe as a former ride operator for a carnival company and a drifter who traveled the U.S. and often stayed in homeless shelters between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s. He has convictions in multiple states for raping young girls and has been locked up in Delaware since 1998 for sex offenses. Neither man has been charged in the case, but Richard Welch's wife, Patricia Jean Welch of Hyattsville, Maryland, was indicted last month on a charge of lying to a grand jury. In October, a special grand jury was enrolled by the Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney's office and is still hearing evidence in the case. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, Katherine Lyon was last seen wearing a baby beads necklace with orange beads and 'KATE' in black letters on white beads and dirty beige brushed suede wallaby type Jumping Jack shoes with dirty beige shoelaces. Where are they? Age progression photographs, created by the National Center for Missing Children, show Sheila Lyon (left), who would now be 52, and Katherine Lyon (right), who would now be 50 . Hopeful: Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown said he hoped to find the girls' remains in the search . Investigation: Police can be seen heading towards the site on the mountain on Monday. Searches have been carried out in the area before but authorities said this time they have more specific information . Sheila Lyon was last seen wearing farsighted gold wire rimmed glasses, low cut GallenKamp sneakers, size 6.5 or 7.5, with dirty white shoestrings, and knee socks. Katherine has a birthmark on the inside of her upper thigh. The organization also created age-progressed photographs of the sisters. Sheila Lyon would now be 52 and Katherine Lyon would be 50 years old. In September, the girls' parents, who still live in the same area, asked for privacy. Their father was a well-known radio presenter in the area and their elder brother Jay became a police officer after his sisters' disappearance. Bedford County Commonwealth's Attorney Randy Krantz urged any residents with information about the case to come forward. 'Our mission focus is to bring these children home if at all possible,' Krantz said.

"A woman who challenged herself to smile at every person she encountered for an entire day has described the 'hostile' reactions she received. New York City-based Rebecca Jane Stokes, 29, says that her grin 'visibly frightened' one woman and elicited crude remarks from several men. Chronicling her experience for xoJane, she wrote that smiling at passersby on the street does nothing but stamp 'vulnerable and foolish' on a woman's forehead. Scroll down for video . Grin and bear it: Rebecca Jane Stokes , a 29-year-old New Yorker, tried smiling at every stranger she encountered for an entire day . Miss Stokes began the experiment out of frustration that her usual 'blank-to-sad' expression and down-turned lips elicited comments from strangers, such as 'It can’t be THAT bad' or 'Show me that smile, baby girl!' 'If everyone wanted me to smile all the time, why don’t I try smiling, see what that does?' she thought. She decided to smile at every person she passed and made eye contact with for a whole day, and found that the endeavor was 'totally exhausting'. Miss Stokes said that groups of women appeared the most hostile, concluding that they were laughing at the 'desperate need to be liked' that her grin conveyed. Another woman who initially assumed that she and Miss Stokes knew each other appeared 'visibly frightened' after realizing that a stranger was smiling at her. About face: Miss Stokes began the experiment out of frustration that her usual 'blank-to-sad' expression and down-turned lips elicited comments from strangers, such as 'It can’t be THAT bad' And while some men responded to her smile with some innocent 'eye-flirting', one man on the subway asked if she'd ever 'sucked anyone off on the train before'. Another man even asked if she wanted to have dinner at his mother's house in Sheepshead Bay. And of course, many people simply ignored her. 'Not to be overly melodramatic but each time you lock eyes with another person and smile and they look away from you and keep going as if they haven’t see you, it's a little bit like they've denied you your humanity,' she wrote. Miss Stokes concluded: 'My main takeaway from smiling for a day was that it’s a terrible idea if you’re a girl. Conclusion: Miss Stokes said that smiling at passersby on the street does nothing but stamp 'vulnerable and foolish' on a woman's forehead . 'If a man smiles at someone on the street in passing, he’s either a letch or trying to make it clear that he’s courteous and has no immediate plans to murder you. But if you’re a woman all it does it stamp ""vulnerable and foolish"" and your forehead and leave you running a fever and in desperate need of a drink.' Miss Stokes isn't alone in her frustration with strangers telling her to smile. Shoshana Roberts, a 24-year-old aspiring actress, recently walked the streets of New York with a hidden camera and captured unsolicited comments from men such as 'Smile' and 'What's up, beautiful?' in an effort to draw attention to harassment. On the wrong track: The New York City subway was one of the locations where Miss Stokes smiled at strangers (stock photo) Shop talk: Miss Stokes continued her experiment at a New York City Rite Aid (stock photo) She was even followed by some men for several minutes, with one repeatedly asking her: 'You don't wanna talk? Because I'm ugly?' Others winked at her, whistled and made inappropriate noises. The shocking video, filmed in August, was later posted on YouTube and Facebook by Miss Roberts, who describes herself as 'a New York City-based actress with a black belt'. Alongside the clip, Miss Roberts wrote: 'This happens daily to so many people. We don't put up with harassment in school, at home, or at work, so why should we have to put up with it on the street?'","Rebecca Jane Stokes, 29, encountered hostility from other women and crude remarks from men .

"Paul Johnson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says Labour's plans to soften spending cuts would add £170billion to the national debt by 2030 . Labour's pledge to soften spending cuts in power would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories, a respected think-tank said last night. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, claimed Ed Miliband's plans would add £170billion to the national debt by 2030. This would mean greater risks for the economy and make it much harder for the UK to withstand economic shocks in future years, he wrote in The Times. The IFS also said families with children have been among the biggest losers since the Coalition came to power. It found while pensioners have been protected by tax and benefit changes since 2010, families with children 'have lost more on average than other household types'. The report questions David Cameron's promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever – and will cause alarm among Tory MPs ahead of May's poll. 'The overall effect of tax and benefit changes implemented since January 2010 has been to hit the richest hardest, to take benefits away from the poorer half of the income distribution, and largely protect those on middle and upper middle incomes,' said Mr Johnson. 'Pensioners have also largely been protected while families with children have lost out. 'Lest there be any doubt, there is a big difference between £7 billion of cuts and £33 billion of cuts. 'If you take the plans set out in the autumn statement at face value, spending cuts of more than £50 billion could be required after 2015/16.' He added: 'The problem is that another recession will strike one day. Going into a new recession with debt still high - and it is higher now than at any time since the late 1960s - could leave less room for manoeuvre. 'The sort of additional borrowing that we are able to support as we made our way through the recent period might not be as easily financed.' Conservative plans will prove tough to deliver, Mr Johnson suggested. He wrote: 'Under the autumn statement plans, Conservatives could be cutting unprotected budgets by 26% after 2015/16 or an extraordinary 41% over the period from 2010. Mr Johnson said Ed Miliband's, left, plan to soften spending cuts would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories. He also questioned David Cameron's, right, promise to lead the most family-friendly government ever . 'Even just to meet their more modest fiscal target, these budgets would need to be cut by more than 15% after 2015/16. 'Labour would need to implement cuts of just 3%.' He pointed out that Conservatives would want to achieve a surplus on the overall budget and do not want to borrow to invest. 'That means they would need to find spending cuts of around £33 billion after 2015/16,' he added. Changes made by the Coalition mean families where one parent is earning more than £50,000 a year are no longer able to claim the £20.50 a week for an eldest or only child and £13.55 a week for subsequent children. Mr Johnson said understanding the economic facts 'should be crucial to the choices people make' on polling day. Downing Street won some backing for its claim that the deficit had halved under the Coalition – but it was told it was still far bigger than planned. The IFS said annual borrowing is on course to fall from 10.2 per cent of national income in 2009-10 to 5 per cent this year – £90billion against a planned £45billion.","Institute for Fiscal Studies say Labour plans would add £170billion of debt .

"The body of an aspiring actress has been found in the water tank in the Mexico City apartment block where she lived, one year after she disappeared. Psychology graduate Carmen Yarira Noriega Esparza, 27, vanished  in February last year, and friends and family feared she had been kidnapped by human traffickers and sold as a sex slave. Ms Esparza's severely decayed body was discovered in the tank after residents in the building complained that the drinking water tasted funny.

Friends and family set up a social media campaign to try and find her, and took to the streets to post up her photographs in the hope that someone might recognise her. Pal Javier Paz, 30, said: 'She was a talented and beautiful women who dreamed of being an actress.

"Husbands take heed: A New York man became an overnight multi-millionaire just for listening to his wife. If it wasn't for the 80-year-old Harold Diamond's wife Carol, 74, he wouldn't have stopped at a gas station and bought the winning ticket for the $346million Mega Million jackpot. The retired school principal was announced Monday as the sole winner of the jackpot drawn November 4 - the biggest prize in New York Lottery history. 'I always listen to what she says,' he told the crowd as he accepted his check today. Scroll down for video . Always listen to your wife: Harold Diamond (right) was named the sole winner of November 4 Mega Millions jackpot. He says he bought the ticket out of boredom, when his wife asked him to stop at a gas station to wait out a storm . One check: Diamond has decided to take his winnings in a $197million lump sum payment, which comes out to about $130million after taxes . Diamond said he bought the ticket at a highway service center where he had stopped at his wife's insistence to wait out a storm on Election Day. As they ate lunch at the Valero on Route 302 in Middletown, Diamond noticed the flashing Mega Millions sign and decided to spend $10 for 10 sets of Quick Pick numbers. 'I put the ticket in my wallet and forgot about it,' Diamond said in a statement released by New York Lottery. 'I went to play golf the next day and the guys in the clubhouse were talking about the jackpot-winning ticket someone bought at a Valero on Route 302, and I thought, wait a minute — I bought a ticket there last night!' Good decision: It was at this gas station in Middleton, New York that the couple stopped on Election Day and bought their winning tickets . Diamond said he dashed home, checked his tickets and found he had the winner. 'I was in a dither, a real daze,' said Diamond, who retired as principal of George L. Cook Elementary School in Monticello in 1995. The New York Lottery's Yolanda Vega presented a giant ceremonial check to Diamond on Monday. He has chosen to take the cash in a lump sum payment of $197million, which comes to about $130 million after taxes. Diamond says his plans for the money include helping family and 'giving back to the local community.' He says they'll be thinking about it more on their upcoming vacation to Hawaii, for their 55th anniversary. 'I simply can’t envision that kind of money,' Diamond said. 'It’s very hard to fathom. We feel very blessed.' He said he owes his good fortune to his wife Carol, a retired Goshen High School math teacher.","Harold Diamond, 80, says he bought his winning ticket at a gas station his wife insisted they stop at to wait out a storm .

"A husband-to-be has spoken for the first time of the moment his beloved fiancée was shot dead - as she chatted to him on the phone. Rod Hernandez, 58, from Salt Lake City, Utah, was just weeks away from tying the knot with Tanya Nikitina in 2010 when she was gunned down by her former mother-in-law. Tanya, 34, who's real name is Tetyana, was talking to Rod while sitting in the school car park where she worked as a teacher when her life was horrifically cut short. Tragic end: Rod Hernandez, right, had been due to marry Tanya Nikitina, left, but just weeks before their big day, she was shot dead her her former mother-in-law . Jailed: Mary was sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years after pleading guilty to murder . She was shot by Mary Nance Hanson because the 71-year-old believed her son Dale Jankowski - Tanya's ex-husband - should have custody of the couple's two children. Rod heard the attack as he spoke to Tanya on the phone and said his fiancée's dying moments will haunt him forever. He recalled: 'She was telling me how much she loved me when suddenly I heard her scream and there was a loud bang. 'I could still hear her engine revving and the radio playing. I thought she'd had an accident. 'The school was only a short drive away, so I jumped in my car. I stayed on the phone the whole way there, screaming her name trying to wake her up.' On arriving at the school in Salt Lake, Rod was shocked to discover Tanya has been killed by her former mother-in-law. Murderer: Mary Nance Hanson, 71, left, gunned down her former daughter-in-law over the custody of her grandchildren after Tanya, pictured right, and her son Dale, divorced . After being arrested, Mary pleaded guilty to first degree murder. Rod said: 'I couldn't get my head around it. Why on earth would Mary want to kill Tanya? She'd done nothing wrong. Now the children are left without a mother and I've lost my beloved fiancée. 'She was the woman of my dreams.' Rod had met Tanya in 2008, three years after her divorce from Dale. He said her relationship with her ex-husband and his family was often under strain due to child care arrangements for Stefan, then seven, and Sasha, five. Rod said: 'Dale lived with his mother, and the kids would go and stay with them at weekends. But there was some tension between Tanya and Dale and Mary.' He added that Tanya began receiving threatening text messages from her former mother-in-law, claiming she didn't deserve to have custody of the two children. 'I hated seeing Tanya upset, so I asked her if she wanted to bring the wedding forward, to give her something to look forward to,' he said. Crime scene: The car park where Tanya was shot dead by Mary as she spoke to Rod on the phone . Haunted: Rod recalls of his fiancee's last moments 'she was telling me how much she loved me when suddenly I heard her scream and there was a loud bang' The couple planned to tie the knot in a Las Vegas ceremony in February 2010. But on January 29, two weeks before the big day, Tanya was brutally executed. Mary had hidden in the car park armed with a 38-caliber revolver waiting for Tanya to leave school and get into her car. She first fired through the window, then reloaded the gun, opened the car door and fired again. A medical examiner would later confirm the cause of death as four gunshot wounds to the head . Mary showed little remorse when she appeared to be sentenced for the crime in August 2010 but did ask the judge if she could to receive a death sentence. When he explained it didn't meet all the criteria to be considered a death penalty case, the grandmother replied: 'Well, I guess I didn't do a good enough job then.' 'It was such a twisted thing to say,' Rod said. 'Woman of my dreams': Rod pictured with Tanya, said he can't believe the love of his life has been taken away . Wedding bells: The couple had been due to marry in Vegas . Loss: Tanya had two children with her first husband, Dale, who will now grow up without their mother . Mary was sentenced to life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years. But Rod said the punishment gave him little comfort. 'No amount of time in prison is going to bring Tanya back. Hearing my fiancée's tragic end on the phone, still haunts me,' he said. 'I still can't believe she's gone. She was my world and Mary stole everything from me when she killed her.'

"Thousands of Japanese women dressed up on Monday in dazzling kimonos for the country’s annual Coming of Age Day – with some planning their look a year in advance. The Coming of Age is an annual holiday, held on the second Monday of January, that marks teenagers turning 20 and so reaching official adulthood in the country. Ceremonies are held nationwide at local town halls and offices, with many attending parties afterwards with family and friends. The age of 20 is significant in Japan because that’s the age at which it becomes legal to drink, smoke and vote, so the day is seen as a threshold between youth and becoming a responsible adult. Women have been known to book appointments a year in advance to have their hair and make-up done and to have a kimono fitted – a notoriously fiddly task. Beauty parlours stay open all night in order to handle the rush for styling. While most women wear kimonos, men tend to wear business suits. The Coming of Age tradition - a celebration for those who turned 20 in the past year - dates back to 714 when a young prince kitted himself out in new robes and had a fresh haircut to celebrate leaving his teen years behind. The number of people who celebrated their coming of age was 1.26 million this year, an increase of 50,000 from 2014. Scroll down for video .

"French armed officers have revealed that they cut down the jihadi gunman who killed four hostages at a Paris supermarket in a hail of over 40 bullets. The special forces team said they worked 50 straight hours before they launched their assault on Friday, fatigue diminished by the thought of avenging their colleague Ahmed Merabet. He was killed in cold blood two days earlier during an attack by brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Eye-witness footage of the execution caused revulsion around the world. Scroll down for video . French armed officers have revealed that they cut down the jihadi gunman who killed four hostages at a Paris supermarket in a hail of over 40 bullets . Amedy Coulibaly killed four at a Paris deli on Friday and was killed by police commandos in a hail of bullets . ‘Sincerely, one of the things that most motivated us was that video of the odious assassination of our colleague Ahmed Merabet outside Charlie. We all had that image in our heads,’ Jean-Pierre, one of the members of the Raid police team that brought the deli siege to an end, told Le Parisien, according to the Daily Telegraph. He said that the stand-off between the police and the Kouachi brothers at a warehouse in Dammartin-en-Goele acted like a shot of adrenalin, despite having been on duty for over two days. He added: ‘When that attack begun, we were suddenly not tired anymore.’ Another member of the assault team, named as Stan, revealed that they had snipers training their sights on the supermarket, in the Porte de Vincennes area of the city, but couldn’t get a clean shot because there were advertising posters in the windows. A third member of the team, named as Marc by the French newspaper, told how deli gunman Amedy Coulibaly was met with a wall of bullets when he charged at them. The special forces team who ended the deli siege said they worked 50 straight hours before they launched their assault on Friday, fatigue diminished by the thought of avenging their colleague Ahmed Merabet (pictured) The team placed explosives at the entrance to blast their way in, as Coulibaly had placed shopping trolleys across it. But in the end the fanatic attacked them first. He fired his Kalachnikov at the police team, retreated back in to the supermarket, then came at them again. Police had wanted to take him alive, but it was clear that this was a suicide mission for Coulibaly. Marc said: ‘In front of us we had a man, ultra precise, well trained, who knew how to work his AK47. Then he threw himself at us.’ He described the counter-attack by the police as being ‘like a bomb going off’. The description of the siege by members of the special forces team came as pictures emerged of shoppers hiding in a freezer during the stand-off. Terror: This image, taken by one of the hostages themselves, shows the scene inside a freezer where shoppers feared for their lives as an Islamist gunman took control of a kosher deli in Paris. One woman is seen clutching a baby as they huddle together for warmth . Final words: Hostages quietly huddled around cardboard boxes, some texting goodbye messages to family they feared they would never see again. One of the trapped hostages even managed to joke: 'We’ll open a bottle of wine. Here, there are plenty' Freedom: Some of those pictured inside the freezer later walked to safety outside the supermarket, escorted by armed French police . One woman is seen cradling her child, while in another image a hostage sends a text message to a loved one. Coulibaly had killed four people as he entered the supermarket. Hearing shots, shoppers at the back of the store fled downstairs to the storeroom where they huddled together in temperatures of -3C (27F). Fearing they would not escape alive, they made what they believed would be their last calls to family to tell them they loved them. One man, known only as Ilan, was with his young son and quickly removed his jacket and wrapped him in it as they cowered in freezer for nearly five hours. The pictures from inside the storeroom were made public as the hostages came forward to give dramatic accounts of their ordeal on Friday. Stories of incredible bravery and heroism emerged, including that of 22 year-old store worker Yohan Cohen, who was executed by Coulibaly when he tried to grab the fanatic’s gun, and Lassana Bathily who ushered the shoppers to the freezer, undoubtedly saving their lives. Mr Bathily, a Muslim of Malian descent, guided the terrified group of men, women and at least two young children, to the walk-in freezer in the basement. He said: ‘I turned off the lights and the fridge. I closed the door and told them to keep quiet.’ Mr Bathily then slipped away using a goods lift and was able to provide police with valuable information about what has happening inside the store. Extremist: Amedy Coulibaly in a video released after his death in the standoff . Amedy Coulibaly began his terror rampage a day earlier than previously thought by shooting a jogger and planting a car bomb, it emerged yesterday. The killer, who was shot dead by police after murdering four hostages in a Jewish shop on Friday, was thought to have struck first when he killed an unarmed policewoman last Thursday. But now Paris prosecutors think he was responsible for seriously injuring a jogger in a suburb of the capital on January 7, the same day gunmen killed 12 during the Charlie Hebdo massacre. A ‘martyrdom video’ of the fanatic, apparently filmed midway through the wave of terror attacks, appeared online yesterday. In it he urges Western Muslims to wage war against ‘enemies of Islam’. The footage claims Coulibaly planted a bomb under a car on a Paris street, seemingly referring to an explosion on Wednesday night that authorities had not linked to the terror attacks. Prosecutors said that tests on shell cases from the jogger shooting linked them to the weapon used at the kosher supermarket two days later. The runner, who was attacked in the southwestern suburb of Fontenay-aux-Roses, has not been named but was left seriously wounded. In the video, Coulibaly is shown sitting beside an AK47 and under an Islamic State flag as he declares that the terrorists’ actions were ‘completely legitimate’. ‘You cannot attack us and expect nothing in return,’ he says. The slickly made film, which has been verified by intelligence experts, also shows the 32-year-old describing how he worked alongside the brothers who attacked Charlie Hebdo. Separately, Coulibaly’s mother and sisters have condemned the atrocities and offered their ‘sincere condolences’ to the families of those killed.

"It's undoubtedly the hottest ticket in town and only a selection of fashion's finest VIP guests, including Anna Wintour, David Gandy and Jourdan Dunn, were lucky enough to grace the front row of today's Burberry Prorsum menswear AW15 show. Part of London Collection's: Men, the show, which took place at  Kensington Gardens, was inspired by all things bohemian and was Christopher Bailey's most wearable menswear range to date. The Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer, who champions budding musicians, called on British singer-songwriter Clare Maguire to perform four live songs, including one written specifically for the collection to kick off proceedings. Christopher Bailey sent his male models down a tiled runway in a classically Bohemian show - think paisley prints, shearling coats and frinched ponchos . The 'Clasically Bohemian' show was a story of vibrant outwear, classic tailoring and, of course, an updated spin on the trench coat and beloved Burberry poncho. The trench is muted in natural hues for AW15 and comes in ivy green, taupe, purple and the perfect shade of yellow. There were shearling coats, too, in navy, as well as paisley shirts aplenty, sometimes worn with animal print. Elsewhere there was suede, tassled scarves, jumbo cord and even shirts and bags with smatterings of sequins. The poncho comes fringed and leopard is introduced for the upcoming colder months - even splashed over bags (keep your eyes peeled for the new The Carryall tote). The stellar collection was watched from the front row by Vogue cover girl Jourdan Dunn, Anna Wintour, Natalie Massenet, Nick Grimshaw, David Gandy and Tinie Tempah.

"More than four decades after an explosion near Chi Chi in Vietnam left Patrick Olive with permanent nerve damage he has been told he is to receive a Purple Heart. Olive, 66, was drafted into the army in 1968 and after basic training in South Carolina was sent to Vietnam as part of the 25th Infantry Division, which saw heavy fighting in Saigon. At just 21, Olive suffered damage to his right leg in an explosion, an injury he is finally receiving recognition for. More than four decades after an explosion near Chi Chi in Vietnam left Patrick Olive, pictured above with his wife Evelyn, with permanent nerve damage he has been told he is to receive a Purple Heart . The Florida resident was notified of his award in a letter from the Department of Army last month, which noted that its records 'have now been corrected'. According to Olive's citation for valor, in November 1968, with complete disregard for his own safety' the solider exposed himself to heavy fire to retrieve 'desperately needed' ammunition which he then supplied to his comrades. Then, according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel, in April 1969, while in a difficult defensive position, Olive again 'distinguished himself by heroic actions'. Olive volunteered to brave heavy fire to resupply his section on the perimeter. After being wounded, Olive spent months in hospitals in Vietnam, Japan, Washington and then finally in San Juan, Puerton Rico, at the Veterans Affairs Facility closet to his home in St Thomas. Olive will receive a Purple Heart along with the Army Commendation Medal with a V for valor, a Good Conduct medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, with four bronze service stars, and his expert badge as a rifleman . Olive's met his wife Evelyn, a hospital dietitian, when he was being treated for his injuries. The pair kept in touch after his release and connected a year later. They have now been married for 43 years. She said: 'When he gets that medal it will be mission accomplished. 'We will all be proud. I will be proud of my hero.' Vietnam was not a popular war and as a result when Olive returned home, he didn't speak about the atrocities he saw and endured there. Neither did he pursue the Purple Heart or other service medals he was entitled to. Olive, who spent 30-years chasing drug smugglers in the Caribbean as a U.S. Customs Service agent after the war, said: 'War was a nightmare. Olive suffered nerve damage to his leg age 21, during an explosion while bravely retrieving ammunition for his comrades while under heavy fire; he 'distinguished himself by heroic actions' again a year later . 'It was hell. It's nothing you like to talk about.' After years in St. Thomas Olive moved to Miami in the early 1980s, where he and Evelyn had a son, Francisco. He now works for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The couple then moved to Plantation and Olive retired in 2002. He wrote to the army about his award last summer, at his wife's urging. He told the newspaper: 'All veterans deserve to be honored for the sacrifices they and their families gave for this country,' Evelyn Olive said. 'The medal would be an acknowledgment of what he went through. So I said let's go for it.' In addition to the Purple Heart, Olive will also receive the Army Commendation Medal with a V for valor, a Good Conduct medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, with four bronze service stars, and his expert badge as a rifleman.","Florida resident Patrick Olive was drafted into the Vietnam war in 1968 .

"Kristina Pimenova - the controversial nine-year-old Russian model dubbed 'the most beautiful girl in the world'- has a doppelgänger, it has emerged. Elizabeth Hiley, ten, based in Montreal, Canada, bears more than a striking resemblance to young supermodel Kristina, and her mother now has high hopes that Elizabeth can follow in Kristina's fashion footsteps. 'The likeness between Kristina and my daughter is uncanny,' Anne-Marie Ashcroft, 41, tells Daily Mail Online. 'Before I came across Kristina, I was reluctant to allow Elizabeth to start at such a young age. Now I realize that the time for her is right.' Scroll down for video . Double vision: Elizabeth Hiley, ten, based in Montreal, Canada, (left) bears more than a striking resemblance to nine-year-old child supermodel Kristina Pimenova, based in Moscow, Russia (right) Family: Elizabeth's mother Anne-Marie Ashcroft, 41, pictured (center) with Elizabeth (left) and her 14-year-old son David (right), feels this could be the start of a promising modeling career for her daughter . Comparing Elizabeth to Kristina, who has covered Vogue Bambini and modeled for Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana and Armani, Ms Ashcroft says she is optimistic for her daughter's career as a model. 'Logic dictates that Elizabeth could in all likelihood achieve a similar - or dare I say better - standing as a child model,' she theorizes. Ms Ashcroft first came across Kristina, based in Moscow, after reading about her two months ago on Daily Mail Online. Kristina's story triggered widespread outrage over her young age, with critics slamming the girl's mother Glikeriya Pimenova for posting scantily-clad images of her daughter to Instagram; many of which garnered sick comments referring to Kristina as a 'babe' and praising her 'long legs.' Beauty: Comparing her daughter (pictured) to Kristina, Ms Ashcroft says, 'Logic dictates that Elizabeth could in all likelihood achieve a similar - or dare I say better - standing as a child model' Uncanny: Elizabeth (left) posing as Kristina - the controversial Russian child dubbed 'the most beautiful girl in the world' (right) Body double: Elizabeth (left), re-creating Kristina's pose (right), which sparked outrage after it was posted by her mother on Instagram, inviting comments about Kristina being a 'babe' and praising her 'long legs' Goals: Elizabeth (left) hopes to follow in the footsteps of Kristina (right), who has covered Vogue Bambini and modeled for Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana and Armani, among others . Still, it wasn't the  backlash over Kristina's photos that piqued Ms Ashcroft's interest, it was Kristina's astounding likeness to her daughter Elizabeth. 'I was shell-shocked,' she recalls, adding that she immediately sent the article around to friends and family, all of whom responded with observations along the lines of: 'Lovely photos of Elizabeth.' Ms Ashcroft explains: 'When I clarified that the photos were not of Elizabeth but of another little girl, most were in disbelief. 'And when I showed Elizabeth a picture of Kristina, she asked, “Mommy when did you take that photo of me, I don’t remember that shirt?”' Ms Ashcroft, who also has a 14-year-old son, David, claims it was on this day that she realized, 'I could no longer come between Elizabeth’s dreams of becoming a model.' She promptly set up a shoot with photographer Fiona du Jardin, in which Elizabeth copied some of Kristina's poses to demonstrate their 'twin-like' similarities. Momagers: Elizabeth's mother Ms Ashcroft (left) and Kristina's mother Glikeriya Pimenova (right), both of whom are helping their daughters realize their modeling dreams . Gene pool: Ms Ashcroft (left) is a full-time mother and former real estate broker, while Mrs Pimenova (right) is also a full-time mother and a former model . More parallels: Elizabeth is a talented hip-hop dancer (left) and Kristina is a competitive gymnast (right) Elizabeth was quickly snapped up by two agencies who were sent the photos; Folio, an adults-only agency based in Montreal and Kids London, which will represent Elizabeth in Europe over the school holidays. Helpfully, Elizabeth is a citizen of both Canada and the UK. Folio agent Catherine Marsland, who made an exception when she signed up the agency's only child model, states: 'Elizabeth is an exceptionally beautiful little girl who I believe has great potential in the modeling industry. 'The resemblance between Elizabeth and Kristina is absolutely remarkable and we see a promising future for her.' Ms Ashcroft is well-aware that many see Kristina as too young and, worse, too sexualized by her mother, but she disagrees with these sentiments. 'I do not believe that many of the accusations made against Kristina’s mother are fair,' she remarks. 'I believe that fundamentally, she has her daughter’s best interests at heart.' She adds: 'Sadly, we live in a world where we as parents must be vigilant in protecting the safety of our children from those wishing to exploit or seek to harm them. 'As Elizabeth’s Mother, I will seek to find a safe and healthy balance vis-a-vis Elizabeth’s public exposure in her pursuit of a career in modeling. In demand: Elizabeth (pictured) has been snapped up by two agencies, Folio, an adults-only agency based in Montreal and Kids London, which will represent Elizabeth in Europe over the school holidays . Ambitions: Elizabeth has been expressing an interest in modelling since the age of eight, but when she grows up, she wants to be an anesthetist doctor . In the interests of promoting her daughter's extraordinary beauty, Ms Ashcroft has just started a fan page for Elizabeth on Facebook. 'Inevitably, there is a degree of public exposure for child models, actors and the like', she says. Indeed, a large part of her lookalike Kristina's rising worldwide fame is thanks to her social media presence. Both her Facebook page - which boasts nearly three million followers - and her Instagram account are manned by Kristina's mother. Speaking to Daily Mail Online in December in defense of these social media accounts, Mrs Pimenova, 39, said: . 'You must think like a pedophile in order to see something sexual in [Kristina's] pictures, so it is time for you to see a doctor. 'In fact I must say she does not especially like it when I am photographing her, so I do it quickly and when she doesn't notice. I am certain in my mind all her photographs are absolutely innocent.' Elizabeth, on the other hand, is far from camera-shy and has been expressing an interest in modelling since the age of eight. 'Elizabeth is mature for her age and is a determined girl,' Ms Ashcroft explains. 'I have given careful consideration to my decision to allow her to pursue her dream of becoming a model.' She adds: 'I do not believe that there is a “magical” age when suddenly this becomes right. I think quite simply that one must look at what’s best for the individual child.' Porcelain features: Elizabeth (pictured), whose parents divorced in 2013 and whose father lives near London, attends a small private school in Canada . Gifted: The rising star is fluent in both French and English, excels in piano and creative writing, and her mother insists her that her education remains 'paramount' Elizabeth, whose parents  divorced in 2013 and whose father lives just outside of London, attends a small private school in Canada. 'My daughter is a keen student and her academics are important to her,' Ms Ashcroft says. The rising child star is fluent in both French and English, excels in piano and creative writing, and wants to be an anesthetist doctor one day. She, just like Kristina, is also a keen dancer. Having trained in classical ballet from the ages of four to seven, Elizabeth is now a student at 8 Count, Canada’s premier hip-hop dance school, and was recently selected during try-outs for their advanced class. Asked whether she would allow Elizabeth to leave school early in pursuit of full-time modeling, Ms Ashcroft replies: 'Elizabeth will be encouraged to complete her university, even if on a part-time basis. 'Her education is paramount. I believe that with the right support, Elizabeth can have it all.' Ms Ashcroft, who is willing to make 'special exceptions' for Elizabeth missing school to take up modeling jobs, is herself clearly an ambitious force to be reckoned with. 'I was forced to abandon my demanding and budding career as a real estate broker at Sutton (formerly with Sotheby's)  to return to being a full-time mother when the children’s father left Canada in early 2012 to live in the UK,' she explains. Grounded: Ms Ashcroft remarks, 'What I love about Elizabeth is that she always says, “Mommy, looks aren’t everything”. Her heart and mind are in the right place' Ms Ashcroft's ex-husband is a European sales director for a major American I.T. Corporation, and her family have properties in the U.K., Portugal and Spain. Elizabeth's mother has since remarried and hopes to soon revisit her own career, either in high-level corporate sales or by starting her own business. 'As a teenager, I thought about becoming a model,' the pretty mother says. 'However, with the exception of a runway stint for a Canadian swimsuit store, it was not something that I pursued.' As for Elizabeth, who is described by Ms Ashcroft as being 'a kind, caring and sociable little girl', her favorite model is Romeo Beckham, the 12-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham. 'Elizabeth has the sweetest crush on Romeo Beckham and thinks that he is “very handsome”,' she says. 'That said, what I love about Elizabeth is that she always says, “Mommy, looks aren’t everything”. Her heart and mind are in the right place.'","Elizabeth Hiley, ten,  based in Canada, looks just like Kristina Pimenova, nine, from Russia,  dubbed 'the most beautiful girl in the world'

The trailer introduces two mothers who have chosen to pursue this ultimate style of natural birth, with one being carried out into the woods during labor, and another choosing to go through the entire process while camped out in a makeshift cabin in rural Alaska. And while the show has come under fire from medical experts who claim it will start a 'dangerous trend' that will see more mothers attempting to give birth without the help of doctors or midwives, its stars insist their choice of birthing method is actually one of the safest - and most enjoyable. Scroll down for video . Natural birth: Lifetime's new reality series Born in the Wild follows a group of pregnant women who abandon traditional hospital births in favor of having their babies out in the middle of nowhere . Little miracle: Producers insisted that no first time mothers were allowed to take part in the show . 'The main problem I had with my first birth is my choices weren’t respected,' mother-of-three Audrey Bird, 25, whose six-month-old daughter Piper was born in front of the cameras outside of the family home in rural Alaska, told the New York Post. 'I said, ""I don’t want IV lines, I want to be able to move, be able to walk, I don’t want to be strapped down to the bed or tied to a monitor."" 'The nurses at that time... were very argumentative and as soon as I proved any resistance to what they wanted to do, they treated me disrespectfully and they introduced a lot of fear to me that wasn’t necessary.' Audrey, whose husband Peter fully supported her decision to pursue a totally natural birth, is actually a trained midwife and gave birth to her second child while at home, without the help of any other doctors or nurses. Isolated: Audrey Bird, from Alaska, opted to give birth to her third child Piper in a makeshift cabin built by her husband . Trained professional: The 25-year-old is a midwife and therefore chose not to have any other doctors or nurses present at the birth . Into the wild: The family asked a nearby medevac team, located 30 minutes away from their home, to be on standby in case of an emergency . She admits that giving birth out in the wild, without the safety of a totally-sterile environment, didn't worry her because she completely 'trusted her body', her husband and her training to ensure her baby would be born without any complications. Lifetime producers offered the Birds the opportunity to have a medical professional on-hand in case of any medical emergencies, but Audrey declined, opting instead to have a ask a medevac team located 30 minutes away from their home to be on standby should anything go wrong. 'I’ve attended many births, dealt with many complications. We were very prepared, we didn’t anticipate anything going wrong that we couldn’t handle,' she added. While announcing the launch of the series back in June, Lifetime's senior VP Eli Lehrer told Entertainment Weekly that executives working on the show were taking 'extreme precautions to make sure the mothers and babies were safe' throughout the filming process. Mother and child: Audrey and her husband Peter welcomed a healthy baby girl . Trust: The mother-of-three was completely confident in 'her body and her husband' He added: 'Our presence at these births is going to make them far safer than if they were doing it on their own.' But the series has already come under fire from critics who insist that Born in the Wild will inspire many more pregnant women to follow in the footsteps of its stars - but without the help and support of a professional production team. 'I understand everybody wants to believe we over-medicalize pregnancy and that it's a natural process,' maternal-fetal specialist Ron Jaekle told Entertainment Weekly. 'But it's a natural process that historically has caused an extraordinary loss of life.'","Lifetime's Born in the Wild follows women who choose to have their babies out in the middle of nowhere, miles away from the nearest hospital .

"Lena Dunham's HBO series Girls has become a huge hit for its portrayal of New York City millenials. But, a new infographic shows, the numbers don't quite add up when it comes to Hannah, Marnie, Jessa and Shoshanna's financials. The research, by Digit.co, finds that the average pre-tax income for the characters' respective jobs wouldn't always cover living expenses and typical rent for the apartments in which they live. Shoshanna would be the most deeply in debt - largely because she is a student at NYU for the first three seasons. Tuition fees of $3,847.50 per month, share of an apartment in Manhattan's trendy Nolita ($1,275 per month) and living expenses of $1,327.04 per month, add up to a hefty $6,449.54. Scroll down for video . Grumpy at Cafe Grumpy: In season one, Hannah (right) is forced to take a barista job working for Ray (left) after her parents cut her off - but the wages barely cover her rent . Afloat: Jessa (left) and Hannah (right) pictured in Hannah's apartment in a still from season three. By this point, Hannah is working as a copywriter for GQ and can more than afford her $1,450-per-month share of rent . While we can assume that Shoshanna's parents pick up that tab, the same is not true of Hannah, who struggled in season one when her parents cut her off. Though she managed to find a job in Cafe Grumpy, her monthly income of $1,512 barely covers her share of rent on the Greenpoint, Brooklyn, apartment she shares with Marnie ($1,450), let alone living expenses of $1,509.18 each month. This adds up to a monthly loss of $1,447.18. Hannah's finances look healthier by season two thanks to her budding career as a writer. Digit.co calculates that she would have been earning $35,000 a year ($2,916.67 per month), narrowing her loss to $42.51 per month. And by season three, her job as a copywriter for GQ (J. Crew's Jenna Lyons famously made a cameo as her boss) meant that she was well and truly in the black, making $2,436.65 a month after paying her rent and living expenses. At least until she quits. Manhattan lifestyle: Shoshanna, a student at NYU in seasons one, two and three, spends $1,275 per month on her share of a Nolita apartment - luckily her parents pick up the tab for rent, tuition and living expenses . Falling apart: Jessa's finances are the healthiest of all the Girls until she enters rehab. She would still be contributing $1,450 a month rent in Greenpoint, but without an income, plus living expenses, she would be losing $2,959.18 per month . In contrast, Marnie's finances worsen as the seasons progress. The art gallery assistant and aspiring singer is found to be making a small loss in season one of just $48.60 per month, but by season two (in which she moves in with Shoshanna and must work as a nightclub hostess) this escalates to a monthly loss of $268.71. Her situation doesn't even improve when she finds a new gallery job - it only pays $34,927 per year ($2,910.58 per month) - but by this time she is renting an apartment in Manhattan, costing her $2,000 per month, pushing up her monthly loss to $1,171.05. For such a troubled character, Jessa manages to keep herself afloat for more of the first three seasons than any of the other characters. Her job as a nanny in season one brings in $673 per week, while her share of Shoshanna's apartment costs just $1,275 per month. Things fall apart in season two when she enters rehab though. Digit.co calculates that she would be contributing $1,450 a month rent in Greenpoint, but without an income, plus living expenses, she would be losing $2,959.18 per month. The cost of rehab is picked up by her grandmother. In debt: Marnie finds a new job as a gallery assistant in season three, but it only pays $34,927 per year - and by this time she is renting a $2,000-per-month apartment in Manhattan, pushing up her monthly loss to $1,171.05 . Digit.co calculated the figures in the infographic by using real-world averages and online postings. 'For as close a comparison as possible, we used average residential area rent as a basis,' the site explains. 'In NYC, rent can exhaust roughly 49per cent of a person's living expenses. We did the math from there, selecting one profession (pre-tax) and apartment per season for each character.' How each character will fare in season four remains to be seen. Last night's premier saw Hannah depart for Iowa and Shoshanna graduate from NYU. Marnie's attempts at a singing career are poorly received by diners at a (jazz-free) jazz brunch and Jessa is left crushed when her role as carer to Beadie is snatched away after attempting to help the elderly photographer commit suicide. Fact meets fiction: The figures in the infographic were calculated using real-world averages and online postings. They show that Jessa would have been the only character actually making money in season one . Broke: By season two, all of the Girls girls would be deeply in debt by real world standards, though Hannah's monthly loss is down to just $42.51 . Ups and downs: Season three sees Hannah get a well-paid job as a GQ copywriter, but Marnie falls deeper into the red after moving in to a $2,000-a-month apartment .","A new infographic calculates how much each character might earn and spend on rent and living expenses .

"Among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism, the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism . Couples may be allowed to get married naked in naturist weddings under a rethink of marriage law ordered by ministers. The prospect of brides walking down the aisle of Waitrose rather than one in a church will also be on the cards in a full-scale inquiry into how and where weddings should be staged. The move to reform wedding law follows David Cameron’s introduction of same-sex marriage. The 2013 legislation that allowed gay weddings also said the Government would examine changes to the way marriages are solemnised. As a result, the wedding law review, ordered by ministers to start this week, will look at sweeping reforms which could allow weddings in the open air or in people’s homes and gardens. It will explore whether weddings may be conducted by non-religious organisations from humanists to political pressure groups. A paper published yesterday by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed that among groups that have expressed an interest in changing the wedding laws is British Naturism, the organisation that represent naturists and campaigns to combat prejudice against outdoor nudism. It said naturists could qualify to conduct weddings if the rules were changed. And, the paper said, there was concern that liberalising wedding law could bring in commercial competition, with rival private wedding companies vying to attract the custom of brides and grooms, and even supermarkets might be turned into venues for couples to take their vows. That would mean Tesco could open wedding parlours alongside its pharmacies and banks, and the Co-op could expand its funeral services into an all-round ‘match and despatch’ operation. Independent marriage support groups said it was important that people take their weddings seriously wherever they are held. Harry Benson of the Marriage Foundation, which campaigns to promote marriage, said: ‘I have no objection to people getting married jumping out of an aeroplane or on a beach as long as they mean it and the marriage is properly registered. A paper published yesterday by Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (above) said there was concern that liberalising wedding law could bring in commercial competition, with rival private wedding companies vying to attract the custom of brides and grooms . ‘But some of these ideas are just silly. I hope there will be guidance for the best man at a nude wedding on where to keep the ring.’ At the moment wedding law allows couples to have a traditional wedding in church, under rules set by the Church of England and other churches with the right to conduct the ceremonies, or a civil wedding in a register office or ‘approved premises’. Approved premises, which include stately homes, hotels and sports ground entertainment suites, have proved highly popular since they were introduced in the 1990s. Only Jews and Quakers are allowed to marry in their own homes, under laws from 1753 which released them from the requirement to be married by the Church of England. Tony Blair’s government tried to introduce a law to allow people to get married anywhere they liked in 2000, but dropped the idea in the face of the complications involved. The 2013 Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act said ministers would review whether ‘non-religious belief organisations’, like humanists, should also be able to conduct weddings. The consultation response from the Ministry of Justice yesterday said that humanists were anxious to hold weddings in the open air or at places couples find ‘meaningful’, which could mean a preferred holiday beach, the place where they met, a place where a parent’s ashes were scattered, or even a football pitch. But it said that there was a risk that criminal gangs running sham or forced marriages would move in, and that ‘inappropriate’ organisations could win the right to run marriages. ‘There was a risk that any group, including those with a cult following, could potentially qualify if they could show their purpose as the advancement of beliefs and the ethics associated with those beliefs, or could successfully have it determined that they were being discriminated against if excluded from conducting legal ceremonies,’ the paper said. It added: ‘The groups identified as a risk included political organisations, Jedi Knights, Hell’s Angels, radicalised groups and criminal gangs involved in forced marriage.’ One critic of reform, it said, feared that pressure groups would try to conduct marriages to raise funds for their cause. The Ministry of Justice paper said that the Government law reform advisers, the Law Commission, will be asked to ‘begin as soon as possible a broader review of the law concerning marriage ceremonies. ‘An independent review should be able to examine all the issues arising from the consultation alongside all other relevant matters. The Government will start to work with the Commission in January to consider the scope of such a review.’","A wedding law review is to start this week ordered by ministers .

"The founder of Facebook stepped in to reverse the decision of his network to remove a post by a Pakistani actor that compared ridiculing Islam to called a black person a n***** or describing Hitler as ‘the messiah’. Hamza Ali Abbasi was told that his post, which related to the Charlie Hebdo massacre, violated the social networking website’s ‘community standards’ and was removed and had his profile deactivated – but Mark Zuckerberg intervened. When asked by a user what he thought about the deletion of Mr Abbasi’s post, Mr Zuckerberg said that a mistake may have been made, and alerted his company’s Vice President of Global Operations and Media Partnerships, Justin Osofsky, to the matter. The founder of Facebook stepped in to reverse the decision of his network to remove a post by a Pakistani actor, Hamza Ali Abbasi (right) that compared ridiculing Islam to called a black person a n***** or describing Hitler as ‘the messiah’ When asked by a user what he thought about the deletion of Mr Abbasi’s post, Mr Zuckerberg (pictured) said that a mistake may have been made . He said: ‘I don’t think this should have been blocked. Our team might have made a mistake. Justin, can you look into this?’ Mr Abbasi, who is very vocal on political issues, posted a message last week in which he questioned the west’s definition of freedom of expression in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo attack by two jihadists in Paris. He wrote: ‘A French Muslim police officer dies doing his duty in the face of two mislead Muslim youth killing falsely in the name of the religion of peace, Islam. Yes, even my blood boils when someone insults my Prophet... But that does not give individuals the right to kill. ‘But west needs to understand too that freedom of expression includes criticism, disagreement or even rejection of faiths or ideology... but should not and must not allow 'insult'. Would it be 'freedom of expression' if I branded black people as n****** or if I say Hitler was a messiah?’ He added: ‘The West needs to rethink and fix its definition of “freedom of expression”.’ Mr Abbasi, who is very vocal on political issues, posted the message last week - but it was removed . Mr Abbasi revealed that his account was subsequently blocked. He told Dawn.com: ‘I had been trying to log into my Facebook for a couple of hours and it wasn't accepting the password. I genuinely thought it had been hacked but then I got an email from Facebook saying that my account had been temporarily blocked and my status had been deleted and this was the first of three warnings. That really made me angry so I took the screen grab and posted it as soon as I had access to my account.’ He added: ‘I post so many controversial things on my Facebook, I believe in voicing my opinion. It's just funny that their selective freedom of speech caused them to delete only this particular post of all things.’ Mr Osofsky later posted an apology and said he hoped Mr Abbasi would re-post his comment. He wrote: 'As Mark mentioned, we made a mistake in taking this down. We try to do our best, but sometimes make mistakes. We apologize for this error, and hope that the author will re-post it as we are not able to restore it from our end. Thanks for bringing it to our attention.' The spat follows Mark Zuckerberg recounting a 2010 incident he had with a Pakistani extremist, who demanded that he be put to death for allowing insults about Islam to appear on Facebook. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook: 'A few years ago, an extremist in Pakistan fought to have me sentenced to death because Facebook refused to ban content about Mohammed that offended him.' It was a result of the site's promotion of an Everybody Draw Mohammed Day which took place on May 20 of that year. And while he did not end up being charged with any crime or sentenced to death, the Pakistani government did block Facebook in their country.","Hamza Ali Abbasi had account blocked after a post about Charlie Hebdo .

"Jenny Agutter pictured with her son in 1991 . She was nearly 40 when she got married – and quickly found herself pregnant. But actress Jenny Agutter is the first to admit that having a family was the making of her. She said it was initially difficult to adjust after spending 15 years single – however the rewards are worth it. ‘You grow up when you let someone else into your life in marriage,’ the 62-year-old said. ‘It’s a hard adjustment, coming to terms with other people’s realities and that you’re not going to do everything your way, although it’s wonderful to have someone else there.’ Miss Agutter was living in Los Angeles when she met Swedish hotelier Johan Tham at a Bath arts festival in 1989. They married a year later, with their son Jonathan arriving in December 1990. Speaking to the Radio Times, she said: ‘In my 20s I felt much more maternal than in my 30s, but there was no one around to have a child with. 'I thought about having one on my own, but knew I wouldn’t cope. I needed support. ‘I was less broody when I was in a position to have a child, but thrilled when I became pregnant. ‘However, they don’t tell you that, the moment you’re pregnant, your life is taken over. Everything you do, think and feel is affected.’ An established face on British screens thanks to her 1970 role as Roberta in The Railway Children and later parts in films such as An American Werewolf In London, Miss Agutter initially cut back on work to look after her new family. ‘I didn’t want to compromise so that had to take precedence,’ she said. But now she thinks there has been something of a renaissance for older actresses – and Miss Agutter has certainly benefited. Her most recent role is as Sister Julienne in Call The Midwife, which returns for its fourth series this week. Ageing gracefully: Miss Agutter, elegant at 60, is set to play Sister Julienne in Call The Midwife, which returns for its fourth series this week . ‘There’s a more mature audience to be catered for and great stories are being written,’ she said. ‘You no longer have to be young for ever, which is terrific.’ Lifting the lid on her time in America and her early career, she added: ‘Living alone [in LA] I made every decision and did things my way. I was never lonely. ‘I was self-centred, and it took me a long time to grow up because I didn’t do it with my peers.’ Miss Agutter as Sister Julienne (L) alongside Jessica Raine as Jenny Lee and Judy Parfitt as Sister Monica Joan in the new series of Call The Midwife . She revealed she managed to resist pressure from Hollywood producers to change her appearance – but said that turning 60 was an unpleasant milestone. ‘It was nothing to do with the age – more my own attitude in the past, thinking how old it made other people seem,’ she said. As well as her son, the star also has two stepdaughters – one of whom has two children aged 11 and eight.","Actress spoke of joy of motherhood during interview with Radio Times .

'To actually try and hide and not be a part, not be in the world, was so difficult and was so kind of frustrating for her,' he revealed.

"Toni Tattis knows the grief of miscarrying a child. In fact, it is something she has experienced five times over. So when the Hunter Valley mother-of-two heard the New South Wales government was for the first time acknowledging miscarried children by giving parents the option to obtain a certificate of recognition for their loss, she was over the moon. Ms Tattis has had five miscarriages and lost a set of twins just days after they were born. Scroll down for video . Toni Tattis, 38, has had four miscarriages and lost two sets of twins just days after they were born. She is pictured here with her 'miracle baby' Isabella (pictured with Ms Tattis above) who is now 9 years old . Drawing from these experiences, she is now helping other parents cope with their grief. The now 38-year-old lost a baby boy at 11 weeks in May 2001 when she was 25 years old. This child, who she later named Rhys, was her first miscarriage. In November of the same year she lost baby Jordyn at nine weeks and then in April 2002 her dreams of becoming a mother slipped away again when she lost a set of twins, Cooper and Kaitlyn. Heartache returned in May 2004 when baby James passed away five weeks after she fell pregnant. Amid these tragedies, Ms Tattis gave birth to twins Jacinta and Madelin - only to lose them after they were born in November 2003. Jacinta lived for two hours and Madeline passed away after three days. They were born 24 weeks into Ms Tattis' pregnancy. She has since had two healthy children, 'miracle baby' Isabella, 9, who was born in 2005 and Arlie, 19 months, in 2013. Her girls, Jacinta and Madelin, died in November 2003 . Her first husband, Tim Tattis, is the father of Isabella and her lost babies, and her fiance Warren Cooke is father to Arlie. 'For me, my very first loss on its own was quite devastating and distressing for me because I didn't know anyone who had experienced loss [like this],' Ms Tattis, who lives in the Hunter Valley, told Daily Mail Australia. 'All my sisters had healthy pregnancies and I was the oldest. 'The main thing I felt was very lonely and isolated, and there were no online support groups - in essence - I had to deal with it on my own.' To add to her times of grief, Ms Tattis said some of her friends did not see her loss as a real loss. She stressed her close family and friends were very understanding and helped her cope with the death of her children. 'Miscarriage loss is looked at by quite a few people as not quite a big deal, it's not a baby that you've lost,' Ms Tattis said. 'That expectation that parents should move on quickly, that doesn't happened in reality. 'You can't just switch a button and say it's all good. That puts a lot of pressure on us, and they do feel that loneliness and isolation. The names of her lost children - Rhys, Jordyn, Cooper, Kaitlyn, Jacinta and Madeline and James - are in a framed picture as she remembers them every day. She would grief for them forever . Keepsakes from her twins, Jacinta and Madeline, are two teddies sitting on the two quilts they lay on in hospital . '[Some people] think we weren't really attached these babies so early into the pregnancy, but the love and the future are all embedded in them and is there from the moment we find out about the baby. 'The big issue is that there's still a perception that these babies aren't real babies, they're not treated as a full-term birth. They are different. 'But a loss is a loss and I don't know why we need to minimise it this much. They have a beating heart and you can't question that.' Despite it being a few years since the deaths of her children, Ms Tattis said she would spend her whole life grieving for them. 'We invest in these [miscarried] babies... and when they are taken from you it doesn't make a difference when the pregnancy is lost. 'I will always be a mum to these babies and I will carry them in my heart forever. 'Even though I'm living my life, I never forget their birthdays. There is always something special I usually do for them on their birthday like I do for my two living children because they are my children.' Fortunately Ms Tattis now has two children named Arlie, 19 months, and Isabella, 9. On the left, Ms Tattis is pictured with her children and fiance Warren Cooke who is Arlie's father . Ms Tattis (again pictured with daughter Isabella) is also co-founder and vice-president of Bears of Hope - a group dedicated to helping grieving parents who lose a child . From her first-hand experiences, Ms Tattis knew the New South Wales government's move to introduce certificates of recognition for miscarriages would help grieving parents cope with the death of their child. '[When I heard] I was absolutely ecstatic, I was so emotionally overwhelmed. I wish it was available to me back then,' she said. 'This validation and acknowledgement from the government is going to shape the perception among the community and help those families grieving for their baby. 'Acknowledgement goes a long way helping parents heal and work through their grief. 'To be able to speak of their name and acknowledge their life is music to the ears of their parent.' Ms Tattis has welcomed the NSW government's move to introduce a certificate of recognition for miscarriages . Ms Tattis said naming her lost children had helped her move forward with her life. 'When I did I felt a big weight come off my shoulders... I wish I had done it in the beginning,' she said. The move from NSW comes after Queensland, South Australia and the Northern Territory have done the same. The certificate of recognition was introduced just before Christmas last year but Attorney-General Brad Hazzard made the announcement on Monday. A miscarriage involves a child that is carried for less than 20 weeks and is below 400 grams. 'Families who experience the loss of a baby early in a pregnancy have a difficult grieving process and often feel that their loss isn't recognised,' Mr Hazzard said. ;Until now it has not been possible to receive formal recognition for the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks. 'At the request of the Government, NSW Registry of Births, Death and Marriages are issuing optional recognition certificates to parents who have experienced this tragedy. 'The recognition certificates are not legal documents but it is hoped that, at least in some small way, a formal recognition certificate will help.' It is also available to parents who lost a child before the introduction date. Partnered with raising her two children, Ms Tattis is also co-founder and vice-president of Bears of Hope - a group dedicated to assisting parents to deal with their miscarriage. 'What has helped me through the years of loss, loneliness and depression [is] having the opportunity to speak about my babies with other bereaved parents, co-founding and managing Bears Of Hope and writing children's books,' she said. 'Turning the absolute heartache into helping others has been beneficial in my own healing.'","Toni Tattis, who had five miscarriages, knows the grief of losing a child .

"Wide-eyed and apprehensive, these Pakistani children returned to the school where their classmates and teachers were slaughtered last month. In a show of defiance they travelled - on packed motorbikes, rickety buses, clapped-out vans and on foot - to the scene where 152 people, 133 of them children, were murdered by the Taliban. As they neared the school gates, soldiers carrying guns patrolled the entrance where the elevated boundary walls have been fitted with steel wire fencing. In the deadly attack on December 16 that was condemned across the world, several Taliban attackers wearing bomb vests cut through a wire fence and went from class to class in a killing spree that left 152 dead at the Army Public School in Peshawar. Harrowing eyewitness accounts revealed how students were forced to watch as bodies were burned beyond recognition during a three-hour orgy of bloodshed. Other survivors told how they played dead while insurgents scoured the school looking for children to shoot, before opening fire indiscriminately - sometimes with smiles on their faces.

Brave children made their way to school on a rickety van following the attack that left Pakistan reeling and was condemned around the world . For 16-year-old Shahrukh Khan, who was shot in both legs while pretending to play dead in his school's auditorium, going back was a traumatic experience. 'I have lost 30 of my friends. How will I sit in the empty class, how will I look towards their empty benches?' he told news agency AFP. 'My heart has been broken. All the class fellows I had, have died. Now my heart does not want to attend school,' he said. Raheel Sharif, the head of Pakistan's powerful army, made an unannounced visit with his wife, greeting and hugging anxious students dressed in green blazers. Parents spoke of having to sit down with their children and mentally prepare them for their return to the murder scene, which now has an airport-style security gate installed at the front. 'He was terrified but we talked him up. We cannot keep him imprisoned between four walls and we must stand against militancy,' Muhammad Zahoor said as he walked his son to the school. 'I want to go to school to see my friends. I will join the army after my schooling and will take revenge,' said Muhammad Zaid, his son.

No force can stop me from going to attend my school. I will go and tell the attackers, ""We are not afraid of you""', 16-year-old Zahid Ayub, who sustained minor wounds, told AFP. A teacher - who wished to remain anonymous - said rows of empty seats, especially in the 9th and 10th grade classes, had made the first day back  a surreal experience. 'Students were greeting each other and saying ""You're alive?"" They were taking their parents to different spots and explaining to them where they were during the time of the attack and how it happened,' he said. 'Photographs of the martyred are pasted on a noticeboard in the school. Students and teachers were placing flowers in front of it and weeping,' he added. Parents across Pakistan spoke of their trepidation in dropping their children off at school. 'Driving to school in the light of a quietly subdued rising sun. There's a kind of stillness in the air. It sounds like a million mothers saying a silent prayer as they drop their babies to school. Stay safe. Stay safe,' wrote Saima Jamil Ashraf, a parent in Karachi, on Instagram.

"Staying put? Dr Jim Sears, 48, has denied claims he is leaving popular CBS chat show 'The Doctors' Dr Jim Sears, star of daytime talk show 'The Doctors', has denied reports that he is about to leave the cast while being investigated for threatening his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend. TMZ reported that Sears, 48, was at his Huntington Beach, California home last month with his girlfriend when she felt 'uneasy' and asked her ex to pick her up. The ex-boyfriend, Pete Scalisi, arrived at the home and took the woman away. But Sears 'flew into a rage', called Scalisi and accused of him kidnapping the woman - before driving to his house, TMZ reported. 'I'm going to kill you!' he allegedly shouted at Scalisi. Scalisi then filed a police report against the doctor, alleging that he had made criminal threats. Police are investigating but have yet to speak with Sears, the website noted, adding that the doctor is leaving the show 'very soon'. But Sears' lawyers this morning vehemently denied the claims to DailyMail.com, calling the allegations 'a complete fabrication'. 'Dr. Spears did not threaten anyone's life and is not resigning from The Doctors,' Michael P. Wippler said in an email. The Doctors, a CBS daytime talk show that started in 2008, features a panel of doctors, including Sears, discussing a range of various health-related topics with audience members. Giving advice: Dr Sears, pictured second left with (from left) Dr Drew Ordon, Dr Lisa Masterson and Dr Travis Stork, is part of the panel of experts on The Doctors. He is a pediatrician with a practice in California . Sears, a pediatrician, works at a family practice in Capistrano Beach, California with his father and younger brother. He has two children with his former wife, Diane, and a third child. In 2011, he revealed on the show that he had proposed to his girlfriend, Gina, during a vacation to Hawaii. It is not clear if she was the woman cited in the police report. He is a published author, serves as the Children's Health Specialist for the AOL Medical Advisory Board and has featured as an expert for a range of outlets, including Parenting.com and CNN. Following an appearance on CNN last year, Dr Sears was forced to apologize for comments he made about six-year-old Coy Mathis, a transgender child who wished to use the girl's school bathroom, GLAAD reported. Award winning: Sears is pictured with his fellow hosts (left to right, Dr Ordon, Dr Masterson and Dr Stork) with the Outstanding Informative Talk Show following the Emmys in Las Vegas 2010 . Sears said he would not be happy with a child with a penis sharing the bathroom with his daughter, saying it would be 'uncomfortable' for the girls in the bathroom. He later released a statement saying he had made comments based on the assumption that the youngster would have acted 'like a typical boy'. 'I understand Coy as transgender is not likely to display those same tendencies,' he said. 'I do apologize for implying she may display the same behavior as I have seen with young boys her age.'","Dr Jim Sears, who appears on CBS' daytime talk show The Doctors, was reported to be leaving the show - but his lawyers have denied the claims .

"A spacecraft that is due to arrive at the former planet Pluto later this year is carrying the ashes of the astronomer who first discovered the icy world. Clyde Tombaugh spotted the tiny gleaming object - which at 1,430 miles across is around two thirds the diametre of the Moon - as a dot on the edge of our solar system in 1930. On his death in January 1997, Mr Tombaugh requested that his ashes be sent into space. Clyde Tombaugh, pictured above in 1990, requested his remains be flown into space after his death in 1997 and his ashes are now approaching Pluto, the icy world on the edge of the solar system that he discovered . Now his remains are about to visit the world that he discovered, onboard a space probe that has been slowly flying through the solar system for the past nine years. A small container holding his remains is fixed to the upper deck of the spacecraft, bearing the inscription: 'Interned herin are the remains of American Clyde W Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system's ""third zone"".' Named by an 11-year-old girl after the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto is one of the least understood objects in our solar system. It is so far away that it appears barely as a pinprick in the sky even through the most powerful telescopes on Earth. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed a fuzzy picture of a molasses coloured world that teams with activity. Over time Pluto has also apparently grown redder, perhaps due to seasonal changes. No one is certain what is causing the coloured splotches, but the surface is thought to be mainly composed of frozen water and rock. Chemicals such as nitrogen and methane are thought to lie frozen beneath the icy crust. Pluto's orbit is highly eccentric, or far from circular, which means its distance from the sun can vary considerably. At times Pluto may come close enough to the sun for some of the frozen nitrogen and methane to turn into gas, giving it a thin and temporary atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity, which is a little more than one-twentieth that of Earth's, causes this atmosphere to extend much higher in altitude than Earth's. Pluto's surface is one of the coldest places in the solar system at roughly -375F (minus 225 degrees C). The £460 million New Horizon's mission will make him the first 'human' contact mankind has had with the dwarf planet. However, at more than 3.67 billion miles from the Sun, it is an inhospitable place. Temperatures on the surface plummet to -375 degrees F (-225 degrees C), cold enough for nitrogen and methane to freeze, and there is little atmosphere. Nasa's New Horizon's spacecraft woke up last month after a long hibernation as it makes its final approach towards Pluto. On 15 January it should finally be close enough to get a good look at Pluto and its moon Charon before beginning a fly past that will allow it to peer at the surface, taking measurements of the dust, gas and magnetic field that surround the former planet. Alan Stern, the principal investigator on the mission and a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, in Boulder, Colorado, said: 'We’re currently in the very earliest stages of Pluto approach. 'When the encounter begins we’ll still be very far from Pluto, about 135 million miles (220 million kilometers).' He added, though, that by May they hoped to receive images that were better than the grainy images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. Pluto is among the most controversial objects in the solar system. Since its discovery by Mr Tombaugh up until 2006, Pluto was considered to be the ninth planet in the solar system. However, after the discovery of several other Pluto-sized objects in the far reaches of the solar system, astronomers decided to downgrade its status. They eventually settled on describing Pluto, and other objects, like it as dwarf planets. Its official designation is now asteroid number 134340. The artist's impression above shows the New Horizons spacecraft as it approaches Pluto and its three moons . Nasa obtained these images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 2010 showing the coloured world of Pluto . However, scientists believe that Pluto is still vitally important and could hold a wealth of information about the far corners of our solar system and how it formed. Pluto is thought to be composed mainly of frozen water ice, methane, nitrogen and rocks surrounding a metal and rock core. New Horizons is carrying seven scientific instruments designed to take infrared and ultraviolet images of the planet, along with a high resolution camera. A particle spectrometer and a dust detector will also be used to measure the solar wind and other particles that are found around the former planet. Clyde Tombaugh, seen here in 1931, discovered Pluto in 1930 while working at the Lowel Observatory . The New Horizon's probe, seen above in this artist's impression, will use miniature cameras, radio science experiment, ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers to study the geology of Pluto and its moon Charon . This is one of the clearest images obtained of Pluto and its moon Charon by the Hubble Space Telescope . Dr Dennis Reuter, Nasa's co-investigator of the New Horizon's mission, said: 'While we have some idea of what we expect to see, I can’t help but think that history will repeat itself, and we’ll find ourselves astounded by something new, something we had never expected to see. 'I often think about the fact that the first time we’ve taken a close-up look at an object in the solar system, our understanding of that object immediately leaps forward. 'From volcanoes on Jupiter’s moon Io, to hydrocarbon lakes on Saturn’s moon Titan, to nitrogen geysers on Neptune’s moon Triton, and innumerable other examples, we’ve seen remarkable things that have taught us much about what goes on in our sun’s neighborhood.' Pluto's surface, seen here in an artist's impression, is thought to be composed mainly of frozen ice and rock .","American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered the icy world in 1930 .

"Rapper Common led tributes to slain Missouri teen Michael Brown at the MTV Video Music Awards last night. The star-studded audience in Los Angeles fell silent for five seconds in tribute to the 18-year-old aspiring rapper, two weeks after he was shot and killed by white police officer Darren Wilson. A 15-second video clip set against a black-and-white image of Ferguson's city sign was also played with a crowd in the background chanting 'hand's up don't shoot' - the slogan used by protesters  in the St Louis suburb. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Common speaks to the audience about events in Missouri after the death of Michael Brown. The artist said that the people of Ferguson have proved 'every one of our lives matters' The audience (including Snoop Dogg, pictured) closed their eyes for five second of silence from slain Missouri teen and hip hop enthusiast Michael Brown . A 15-second video clip was also shown during the ceremony. A chant of 'hands up don't shoot' was heard in the background . The footage included a quote from writer James Baldwin, which said: 'Not everything that is faced can be changed; but nothing can be changed until it is faced.' During the awards ceremony, Common told the audience: 'The people in the Ferguson...in St. Louis have used their voices to call for justice and change - to let everyone know that each and every one of our lives matters.' In the moment of quiet that followed, artists including Snoop Dogg bowed their heads and closed their eyes before the performance carried on. MTV President Stephen Friedman confirmed on Sunday the network would air a 15-second spot focusing on race in a bid to continue the discussion about events surrounding the shooting. 'It's a call to action to our audience that we have to confront our own bias head-on before we can truly create change,' Friedman said. In St Louis on Sunday, Michael Brown Sr. (left) and Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton (second from left) hold up their hands as attorney Benjamin Crump (right) speaks at Peace Fest music festival . Residents continue to pay tribute to the slain teen at a memorial set up on the exact spot where he was shot . The protests in the St Louis suburb have become more peaceful after the National Guard was withdrawn . 'Hip-hop has always been about truth and has been a powerful instrument for social change,' he told the audience, before leading them in five seconds of silence then announcing the nominees for best hip hop video. Brown, who was gunned down by police officer Darren Wilson on August 9, will be buried today during a public funeral at a St Louis Church. Micheal Brown Snr has called for a 'day of silence' and 'peace' today as his son is laid to rest more than two weeks after his death. The teen instantly became a symbol of racial injustice as protesters flooded into the streets of the predominantly black community in response. Police watch as a peaceful demonstrators carries a cross through the streets of Ferguson . There is still a police presence in the suburb, but clashes have eased over the last few days . A mural for the youngster has been painted on a wall of the city in the wake of civil unrest . It revived long simmering questions about police treatment of minorities across the country. The National Guard was called in to try to ease the tensions while the federal government has also opened an investigation into the shooting. The Rev Al Shrapton, who led a Peace Fest in Ferguson yesterday, added to the plea from the boy's father. Aspiring rapper Brown was preparing to start college before he was shot dead in the street by a white police officer . He said: 'We don't want anything to happen that might defile the name of Michael Brown,' Sharpton said. 'This is not about our rage tomorrow. It's about the legacy and memory of his son.' The parents of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin also spoke, urging the crowd to channel its anger into action by pushing to strengthen families and better educate youth and expressing support for the Brown family and the people of the St. Louis area. 'We're going to stand tall with you all,' Trayvon's Martin's father, Tracy Martin, said. Trayvon Martin, 17, was also unarmed when he was shot and killed in 2012. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who said he shot Martin in self-defense, was acquitted. The nightly protests in Ferguson have been mostly peaceful in recent days, a contrast to images of police in riot gear firing tear gas canisters at angry protesters in the days after the Brown shooting. Details released by law enforcement have said that Brown was involved in a scuffle with Officer Wilson after he was asked to move and pushed him against his patrol car. Some witnesses have reported seeing Brown's arms in the air — an act of surrender. An autopsy concluded he'd been shot at least six times. Ferguson police identified Wilson at the same time they released a video of an alleged theft showing Brown snatch some cigars in a convenience store just minutes before he was killed. In the video, Brown is shown grabbing a clerk by the shirt and forcefully pushing him into a display rack.

"Mortgages are now the cheapest on record, new figures show. Two-year fixed and variable rate mortgages have plummeted to new lows as lenders try to attract borrowers. Banks and buildings societies are trying to lure in new buyers after demand fell in the last half of the year. Tough new lending rules which make it harder for some borrowers to obtain a mortgage have dampened the market in recent months. Two-year fixed and variable rate mortgages have plummeted to new lows thanks to tough new lending rules and fears that the Bank of England would raise its historically low base rate (File photo) Fears of an imminent hike in interest rates also deterred buyers, as many waited to find out if the Bank of England would raise its base from an historic low of 0.5 per cent before moving. But with the Bank of England not due to raise its base rate until the end of this year – or even 2016 – lenders are making up for lost time and now offering rock bottom offers. Experts said now could be one of the best times in history to lock into a fixed rate mortgage at a cheap price before rates rise. The average interest rate for a two-year fixed rate home loan with at least a 25 per cent deposit  was just 2.08 per cent in December, the lowest level since records began in 1995. This deal, which is the most common loan type taken out by borrowers, fell from 2.17 per cent a month earlier. Interest rates on a two-year variable with a discount have also never been lower at 1.63 per cent, down from 1.81 per cent a month before. And lifetime trackers are also near record lows at 2.86 per cent, the figures showed. Global bank Citi said the figures showed that ‘key mortgage rates generally continued to fall in December, and many mortgage rates now are at or around record lows’. Sylvia Waycot, of the financial website Moneyfacts, said: ‘Mortgage lenders are now fighting for our attention. Demand for mortgages was reported to have ‘decreased significantly’ in the last quarter of 2014, according to the Bank of England (File photo) ‘Almost daily new deals are being launched as each lender tries to out-do its competitor – which at last is some great news for the borrower.’ Demand for mortgages was reported to have ‘decreased significantly’ in the last quarter of 2014, according to the Bank of England. This was partly due to the mortgage market review, which forced lenders to check that borrowers could afford to meet their monthly repayments in the event of interest rate rises. Banks now have to carry out rigorous checks on potential buyers’ spending habits before they agree to grant them a home loan, which has apparently led to fewer approvals.","Demand drop partially due to tough new lending rules .

"Sir Richard Branson claims staff from his Necker Island retreat had to rescue Olympic sailor Sir Ben Ainslie after he ran into trouble sailing in the area on his honeymoon. The Virgin boss said the four-times gold medallist ran into difficulties when a furling system, which controls the sail being rolled out, broke. The British Olympian was on honeymoon with his new wife Georgie Thompson, after they married at Hampton Court Palace last month, when the incident occurred. Scroll down for video . Necker Island staff members (from left) Marco Bava, George Lambert, Adam Chubbock pose with Georgie Thompson and Sir Ben Ainslie after they helped rescue them following a technical fault on their yacht . The furling system on the yacht broke, meaning ithe sail couldn't be hoisted or lowered . Sir Richard said the couple were holidaying near Necker Island, in the British Virgin Islands, when they encountered the problem and Ainslie was forced to radio for help. Members of the island's watersports team - Marco Bava, George Lambert and Adam Chubbock -helped to cut the sail and avoid the vessel being wrecked on a nearby reef. Writing on his blog, Sir Richard commented: 'It was great to see Ben Ainslie sailing past Necker Island as he enjoyed his honeymoon with his delightful new wife Georgie Thompson. The newlyweds didn't let their sailing disaster dampen their honeymoon and joined Sir Richard for a few days on Necker Island . Sir Richard tweeted about the incident and wrote a post on his blog saying he had never expected to rescue an Olympic sailor from a boat . 'Seeing as Ben is one of the greatest sailors of all time, what we didn’t except to see was his boat getting into trouble!' The three helpful workers managed to cut the sail, which could not be raised or lowered due to the major technical problem. Sir Richard said: 'Unsurprisingly, Ben kept an amazingly cool head whilst directing operations - he just needed more hands to sort out the mess.' The Virgin boss has also invited the couple to stay on his island for a few days. Ainslie and TV sports presenter Georgie only announced their engagement last October and married on December 20. The couple were married at the end of December and enjoyed some time in Antigua before heading out on a yacht around the British Virgin Islands . Romantic ceremony: The lovebirds exchanged vows at London's Royal Hampton Court on December 20 . Announcing the news, Ainslie, who has four Olympic gold medals and one silver to his name, wrote on his Twitter account: 'Picture says it all. So happy to be engaged to the loveliest woman in the World. Biggles is pretty excited too!' Thompson then posted on her account, saying, rather accurately: 'This just in… @AinslieBen and I are getting married! Couldn't be happier. Suspect the honeymoon may involve a boat..:)' After their wedding, the couple were spotted walking arm in arm in Antigua before embarking on the second part of their honeymoon.","Sir Ben Ainslie and Georgie Thompson rescued by Necker Island staff .

"A 26-year-old man decided there was more to life and gave up everything so he could travel the world in a converted van. Bored with his conventional life in the UK, systems engineer Mike Hudson, 26, has spent 300 days travelling 10,000 miles in a £2,500 LDV Convoy van. The adventurer, from Sheffield, converted the vehicle into his very own 'studio apartment' complete with bedroom-lounge-diner, walk in shower room, 200-watt solar power system, fridge and gas cooker. Scroll down for video . Mike Hudson has already travelled some 10,000 miles after starting a new chapter of his life in his van . The 26-year-old decided to leave Sheffield and travel the world, and right, he earns money fire-juggling . Mike spent four-months refitting the van and set off from his home city to live in some of Europe's most striking wildernesses and cities. He worked in an office during the day while learning to build websites and researching how to refit his van in his evenings. Mike explained how he reached the decision to make such a dramatic change in lifestyle. 'I lived in Sheffield and I really love that city,' he said. 'I have loads of great friends in England and I had my own place which rented with a friend, a car and a good job. Mr Hudson now takes in some of the more spectacular views around the world as he tours with his van . This is the scene that Mr Hudson was more used to on a daily basis; Sheffield . 'Looking back though, I was quite miserable the year before travelling. I felt a bit trapped, and I had a feeling of - is this it? This can't be it. 'I wanted something different - adventure, experience and challenge. I was bored, and living on the road was a daydream I couldn't get rid of. 'I was lucky everyone there was really cool when I told them my plans to leave the UK and travel the world in my truck. 'I was nervous, scared, excited and relieved because I knew there was no going back. It's a bit of a life experiment.' Mr Hudson paid £2,500 for the LDV van, and spent a fair amount of time making it into his 'home' There is space in the back of the van now to dine, relax and then sleep, with a nice wood finish . Mr Hudson has added in extra storage space for some of life's essentials as he travels around the world . Mike, who left the UK in March last year and is currently in the paradise Greek island of Santorini, managed to scrape together £4,500 to finance his new life. He now survives on a daily budget of just ten-pounds per day by diesel sharing with hitchhikers, generating money from his online blog and juggling fire as a street performer. Highlights of Mike's journey include crossing the incredible Transfagersan pass in Romania, taking part in Hungary's SUN music festival and spotting brown bears in the forest. 'In Slovakia, I did a three-point turn in a narrow mountain road and the back wheels slipped off the edge of the crumbling road. This is how Mr Hudson's home started - more akin to a painter and decorator's pack-up than a home . Mr Hudson spent four months preparing the van for the next journey of his life . 'My foot was pressing so hard on the brake, there was fluid leaking onto the road, I couldn't let go because I'd go off the road down the hill, backwards. 'My van is rear wheel drive so I had to be towed out. 'I really didn't think I'd get out of that situation.' So far Mike has travelled from England to France, Spain and Portugal, then he travelled east to Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria to eventually reach Greece. Mike has travelled from England to France, Spain and Portugal, then he travelled east to Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Hungary among others . Mr Hudson has ensured he can dine with a little bit of style, despite eating out of the back of a £2,500 van . There was even enough room to fit a toilet into the van, and right, a general view from the back . Despite the drama of life on the road, Mike explained why he has no firm plans to return home at the moment. 'I like England, but the winter and lack of light kills me - plus it's too cold to live in a van during winter,' he said. 'I want to look back when I'm older and think - yes I was living, and I made the most I could out of life. Mr Hudson has said he has no firm plans to return home at the moment after taking in some wonderful sights . Mike Hudson (back row second from left) celebrates in a pub with friends before his world trip . 'I describe everything in my blog and whether this gives people a kick in the right direction to follow their dreams, or helps them in some way with van conversions or travel then I'm happy. 'Eventually, I want my website to be a resource for anyone who wants to convert a van into their home with minimal skills and tools, as well as guides for living and travelling in a van.

"An Ohio sheriff has released 72 inmates because of budget cuts which he says are restricting his ability to safely run the jail. The move by Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry in Akron on Sunday reduces the county jail's overall capacity by 149 beds, from 671 to 522. Convicts, mostly with non-violent charges, beamed as they filed out of the now defunct wing to meet relatives and agencies outside the gates. Released: 72 inmates were released from Summit County Jail, Ohio, on Sunday after an entire wing was shut . Decision: Summit County Sherrif Steve Barry said he had no choice but to close the 150-bed wing . The jail has been reporting issues since the state cut local government funding by $1 billion in 2012. The sheriff's spokesman Bill Holland told the Akron Beacon Journal lowing staffing meant inamtes were being kept in their cells longer, with less recreational time, leading to heightened tensions and fights. To combat the issue, he said, staff had been refused holiday. A table was set up outside the jail with hats, gloves and scarves for the inmates as temperatures dropped to 24 degrees. Some were unaware they were being released until hours before. 'I ain't happy because I've got to go back to court,' one inmate, who was not named, told ABC News. Another said: 'I'm happy! I'm out!' Mixed feelings: One man (left) was  delighted. Another (right) raged that he has to go back to court . 'Second chance': Antonio Spragling, jailed for drugs charges in November, said this is a second chance . Surprised: Many did not know they were going to be released until hours before the measure passed . Former inmate Antonio Spragling, 50, who was jailed for drug charges in November, told the Akron Beacon Journal: 'All I can do is thank God... I look at it as a second chance and I'm not going to let anyone down. No judge. The system. And more important, I'm not going to let myself down.' Most of the released men were taken home while some were transferred to alternative sentencing programs. The sheriff, who announced the planned measure last year, could not recall a similar release in the past. 'I don't want these people out,' Barry told the journal. 'I got no choice.' The next step: All inmates have been issued a court date to discuss the completion of their sentence . Barry, who began his sheriff's office career in 1979, said all the victims of the inmates have been contacted about the release. The jail received about 50 new inmates over the last two days, complicating Sunday's release. Cuts in state funding for local municipalities have squeezed the sheriff's budget, along with voters' November rejection of a county sales tax increase that would have generated about $20 million a year for 10 years.","Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry closed a 150-bed wing of the jail .

"Over-50s hold almost half of physical wealth,  figures from Saga show (models posed for picture) While many Britons are still recovering from the financial crisis, the over-50s are enjoying record levels of wealth, figures show. New analysis found older people now enjoy a greater proportion of everything from property wealth to stocks and shares than they did in 2008. Saga, which commissioned the study, said that over-50s had weathered the recession by taking a ‘prudent approach’ to life and had saved, spent and invested carefully. They have also benefited from booming house prices, with the over-50s owning the majority of property in the UK. A report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found the over-50s now hold over two-thirds of all household wealth. This includes property, physical assets such as cars, furniture, art and televisions, financial wealth such as stocks, bonds and trusts, and pension wealth. The over-50s hold almost half of physical wealth, three-quarters of financial wealth and two-thirds of property wealth. Saga said it should ‘come as no surprise that many people who have worked, saved and invested over a number of years have built significant wealth’. They said the rise in the number of older workers also meant increased the riches of the over-50s. Paul Green, at Saga, said: ‘The proportion of wealth held by the over 50s has gone up since the start of the financial crisis predominantly through the careful management of their finances and changes to their retirement age. ‘We now have more than a million over 65s who are remaining in work so they can earn, spend and save more than previous generations would have done. ‘This is in part due to the desire for active older people to want to work longer, but also due to low interest rates which have encouraged many to stay in the workforce.’ He added: ‘Contrary to the rhetoric of the pinch enthusiasts, the Saga generations have not commandeered an undue share of wealth in some conspiracy against the young, but have instead built it through the dint of their hard work. ‘Of course, some of this wealth has been built through house price inflation, and the fact that many older homeowners have generally paid off a much larger proportion of their mortgage, however many plan to use this accumulated wealth to support or pass onto their families.’ In addition to cash, older people have household wealth assets such as cars, furniture, art, stocks, bonds and trusts .","Older people survived the slump by taking a ‘prudent approach’ to life .

"A woman has died and 84 people have been hospitalized after smoke engulfed a train carriage and a station platform during a huge electrical malfunction on the Washington D.C. Metro on Monday afternoon. Around 200 people were evacuated from L'Enfant Plaza  at 3.20pm after the thick cloud of smoke barreled through the carriages, leaving hundreds of commuters in need of medical attention and causing chaos during the city's rush hour. A woman on the train - which had stopped 800ft short of the platform when the smoke began pouring in - was taken to hospital after paramedics arrived on the scene. She later died. It was the first fatality on the Metro system since a 2009 crash that killed eight passengers and a train operator. Others on the train started choking and lost consciousness as they waited for help to arrive as the smoke billowed from the malfunction deeper in the tunnel. Two people are said to be in a critical condition at George Washington Hospital. An initial investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said the smoke had been caused by an 'electrical-arcing event'. An arcing occurs when electricity from the third rail comes into contact with another substance that conducts electricity, such as water, and may generate smoke. Scroll down for video . Engulfed: Smoke is seen hovering over L'Enfant Plaza Metro station in Washington D.C. after thick smoke filled one of the tunnels and a station platform on Monday afternoon. One woman died as a result and more than 80 people were taken to hospital . Caught-up: Two men who were in the station when it started to fill with thick smoke wait outside. One is given an oxygen mask by firefighters to combat smoke inhalation . Trapped: Terrified commuters crouch onto the floor of the smoke-filled train. Some said they were left inside for as long as an hour . Horrifying: A man is seen being dragged from one of the carriages by firefighters holding flashlights . While there was water in the tunnel, NTSB investigator Michael Flanigon said the cause of the arcing was not yet known. 'The third rail is high-voltage direct current, and if that current starts arcing to another conductor that it is not designed to connect with, you get a flash,' Flanigon said. 'In certain cases, that arc can start sort of feeding on itself, and it actually generates gases that are more conductive.' Forty of the injured were transported by bus to Howard University Hospital, and between 20 and 25 people were taken to Washington Hospital Center. As well as the 84 people who were hospitalized, 200 people are being evaluated, authorities said. One firefighter was also said to have been hurt, but does not have life-threatening injuries. Panicked commuters described how they lay on the floor of a pitch-black train for 40 minutes in a bid get away from the smoke while announcers told them to 'stay calm'. Others said they waited up to an hour, while some passengers left the trains on their own. 'It started to get scary pretty quick,' passenger Jonathan Rogers told The Washington Post. 'People started praying. Smoke was coming in pretty steadily.' Those who caught up in the smoke were seen walking away from the station with black soot under their noses. Emergency workers escorted smoke inhalation victims to medical aid buses to receive oxygen. Adjoa Adofo, 30, a public relations worker who was on her way to Virginia, told the Washington Post: 'People were panicking. We didn't know what to do and and we weren't getting a lot of information.' She also described how one man suffered a seizure while another terrified man started banging on the closed doors. Dense: A man is seen lying on the floor of the dark carriage as smoke flows through the closed doors . Evacuation: Firefighters are seen guiding passengers through the blackened subway tunnels to safety . Response: A woman is taken into the back of an ambulance. As many as 200 passengers were being evaluated after the incident . Alec Dubois, a freshman at Gonzaga University, told CNN affiliate WJLA: 'People were freaking out, going everywhere. The conductor was telling us to stay calm. He said he was trying to get our train back to the station. 'We had no cell service. I was trying to call my parents. And then there was black stuff everywhere, it was all over my pants, too. It was under our noses. We have no idea what it was.' There were huge delays on the Metro system as a result with a number of lines stopping services or diverting journeys as the smoke was ventilated out of the surrounding tunnels. The yellow line remained shut down Tuesday morning, and the system's orange, blue and silver lines were on a reduced schedule. Service on the green and red lines was normal. NTSB railroad accident investigator Mike Flanigon told the DailyMail.com: 'Just after 3 pm ET today, a six-car Yellow Line train, traveling southbound from L'Enfant Metro station, stopped about 800 feet inside the tunnel leading towards the Pentagon. 'About 1100 feet in front of the train there was an electrical arcing event involving the trackside power cables (the third rail). The tunnel was filled with smoke. Passengers on the train self-evacuated. The train did not derail. There was no fire on the train. 'The NTSB will be finishing up its on-scene work tonight and releasing the site to WMATA. Investigators will conduct a post-recovery examination of the train tomorrow to document the equipment. Taking cover: The station was evacuated on Monday and one person - a female passenger - later died . Help: Firefighters assist a man and set up mass casuality procedures to treat the passengers who were exposed to the smoke . Aftermath: Two men caught up in the smoke hold their hands on their chests as they are led onto a bus . Attention: Commuters who were inside the downtown Washington D.C. station at the time are led to a bus to receive medical treatment . Personnel: A Metro Transit Police officer walks up the escalator at L'Enfant Plaza Station in Washington . Support: A firefighter puts his arm around a woman and guides her to a bus so she can receive medical attention . Investigative groups will include train operations, survival factors and emergency response, and fire science. D.C. Firefighters union Local 36 described the incident as a 'Mass Casualty' event, meaning additional resources were needed because it was such a large-scale incident. In response to the tragic death, Metro General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Richard Sarles said in a statement: 'There was a woman who was in distress on that train, and I'm sorry to say she's passed away.' According to WUSA 9, there was a track fire at the same station last Wednesday. A piece of debris was caught in a light grate, filling the station with smoke. L'Enfant Plaza is near several government buildings, office complexes and restaurants. Washington's Metro system serves five million people in a 1,500-square-mile (3,885-square kilometer) area, which includes transport to neighboring Virginia and Maryland states. The trains and buses provide about 2.3 million trips per year, according to WMATA. Concern: Two firefighters speak with a victim following the evacuation. The smoke caused chaos for commuter's in the nation's capital . Law enforcement: An FBI Medic, center, helps people onto a bus after they were evacuated from a smoke filled Metro subway tunnel . Area: A woman coughs hard as she and another woman speaks on the phone during the evacuation of people from the smoke-filled Metro subway tunnel in Washington . City: The scaffolding surrounding the top of the U.S. Capitol is seen in the background with a number of police cars parked in front of L'Enfant subway station .","L'Enfant Plaza was evacuated on Monday afternoon after thick smoke filled the station .

"Britain would be more at risk to terrorism if it leaves the European Union, Ed Miliband suggested today. The Labour leader said it was 'much better working across borders' as he was questioned about the threat to the UK in the wake of the attacks in Paris which 17 people dead. Labour was accused of 'distastefully' using the atrocities for political gain, as Downing Street announced police and security agencies are to carry out new training exercises to prepare for marauding gun attacks and hostage crises which last for days. Ed Miliband said it was 'much better working across borders' as he was questioned about the threat to the UK in the wake of the attacks in Paris which 17 people dead . David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. But Labour has not matched the promise of a vote, insisting Britain must remain in the 28-nation bloc. Mr Miliband suggested that politicians who recommend leaving the EU risk making the country more vulnerable to terrorism. The Labour leader, who was in Paris yesterday to show solidarity after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, said cross-border co-operation over security was crucial. Speaking at a town hall-style event with voters in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Mr Miliband reiterated that he wanted the UK to stay in the EU. 'Think about terrorism and counter-terrorism. We are much better working across borders to do that,' he said. 'Think about our economy... I just think we are much, much better working within the EU than not.' The comments sparked claims that Labour was trying to suggest a referendum would put public safety and national security at risk. However, a senior Labour source insisted Mr Miliband believes 'security is one of the issues where working across the EU shows its obvious benefits'. The source added: 'We all remember from 7/7 that the European arrest warrant (EAW) played a vital role in bringing those suspects back to Britain. The EAW has been a very useful tool in dealing with security issues since it was introduced.' Pressed on whether that meant politicians who wanted Britain to leave the EU were endangering people, the source said: 'I wouldn't back away from that interpretation. 'I think security is an important part of what the EU does.' A senior Labour source insisted Mr Miliband believes 'security is one of the issues where working across the EU shows its obvious benefits' But Matthew Elliott, chief executive of pro-referendum group Business for Britain, said: 'It's pretty distasteful to insinuate that Britain's security would be put at risk by holding an EU referendum. A referendum is our best bet at securing lasting reform in the EU. 'If Ed Miliband is against giving people a say on Britain's membership of the EU, then he should be honest with the public about his reasons why. 'He certainly shouldn't try to scare them at a time when we need a grown-up debate about the serious threats to our national security, not hot air from politicians.' Mr Cameron today held talks with spy chiefs to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence'. Training exercises involving the police, military and security agencies will be adapted in the wake of the murderous attacks in France last week which left 17 victims dead. David Cameron today held talks with spy chiefs to step up Britain's defences against the threat posed by a 'fanatical death cult of Islamist extremist violence' Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon were among the senior ministers who attended the briefing in Downing Street today . Home Secretary Theresa May and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon were joined by security agencies and Met Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan Howe for the briefing in Downing Street. Mr Cameron asked the police and military to 'continue to work closely together' to ensure that the police, who lead on counter-terror measures, can call on military back-up when needed across the country. Discussion centred on levels of preparedness for 'marauding' gun attacks, similar to those seen in Mumbai in 2008 when 164 people died in 12 shooting and bomb attacks over four days. Police and security agencies 'regularly' carry out training exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris, Downing Street said. 'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios.' It is understood that particular focus has been on the way brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi moved from central Paris after carrying out their attack on the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. They are said to have spent a night in woodland before trying to return to the capital, before becoming holed up on an industrial estate in the small town of Dammartin-en-Goele. Mr Miliband yesterday joined thousands of people on the streets of Paris to express solidarity with the victims of the Paris attacks . While thousands of French police were focussed there, Amedy Coulibaly took several people hostage in a Jewish supermarket in the Vincennes district of eastern Paris, stretching resources further. British security teams are to assess their own ability to carry out large scale searches in urban and rural areas and react to the challenge of an incident which lasts several days. A Downing Street spokesman said: 'The Prime Minister held a security meeting in Downing St this morning to review the Paris attacks and the risks to the UK of a similar attack. 'Following an intelligence update, they discussed the UK's preparedness for similar incidents. The relevant police and agencies regularly carry out exercises to test their response to a terror attack, including scenarios similar to the incidents in Paris. 'The meeting agreed that for future exercises, the relevant agencies should identify whether there are any further specific elements of the Paris attack that should be built into the exercise scenarios. 'The Prime Minister also asked the police and military to continue to work closely together to ensure that the police can call on appropriate military assistance when required across the country. 'They also discussed the risk posed by firearms, agreeing that our existing tough firearms laws are a very important part of the protections we have and that we should step up our efforts with other countries to crackdown on the illegal smuggling of weapons across borders.'","Labour leader says it is 'much better working across borders' in the EU .

"Scientists have discovered that throat singers such as the late Kongar-ol Ondar, have differently shaped vocal cords that allow them to make the deep hum . If you try to emulate the strange low songs of throat singers from Siberia, you will probably be disappointed. Scientists have discovered that the uniquely shaped vocal cords of people living in the Altai mountain region in southern Siberia means that only they can perform the eerie melodies composed centuries ago, which have been passed down generations. The distinctive noise comprising a low hum with several higher notes sounded simultaneously,   has featured in a song by Bjork, but hasn't popularly spread beyond the regions because only the people of southern Siberia and Tuva can make it. Scientists from the Institute of Philology of the Russian Academy of Sciences have discovered that native Turks have different vocal cords so only they can master the melodies, The Siberian Times reported. Their cords are slightly wider, with a shorter voice box, allowing natives to make the unique noise, which comes deep within the throat. Throat singers have been likened to ‘human bagpipes’ and can sing a long, low note, while making higher whistling notes and rhythm. The study suggests that people in Europe, for example, are unable to make the noises because of their differently shaped throats. It's believed that Mongolian men used songs to communicate across the vast, rugged landscape. They used natural features like mountains to ensure their voices carried long distances. Now experts think that the way the notes were sung gradually altered the structure of people’s throats in the region. The researchers also studied the speech of two residents in Kemerovo who speak Turkic Shor, which is spoken by around 2,800 people in south central Siberia and borrows many of its roots from Mongolian. They used digital radiography and MRI scans to study the vocal apparatus and the brain. The research took place in the laboratory of experimental phonetic studies, which, since its creation in the 1960s, has been used to describe the sound and features of more than 40 languages and dialects. Mongolian throat singing is a particular variant of overtone singing practiced by people in Mongolia and Tuva. It was added to the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Unesco in 2009. Throat singers make one or more pitches sounded simultaneously over a base note - producing a unique sound. It is not known when the practice originated, but it thought to have passed down generations of male herders for hundreds of years. Now women are using the technique too. The open landscape of Mongolia and southern Siberia allows the sounds to carry a great distance. It's thought human mimicry of nature's sounds is also at the root of throat singing.","People living in the Altai mountain region in southern Siberia have differently shaped vocal cords and voice boxes, a study has revealed .

"A nine-year-old boy had part of his skull transplanted into his stomach for three weeks, as part of a pioneering new operation to save his life. Jahfari Martin was severely injured when he was knocked off his bike by a car. As part of his treatment, surgeons removed a section of his skull and implanted it in his stomach for 'safe-keeping'. The surgery was necessary to relieve pressure after Jahfari's brain became so swollen it was putting his life at risk. Paediatric neurological surgeons Aabir Chakraborty and Ryan Waters performed the operation at Southampton Children's Hospital. They gently removed the skin from Jahfari's forehead just above the eye line, then cut out a section of skull bigger than a adult's hand to help alleviate the pressure. Jahfari Martin, nine, was badly injured when he was knocked off his bike by a car. Surgeons removed part of his skull, implanting it into his stomach for 'safe-keeping' to relieve pressure on his brain . After 17 days in hospital paediatric neuro-surgeons at Southampton Children's Hospital replaced the piece of skull. The bone is stored in the abdomen because it is a sterile environment and lessens the chance it will be rejected by the body when it is reattached . Once it was removed the team created a pocket in the year five pupil's stomach and kept the pieces of bone there for 18 days until he had recovered sufficiently to have it replaced by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Ryan Waters. The unusual procedure is known as a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy and insertion of bone flap into anterior abdominal wall. Mr Chakraborty said: 'It's an elegant solution, particularly in children. 'Obviously you can't have someone without the bone in the long term. But we had to store the bone somewhere. 'In the past we used to put it in a medical freezer or use a tin plate which is custom built. 'There is a reasonably large pocket in the tummy. The magical thing about that is it is a sterile environment, it won't be rejected by the body and it is very straight forward to go back and take the bone out.' The operation was a complete success and Jahfari was discharged from the hospital three days later. Mr Chakraborty said that Jahfari was back to his old self and added: 'He looks brilliant.' The nine-year-old was on his way to a football match after school when he was struck by a car. He jumped on to a bike to catch up with friends, but didn't realise his brakes weren't working. He careered out into the road and into the path of a silver Vauxhall Corsa. Witnesses described seeing Jahfari hit the car's windscreen head first before being catapulted 15ft into the air before landing unconscious in the road. His mother Sheryl said the impact of her son's head had cracked the car's windscreen. Ryan Waters and Aabir Chakraborty performed the unusual procedure, known as a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy, at Southampton Children's Hospital . 'He jumped on a bike but didn't know there were no brakes on it,' she said. 'He had his hands on the brakes and tried to stop the bike, but couldn't stop it and went straight into the road. He was at full throttle.' Emergency services rushed to the scene in  Southampton and Jahfari was taken by ambulance to Southampton Children's Hospital. There he was passed to Mr Chakraborty, who has worked at the hospital for two years. After suffering a head injury in the crash doctors noticed a build up of pressure on Jahfari's brain. After attempting to reduce the swelling by putting the nine-year-old into a medically induced coma, specialists decided to attempt the unusual procedure a bi-frontal decompressive craniectomy and insertion of bone flap into anterior abdominal wall. Paediatric neurological surgeons Aabir Chakraborty and Ryan Waters performed the operation at Southampton Children's Hospital. They gently removed the skin from Jahfari's forehead just above the eye line, then cut out a section of skull bigger than a adult's hand to help alleviate the pressure. Once it was removed the team created a pocket in the year five pupil's stomach and kept the pieces of bone there for 18 days until he had recovered sufficiently to have it replaced by consultant paediatric neurosurgeon Mr Waters. The consultant knew immediately that Jahfari had a 'very, very nasty injury' which was causing pressure to build up in his brain because of the swelling caused by the serious bruising. 'It was life and death,' said the surgeon. 'The skull stops the pressure being relieved, hence pressure in the head rises, stopping blood coming into the brain and eventually you will die. 'Jahfari was going in and out of consciousness - he was on the brink of going into a coma.' The schoolboy was immediately given medication to ease the swelling but the next day Mr Chakraborty hooked the youngster up to breathing apparatus and put him into a medically-induced comma to relax the brain and help ease the pressure. His team then performed an image-guided insertion of an external ventricular drain, where they tried to insert a tiny tube into the brain to drain the fluid out. Although the procedure was a success, the football-mad youngster did not show signs of recovering. 'Despite the procedure, the pressure was still unacceptably high,' said Mr Chakraborty. 'In those situations you only have one option and that is to remove a very large amount of bone from his skull.' He removed a section of Jahfari's skull, implanting it into the nine-year-old's stomach, a sterile environment that prevents the body from rejecting the bone. The Chelsea FC football fan spent a total of 17 days in hospital, but his time there was brightened up when his big brother Tre, 18, managed to get his hero and Chelsea captain, John Terry, to send Jahfari a get well soon card. Today all that remains of Jahfari's ordeal is a long red scar hidden by his hair line. He is back at school but has to wait for a year before he can get back on the football pitch . His mother Sheryl said: 'He got the letter from John Terry wishing him well and telling him to get well soon and that made him really happy. 'He is Chelsea all the way - he has Oscar and David Luiz  printed on his wall.' Now, three months after the operation Jahfari is back at school and life is returning to almost normal - the young striker cannot play football for a year until he gets the all clear from the hospital. 'He has had to quit football for a year and Jahfari is very upset about that,' said Sheryl. 'He has been on trial with different clubs and had only just started with Eastleigh FC. 'He is really worried about going back. He loves playing football - he is very good. The 38-year-old mother-of-three thanked the team at the hospital, which specialises in children's neurosurgery, for returning her son to health. 'I am just so happy he is alive,' she said. 'I wake up every day and praise God and the surgeons. 'I had a lot of worries but now I worry about different things like being the perfect mum, making sure he is not in danger, making sure he is safe.' Today all that remains of Jaffy's ordeal is a long red scar underneath his hairline showing where part of his skull was temporarily removed. 'The miracle was that there were no other injuries,' said Sheryl at the family home in Sholing, Southampton. 'At the hospital they prepared me for lots of horrible things - they said it could take six months to a year before he was ready to leave. 'Every mother prays for their child but I feel I had the Lord's prayer tattooed to my brain. 'I slept in the chapel at the hospital most nights - it was quite an ordeal. 'It's changed me so much as a person.'","Jahfari Martin was knocked off his bike by a car, causing a head injury .

"Elaine Frazer, from Lisburn in Northern Ireland, had breast cancer at 40 . Even when it's raining, Elaine Frazer refuses her husband's offer of a lift to work. She'd rather take the 20-minute walk because she is determined to stay well. The 45-year-old shop assistant from Lisburn in Northern Ireland hasn't always been so conscientious about her health. For years until recently she often spent her evenings on the sofa munching fatty snacks in front of the TV, even after a meal. By her late 30s she was 16st. At 5ft 10in her BMI was over 32 - officially obese. 'I felt sluggish and tired, but I put it down to the fact I was getting older.' Then when she was 40, she noticed a lump by her right nipple. To her horror, tests showed it was breast cancer. 'They told me they had caught it early, but all I could think about was my son, Anthony. He was only 14, and I just kept thinking: ""I'm never going to see him grow up or have a family"",' says Elaine, who is married to Michael, 53, a printer. After her diagnosis in September 2009, Elaine underwent a lumpectomy, chemotherapy and then, in February 2010, radiotherapy. Doctors gave her a good prognosis, but she was concerned that the cancer might return. She was told she'd be given the drug tamoxifen and six-monthly mammograms, but she wanted more reassurance. Then, in March 2010, during an appointment a doctor said something that resonated. 'She said: ""You have another chance at life if you change your lifestyle."" It really hit home.' There are more cancer survivors like Elaine than ever before - two million in the UK. Forty years ago, three-quarters of people diagnosed with cancer died within ten years. Now, according to the latest figures from Cancer Research UK, half of all those diagnosed with cancer will be alive ten years later. However, people who have had cancer once are statistically more likely to get it again. This may be because the treatment itself, such as radiotherapy, increases the risk of another cancer, or because the lifestyle factor that contributed to their cancer in the first place is still not addressed. They are also more prone to other diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis. This, too, can sometimes be due to cancer treatment. Elaine pictured with her mother, Brenda, while Elaine had cancer . For example certain cancer drugs weaken bones, raising the risk of osteoporosis; and women who have had breast cancer treatment are prone to putting on weight due to steroid or hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen, and this may increase the risk of diabetes. A report published last week by the charity Macmillan Cancer Support revealed that one in four patients faces long-term illness or disability as a result of treatment for the disease. Now, however, scientists are starting to identify what can be done to help keep former cancer patients well and reduce their risk of cancer returning. 'Research has been accelerating rapidly,' says Dr Kate Wolin, an epidemiologist based at Loyola University, Chicago, who has studied how to improve quantity and quality of life for cancer survivors. 'Whereas the World Cancer Research Fund [the global authority on cancer] has been issuing advice on cancer prevention for years, only in the past two years have they issued advice on survivorship as they feel they finally have enough information to make recommendations.' These include eating a largely plant-based diet, maintaining a healthy weight and getting regular physical activity. Following these guidelines can reduce the risk of cancer recurring two to three fold, and can reduce the risk of illness from cancer or other causes by 34 per cent, says Dr Sorrell Burden, a dietitian who has conducted cancer research and works at Central Manchester University Hospitals. Meanwhile, a study published in the British Journal of Cancer in 2012 found that a diet with a high intake of vegetables, fruit, vegetable oil, and soups reduced the risk of cancer recurrence by 29 per cent compared with a standard Western diet high in red and processed meat and deep fried foods. Now, she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st . Why is still not clear, but one emerging theory is that these foods trigger inflammation, which can boost cancer cell growth. But it is physical activity that provides some of the best evidence for helping cancer survivors. The authors of a report for Macmillan Cancer Care refer to it as the 'underrated wonder drug'. Last year experts at Macmillan calculated that walking a mile a day at a steady 3mph - roughly a 30-minute walk - could cut the risk of breast cancer recurring by 40 per cent. And for women actually undergoing breast cancer treatment it could cut the risk of dying from the disease by 40 per cent. Meanwhile, a U.S. study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2011, which followed more than 2,000 prostate cancer survivors over 18 years, found that those who did more than three hours a week of vigorous activity such as swimming, tennis or cycling cut their risk of dying from their cancer by 61 per cent. Bowel cancer patients who do around six hours of moderate intensity physical activity a week such as cycling, jogging or walking could help reduce their risk of dying from the disease by around 50 per cent, according to a review of 60 studies entitled The Impact of Physical Activity on Improving Cancer Survivorship. Quite why exercise should be so effective at preventing cancer returning is unclear, says Professor Jane Maher a consultant oncologist and joint medical officer for Macmillan. It's not simply about keeping weight down (being overweight is a risk factor for some cancers, including breast). 'Physical activity has an impact as it can reduce levels of hormones such as oestrogen that are known to stimulate cancer. Another theory is that exercise reduces inflammation and makes it harder for cancer cells to take hold and grow.' For Dr Wolin, 'the surprising thing is that despite this new emerging research about the benefits of lifestyle, researchers' focus is still on drugs - unlike drugs, lifestyle options have no side-effects and the benefits are enormous'. Indeed a healthy lifestyle can have an effect 'comparable to drugs,' adds Professor Maher. 'That is not to say they can replace them - but they do have a comparable effect.' She now encourages all but her very ill patients to stay active throughout their treatment and beyond. 'Having looked at the data I now always recommend physical activity,' she says. 'Walking can make a big difference and it is so simple. You don't have to slip into Lycra and go to the gym every day to make this impact, any form of physical activity helps.' Pictured with her husband Michael and son Antony while she had cancer . Considering the benefits from diet and exercise, experts say not enough patients are issued with this advice. Currently, only those with certain types of cancer, for instance colon or stomach, are routinely given advice about what to eat, says Dr Burden. 'At the moment patients often get their advice from the TV or the media or magazines, whereas it would be better if it came from health professionals.' And yet a survey by Macmillan of 400 health professionals, found that one in ten still believed it more important for patients to rest during treatment - when the key seems to be staying active not just after treatment but during it, too. Only 6 per cent tell patients of the benefits of physical activity - and half admit they know little if anything about the benefits for cancer patients. Professor Maher says things have improved slightly since this survey was conducted in 2011, with more GPs and oncologists now giving exercise advice, but adds: 'It is still the case that advice about exercise is not being included in information for patients.' The proportion of breast, prostate and skin cancer sufferers alive five years after diagnosis . U.S. research shows that support is crucial, with those given counselling about how to lose weight and get more physically active, having lower levels of an inflammatory marker linked to breast cancer, than those just given a leaflet. Yet too often a leaflet is all that patients such as Elaine get. 'I didn't really know what I should or should not be eating, so looked it up in books and on the internet,' she says. 'Before cancer, my only vegetable intake was maybe some carrots with dinner, but now half my plate is vegetables of all kinds.' She also started walking, aiming to take 10,000 steps a day. Now 45, she used every ounce of determination to slim down to 13st. 'When I went for my five years check-up the nurse said I had done really well and that by taking the weight off, and getting more active I had substantially reduced my risk of the cancer returning. 'If I hadn't changed my lifestyle - it could have been very different.' For information packs about physical activity go to macmillan.org.uk/movemore . Or call the Macmillan helpline, 0808 808 0000.

"Hacking group Anonymous claims to have closed down its first extremist website after launching an online war in retaliation for the Charlie Hebdo massacre. The campaign group posted a tweet on the account @OpCharlieHebdo boasting it had crippled the French terrorist website ansar-alhaqq.net. It came with the hashtag #TangoDown and the message: 'Expect us. #JeSuisCharlie' - a reference to the campaign of solidarity launched worldwide in the wake of the atrocity. The ansar-alhaqq.net page remains down, instead directing to the search engine DuckDuckGo.

It is not clear exactly how the site was brought down, but Anonymous has previously used a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) that overloads the website with vast amounts of data. The group last week promised a 'war on jihadists' in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, which left 12 people dead when gunmen stormed the offices of the satirical magazine. In the clip, which was uploaded to the group's Belgian YouTube account, a figure wearing the group's Guy Fawkes mask and a hood says in French in an electronically-distorted voice: 'We are declaring war against you, the terrorists.' Sitting at a desk and reading from a piece of paper, the figure says the group will track down and close all accounts on social networks related to terrorists to avenge those killed.

"Hodan Abby fled to Syria with her friend Hafsa Mohamed (pictured) last month . The parents of a young Sydney woman who fled to Syria to offer herself as a jihadi bride to Islamic State militants, have travelled to the Middle East to search for their daughter and attempt to bring her back to Australia. It comes after Hodan Abby, 18, and her friend Hafsa Mohamed, 20, slipped out of the country last month after the pair had reportedly told their parents they were going on a holiday. After discovering that their daughter had crossed the Turkish border and made her way into Syria, the news left her parents feeling 'devastated'. It is believed that Ms Abby's father is still on a desperate search in Middle East while her mother has returned to their Western Sydney home, the Daily Telegraph reports. While her friend Ms Mohamed, who was a childcare worker took to the internet to look for a husband, who were heading to the Middle East before she disappeared, adding that she longed to be a martyr 'for the sake of Allah'. 'If any mature guy wanting to go to Syria or Palestine would propose I would accept without a thought though he should be on his dean and must have a beard,' Hafsa wrote, according to News Corp. 'Pray that my dream of going to Syria is fulfilled. I want to bring it up with my mum but I'm afraid to do so … Australia is nice but I would rather be in Syria. '… How great to be martyred for the sake of Allah and going into a transaction with him by giving him your life and he will repay you with Jannah.' Scroll down for video . The parents of a Sydney woman, who fled to join the Islamic State and offer herself as a jihadi bride, has travelled to Syria in search of their daughter. Pictured: An Islamic State of Iraq fighter in the city of Mosul . Hafsa's family last heard from her about one week ago, when she texted them to say she had crossed the Turkish border into Syria. Pictured: Islamic State fighters marching in Raqqa, Syria . She and her friend could face up to 10 years in jail if they try to return to Australia. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop admitted last month, that the reports of young Australians travelling overseas to join the Islamic State is a 'deeply disturbing phenomenon', the Sunday Telegraph wrote. 'We are now seeing examples of young women being radicalised and travelling to Syria and Iraq to take part in fighting for listed terrorists organisations,' she said. It came just a day after the father of  Australian jihadist Amira Karroum, who was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in  Syria, said he planned to sue the Australian government for his 'angel's' death. Amira Karroum was killed in January after joining her radicalised husband and al-Qaeda fighters in Syria . Educated at an Anglican private school in Queensland, Amira Karroum became a devout Muslim, donning the hijab, after moving to Sydney with her sister in 2011 . During an explosive interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, Mohamed Karroum said he blames Australian authorities for his daughter's death because they allowed radical Islamic recruiters into the country and they 'allowed her to leave'. In one shocking comment, an angry Mr Karroum told journalist Lisa Goddard: 'I'm praying to the Lord every day, Tony Abbott, please Lord, let him lose one of his daughter, either in sickness or in accident or something, please Lord.' 'The Australian government is the mother and father of her, they are the ones who control everything in this country,' Mr Karroum told A Current Affair. 'I want to take the federal government to court; they are responsible for the death of my daughter.' In an interview on Channel Nine's A Current Affair program, a grieving Mohamed Karroum says the Australian government has his daughter's blood on its hands . Amira, 22, described by her father as a 'beautiful girl' who loved barbecues and dancing with her friends, was in war-torn Syria with her new  husband Tyler Perry, also known as Yusef Ali. The pair met and married in 2013, before Ali travelled to fight with al-Qaeda in Syria. After the Australian government stopped Amira from trying to leave the country on two occasions, she told family she was going to meet Ali for a vacation in Copenhagen. Her body was found shot and dismembered beside her husband's   in a house in Aleppo, just three weeks after she left Australia. Mohammed Karroum recalled the last message his daughter sent him shortly before her death. 'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' he recalled. He says he 'just can't believe' his daughter became an al-Qaeda fighter. Mohamed Karroum says Yusef Ali, a known extremist, 'poisoned' his daughter's mind . One of the posts from Amira's Facebook page, where she said she worked as a 'Slave of Allah' Mohamed Karroum believes Ali was a trained al-Qaeda killer who was known to Australian authorities. 'I believe she was sacrificed because they were trying to take somebody to court, and they knew she would lead them to him,' he said. 'The Australian Federal Police and ASIO are not doing their job, this is the fact.' He is now looking for a lawyer to help him take the federal government to court. 'I want an apology, that's number one, for killing my daughter.'","Hodan Abby slipped out of the country last month to become a jihadi bride .

"Home ownership may be what many Australians dream of but the reality of how much your castle will finally cost reads more like a nightmare, as a mortgage of less than $500,000 will actually set you back more than $1 million by the time it's paid. Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert with finder.com.au, told Daily Mail Australia that the hefty price tag 'is not meant to put people off but show home-owners they have options'. Their research found that Australians with a mortgage of at least $489,300 will cost $1 million over the life of a 30-year loan, using the average variable interest rate of about 5.5 per cent. Scroll down for video . An Australian mortgage of less than $500,000 will actually set you back more than $1 million by the time it's paid . Michelle Hutchison, Money Expert with finder.com.au, told Daily Mail Australia that the hefty price tag 'is not meant to put people off but show home-owners they have options' Sydney tops the list for the most expensive median house price of $825,000  and for this price tag, borrowers will hit the $1 million mark by year 11 . If this mortgage size was 80 per cent of the property's value, that means any property priced from $611,625 will end up costing borrowers $1 million. Ms Hutchison, said many borrowers are being stung by this slow-burning hole in their hip pocket but it doesn't have to be that way. 'The fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering, there's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates,' she said. 'When borrowers look at how much they can afford to repay for a home loan, they might not look down the track to how much they end up spending. The danger lies with spending a lot more than necessary. Sydney: $825,000 ($1.349 million) Melbourne: $633,000 ($1.035 million) Perth: $530,000 ($866,673) Brisbane: $475,000 ($776,735) Adelaide: $421,000 ($688,433) *Based on mortgage with 20% deposit paid over 30 year term and median house price . 'While it’s likely that your home will increase in value over a 30-year loan term, it might not compensate the cost of a home loan as the money you end up spending can be greatly increased if you have a small deposit and don’t shop around for a good value deal,' she said. Her other big tip is to pay that little bit extra each month or every week. 'Just $50 a month on a $489,300 loan can make a huge difference and will save you $26,000 over time,' she said. Ms Hutchison added that an extra $50 a week on the mortgage can trim almost $100,000 by the end. She also urged borrowers to haggle. 'Review your home loan very year, just by arguing with your current lender and getting 10 basis points trimmed, can work,' she added. 'And keep on top of your mortgage, if you get a reduction, make sure it doesn't get absorbed when rates fall. 'There are plenty of options and the lenders know that, so threaten to leave in the nicest possible way - the lenders are clever and know their competition, so use that leverage as a bargaining tool.' 'The fact is that there is such a huge difference in what lenders are offering, there's thousands of types of loans out there and different interest rates,' Michelle Hutchison said . Finder states that: 'Across the country, Sydney tops the list for the most expensive median house price of $825,000 according to figures by CoreLogic RP Data. For this price tag, borrowers will hit the $1 million mark by year 11, based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 percent, with a 20 percent deposit which would mean a loan size of $660,000.' For the median-priced house in Melbourne of $633,000, a mortgage of $506,400 (with a 20 per cent deposit) would cost borrowers $1.035 million over 30 years, hitting the $1 million mark by year 24. 'This research was based on the average variable rate of about 5.5 per cent but borrowers need to remember that there’s a big difference between what lenders are offering, which can mean bigger costs for a home if you’re not careful,' she added. 'Take advantage of the on-line tools and comparisons of different home loans to help you find the best value deals.

"Sadhana Press had become increasingly breathless . As she strolled around the ancient city of Petra, Sadhana Press expected to be overwhelmed by her surroundings. But all she could focus on was her breathlessness, and how she simply couldn't seem to get enough air into her lungs. This wasn't the first time the 61-year-old from Harrow, London, had found herself out of puff. For the past few months, she'd become increasingly breathless, especially at work, while rushing about in her job as a restaurant manager. Initially, she had blamed this on the fact she was overweight, but on that holiday in Jordan last March, the mother-of-two realised it must be more serious. Back home, her GP referred her for an echocardiogram, where ultrasound is used to examine the heart's structure, and an angiogram, an X-ray where a special dye is injected into the blood to check the arteries of the heart. The tests revealed that Sadhana was suffering from heart failure. This affects about 800,000 Britons, and occurs when the heart muscle becomes damaged and weakened, and blood is no longer pumped around the body properly. This triggers breathlessness and fatigue as well as swelling in the feet and ankles (fluid accumulates as the heart is no longer able to pump it around the body, and gravity causes it to pool here). The most common causes of heart failure include high blood pressure, heart disease, a previous heart attack, heart rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or faulty heart valves. Treatments involve medications such as ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to lower blood pressure and regulate heart rate. Sadhana has a new type of heart failure that predominantly affects women and unfortunately there are few treatment options. That is because this type of heart failure doesn't cause the heart to become enlarged, as is typical, but instead causes it to stiffen and shrink. With a healthy heart, with every heartbeat the two large 'pumping' chambers of the heart - the ventricles - contract forcefully, propelling blood out to the body and lungs. This surge of blood is what we feel as our pulse. Between each heartbeat the ventricles rapidly relax, allowing them to fill with blood ready for the next heart beat. With heart failure, typically the heart muscle thickens in an effort to create more power to pump blood around the body - but while this sounds helpful, the increase in size actually makes the heart less efficient at pumping blood, and so further exacerbates symptoms. Doctors often diagnose heart failure when a heart appears large on a scan. But doctors now know that not all cases cause the heart to enlarge. She was suffering from new type of heart failure which causes the organ to stiffen and shrink . In fact, in some cases the heart stays the same size or shrinks, explains Dr Alex Lyon, consultant cardiologist at the Royal Brompton Hospital, London. 'Over the past decade, it's become apparent that a large proportion of people arriving at hospital with heart failure don't have enlarged hearts,' says Dr Lyon, who is also a British Heart Foundation senior lecturer at Imperial College London. These patients have a different type of heart failure, where the ventricles become stiff and so can't relax between beats. They're unable to fill properly with blood, so less blood is pumped around the body. The exact reason for this stiffening is unknown, but it's thought that a mesh of scar tissue, triggered by damage from conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or obesity, forms between the muscle cells of the heart. This stiffness causes the heart to appear smaller (though both types of heart failure trigger the same symptoms). And because it seems to affect women more than men, particularly older women, some experts refer to it informally as 'old lady heart syndrome'. 'It sums up the type of patient affected - female, over-70 and also often with a history of high blood pressure,' explains Richard Bogle, a cardiologist from St Helier Hospital in Epsom, Surrey. Why this condition affects more women is unknown, though the menopause may play a role as this triggers a drop in oestrogen, a hormone that helps protect the heart. The classic form of heart failure (previously known as systolic heart failure but now called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction - HFrEF) was thought to be by far the most usual, but doctors realise that this newer type may be much more common than once thought. 'In one U.S. study involving 12,000 patients with heart failure, a third were found to have the type of heart failure where the heart is not enlarged. The strong risk predictors for this were found to be ageing, being a woman and a history of high blood pressure or diabetes,' says Dr Lyon. 'In July, we reviewed the admissions of heart failure patients from eight London hospitals and the surrounding area and found one in five had this type of heart failure.' Some estimates suggest that, for some unknown reason, the condition - known as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF - is rising at a greater rate than classic heart failure. Last year, U.S. doctors, writing in the Journal Of The American College of Cardiology, said: 'Among elderly women living in the community, HFpEF comprises nearly 90 per cent of new heart failure cases.' But despite warnings that the condition is on the rise, it may still not be diagnosed, says Dr Bogle. 'If you're not a cardiologist interested or aware of this condition, you may just miss it.' A new treatment to destroy nerves around the kidney is being trialled . This stems from how heart failure is detected. Doctors use an echocardiogram to calculate the percentage of blood in the heart that is pumped out with each beat. This is called the ejection fraction, and is thought to be around 55-65 per cent in a healthy person. However, Dr Lyon says experts are realising that ejection fraction is a crude measure of heart function. Furthermore, while ejection fraction is reduced in classic heart failure, it is normal in the newer type of heart failure, leading to patients wrongly being told their hearts are healthy. Although the tests suggested that the amount of blood was being pumped out of the heart was normal, their overall heart function is impaired, leading to breathlessness. 'When a patient is found to have a heart that is a normal size and with a normal ejection fraction, they may be told their breathlessness isn't their heart,' says Dr Lyon. He believes that patients with suspected heart failure should have their heart stiffness calculated by using an echocardiogram to measure how much the heart contracts with each beat, as well as a blood test that tests for levels of a substance called natriuretic peptide, which helps give an indication of heart function. For reasons that are largely unknown, none of the treatments that works in classic heart failure works in HFpEF. However, reducing salt intake has been shown to be beneficial explains Dr Bogle, as it helps lower blood pressure. 'American cardiologists say they see a big surge after Thanksgiving, because elderly women with this condition have been eating salty snacks, which raises blood pressure and makes their symptoms worse.' Doctors are trialling a new treatment at the Royal Brompton Hospital using high frequency energy waves to destroy nerves around the kidney. It seems these nerves mistakenly tell the brain to send the body into 'emergency mode', which increases heart rate and raises blood pressure, placing even greater strain on the heart. The theory is that cutting off certain nerve signals will improve heart failure symptoms in both types of the condition. The trial is due to be published next year, but early results are promising. If they prove positive, a larger, placebo-controlled study will follow. Sadhana underwent the hour-long procedure as part of the trial in August, under local anaesthetic. Within a month her breathlessness had improved. 'Even opening the car door would leave me tired. Now I'm back to my old self.'","Sadhana Press, 61, from Harrow, had become increasingly breathless .

"Boxing legend James ‘Buster’ Douglas stunned the world when he knocked out previously undefeated champion Mike Tyson in what became one of the biggest upsets in the sport’s history. But while Tyson – nicknamed ‘The Baddest Man on the Planet’ - went on to have a long and lucrative career both in and out of the ring, boxing hero Douglas’ moment in the spotlight was short lived. In the years after his historic victory, his boxing career came crashing down and the heavyweight champion fell into a pit of drinking, binge-eating and depression. He struggled to cope with losing both his parents and the shooting deaths of two of his brothers. Scroll down for video . Pow! James ""Buster"" Douglas, right, hits Mike Tyson with a hard right in the face during their world heavyweight title bout at Tokyo Dome on Feb. 11, 1990. It was one of the biggest upsets in the sport’s history . Sore loser: 'Tyson  was upset that I beat him,' says Douglas. 'He was whining and complaining like a baby' Bet on it: Casinos in Las Vegas refused to even offer odds on the championship fight with Tyson, so certain they were that Iron Mike would annihilate his opposition . Out of control: At his lowest point Douglas ballooned to almost 450 pounds and slipped into a diabetic coma that almost killed him . At his lowest point Douglas ballooned to almost 450 pounds and slipped into a diabetic coma that almost killed him. Now as the 25th anniversary of the dramatic fight approaches, Douglas is celebrating getting a ‘second chance at life’ and admits that life outside the ring has been much harder than his ten hard fought rounds with boxing giant Tyson. ‘Life is definitely harder than fighting Tyson or anyone else,’ he told DailyMail.com. ‘Life outside the ring is real, it’s hardcore. ‘But you know once I came out of my depression, and quit drinking all the time, I felt like I got a second lease at life. ‘I look forward to every day now.’ Douglas, 54, who lives in his hometown of Columbus, Ohio, was the 42 to 1 outsider when he entered the ring In Tokyo, Japan on February 11, 1990 to take on the world champion in a match billed as ‘Tyson is back’. Most casinos in Las Vegas had refused to even offer odds on the fight, so certain they were that Tyson would annihilate his opposition. But Douglas had trained hard and despite losing his beloved mother Lula to a stroke just 23 days before the fight, he was sharply focused. Recovering from a knock down in the eighth round, Douglas claimed victory a minute into round 10, slamming ‘Iron Mike’ Tyson to the ground with a flurry of powerful punches. Champion:  In the years after his historic victory,  Douglas' boxing career came crashing down as the heavyweight champion fell into a pit of drinking, binge-eating and depression . Even now, Douglas still remembers the jubilation of that night, the crowd chanting his name, as he became heavyweight champion of the world. “It was just great - I have great memories of that night, the preparation, just focusing, feeling good about going in there and doing something everybody thought was impossible,” he said. “I fought hard that night, I was in shape and he went down.” But Tyson was not willing to hand over his title that easily, and soon after the fight launched a campaign to strip Douglas of the title – claiming he should have been counted out in the eighth round. Although Tyson ultimately lost the appeal – it spoiled what should have been a night of celebration for Douglas and embroiled him in a legal battle that lasted months. Even now, Douglas brands Tyson a ‘sore loser’ and admits the pair barely spoke to each other when they met for the first time since the fight two years ago. ‘He’s a big time sore loser,’ Douglas said. ‘He was upset that night I beat him. He was whining and complaining like a baby in a crib. ‘It was an enjoyable win, having everyone chanting my name, but after that I was stuck in a legal battle for about four months trying get the right to call myself champion of the world so that was pretty difficult. ‘I still celebrated with my trainer and stuff but it did spoil it. ‘I met Tyson in Cinncinati a couple of years ago at a boxing event and took pictures and stuff. He didn’t say much - we didn’t speak much at all in fact.’ Just months after beating Tyson, Douglas lost his title to Evander Holyfield in a championship match on October 25, 1990, and the boxing hero’s life began spiraling downwards. Coach: Douglas is now training his son Artie, 21,  at the Thompson Recreation Center. The dad-of-four, who lives with wife Bertha, has now successfully battled his demons and has found a new lease of life . The former champ and now coach hopes Artie and son  Kevin, 9, follow in his footsteps . Still struggling to deal with the death of his mother – Douglas, a diabetic, stopped training, began downing bottles of cognac and beer – and his weight doubled to nearly 450 pounds. Then finally in 1994, Douglas, who had always managed his diabetes well, hit rock bottom and slipped into a near fatal diabetic coma. ‘I was drinking and eating whatever I wanted. I just didn’t give a darn. I was depressed. ‘It was never about money I was financially secure, it’s just the way everything didn’t go as I planned after I won that title, then there was the readjustment to get over that, but I kept wallowing in self pity. ‘My lowest point was when I went into the diabetic coma. ‘I put on all that weight and I almost passed away. But I got a second chance and I came through. ‘I woke up after being in the coma for about three days and I decided right there and then it was my time to get back on the horse and start riding again instead of sitting around moping and feeling bad about myself.’ As well as surviving the coma, Douglas has had more than his fair share of personal tragedies to cope with. His father Bill, who was also Douglas’ trainer and manager died in 1999 after a hard cancer battle. And two of his brothers were shot dead in separate incidents. ‘My youngest brother was shot in 1981 and my brother who was a year younger than me he was shot in 1998. ‘It’s been hard to deal with. But we just keep the faith and keep moving on it’s all we can do.’ Evander Holyfield took the title away from Douglas just months after he won it, slamming the former heavyweight champ  with a right punch in the third and final round of their title fight in Las Vegas . Douglas believes it was a combination of tragedies and setbacks that drove him to drink. ‘It was depression, the way everything went, my boxing career, the way everything came crashing to an end. ‘I was really down about everything but I didn’t really have anyone to talk to about it. My wife was always someone I talked to and confided in but she wasn’t around then so I had to just get through it. ‘I just had to get back involved in life, back involved with my family and I did. ‘After my coma I decided to look at the brighter side of life, how fortunate a person I am and ever since then I’ve lived a wonderful life.’ The dad-of-four, who lives with wife Bertha, has now successfully battled his demons and has found a new lease of life as a boxing coach. He coaches amateur and professional boxers from his gym in Columbus – including two of his sons Kevin, nine, and Artie, 21, who he hopes may follow in his footsteps. ‘I have a couple of professional fighters who I manage and I also coach amateur fighters trying to create a dynasty here. ‘I’m really enjoying working with these kids – it’s like full circle for me coming back to the place where I started and I’m having a blast. ‘It’s like I’m going all over again from the beginning but I’m at the end - I’m the coach now. ‘I know what all the kids are going through because I’ve been there done that. ‘When they struggle I tell them it’s going to be alright - that there will be better days ahead.’","James ‘Buster’ Douglas stunned the world when he knocked out undefeated champion Mike Tyson in 1990 .

"A woman has been jailed after she bit off another woman's ear while the pair's partners were fighting in a drunken pub brawl. Paula Hammond attacked Gail Lowe at a working men's club and proceeded to sink her teeth into the victim's ear as their spouses argued about a pint of beer. The 42-year-old attacker told Mrs Lowe she would 'bite her f***ing ear off' and repeatedly punched her, before tearing off a chunk of flesh and spitting it out. A bystander put the piece of ear into a glass to preserve it, and the organ was re-attached during an operation which required Mrs Lowe, 39, to have 30 stitches. Warning: graphic content . Assault: Gail Lowe, left, had part of her ear bitten off by Paula Hammond, right, at a working men's club . The victim is still undergoing reconstructive surgery, and has suffered lasting psychological damage due to the traumatic assault at the the Alverthorpe Working Men's Club in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. Hammond, a shopkeeper, had denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent, claiming she was acting in self-defence, but was found guilty at Leeds Crown Court last Friday and sentenced to five years in prison. Graham O'Sullivan, prosecuting, said that the attack came after Mrs Lowe had gone to the club with her husband Dean, 42, to watch a gig in November 2013. He added: 'During the evening the victim's husband got into an altercation with a man. Paula Hammond then assaulted her. Horror: Mrs Lowe's ear pictured after the assault, which took place in November 2013 . 'They fell to the floor or into a table. It was at this point Miss Hammond threatened to ""bite her f***ing ear off"". 'One witness saw her biting her ear. There was after that several punches delivered to Mrs Lowe's head.' He continued: 'The severed ear was picked up by someone who had the presence of mind to put it into a glass.' He said the victim later needed 'something in the region of 30 stitches in the hope it would heal', adding: 'Mrs Lowe has been left with an area of tissue which is dead and has needed reconstruction which is ongoing.' Defence barrister James Littlehales claimed the offence came 'on the spur of the moment', adding: 'This clearly is a tragic case for all concerned. It is a very unusual case for a woman and totally out of character. 'She has appreciated what she has done and its psychological effect effect on the victim. She has genuine remorse.' Judge Neil Clark told Hammond: 'You have been convicted of a very serious offence. 'Gail Lowe described being hit on the hit on the back of the head and falling forwards. She remembers you shouting you were going to bite her ear off. 'The witness could see your jaw moving. It was clearly a deliberate act. You then delivered a number of punches to her and walked away without showing any emotion.' He told her that her five-year prison sentence had been aggravated by the fact that she was drunk at the time of the attack. Venue: The incident happened during a gig at the Alverthorpe Working Men's Club in Wakefield . Speaking after the case, Mrs Lowe said that she thought the row had been sparked by a misunderstanding after her husband picked up a drink belonging to Hammond's partner. 'No one really knows why the fight kicked off between our partners,' she said. 'It seems he got angry when Dean picked up his pint glass by accident.' The victim added: 'Life will never be the same again - the attack has affected me and all my family. I have teenage daughters and I get anxious every time they go out. 'I used to be a fairly confident person but my self-esteem has taken a big knock. I've been having counselling to help me move on. 'I've been left disfigured and obviously that's not a nice thing for a woman. I can't do little things like put my hair up because I'm worried people will look. 'Doctors said it would be impossible to re-attach my ear but I begged them to do it. They had to stretch the skin across as part of the reconstruction, but it's not the same shape as it used to be.' Mrs Lowe said that the trauma had been worsened by Hammond's refusal to accept responsibility for the crime. 'She should have just pleaded guilty,' she said. 'She wouldn't own up to it and now she's been given a longer sentence as a result.'","Paula Hammond, 42, jailed for five years over attack on Gail Lowe, 39 .

"Dr. Ben Carson, the rising African-American Republican star who is considering a run for the presidency, endorsed a nutritional supplement made by a firm embroiled in controversy, including claims that it's a pyramid scheme selling 'scam' products. The revelation will damage Carson's standing as a moral crusader who aims to put an unassailable face on the GOP's anti-Obamacare health policies and could tank his future political plans. Mannatech, a multi-level marketing sales company that sells weight-loss products, skin creams and so-called 'nutraceuticals.' Carson began his relationship with the firm in 2004, speaking at its annual sales conference, and gave repeat performances in 2011 and 2013. His business manager Armstrong Williams told National Review Online that 'the decision that has been made' that Carson's won't publicly address his relationship with the company, and insisted the appearances were arranged by an outside speaker's bureau that currently charges more than $40,000 per speech for his services. Former pediatric neurosurgeon and likely GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson fronted for Mannatech, a multi-level-marketing company that produces nutritional supplements with a checkered history . Ben Carson pushed Nutriverus, a product whose central claims have drawn skepticism from doctors and other scientists . 'All we know is that the Washington Speaker’s Bureau, which booked hundreds of speaking engagements for him through the year, booked these engagements,' Williams insisted. 'He had no idea who these people are.' Mannatech, whose name is a play on the heavenly food from the Bible, offers its flagship 'glyconutritional dietary supplement' Ambrotose by claiming it can 'improve your health with an advanced blend of saccharides.' 'Saccharide' is a synonym for sugar, and glyconutrients including eight common sugars including simple glucose. In a 2008 paper written for the journal 'Glycobiology,' Johns Hopkins University pharmacology professor Dr. Ronald Schnarr warned that 'people desperate for medical breakthroughs have spent billions of dollars to purchase plant polysaccharides whose medical value has not been subjected to FDA-approved clinical trials, or, in some instances, whose medical value has been disproved.' And in an ABC News investigation, Dr. Hudson Freeze of the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California warned that glyconutrients might accomplish little aside from making consumers gassy. 'There are authentic, scientific studies that have looked at people drinking these kinds of materials,' Freeze said. 'And it doesn't really do anything except increase flatulence.' Mannatech also sells weight-loss meal replacement shakes for $35.00 per jar and 1.4 oz. containers of night cream for $65.00. But it's the concept of 'glyconutrition' that had Carson sold when he made an online video for Mannatech and extolled its latest offering, Nutriverus, as 'a way to restore natural diet as a medicine.' 'The wonderful thing about a company like Mannatech is that they recognize that when God made us, He gave us the right fuel,' the retired doctor says on camera. 'And that fuel was the right kind of healthy food.' 'You know we live in a society that is very sophisticated, and sometimes we’re not able to achieve the original diet. And we have to alter our diet to fit our lifestyle. Many of the natural things are not included in our diet. Basically what the company is doing is trying to find a way to restore natural diet as a medicine or as a mechanism for maintaining health.' Texas Governor Greg Abbot disagreed in 2007, when he was the state's attorney general. The company, he said in a press release accompanying a lawsuit, used 'deceptive practices pose a health risk to seriously-ill consumers who may forgo traditional medical attention because of the company’s false claims.' That came three years after Carson's first speech to the company's sales force. ROCK STAR: Carson leaped to prominence in 2013 when he compared Obamacare to slavery at a National Prayer Breakfast event – while the president looked on . Abbot's legal filing in the case charged that Mannatech used testimonials in its sales program that claimed the company's products had helped beat autism and non-Hodgkins lymphoma. It also blew the whistle on a Mannatech-distributed CD that 'provided example after example of how ‘glyconutrients’ (i.e., Mannatech’s products) cured, treated, or mitigated diseases including but not limited to toxic shock syndrome, heart failure, asthma, arthritis, Lou Gehrig’s Disease, Attention Deficit Disorder, and lung inflammation.' ABC News reported that year that Ambrotose 'costs at least $200 a month,' and was sold as 'a miracle cure that could fix a broad range of diseases, from cancer to multiple sclerosis and AIDS.' 'PLAGIARISM': Carson's 2012 book was exposed as containing passages copied verbatim from other sources without attribution . Abbot called the system a 'glyconutrient sham.' Texas reached a settlement in 2009; Mannatech paid $4 million in restitution to customers in the state but wasn't required to admit any wrongdoing. The company's president paid a $1 million penalty and was banned from working for Mannatech for five years. The company's employees were also barred from claiming 'directly or indirectly' that their products could 'cure, treat, mitigate or prevent any disease.' Carson's work with Mannatech, however, extended until at least March 2014 when the YouTube video was published online. The Texas lawsuit wasn't the only one. In 2004 the mother of a boy with Tay-Sachs disease sued the company because the three-year-old had died in 1997 after being 'treated' with Mannatech products. The suit alleged that after she confidentially provided a Mannatech sales associate with naked pictures of her son (in order to document his weight gain), he showed to an audience of hundreds during a Mannatech seminar. 'The sales associate was further accused of authoring an article, in the Journal of the American Nutraceutical Association in August 1997, explicitly claiming that Mannatech’s supplements had improved the boy’s condition,' National Review Online reported, 'even though the boy had, by that time, died.' 'The suit also presented evidence that Mannatech was still using photographs of the boy in promotional materials on its website in March 2004, ""with the clear inference that [the boy] was alive and doing well some seven years after his actual death"".' That suit was settled for $750,000, according to public shareholder filings Mannatech made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also agreed to stop using the child in its promotional material. Representatives for Carson, and for Vernon Robinson – the retired U.S. Army captain who runs the Draft Ben Carson for President Committee – did not respond to requests for comment. The new scandal is hitting Carson while he's still reeling from last week's revelation that his 2012 book 'America the Beautiful' included sections plagiarized from other authors without citing them. MONEY MAN? Armstrong Williams, Carson's 'business manager,' was fied by his column's syndicator for accepting money from the Bush administration in exchange for hawking the No Child Left Behind program . Mannatech itself sells its products through multi-level marketing, a system that rewards existing salespeople for recruiting new ones by giving them a percentage of their 'down line' sales. Other multi-level marketing schemes have been labeled 'scams' and 'frauds' by state governments. Some whistle-blowers and fraud watchers refer to the sales systems as 'pyramid schemes' that benefit those at the top while making it hard for the newest sales team members to make a living because everyone above them gets a cut. Carson's business manager, Armstrong Williams, has his own dodgy past, raising more questions about whether the company Carson keeps will render him unable to withstand the intense scrutiny of a presidential campaign in 2016. Williams, who writes a column for The Washington Times, hosts a daily radio show and owns several radio and TV stations, was embroiled in a 2005 pay-for-play media scandal that almost ended his career. USA Today reported then that he accepted $240,000 from the George W. Bush administration to promote the government's 'No Child Left Behind' (NCLB) education program in his broadcasts and weekly syndicated columns. A government contract with the PR firm Ketchum specified that he had to 'regularly comment on NCLB during the course of his broadcasts.' Tribune Media Services terminated his syndication deal after the scandal broke.","Nutraceutical firm Mannatech uses Carson to hawk its 'Nutriverus' product, which he claimed could 'restore natural diet as a medicine'

"Most of us know we should include fibre in our diet, but as a nation we simply don't eat enough of it. Despite its many health benefits, which include reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, our average daily intake of fibre is just 18g - a third lower than the recommended 25g. Under proposals from the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (who advise the Government), this target is likely to rise to 30g. The trend for avoiding carbohydrates isn't helping, says dietitian Sioned Quirke, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. 'I see lots of people cutting down on carbohydrate foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta, in an attempt to lose weight, but they jeopardise their health and increase their risk of constipation and bowel conditions such as diverticulitis (where the gut wall weakens) if they don't eat other fibre sources,' she said. Scroll down for video . Despite the many health benefits of eating enough fibre, the majority of people don't get their daily recommended 25g. Here we reveal some smart ways to sneak more fibre into your diet - you'll need to choose between three and six items . Previously called 'roughage', dietary fibre is found in pulses (half a tin of baked beans provides a third of your fibre intake), cereals, fruits, nuts and vegetables - but there is none in meat or animal products such as eggs. There are two types of fibre - insoluble and soluble - and both are needed to keep us healthy. 'Insoluble fibre makes food move through the digestive tract more quickly, preventing constipation and reducing the time toxins are in contact with the gut, which may reduce bowel cancer risk,' says Sioned Quirke. Soluble fibre dissolves inside the digestive tract where it forms a thick gel that helps slow the movement of sugars into your blood and reduces the absorption of cholesterol. High fibre diets are associated with trimmer waistlines - one theory is that fibre fills you up, while another is that some types can be partially digested by friendly gut bacteria, which in turn release chemicals that influence appetite. To get the recommended 25g of fibre can mean eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, plus two slices of wholemeal bread and a portion each of high fibre breakfast cereal and wholewheat pasta. To take it to 30g, you'd need to add a large jacket potato. That can be a daunting menu, so instead here are smart ways to sneak in more fibre - you'll need to choose between three and six items from the list below to get the recommended daily intake of at least 25g (and ideally 30g).

"Dramatic CCTV images emerged today showing the Charlie Hebdo gunmen robbing a petrol station with a rocket launcher the day after the newspaper massacre. Al Qaeda brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi can be seen prowling around the store while filling a black plastic bag with food and water while on the run from thousands of police. Cherif has a rocket-propelled grenade launcher casually slung over his shoulder as he reaches into the drinks fridge. Scroll down for video . On the run: Charlie Hebdo gunman Cherif Kouachi is seen with a rocket launcher slung over his shoulder as he reaches into a drinks fridge while robbing a petrol station with his brother Said hours after the massacre . Unmasked: Their faces are clearly seen on the CCTV as the brothers fill a black plastic bag with supplies . Terrorists: Cherif Kouachi (left) and his brother Said (right) eluded police for two days after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, robbing a petrol station, stealing a car and then taking a hostage before being killed in a stand-off . The stills, obtained by the French investigative site, Mediapart, also show the killers at the petrol station counter, unmasked. Police swooped on the site at Villers-Cotterêts, 50 miles north-east of Paris, after the attendant gave the first positive sighting of the pair since the massacre 24 hours earlier on January 7. A massive manhunt involving tens of thousands of officers was launched, but the Kouachis were able to elude police for the rest of the day. Investigators later found a dozen Molotov cocktails and two jihadist flags in their getaway car which they dumped before hiding out in a forest overnight. Closing in: Police swoop on the petrol station after the attendant raised the alarm . Merciless: Masked gunmen Cherif and Said Kouachi shoot a police officer dead as he raises his hands in a plea for his life after they stormed the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hedbo last week . The next day they went on to take a hostage at a printing house in Dammartin-en-Goele near Charles de Gaulle Airport, prompting a day-long stand-off with police. Meanwhile, their accomplice Armedy Coulibaly had attacked the Paris kosher supermarket, killing four hostages and threatening more violence unless the police let the Kouachis go. It all ended at dusk on Friday with near-simultaneous raids at the printing plant and the kosher market in eastern Paris, resulting in the death of all three terrorists. France has ordered 10,000 troops into the streets  to protect sensitive sites after last week's bloodshed that left 17 people dead. The emergence of the CCTV images came as a former teacher of the brothers said the boys were more interested in football than religion at school, but were too dim-witted to avoid extremists after they left. Said (left) and Cherif (right) Kouachi grew up in a specialist boarding school in the tourist village of Treignac after their parents both died . Francoise Ronfet who helped raise the orphaned pair at a school in the holiday village of Treignac recalls them as happy, popular and trustworthy children who had little interest in religion. The pair, who are of French-Algerian descent, were sent to the Monedieres centre in the picturesque Mastiff region in 1994 by their mother, who was unable to raise them after their father died suddenly. Once at the boarding school, which specialises is raising children with social needs, they were largely isolated from the outside world. There they took up sports, showing a passion for football, while also taking regular lessons. Francoise Ronfet, a retired biology teacher from the school, grew particularly fond of Cherif. He was not especially bright, she said, but showed a willingness to learn. She had fewer dealings with Said, Cherif's older brother, but said his level of intellect was 'low'. She said that she noticed Said praying but that religion did not form a large part of his upbringing. While the boys were in school their mother died and when the time came for them to leave at age 18 they had no family to return to. Instead they moved together to a council apartment in Paris's poor 19th arrondissement where they fell into a life of drug dealing and petty crime before being taken in by the Buttes Chaumont gang. The group, which also included Deli attacker Amedy Coulibaly, 32, was lead by two radical Imams who preached jihad. Speaking about Cherif's move to Paris, Ms Ronfet told The Times: 'He joined up with little groups of hooligans. 'They ran rings around him because he was relatively fragile and allowed himself to be led by the nose. 'I think it's from then on that he started spending time in the mosques. But when he was at college in Treignac he had nothing to do with religion. I don't think he was a practising Muslim. 'As for his brother, Said, his level of intellect was very low. I think he used to pray. When I saw the photos on the TV, I was really very surprised the boys turned out like that.'","Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi fill black plastic bag with food and water .

"A mother-of-four has told of how a state-appointed drugs counsellor used her for sex and attempted to abort her unborn child with his bare hands when she was eight months pregnant. Johanna Bernal, 35, from New York, suffered from schizophrenia, depression and drug addiction in the wake of an abusive relationship with the father of her three oldest children. Counsellor George Alejandro, 61, is being accused of taking advantage of his vulnerable patient for four years, during which time she was kept in 'a drugged state', The New York Post reports. Accusations: Johanna Bernal, 35, was used for sex by her 61-year-old drugs counsellor who then tried to abort their baby when she was eight months pregnant by 'pouncing on her' in a hotel room, using his hands according to a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court . Ms Bernal, originally from Colombia, was assigned to Alejandro after her mother had turned to the city of New York for help in 2003. Alejandro was working for Vida Family Services, a taxpayer-funded agency, as a drug counsellor, but instead of treating Ms Bernal, he took her to a hotel to have sex, a lawsuit alleges. Shortly afterwards Ms Bernal's mother Alicia Alvarez alleges she caught Alejandro massaging her daughter in her bedroom in the family home in Queens. Ms Bernal fell pregnant with Alejandro, and when she was eight months gone, the counsellor invited her to a hotel room. There he 'pounced on her, using four fingers to [attempt to] abort the baby. He wanted to rip the baby out,' Ms Alvarez told The New York Post. Ms Bernal's mother was referred to taxpayer-funded Vida Family Services in 2003, where Ms Bernal was assigned to Alejandro who allegedly went on to use her for sex . Ms Bernal was taken to hospital and the baby's life could be saved, and although her mother wanted to go to the police, she told The New York Post Alejandro threatened to kill the family if she did. Ms Bernal, now mother to Alejandro's child, and her mother Ms Alvarez, filed a $20million lawsuit  in Manhattan federal court against the city of New York and the Administration for Children’s Services which had referred Ms Bernal to Alejandro's agency. 'My family has suffered a lot at the hands of this man. I live in fear,Ms Bernal told the Post. Alejandro did not have a state certificate as a certified addiction and substance-abuse counselor until 2005. He refutes that he had a sexual relationship with Ms Bernal and denies fatherhood of the child.

"It seems that more is more when it comes to exposing skin in Hollywood, if last night's Golden Globes red carpet is anything to go by. The likes of Rosamund Pike, Sienna Miller,  Kate Hudson, Jennifer Lopez, Jane Fonda and Katie Cassidy all stole the show in revealing cutaway gowns. The trend is all about showing off just the right amount of flesh - but the A-listers' love to break the style rules. Scroll down for video . Kate Hudson championed the cutaway trend at Sunday night's Golden Globes and showed off her toned body  in this Versace gown . While Jane Fonda, Sienna Miller and Kate Hudson trialled the trend with seductive subtlety, some stars had almost every inch of flesh on show.

Katie Cassidy also exposed plenty of skin in her silver and black gown, which was slashed to the thigh and bared her stomach and chest. Speaking about the trend - and how the stars pulled it off - Lydia Jones, founder of wantherwardrobe.com, said: 'The cutaway trend is all about showing off the perfect amount of flesh to highlight your best features. 'If you love your legs, a slashed thigh gown is the perfect option and if you're proud of your stomach, a few subtle slashes at the waist can emphasise a toned tum. It's all about focusing on your body strengths but remaining sophisticated. 'Jane Fonda hit the right notes in Versace, but Katie Cassidy left little to the imagination in her gown.' Jennifer Lopez, pictured at last night's awards, has been described as 'the sexiest dresser on any red carpet' Fashion writer Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) offered his views, saying: 'Put a cutaway dress on a TOWIE girl and it will undoubtedly look cheap.  But put a designer one on an A-lister, and nine times out of 10 they look amazing. 'Donatella Versace has perfected the ultra glam cutout dress, which Kate Hudson is a huge fan of.

Above, people protest against the killings in France's capital . In the post, the 83-year-old News Corp CEO wrote: 'Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible.' Murdoch's tweet came just two days after terrorists stormed the offices of the satirical newspaper, Charlie Hebdo, in Paris, gunning down 12 people, including two police officers. The following day, a French policewoman was shot dead in France's capital. And the next (and final day of terror), four hostages were killed when a terrorist seized a Jewish grocery store. Despite the immediate public backlash, Murdoch refused to apologize or take back his claims. Standing firm: Despite the immediate public backlash, Murdoch refused to apologize. Instead, he posted further tweets in support of his point of view, writing: 'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy' 'Holding an entire religion responsible': One user blasted his sweeping generalisation, and said: '""they"" as in most Muslims?????

'Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy.' However, he did later pay homage to one of the slain officers, urging people to remember 'the heroic sacrifice of Ahmed Merabet, Muslim police officer whose funeral was today'. On Sunday night, comedian Aziz Ansari, who was born in South Carolina to a Tamil Muslim family that is originally from India, took to Twitter to ridicule Murdoch's stance on the terror attacks. The Parks & Recreation star, who considers himself an atheist, tweeted: 'Rups can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise.'

In recent days, thousands of Muslims have lashed out Murdoch for his claims, accusing the businessman of blaming the terror attacks on an entire religion with more than a billion followers. In one of his later tweets, Murdoch paid homage to slain Muslim police officer Ahmed Merabet (above) One user blasted his sweeping generalisation, and said: '""they"" as in most Muslims?????

Michael Monan tweeted: '@rupertmurdoch In the same way that you must be held responsible for ordering the hacking of the voicemails of dead school children?' Murdoch's words also prompted ridicule - with white men, journalists, Australians and men called Rupert apologising on his behalf. The creator of BBC sitcom Citizen Khan, Adil Ray, who said: 'I think all of Australia should be held responsible for Rupert Murdoch.' Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch thinks all Muslims should apologise for terrorism. So on behalf of white people I'd like to apologise for Rupert Murdoch.' Richard Robbins said: 'Am I to be held responsible for the rantings of octogenarian media moguls because we're both Caucasian?' Another user joked: 'Maybe most Ruperts peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy cancerous media dinosaur @rupertmurdoch, they must be held responsible.' To which, Rupert Franklin replied: 'I'd like to offer an apology on behalf of us all. Murdoch's comments don't represent the views of mainstream Rupert community.' And Matt Haig added: 'Rupert Murdoch wrote a tweet. As someone who uses Twitter I would like to apologise on his behalf.'","British novelist, 49, posted a tweet saying that she was born a Christian .

"A disturbing racist video has emerged of three girls aged between five and seven singing 'if you all hate p**** clap your hands' to the tune of a popular children's song. The three blonde children are shown sitting in a circle clapping their hands while singing the hate chant for the amusement of an adult filming them. During the racist song a toddler boy wanders around the room while the little girls sing the offensive phrase to the tune of 'If you're happy and you know it clap your hands'. The video, believed to have been produced in the Greater Manchester area since the New Year, has sparked outrage online and among anti-racism charities. Scroll down for video . Upsetting: A racist video of these three children singing 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' has been released online . Family: The film is believed to have been made in the Greater Manchester area and was filmed by and adult . The unidentified children are being watched by an adult whose legs can be seen at the bottom of the clip. The clip - which is being circulated via Twitter and Whatsapp - has provoked an angry response online. Writing on Twitter, Sidrah Hussain said: 'I actually can't believe that!!! 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' racism taken to the next level.' Haroooon R added: 'That video of 3 little kids singing 'if you all hate the p**** clap your hands' is so upsetting.' Samira Axo wrote: 'I'm so baffled. A nursery rhyme turned into a racist chants by little kids.' Anti-racism charities have blamed the parents for warping their children's minds. One appalled man who saw the footage online said: 'It's disgusting. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. 'Of course you can't blame the girls - they've been taught this by people much older than them. 'It shows a whole new level of racism. How can we expect them to grow into tolerant and respectful adults, if they are being taught songs like this at such a young age?' The 13 second clip is understood to have been filmed in a living room in the Manchester area in 2015. The three little girls sit in a smart-looking carpeted living room with a large leather sofa. It has been slammed by anti-racism educational charity Show Racism the Red Card, who use football to stamp out intolerance in the wider society. A spokesman for the charity said: 'The fact these young people are using such an offensive term so freely openly shows a lack of understanding about the nature of the term from their guardians. 'The fact young people are using this word doesn't come as a surprise given a study from Show Racism the Red Card Wales found a quarter of people believe calling a Pakistani person a paki was acceptable.' Blurred: The identities of the children are not known, and have been obscured by MailOnline, but they are known to be between the ages of five and seven . Charity Stand Against Racism and Inequality (SARI) said the video 'fostered hatred and fuelled divide' and the children had been 'manipulated' by adults. Interim director Alex Raikes MBE said: 'Social media can be a tool that tackles inequalities and promotes human rights, tolerance and respect or as in this case can foster hatred and fuel divide. 'Aside from this potentially breaching the law by inciting racial hatred, what is particularly upsetting about this film is the abuse of young minds - children are not born racist - they are taught. 'Here we see this in action. This is a form of child exploitation. 'These children have been manipulated by adults who have taken advantage of their innocence and then disseminated them on film to the wider public - have they had a say in this? 'This can label them in the longer term. 'Children are like mirrors and they reflect the culture in which they live and are captive to their parents' viewpoints. 'In a week where we have seen events that show both the value we all place on freedom of speech, and at the same time how people can be indoctrinated and manipulated to perpetrate atrocities - here we may believe this is simply freedom of expression albeit unpalatable to many - but actually this is nothing short evidence of indoctrination on film. 'Moreover, whose freedom of speech is this? These children had no say in this. 'For SARI, films like can be also very distressing to the members of our community that these children have unwittingly maligned.'","Three children sit in circle singing: 'If you all hate p**** clap your hands'

"If you like a sprinkle of salt or two on your food, then this is definitely the restaurant for you. The walls, bar, tables, and chairs of Salt Restaurant Shiraz are made entirely from the mineral, and even the stairs have a smooth, salty coating. Inspired by salt caves, the architects of the eatery in southern Iran claim their building material cleanses the two-storey bistro of cooking smells and creates positive ions in the atmosphere. The two-storey restaurant in Shiraz, southern Iran, is made entirely from locally sourced salt . The interior of the restaurant has been designed to twist and turn like the salt caves they were modelled on . The choice of salt as the main material in the restaurant was used to promote the concept of green construction, news website Iran Front Page reported. The designers, from the Iranian-based firm Emtiaz Designing Group, said they wanted to make sure the interiors twisted and turned just like they do in salt caves. The building is made from environmentally sustainable, locally sourced and affordable salt, powder and rock. A spokesman from the architects said: 'Salt is a natural disinfectant and the ions it releases also purify and filter the air, making it the perfect material for a restaurant. 'In this particular case, the walls, structural sculptures and ceilings are made from salt sourced from the nearby salt mines and salt lake of Shiraz which was mixed with natural gum to harden it. The walls, structural sculptures and ceilings are all made from salt sourced from nearby mines . Salt has been known as a powerful health remedy since ancient times, the architects said . He added: 'Salt suffers a bad reputation in gastronomy thanks to its overuse in most diets, meaning that most people are not aware of its astonishing healing powers. 'But in fact salt has been known as a powerful health remedy since ancient times, especially for respiratory health and detoxification. 'In many ways, these two functions are the foundation of overall health. Even Hippocrates prescribed salt water inhalation therapy for bronchial and lung disorders.'

"You may think that a dog looks cute when it rolls onto its back while playing. But instead of being submissive, canines may be exhibiting signs of aggression, experts claim. By studying dogs playing in pairs, they uncovered that dogs lie on their backs during a boisterous play session, not to be passive, but as either a defensive manoeuvre, or a useful position from which to launch an attack. Down boy! The experts found that smaller dogs weren’t more likely to roll over than larger dogs when playing as well as that ‘most rollovers were defensive and none of the 248 rollovers was submissive’. A stock image of two very differently-sized dogs playing is pictured . Scientists at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta and the University of South Africa, Pretoria, were interested in why dogs roll onto their back while playing with other dogs, and whether it is a sign of submission, as many owners assume. Some experts have previously suggested that the move is intended on preventing aggression, so that a dog that rolls over is submitting to a more dominant dog that is on top, Scientific American reported. Kerri Norman, lead researcher of the study, which was published in the journal Behavioural Processes, examined 20 YouTube videos showing dogs playing together, half of which were play sessions between similarly sized dogs and the other half between canines of different sizes. She also set up ‘staged’ play sessions where a medium-sized female dog was paired with 33 dogs of different breeds and sizes, and their play observed to see whether rolling is actually ‘executed tactically for combat purposes’. Scientists have discovered that dogs lie on their backs while playing with as a defensive manoevure or a useful position from which to attack. This graph shows the percentage of  rollover types. The grey bars show play seen in person, and the white bars, behaviour observed in YouTube videos . A study of 4,000 dog owners last month found a clear link between limited playtime and animal behaviour problems, such as being nervous when left alone, disobedience and snapping at other animals. While researchers can’t be sure that playing less is directly to blame, they say that games provide vital intellectual stimulation and exercise. The Bristol University study showed that only one in five owners play with their dogs six times a day. Half play two or three times a day and 10 per cent have just one play session. Mark Evans, former chief vet for the RSPCA, said that dogs are one of the few animals to play into adulthood. He told the Sunday Times: ‘There is a clear association in the results. Owners report more potential behaviour problems in dogs that play less.’ Firstly, her team discovered that not all the dogs rolled over during play and in the 33 staged play sessions, only nine of the dogs rolled over. A total of 27 out of 40 dogs rolled over in the YouTube videos and the action didn’t seem to depend on the size of the dogs playing together. The experts looked for signs that the manoeuvre was linked to submission, with smaller or weaker dogs becoming passive, for example. They also studied whether the action is part of interactive play, which proceeds a dog lying on its back ‘launching an attack (offensive), evading a nape bite (defensive), rolling in front of a potential partner (solicitation) or rolling over in a non-social context (other).’ They found that smaller dogs weren’t more likely to roll over than larger dogs. They also discovered that: ‘most rollovers were defensive and none of the 248 rollovers was submissive.’ In fact, none of the dogs that surveyed rolled over in response to aggressive behaviour by another canine to become passive, or submissive. Instead, rolling dogs used their position to block playful bites and launch attacks on their partner. The researchers concluded that while dogs may roll onto their backs out of fear in some scenarios, when they are playing, the move can be used to give them an advantage when 'fighting' back.","Researchers from the University of Lethbridge in Alberta and the University of South Africa observed pairs of dogs playing in person and in videos .

"Cuba has completed the release of 53 political prisoners that was part of last month's historic deal between the United States and Cuba, the Obama administration said Monday. The move would clear a major hurdle for the normalization of ties between the two countries after more than five decades of estrangement. Cuba's leading human rights group said it had not been informed of any prisoner release since Thursday, when the total count stood at 41. The Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation has been keeping close track of the liberation of prisoners since they began last week, reporting releases within hours after hearing from family members or prisoners themselves. Most of the released dissidents belong to the Patriotic Union of Cuba, a vehemently anti-government group based in far eastern Cuba. Jose Daniel Ferrer, head of the group, told The Associated Press that his count was the same as the rights commission's and he knew of no release since Thursday. Scroll down for video . Free: Cuba has released all 53 political prisoners, the Obama administration said Monday. Aide Gallardo, left, and Sonia Garro, were two of the dissidents released . The releases have been shrouded in confusion due to both a U.S. and Cuban reluctance to release the names of those on the list. The prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the U.S. agreement last month with the Cuban government. They had been cited by various human rights organizations as being imprisoned by the Cuban government for exercising internationally protected freedoms or for their promotion of political and social reforms in Cuba. Speaking in Louisville, Kentucky, President Barack Obama's U.N. ambassador said the prisoners were released in recent days. 'Welcome as that step is, and heartening as it is for their families, (it) does not resolve the larger human rights problems on the island,' Samantha Power said, according to prepared remarks. Earlier, an official traveling with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Islamabad said the U.S. verified the release. Power was speaking Monday at an event hosted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. She outlined issues which the administration and the Republican-led Congress could work together on and issues they remained further apart on. Both sides want to advance freedom in Cuba, she said, but they disagree on strategy. 'Some of the embargo's staunchest defenders are Democrats and Republicans with deep ties to the island — people whose families came to America fleeing the Castros' repression,' Power explained. 'These are men and women who are completely dedicated to doing all they can to ensure that Cubans on the island get to enjoy true freedom. So it is important to acknowledge that while there may be disagreements on the best way to get there, we share a common goal of advancing the rights of the Cuban people.' Power said changes already are occurring in Cuba. When Cuban artist Tania Bruguera and other activists were detained after announcing an anti-government event in Havana's historic Revolution Square, she said, nearly 300 Cuban artists signed a letter supporting her freedom. Out: The prisoners had been on a list of opposition figures whose release was sought as part of the U.S. agreement last month with the Cuban government . Recent released dissidents Luis Diaz, David Gayselo, Miguel Tamayo, Vladimir Ortis, Aide Gallardo, Angel Casteyon, Sonia Garro, Mario Hernandez, Rolando Reyes, Carlos Figueyda and Eugenio Hernandez are seen together (left to right) on Sunday . 'In spite of genuine fear, Cubans were speaking out,' Power said. 'And the Castro government was forced to explain why it would rather arrest a woman than let her speak freely in a public square.' Last month, Cuba and the U.S. agreed to work to restore normal diplomatic relations as part of a deal in which Cuba freed an imprisoned U.S. aid worker along with an imprisoned spy working for the U.S. and the imprisoned dissidents. The U.S. released several Cuba intelligence agents. 'Certainly, for those 53 prisoners, it's a great deal. We don't know who they are,'Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in an appearance Monday on 'CBS This Morning.' Rubio said he supports improving ties with Cuba but said he's worried that the Cubans are getting virtually everything they want from the United States for 'these minimal changes.' He said he wants to be certain that improved relations between Washington and Havana provides equal benefits to the U.S. 'My interest in Cuba is freedom and democracy,' he said. Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who's considering a run for the presidency, said there is 'no current example' around the world where a ""government of resistant tyranny"" has moved to greater freedom and democracy as a result of changes in international relations that are based on economic incentives.","Cuba completed the release of 53 political prisoners, the Obama administration said Monday .

"Scientists have grown 'fully-functioning' human gut tissue inside a mouse - a breakthrough that could one day help many thousands suffering with intestinal disorders. By transplanting cells from a human into a mouse, paediatric surgeons successfully grew small intestine tissue that worked just like the 'real' thing. Doctors hope their findings will eventually help treat a range of digestive conditions as well as boost survival rates in sufferers of diseases such as short bowel syndrome (SBS)  - a condition that kills nearly a third of young patients within five years. Paediatrics have created tissue-engineered small intestine (Tesi) tissue (part of the small intestine's duodenum (pictured) that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine. During tests the tissue proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones . The research was led by Dr Tracy Grikscheit from the Children's Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA). CHLA had previously shown that tissue-engineered small intestine tissue could be ‘grown’ by implanting human donor tissue into mice. However, in initial studies - published in 2011 in the biomedical journal Tissue Engineering, Part A - the intestine created had a limited range of functions. As part of the new study, the researchers created Tesi that replicates key aspects of a functioning human intestine. In particular, the Tesi developed contains the mucosal lining - or barrier - seen in fully-grown intestines. The small intestine is a tubular structure that carries food from the stomach up to the colon and its main function is to help with digestion. The small intestine increases 20 times in length as a person ages, from around 78 inches (200cm) in a newborn baby, to almost six metres (20 feet) long. It is typically three times the height of the child or adult and is the part of the intestines where 90 per cent of digestion and food absorption takes place. The remaining 10 per cent occurs in the stomach and large intestine. As food travels through the small intestine, it absorbs nutrients and minerals. Chemical digestion uses enzymes to break down food into a form that can then be absorbed into tissues of the body. Once at the colon, the large intestine carries it to the rectum. The main function of this organ is to aid in digestion. And, during tests the Tesi proved it could break down sugars into glucose and release gastrointestinal hormones. Mice were chosen for the study because mouse Tesi is ‘highly similar’ to the Tesi derived from human cells. For example, both contain important building blocks such as the stem and progenitor cells that continue to regenerate the intestine as a living tissue replacement. The researchers took cells from human intestine tissue and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution. This solution was fitted onto a so-called polymer scaffold - a structure used to help the cells and tissue develop - which was then implanted into a mouse. Four weeks later, the Tesi was harvested and tested. Scientists discovered it was able to break down sugars into glucose, and found the cells within the engineered tissue developed in close proximity to other specialised cells. These specialised cells are said to be necessary in healthy human intestine to create a fully functioning organ. ‘We have shown that we can grow tissue-engineered small intestine that is more complex than other stem cell or progenitor cell models that are currently used to study intestinal regeneration and disease, and proven it to be fully functional as it develops from human cells,’ said Dr Grikscheit. ‘Demonstrating the functional capacity of this tissue-engineered intestine is a necessary milestone on our path toward one day helping patients with intestinal failure.’ Mice (stock image) were chosen for the study because mouse Tesi is ‘highly similar’ to Tesi from human cells. The researchers took cells from human intestines and soaked them in a digestive enzyme solution, which was then implanted into a mouse. Four weeks later, the Tesi was harvested and succesfully tested . The research was published in the American Journal of Physiology: GI & Liver, and brings surgeons a step closer to helping human patients using this regenerative medicine technique. In particular, it could be used to treat short bowel syndrome - a major cause of intestinal failure, particularly in premature babies and newborns with congenital intestinal problems. Tesi may also, one day, replace intestinal transplantation and could solve the problem of donor shortages. Without enough intestinal length, babies are dependent on intravenous feeding, which can cause liver damage. Intestinal failure occurs in more than 24 out of 100,000 live births, with nearly a third of patients dying within five years.","Scientists have previously grown small intestine donor tissue in a mouse .

But after being inundated with hundreds of comments lauding the venture, an intrepid business owner decided to team up with the website to make the idea a reality. The pop-up café is expected to run for up to four weeks, although Mr McMenamin did not rule out opening the store on a long-term basis if it became a success .

The £3.50 dish is served with soup – topped with croutons made from Monster Munch crisps – and chips. Andrew McMenamin said he was inspired to transform his previous business, called That Wee Café, into the crisp sandwich shop after reading the spoof article. Mr McMenamin has been told his crispy sandwich venture is 'the world's first' as the childhood snack makes a leap from guilty pleasure to foodie acceptance . ‘We read the article online and it struck a chord – it was so funny. The comments and the feedback that came about from that got us thinking ""we could probably do that"",’ he said. ‘It is a school thing, people remember it from their school days, it is a classic and it is old-school.’ ‘I have been told it is the world’s first. Once we put it up on Facebook and Twitter that we were going to do this it just snowballed.’ The venture is expected to run for up to four weeks, although Mr McMenamin did not rule out opening the store on a long-term basis if it became a success. Customer Nerys Coleman, 32, said: ‘It is something from your childhood. I have not had a crisp sandwich since university and before that childhood so it is bringing back the nostalgia.’ Billy McWilliams and Seamus O’Shea, who penned the initial satirical article for their Ulster Fry website, said the process from spoof to reality was ‘crazy’. Writing on their website, the comedy writers said: ‘Not only did people believe it, but people wanted to believe it and the story went viral.’ ‘Thousands of people loved the idea of buying a crisp sandwich on the high-street or in a cafe.’ Tayto, a Northern Ireland-based crisp manufacturer which is one of the largest distributors in the UK, has teamed up with the café owner to provide the majority of the crisps, alongside brands including Walkers and Smiths.","Pop-up store Simply Crispy opened in Belfast selling the snack .

"Right fit: The 'Scandfit' bra is designed for women with implants . A woman who had trouble finding the right bra after a  boob job has created her own range of lingerie specifically for those who have had surgery. Rachel Atkinson, 30, designed her ScandFit bras after finding that underwiring can chafe on scars and dig into implants. She was so uncomfortable after going from an A cup to a DD that she had to wear an unflattering sports bra all the time. Now Rachel has quit her job as an adviser with a mortgage broker to devote herself to her new business selling £85 bras made of silk elastane, polymide, and polyester which look attractive but provide the right support. Rachel, of London, said: ‘After I had surgery I couldn’t find anything that fitted. I looked at why that was and it’s due to the shape. 'The underwiring digs into the implant, especially when you bend forward or to the side.’ Plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer confirmed that many other women suffer the same problem. Mr Mercer, former president  of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘Women tell me “I can’t  find anything that fits.” ‘Her bra gives support where it’s needed and it looks brilliant. Women who wear them look a million dollars.’ Rachel will unveil the range at Kensington Olympia this week. For more information visit its website.

"Mark Croft admitted producing cannabis but walked free from Bolton Crown Court today . Kerry Katona's ex-husband has walked free from court after admitting to running a £50,000 cannabis farm from his loft to pay off his drug debts. Former taxi driver Mark Croft, 43, was arrested after police raided his three bedroomed semi-detached home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, on April 3 last year and found 56 plants in the loft. Officers also discovered incriminating text messages linking Croft to the supply of the drug, where he offered a price of £60 for 10g of cannabis 'skunk' weed. Bolton Crown Court heard Croft lost his life of luxury when he and the reality TV star divorced in 2011. He suffered from depression and got into debt with drug dealers. Croft, of Over Hulton, near Bolton, admitted producing cannabis but escaped jail after receiving a two-year jail sentence, suspended for two years. He was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work and pay £210 in court costs and a victim surcharge. Croft is currently claiming £71 a week in state benefits and is fighting the former Atomic Kitten singer for custody of their children Heidi, seven, and Maxwell, six in the family courts. He will be able to pay the bill off at £10 per week. Wayne Jackson, mitigating, told the court: 'This is a situation where Mr Croft is being used by other people to run an operation. 'Due to the difficulty he has had because of his links to the celebrity culture in the past, that pressure from others was brought to bear on him to have those drugs in his house. Croft, pictured with ex-wife Kerry Katona in 2008, was arrested after police raided his home and discovered the plants . 'He was being told that this was the way to pay his debts - if not these people were going to the press and the cat would have been out of the bag.' Mr Jackson added: 'He was acting at the behest of other people. They had a hold over him even thought he had 'a spectacular fall from grace', being followed from day one with Kerry Katona. 'He has gone from a lavish lifestyle covered by TV programmes to now living on state benefits. 'He is trying to improve his life but in the background he has this. He deeply regrets being involved in the drug culture and he has given up drugs. 'He has a family and he has struggled with the deal that life has thrown at him in the last few years. He is trying his best to overcome these problems, he has managed to stop using drugs. He wants to retrain, an apprenticeship has been lined up, and he has children he wants to see.' Mr Jackson told the judge: 'Throw him some sort of lifeline, a lifeline to a man who has struggled for a number of years. The court heard Croft, pictured with a Lamborghini he drove when married to the reality TV star, lost his life of luxury when he and Katona divorced in 2011 . The former couple at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008, left, and right, at a promotional event in Dublin . 'There is a man whose life has changed both ways from start to middle to finish in a roller coaster ride. 'No doubt it will be in the newspapers. No doubt used as a stick to beat him with in family proceedings. I invite you to take a chance with him.' Earlier, Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, said Croft was at home at the time of the police raid and confessed to officers: 'It's in the loft the cannabis plants'.' They gained access to the loft via a hatch hidden behind a cupboard door and found four distinct growing areas. The plants were analysed valued of £52,340. A water irrigation system and suspended artificial lighting was also present as well as an extraction system to mask the smell. Also seized was a mobile phone which revealed messages asking about the crop. Croft was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work and pay £210 in costs . One message Croft received read: 'sound how long will it take to dry'. In reply, he said: 'Weekend should be right'. Another request for drugs was met with the reply, 'I have a few grams of cheese, think 10', suggesting a reference to cannabis skunk. Another message was to reference '£60' indicating the price for 10 grams of drugs. Miss Thomas said it was accepted Croft was not responsible for setting up the farm which had been in operation for a week. Passing sentence, Miss Recorder Abigail Hudson, told Croft: 'You involved yourself for financial gain. There was over £50,000 in your possession. 'You are a man of previous good character, have suffered the breakdown of your marriage. 'I accept you are a good father and I further accept you have struggled with your health but you did play a significant role. 'I take the view you did have some awareness of the scale of the operation and were motivated by financial rewards. I accept there was some degree of pressure brought to bear upon you by others. 'You have lived a lifestyle which is rapidly changing, I do not underestimate the fluctuations you may have had. 'As you have no previous convictions and no experience of custody. I'm willing to believe and give you the benefit of the doubt, your experience of the courts and criminal justice system will be the last.'","Mark Croft, 43, was arrested after police raided his home in Bolton last year .

"Two Albuquerque police officers were charged with murder Monday in the shooting death of a knife-wielding homeless man that led to sometimes violent protests and a federal investigation into the city's police force. The decision to bring murder charges occurred at a time when police tactics are under intense scrutiny nationwide, fueled by the fatal shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri, and the chokehold death of another unarmed man in New York City. Grand juries declined to charge officers in those cases, leading to large protests. Acknowledging the frustration over the secrecy of the proceedings in those cases, the Albuquerque district attorney said she would bypass the grand jury process and instead present the murder case to a judge at a preliminary hearing that will be open to the public. Caught on camera: James Boyd, 38, left, is shown during a standoff with officers in the Sandia foothills in Albuquerque, New Mexico before police fatally shot him . Murderers? SWAT team member Dominique Perez (right) and former detective Keith Sandy (left) fatally shot James Boyd, a mentally ill homeless man who had frequent violent run-ins with law enforcement and they've now been charged with murder . 'Unlike Ferguson and unlike in New York City, we're going to know. The public is going to have that information,' District Attorney Kari Brandenburg said. Police said SWAT team member Dominique Perez and former detective Keith Sandy fatally shot James Boyd, a mentally ill homeless man who had frequent violent run-ins with law enforcement. Video from an officer's helmet camera showed Boyd appearing to surrender when officers opened fire, but a defense lawyer characterized him as an unstable suspect who was 'unpredictably and dangerously close to a defenseless officer while he was wielding two knives.' 'I'm looking forward ... to the DA's office presenting one single witness that says this is murder,' said Sam Bergman, a lawyer for Sandy. The district attorney refused to provide specifics about the reasons for bringing the case, but said it was a lengthy and deliberate process involving several members of her staff. According to KOB, police recordings revealed Officer Keith Sandy--while speaking of Boyd (pictured)--saying he was 'going to shoot him in penis with a shotgun' just hours before the deadly shooting . Each officer faces a single count in the March death of the 38-year-old Boyd. The charges allow prosecutors to pursue either first-degree or second-degree murder against the officers. Even before Boyd's death, the U.S. Justice Department was investigating the use of force by Albuquerque police. The department recently signed an agreement to make changes after the government issued a harsh report. The agreement requires police to provide better training for officers and to dismantle troubled units. Since 2010, Albuquerque police have been involved in 40 shootings — 27 of them deadly. After Boyd's death, outrage over the trend grew and culminated with protests that included a demonstration where authorities fired tear gas and another that shut down a City Council meeting. The criminal charges were the first Brandenburg has brought against officers in a shooting. She is in her fourth term as district attorney and is waging a fight with the Albuquerque Police Department over allegations that she committed bribery while intervening on behalf of her son in a burglary case. Police believe she should be charged with bribery because, they say, she offered to pay a victim not to press charges. The attorney general's office is handling the matter. Brandenburg said the charges against police had nothing to with the agency's investigation into her and that her office got the case long before the bribery claims came to light. The next step in the case will be a preliminary hearing where a judge will decide whether the case can proceed. The officers have not been booked or arrested. That would not happen until a judge renders a decision at the preliminary hearing. A date has not been set. Brandenburg has been criticized for her office's decades-old practice of using grand juries to affirm prosecutors' decisions that no probable cause existed to charge officers in shootings. Dangerously close? Video from an officer's helmet camera showed Boyd appearing to surrender when officers opened fire, but a defense lawyer characterized him as an unstable suspect who was 'unpredictably and dangerously close to a defenseless officer while he was wielding two knives' The office of Bernalillo County District Attorney Kari Brandenburg  is pursuing charges against the two Albuquerque officers. Brandenburg is waging a fight with the Albuquerque Police Department over allegations that she committed bribery while intervening on behalf of her son in a burglary case . Under a revamped system, county prosecutors now decide whether there's probable cause that a crime was committed and either take the case to a grand jury or opt to file a 'criminal information' charge on their own. Bregman said there is 'not one shred' of evidence to support the case and insisted the officer had no criminal intent when he encountered Boyd. He said Sandy followed training procedures outlined by the police department. Luis Robles, an attorney for Perez, said he was 'confident that the facts will vindicate officer Perez's actions in this case.' The FBI is also investigating, but U.S. authorities have not said if the officers will face federal charges. David Correia, a police critic and an American studies professor at the University of New Mexico, said he was pleased that Brandenburg finally brought charges against Albuquerque officers after years of pressure. 'This is the first time an independent agency is holding Albuquerque police accountable,' Correia said. Police are legally empowered to use deadly force when appropriate, and a 1989 Supreme Court decision concluded that an officer's use of force must be evaluated through the 'perspective of a reasonable officer on scene rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.' Philip Matthew Stinson, a professor at Bowling Green State University in Ohio who studies police misconduct, found that local officers were charged in 41 cases with murder or manslaughter stemming from on-duty shootings between 2005 and 2011. By comparison, over the same period, police agencies reported more than 2,700 cases of justifiable homicide by law enforcement officers to the FBI, and that statistic is incomplete. The figures suggest it's difficult to get a conviction 'because juries are so reluctant to second-guess an officer's split-second decision,' Stinson said.

"An American comedian's rage about Rupert Murdoch blaming all Muslims for terrorism has evolved into a hilarious hashtag which has taken off on Twitter. Aziz Ansari's plan of a quiet night in to watch the Golden Globes on Monday night was ruined when he discovered the tweets from the Australian media tycoon holding every Muslim across the globe responsible for terrorist attacks until they destroy their 'jihadist cancer'. To express his outrage Ansari started #RupertsFault which has taken on a life of its own with the News Corp boss being blamed for everything from The Kardashians, the popularity of The Big Bang Theory, Kirk Cameron movies and even Hitler. Scroll down for video . Aziz Ansari (right) started a hashtag blaming Rupert Murdoch (left) for everything after his controversial tweet . Ansari's reaction stems from the media tycoon's tweet saying all Muslims were responsible for terrorism . Born in South Carolina to a Tamil Muslim family originally from India, Ansari asked Murdoch for tips on how Muslims should eliminate all terror throughout the world. 'Rups can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise,' he tweeted. Ansari continued to vent  asking Murdoch what he had done to stop crimes by people of his religion. '@rupertmurdoch is responsible for all pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic. why are you pro-pedophile :(' another post said. He then went on to clarify that he was not targeting any religious groups . 'To be clear, I am not religious and have nothing against Christians or Muslims, just ignorance like what @rupertmurdoch is spreading.' Ansari also asked the billionaire for a step by step guide on how to destroy terrorist groups . The hashtag then took on a hilarious life of its own with the business magnate being blamed for all sorts . Ansari then decided to throw some humour in the mix by blaming the business magnate for 'anytime a Christian person rear ended your car.' But it wasn't until other punters jumped on the hashtag wagon that things started to get quite hilarious. The billionaire was held responsible for everything from 'uber surge pricing', Westboro Baptist Church and Hotel California. Not being able to access alcoholic beverage also made the list.

'Perhaps we could hold all Australians responsible for @rupertmurdoch?' Meanwhile, white men took it upon themselves to apologise on behalf of Murdoch's comments. BBC producer Michael MacLennan described Murdoch as a 'terrible person'. 'Let's hope us white people aren't considered collectively responsible for him. If so I apologise,' he said.

"A key witness who helped jail Dale Cregan, who killed two woman police officers, is homeless abroad after fleeing Britain because of threats . A key witness who helped jail one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan is now living with her children in a garage abroad after fleeing Britain in fear. The mother and her children were threatened on Facebook after giving evidence against Cregan, who was jailed for the murder of police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, as well as two men. Terrified of reprisals, the woman spent more than a year living in six towns and cities across England but eventually fled Britain to avoid revenge attacks and is now homeless. The woman braved death threats to give four days of evidence at Cregan's trial in February 2013. The gangster was jailed for life and told he would never be released after he was convicted of murdering the police officers, as well as his rival Mark Short and Short's father, plus three separate counts of attempted murder. Cregan, with the help of Damian 'Scarface' Gorman and Luke Livesey, who were both jailed for at least 33 years, shot dead Short Jr in a pub in May 2012. Months later he killed Short's father David. On September 18 that year, Cregan made a hoax call to the police, with officers Hughes, 23, and Bone, 32, arriving shortly afterwards to investigate. When they arrived, the murderer shot both women at least eight times and threw a grenade at them, killing both women. The witness' evidence ensure Cregan was convicted, but now she is homeless, destitute and living in a garage abroad with her children. She says the witness protection programme cut all financial help soon after she left the UK a year ago. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, who chose not to disclose which country she now lives in, the mother said she wanted to return to Britain, but needs money from the Government to do so. Police killer: Cregan shot and threw a grenade at PCs Fiona Bone (left) and Nicola Hughes (right), killing them . She said: 'I've told the police we're in serious trouble here. There are no jobs. My kids aren't in school. 'There are no places for them. We're sleeping on a mattresses and a couch in someone's garage. I don't care about myself. I just want something better for my children. I want them back in the UK. That's where their lives are. 'We're getting food from a local family and a church. We didn't celebrate on Christmas day. 'I've paid a very high price for helping the police, too high. I will always stick to my principles and I want the law to prevail but I've had to pay too high a price. 'I can't keep watching my children suffering every day. I don't want to blame the police but I feel abandoned by the Government itself. 'I'd rather risk it in England than see my children suffering. I'm at the point where I think they're better off without me. 'I'm in turmoil because I opened my mouth and put a thug behind bars. Cregan and the rest have food, clothing and even education in prison. Their wives and girlfriends have lives and jobs. What have I got for my trouble? Humiliation. 'They have a better situation than we have by far. I would rather be in their shoes, any day. It's a humiliating position to be in and the children are suffering. I've handed my CV into 73 different places without any joy. There is just no work.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police, speaking for the north west regional witness protection service, said: 'We do not comment on any witness or witness protection measures.' Murdered by Cregan: Mark Short (right) and his father David . The key witness helped put Cregan behind bars for the killings that shocked the nation, but came under intense threats from gangland thugs before the trial. On the night Mark Short was shot dead, the woman saw one of Cregan's co-accused, Damian Gorman, outside her house with two other people. Giving evidence to the trial via video link, she said she also found clothes dumped in a garden next to her home the next day. She said she faced threats after Short was killed, including one of the 'one-eyed Scotchman' - a reference to Cregan - paying her a visit. The trial heard Gorman had told her: 'You better make sure that you keep your f****** mouth shut or you're dead... You see these people, what they are capable of. You're f****** next. You and your f****** kids.' 'He said, ""Be careful because you don't want the one-eyed Scotchman coming to [your] door""... If I said anything to the police,' she said. She said he pulled his finger under his chin and across his throat and told her: 'You don't want to die and you don't want your kids to die.' 'He was always threatening me. The message he gave me was clear,' she added.","Key witness who helped jail Dale Cregan is homeless after fleeing Britain .

"Passed away: Norman Spivey died at his home in Georgia on Saturday from complications arising because of his Stage 4 colon cancer . A Vietnam veteran denied a vital cancer checkup for more than a year by the VA in Atlanta died at home on Saturday. Great-grandfather, Norman Spivey, 64, passed away from complications arising from Stage 4 colon cancer that had spread to his liver and lymph nodes. He was seen for the first time and diagnosed as terminal in July and Spivey's wife, Gayla, has revealed her fury at the fatal delay. 'I have no way of knowing that if he had had a colonoscopy a year ago, that the outcome would be any different,' said Gayla to WMAZ. 'But there's always that possibility. A year? A year to work with it. You know? I mean, it may not have spread to the liver. It may not have spread to the lymph nodes. 'It may be okay. But right now, it's not. Right now, it's not okay. It's just not okay.' Spivey's treatment is another scandalous example of mismanagement at the VA, making former armed forces veterans wait more than a year for an appointment and then publishing secret waiting lists to hide the delays. When the shameful treatment of the nation's veterans was made public in May, VA administrator Eric Shinseki was forced to resign. Anger: Norman's wife Gayle (left and right with her husband) is furious that he did not get a screening earlier . Check-up: It took the intervention of a local news channel to get Norman Spivey a medical appointment for his cancer . Young love: Gayle and Norman have five children and 12 grandchildren and met while he was serving his nation during the Vietnam war . As soon as he was eventually diagnosed, Spivey was put through an arduous cycle of chemotherapy, which despite reducing the cancer, left him weakened, unable to eat and 54 pounds lighter. Gayla said that it was only the intervention of a local news crew that made the VA begin the chemotherapy. 'His spirits were so good,' said Gayla to WMAZ. 'He had such a good outlook, he was determined to get better.' Speaking to WMAZ, Gayla broke down in tears and told WMAZ, 'He fought cancer as hard as any battle he ever fought. 'He was the strongest, most courageous man I've ever known. He was a brave soldier all the way up until the end. He will be missed by many, many people.' Spivey is survived by five children, 12 grandchildren and one great-grandchild.","Norman Spivey, 64, died on Saturday at home in Douglasville, Georgia .

"Defiant: The next issue of Charlie Hebdo will include drawings of the Prophet Mohammed a week after the publication's senior staff, including editor Stephane Charbonnier (pictured), were killed . This week's issue of Charlie Hebdo will contain cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed and the front cover will be unveiled tonight, the magazine's lawyer confirmed today. The surviving members of the magazine's staff decided to print images of the holy figure in defiance of Muslim extremists who slaughtered their colleagues on Wednesday last week. Lawyer Richard Malka said this week's issue, which is expected to sell 1million copies when it comes out in two days's time, will 'of course' contain images of the Prophet. Mr Malka told France Info radio: 'We will not give in. The spirit of 'Je suis Charlie' means the right to blaspheme. 'We will not give in otherwise all this won't have meant anything. A Je Suis Charlie banner means you have the right to criticise my religion, because it's not serious. 'We have never criticised a Jew because he's a Jew, a Muslim because he's a Muslim or a Christian because he's a Christian. 'But you can say anything you like, the worst horrors – and we do – about Christianity, Judaism and Islam, because behind the nice slogans, that's the reality of Charlie Hebdo.' Brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi chose the publication as the target of their attack last week after it repeatedly published cartoons of Mohammed, which some Muslims find deeply offensive. The magazine once renamed itself 'Sharia Hebdo', claimed to be guest edited by the Prophet and carried the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die laughing'. Their offices were burned down after a petrol bomb attack in 2010, believed to be connected to the images, though on that occasion nobody was hurt. Making a stand: The magazine's lawyer confirmed the cartoons would feature in this Wednesday's edition, which has a print run of 1million copies and will be translated into 16 languages (file image) Editor Stephane Charbonnier, who was among the nine magazine staff to be shot dead last week, was also placed on Al Qaeda's most wanted list last year. Charlie Hebdo's remaining members are working on the next eight-page issue from their heavily-guarded temporary headquarters at the Libération newspaper. On the day after the attacks staff first confirmed there would be a magazine this week, saying it would take submissions from cartoonists around the world. The issue will be translated into 16 different languages, though the remaining illustrators have admitted it has not been easy pulling the publication together. Luz, a Charlie cartoonist, said: 'We're getting by. We are having less nightmares. We are trying to put a magazine together and find some calm and inspiration, it's not easy. 'We are down to a skeleton staff since last Wednesday as you might have noticed but we'll try our best.' For freedom: Since the attacks on Charlie Hebdo's offices last week millions of people have come forward to support the magazine's right to blaspheme, coining the slogan Je Suis Charlie - I Am Charlie . En masse: More than a million people took to the streets of Paris yesterday as part of a solidarity march to show support for the magazine and the principle of free speech . Mr Charbonnier, an outspoken proponent of the right to free speech, died on Wednesday along with some of France's most revered cartoonists and magazine contributors. The dead included Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac, Georges Wolinski, Jean 'Cabu' Cabut, Philippe Honore, Bernard Maris, Elsa Cayat, Mustapha Ourrad and Michel Renaud. According to witness reports, Said and Cherif burst in to the paper's morning conference, then called out the names of the contributors they were looking for before pulling the trigger. Since then millions have taken to Twitter, posting messages of support along with the tag Je Suis Charlie - I Am Charlie. Millions took to the streets of France yesterday in solidarity marches waving banners that bore the slogan, while George and Amal Clooney wore Charlie badges to last night's Golden Globes. Today France announced that 10,000 security officers will deployed to protect 'sensitive sites' across the country, including Jewish schools and mosques, in the wake of the attacks. The announcement was made this morning by the Interior Minister after a security briefing.

"Families in Tory-supporting constituencies outside London have seen their homes soar in value eight times higher than those in Labour areas under David Cameron. House prices in towns and villages outside the capital with a Conservative MP have increased by 16 per cent over the past five years, new figures reveal. But in Labour seats, property prices have risen by just 2 per cent since 2009 – far below inflation. Homes in Liberal Democrat areas have increased by 8 per cent. House prices in areas outside the capital with a Tory MP have increased by 16% over the past five years. The Conservatives hold only one seat in Scotland - where house prices have fallen 10%. In the 40 Labour-held seats  property prices have stagnated over the past five years - registering 0% growth . The figures, compiled by estate agents Savills, also reveal that homes in Tory constituencies are worth 64 per cent more on average than those in Labour seats — a gap of nearly £100,000. A typical home in a Tory area is now worth £252,083 compared to £153,843 fetched by an average property in a Labour-held seat, the Financial Times reported today. The revelation will spark fresh accusations that the economic recovery has not been felt equally across the country. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has accused the Tories of ‘looking after their own’ – while Labour have hammered home the message that Mr Cameron is out of touch with ordinary families. Across Britain’s 100 most marginal constituencies, Tory seats have seen house price rise much faster than Labour constituencies, Savills found. Properties in the 20 most expensive constituencies in the UK are worth 13 times more than those in the 20 cheapest. The top 20 seats by value, of which 11 are held by Conservative MPs, have property worth a total of £741billion. The cheapest 20 seats, of which 15 are represented by Labour, are collectively worth just £57billion. Figures for the last four years show the average monthly house price change, including seven towns when properties have fallen in value . By comparison, some properties in the Home Counties have risen by almost £2,000-a-month since David Cameron came to power . It comes after MailOnline revealed families in booming towns in the South East had seen their homes soar in value by up to £2,000 every month since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister. Home owners in Surrey, Hertfordshire and outer London have enjoyed a four year property boom far outstripping the rest of the country, research by the property website Zoopla revealed. But over the same time, deprived towns in West Yorkshire, Country Durham and Northumberland have seen house prices fall by thousands of pounds – trapping families in negative equity. Outside prime central London Britain’s biggest boom towns are Harpenden and Radlet in Hertfordshire, Esher in Surrey and Stanmore in north west London. David Cameron has overseen a house-price boom for families living in Tory areas . Homes in Harpenden were worth £576,554 in May 2010, but have risen in value to £732,059 – a 26.97 per cent increase. Nearby Radlett has seen average prices jump from £668,148 to £842,679, while properties in Esher have increased by £198,167 to £952,421. Homes in Stanmore meanwhile have jumped 34.16 per cent to an average of £610,074 – an increase of £155,326 from May 2010. However, families in towns away from the south east have seen the values of their homes stagnate – or even fall – under the Coalition. Properties in Shildon, County Durham, were worth an average of £81,367 in 2010. But by November they had fallen back to just £77,540 – a fall on £3,827, or 4.7 per cent. Close-by Ferryhill, in Tony Blair’s former constituency of Sedgefield, has seen properties fall by 3 per cent on average – down from £92,459 to just £89,678. Further north in Prudhoe, Northumberland, houses have fallen £2,573 – from £180,377 to £177,804. Castleford and Heckmondwike in West Yorkshire have also struggled over the past four years, while southern towns boom. In Castleford homes have fallen £4,419 to £124,082 while in Heckmondwike the average property is now worth just £115,439 – down from £118,475 in May 2010. Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson said the figures revealed that large areas of the country were being left behind. 'This just goes to prove that there is a major north-south divide in the country and the recovery has clearly not been for everyone. ‘Hard-working families in places like Ferryhill in my constituency are not seeing the benefits of the economic recovery. The growth we’re seeing is benefiting the few and not the many.’","House prices areas with a Tory MP outside London are up 16% in 5 years .

"The Prime Minister has accused Ed Miliband of ‘wriggling like an eel’ when pressed on whether he intended to use the NHS as a political weapon. In November, the BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson revealed: ‘A phrase the Labour leader uses in private is that he wants to – and I quote – weaponise the NHS for politics.’ Yesterday it emerged that Mr Miliband made the comment almost two months ago, in a private meeting attended by up to 15 senior executives at the Corporation. His remark was brought up in the Commons last week by David Cameron, who said he thought that it was a ‘disgusting’ thing to say. Scroll down for video . David Cameron this morning accused Ed Miliband of 'squirming like an eel' by refusing seven times to deny that he wanted to ‘weaponise’ the NHS . And pressure on Mr Miliband deepened over the weekend, as he was asked seven times on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show whether he had used the word, but only said that he did not recall it. He failed to disown the phrase, saying: ‘I want to fight for the NHS. I don’t recall exactly what I said, but we are in a fight for the National Health Service, and I make absolutely no apologies for the fact that I’m really concerned about what’s happening to our NHS.’ Yesterday the Labour leader again avoided the issue at an event with voters, with his spokesman saying he would not comment on the contents of a private meeting. Appearing at the event with voters in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, he chose not take any questions from the press. Asked about Mr Miliband’s comments as he unveiled his election priorities in Nottingham yesterday, David Cameron said: ‘Frankly I think it was an appalling thing to say. 'The NHS is not a weapon, it is what we have for looking after our families, for caring for the elderly, the ill and the frail. It is the most vital public service in our country.’ He added: ‘Watching that exchange, where he was wriggling like an eel, made it absolutely clear to me that he did say those words and that is why he wouldn’t deny it, and I think in one moment we learned more about Labour’s attitude to the NHS than we’ve learned for five years, they see it as a political weapon. I think it’s disgraceful.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband clashed with  David Cameron last week over the NHS crisis  after the PM raised comments he had made to the BBC political editor Nick Robinson (right) Last night Mr Miliband told LBC Radio: ‘This is a smokescreen from the Conservative Party. It’s not about the words people use, it’s about the commitments they make.’ And a Labour source said: ‘We’ve been really clear, this is a fight about the future of the Health Service, and we’re going to make sure we make it that fight. 'We are not going to talk about what were the words used in a private conversation. What we won’t do is leave in any doubt that we intend to make this a fight about the NHS.’ But NHS campaigner Julie Bailey, whose mother died following blunders at Stafford Hospital, told the Mail: ‘What a disgraceful comment from Miliband, planning to weaponise the NHS. ‘Putting politics before patients was a mistake they made when they were last in government, and why they should not be trusted with the NHS again.’","David Cameron accused Labour leader of using ‘disgusting’ term in private .

"A dog who was born with differently coloured eyes is having trouble leaving a rehoming shelter because potential owners can't see past her condition. Molly the collie arrived at the Dogs Trust in Newbury, Berkshire, with her near identical sister Holly a month ago. But while Holly quickly found a new home, Molly has struggled and staff believe it is because she has one blue and one brown eye. Scroll down for video . Molly, a one-year-old collie, has one blue and one brown eye, caused by a condition called heterochromia . Holly (left) and Molly (right) were brought to Dogs Trust in Newbury, Berkshire, together, though the latter's blue eye has seen potential owners pass her by . The one-year-old dog is happy and healthy with her blue eye having less pigment than normal in it, a condition known as heterochromia. Actor Kiefer Sutherland and actresses Mila Kunis, Jane Seymour and Kate Bosworth are all affected by the condition, though the differences between their eyes are not as pronounced as with Molly. Jane Seymour has heterochromia, with one brown and one green eye . Native American myth is thought to hold that dogs with two eye colours can see both heaven and earth. The lack of pigment does not affect Molly's sight. Staff at Dogs Trust are appealing for someone to come forward and stop the friendly pet and her pale blue eye from lingering around too much longer. Nicki Barrow, from the centre, said: 'Molly and Holly arrived at the same time, they are both sweet, playful girls of the exact same age. 'They were both looking for similar homes so there is no reason that Molly would be left behind, other than her unusual eye colour. 'It’s baffling as she is a fantastic dog and we think her blue eye makes her look really striking.' Molly is described as an 'affectionate girl' who loves nothing more than playing. Dogs Trust says she is best suited to an adult-only home with a secure garden, ideally in a rural location so she can enjoy plenty of exercise. Nicki added: 'Molly loves company so she would like to find a home with another dog who can act as her doggy guide and help her settle in quickly. 'We really hope a new owner can see behind Molly’s blue eye and offer her a happy home, just like her sister Holly. 'We think Molly is a dog in a million and we really hope she catches the eye of a loving new owner soon.'

"The clinic where Joan Rivers suffered a fatal complication during a routine surgery has lost its federal accreditation and will stop receiving funds at the end of this month. In a letter sent to Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services told the clinic it no longer meets their conditions for coverage. 'Therefore, CMS is terminating the Medicare Health Benefits Agreement between Yorkville Endoscopy and the Secretary, effective January 31, 2015,' it said on Monday. 'As of January 31, 2015 Yorkville Endoscopy will no longer be eligible to receive federal funds for services provided to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.' Loss: Joan Rivers, pictured right with her daughter Melissa, died in September after suffering a complication during surgery at an endoscopy clinic in Manhattan. The clinic has now lost its federal accreditation . The decision means that the private clinic will no longer receive Medicare and Medicaid funding, but it will still receive money from other paying customers. Rivers died of brain damage in September, when she was 81, after she stopped breathing during a botched endoscopy at the Upper East Side clinic on August 28. After her death, a startling report from CMS said Yorkville 'failed to identify deteriorating vital signs' and violated Rivers' right to privacy when a staff member took pictures of her while she was sedated. Following the complaint, the clinic submitted a plan of correction to CMS, promising to better handle anesthesia, respect patient privacy and improve emergency and review protocols. But when investigators returned to the clinic in December, they found the plan of correction had not been properly satisfied, and they continued to find fire hazards and failures in its reviewing systems, according to the report released on Monday. During the re-visit, they found that patients were discharged before anesthesiologists had properly evaluated their conditions after surgery. One anesthesiologist told the agents that she was just too busy to sign off on patients' forms. Failings: Yorkville Endoscopy, which is in Manhattan's Upper East Side, will no longer receive federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid patients from the end of this month, it has emerged . They also found that 'the facility was not constructed, arranged, and maintained to ensure the safety of patients', including leaks and damp through the building. Equipment used for medical gas had also not been inspected in nearly two years, while the air pressure was not low enough in the decontamination room, the report found. It also listed some patient grievances that the clinic had never fully resolved. In one, a Spanish patient complained that her anesthesiologist laughed at her when she made a mistake and that she felt 'scared and ignored' while at the clinic. If Yorkville disagrees with the decision to terminate the Medicare agreement, it can request a hearing before a judge at the Departmental Appeals Board within 60 days, CMS said. In a statement on Monday, the clinic said: 'We are continuing to work with all regulatory bodies. We intend to communicate with CMS and appropriate authorities to have the decision reversed. Doctors:  Dr Lawrence Cohen, left, was the medical director at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic while Dr Gwen Korovin, right, was Joan's private throat specialist. Both are believed to have been at the clinic . 'Yorkville continues to be a licensed facility and perform procedures while cooperating with the regulatory process.' Negligence was not alleged in the report, but Rivers' daughter has hired a malpractice attorney to look into her death and lawyers said they plan to file a wrongful-death suit against the clinic. After the inspections' initial finding were released, the lawyers said in a statement that Melissa Rivers was 'terribly disappointed to learn of the multiple failings'. 'As any of us would be, Ms. Rivers is outraged by the misconduct and mismanagement now shown to have occurred before, during and after the procedure,' it said. 'Moving forward, Ms. Rivers will direct her efforts towards ensuring that what happened to her mother will not occur again with any other patient.'","Yorkville Endoscopy in Manhattan will stop receiving federal funding at the end of January, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said .

"It is a question that has long occupied the hungry minds of millions hoping to lose weight - what is the best diet to help shift the pounds? A plethora of mantras adorning bookshelves, a constant stream of celebrity-endorsed plans bursting with promises of quick weight loss, and a flurry of new 'superfoods' each week, makes the journey to slim down a confusing one. But a new three-part BBC series aims to offer the answer tonight. One of the biggest studies of its kind in the UK, the programme investigates the science behind the latest diet fads. What Is The Right Diet For You, a Horizon series, sees a team of experts considering the effect of biochemistry, psychology and genes on weight gain. CLICK ON THE HAND SYMBOL BELOW TO TAKE THE QUIZ . Instead of buying into the latest dieting fad, the scientists found the only way to successfully lose weight is to use a personalised diet, built around an understanding of a person's individual biology and specific needs. Professor Tanya Byron, a clinical psychologist with 25 years experience, said the study used cutting edge science from Cambridge University to develop tailor-made weight loss plans for 75 overweight volunteers. The dieters firstly took part in a complex screening process to establish a range of things, including the levels of a specific gut hormone, as well as each person's genetic make up. They were then split in to three groups, and given a tailor-made diet to follow for three months. Professor Byron told MailOnline: 'Some we found were emotional eaters, those who used emotional coping mechanisms. 'Then there were people with low levels of the gut hormone GLP-1, which signals the brain, telling it a person is full. 'They were known as the feasters, who don't necessarily eat all the time, but when they do, they find it hard to stop. 'And the third group, the constant cravers, were those whose genes drive them to eat. They are more grazers, they don't eat huge amounts in one sitting. 'We spent a lot of time examining the results of the screening, conducting further experiments to test different factors that affected the results, to make sure the categories were correct.' A new three-part BBC Horizon special investigates the science behind the latest diet fads, helping separate 75 overweight volunteers into three categories: Emotional Eaters, Constant Cravers and Feasters . Emotional Eaters . Emotional eaters are those people who eat for psychological reasons, turning to junk food when they are anxious, depressed or stressed. Studies have shown that the most effective way to lose weight for emotional eaters, is to attend a weight loss group. The groups will supply a diet plan of low-fat, calorie-controlled recipes to follow. For emotional eaters the support of fellow dieters is a powerful tool, helping drive weight loss. And the impending weekly weigh in helps in moments of stress, when a person might be tempted to break their diet. Feasters . When most people eat, a specific hormones in our gut send a strong message to the brain, telling the brain the stomach is full. But if a person is a feaster, scientists believe they produce less of the gut hormone, GLP-1. It means the signal telling a person to stop eating is weaker. To lose weight, feasters need to eat certain foods that help boost the production of gut hormones. A diet high in protein and low glycaemic index (GI) carbohydrates has been found to encourage production of the vital hormones, and increase feelings of fullness. Constant Cravers . Constant cravers feel hungry most of the time. Scientists believe this factor could indicate a person has more of the genes that tend to make you feel hungrier. This increases the likelihood of eating too much and gaining weight. Because constant cravers are constantly hungry, it is hard to sustain the effort to reduce calorie intake every day. So the diet involves two restricted days, where a person will limit their calorie intake to no more than 600-800 calories a day, with virtually no foods or drinks containing carbohydrates. The other five days are unrestricted, meaning a person does not need to count calories or limit carbohydrates, but must eat a healthy Mediterranean-style diet. Personalised diet plans were then designed for each group, based on each of the three profiles. Emotional eaters were encouraged to join weight loss groups and received Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. 'I did a lot of work with this group,' Professor Byron said. 'In tonight's programme you will see us abseilling down a light house. 'The idea was to get them past the ""I cant do this"", ""I am a failure"" way of thinking about dieting, and show them if they can abseil down a building, they can do anything.' Dr Chris Van Tulleken, an infectious diseases specialist from UCL, focused on working with those volunteers in the Feasters and Constant Cravers category. The Constant Cravers were put on an intermittent fasting diet, with two days of low calorie intake and healthy eating for the remaining five days. And for Feasters, their diet was designed to maximise the production of the GLP-1 hormone, and promotes eating foods that are digested in that part of the gut. Professor Byron told MailOnline the study, which is among the first of its kind, far exceeded the scientists' hopes. 'All the volunteers did unbelievably well, they exceeded our targets set for three months, which was that they would lose five per cent of their weight in that time. 'It was an incredible experiment, that was about helping people understand themselves better, to generate more understanding of their behaviours. 'You are more likely to be able to change your behaviour to lose weight and maintain your weight loss. 'It was about giving people the information and helping them use it to change their behaviour and lifestyle.' Dr Van Tulleken added: 'One of the biggest things was trying to get away from the idea that fat, overweight people are lazy. 'There are huge numbers of biological factors outside people's control, like hormones or genes, that means it can be harder for some people to lose weight.' But rather than give people an excuse for why they are overweight, Dr Van Tulleken told MailOnline the study actually empowers people to understand their bodies and learn the best way to shed pounds. A team of experts worked with scientists from Cambridge University to screen the 75 volunteers looking at how their biology affects weight gain. The tests looked at levels of a gut hormone GLP-1 and each person's genes to try and establish the best way to help each individual shed pounds . After being split into the three groups, the volunteers were given a tailor made dieting plan to follow for three months. Emotional Eaters were advised to join weight loss groups and were given Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Constant Cravers were put on an intermittent fasting diet with two days low calorie intake, while Feasters were put on a high protein, high low GI carbohydrate diet . Dr Chris Van Tulleken, third from right, and Professor Tanya Byron, second right, said the study exceeded their expectations. They told MailOnline the key was to help people understand their biological make up, to follow diets that they are more likely to be able to maintain, by changing habits and creating new behaviours . 'When people understand the biology of any medical problem, it empowers them to deal with it,' he said. 'Almost every person has, at some point, tried to lose weight, most will have failed or lost the weight and put it back on. 'The message is that any diet will work if you stick to it,' Dr Van Tulleken said. 'This study was about trying to identify those people a diet that they will find it easier to stick to. 'It is about building new habits and changing behaviours. 'Like if you are trying to learn a new foreign language, it is difficult because if it doesn't come with the lifestyle advice, it will be hard to achieve. 'It is not about willpower. No one can will themselves thin but you can create a life environment to help you lose weight.'

The hate preacher met brothers Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) as they trained in the deserts of Yemen where al Qaeda's deadliest franchise, AQAP, is based . The cleric, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in September 2011, is believed to have spent $2,300 on hookers in Washington alone. Another prostitute told the FBI that al-Awlaki paid her $300 to watch as 'as she engaged in erotic behavior and stimulated herself' in December 2001 and again in January 2002. One hooker told FBI agents 'she looked through the 'peep' hole ... and thought to herself that he looked like Osama bin Laden. Al-Awlaki, who was born in New Mexico, reportedly paid $400 to have sex with the woman. She described him as 'very polite.' It appears the married father of five had a history of paying for sex, despite his deeply fundamentalist beliefs. History: One prostitute told the FBI that al-Awlaki paid her $300 to watch as 'as she engaged in erotic behavior and stimulated herself'. He was also arrested twice in San Diego for soliciting . He was also arrested in 1996 and 1997 for soliciting prostitutes in San Diego where he worked at a small mosque. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine.

American cartoonist Molly Norris remains in hiding four years after she suggested a 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' The revelations of the long term repercussions of satirizing Mohammed came to light after the horrific massacre of Charlie Hebdo staff last week . 'She had to completely change her identity, disappear from her work,' Larry Kelley, the founder of the Free Molly Norris Foundation, told KOMO-TV. Mr Kelley said Ms Norris is the first U.S. journalist working in the country to be forced into hiding by 'radical Islam.' Ms Norris had attempted to satire Comedy Central for censoring imagery of the Prophet Muhammad on TV show South Park. Her cartoons depicted Muhammad's likeness as a tea cup, domino, box of pasta and spool of thread. The move sparked a campaign for artists to draw the icon, something that is forbidden by the Quran. A Facebook page for the May 20 event garnered several thousand attendees to 'defend a little our country is famous for ... the first first amendment,' her cartoon stated. Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone attack, had put Ms Norris on a hit list . Al-Awlaki then named Norris as a 'prime target'.

As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dempsey serves as President Barack Obama's chief military adviser. Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour.' He said such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be hugely disruptive. General Martin Dempsey says the hacking of Sony Pictures Entertainment demonstrates the military superiority enjoyed by the U.S does not necessarily carry over to the cyberworld . Dempsey was recently asked whether the U.S. was vulnerable to a 'Cyber Pearl Harbour' and said that such an attack could disable critical infrastructure and would be incredibly disruptive . Dempsey said the U.S. has peer competitors in cyberwarfare and went as far as calling it a level playing field. That makes him very uncomfortable, Dempsey said. He did not go into detail about steps the U.S. could take to beef up its cyber defences. Dempsey's comments follow an attack on Sony pictures late last year by a North Korean hacking group calling themselves 'Guardians of Peace'. The hackers released a series of embarrassing emails, including correspondence between Sony Pictures co-chairwoman Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin, who referred to Angelina Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat'. Among correspondence released was emails between producer Scott Rudin, middle, and Sony Pictures co-chairman Amy Pascal; in the emails Rudin called Angelina Jolie 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' Parts of the script for the new James Bond film Spectre, which is due to be released in 2015, were also released by the hackers, as well as emails about the plot lines. The Sony letters were published ahead of the release of 'The Interview', a film which takes the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as its subject matter. Several cinemas refused to show the film, which Sony first pulled but later made available on the internet.","US military boss says a cyber attack could 'disable critical infrastructure'

"Ed Miliband had dinner with Hollywood star George Clooney and his glamorous British wife Amal, it has been revealed. The Labour leader was invited to the exclusive gathering at the London home of top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson. Mrs Clooney is a barrister at Mr Robertson’s London chambers, Doughty Street. Mr Miliband was invited to the soiree to be briefed on proposals to introduce fresh sanctions against Russia. Scroll down for video . George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin Clooney wore 'Je Suis Charlie' badges at the Golden Globe awards last night . The Labour leader is now considering plans to ban a string of Russian officials from entering the UK, the Telegraph has reported. Mrs Clooney wants the UK government to introduce US-style travel restrictions on Russian citizens allegedly behind the murder of whistle-blower Sergei Magnitsky. Mr Magnitsky died after months of prison beatings after revealing government corruption. Under measures adopted by the United States, 34 police chiefs, judges and tax officials involved in the Magnitsky case are banned from entering the country. Campaigners now want to see similar measures imposed in Britain. The high-powered dinner took place at Mr Robertson’s London mansion. Anti-Putin campaigner Bill Browder, whose firm Hermitage Capital Management was the victim of the £150 million fraud after being raided by Russian police, briefed Mr Miliband on his case. Ed Miliband was invited to the exclusive gathering at the London home of top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson (right) Mr Clooney is understood to have read Mr Browder’s forthcoming book on the case, Red Notice: How I became Putin No 1 Enemy and told the gathering that it could be made into a film. One source told the Telegraph that Mr Miliband appeared “very keen” on the proposals afterwards. The revelation comes after Mrs Clooney used her first Golden Globes red carpet appearance yesterday to make a political statement - pinning a 'je suis Charlie' button on her Dior handbag in support of France following a series of terrorist attacks last week. She was joined by her husband and several other stars who flashed the viral phrase for cameras. 'I am Charlie' is a statement of solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine where eight journalists were murdered - along with two policemen and two bystanders - by Islamist fanatics last weekend. Dame Helen Mirren, Kathy Bates and Diane Kruger also voiced their support. Mr Clooney and Amal Alamuddin married at the palazzo Ca Farsetti in Venice last year . Film producer Harvey Weinstein wrote in a Variety column that he hopes stars use the Golden Globes as a chance to pledge solidarity with French journalists who were killed last week. 'There's always champagne on the table. I hope we can all raise glasses and that someone like Tina, Amy or George Clooney will urge us to toast with 300 million viewers around the world: 'Je suis Charlie, je suis juif, je suis Ahmed,' he wrote. Mrs Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, told Elle that she was wearing a Dior gown and carrying a handbag that was 'customized in solidarity with the French people who've gone through a terrible week.'","Miliband was invited to the gathering at home of lawyer Geoffrey Robertson .

"While attempting to trim some trees down, this amateur lumberjack got a little more than he bargained for. Along with the help of his family member, the man attempted to sever the top part of a tall tree in his yard, while relying on the boy below to pull the rope. ‘This is what people do for fun in the Outer Banks,’ a dead-panned voice says off-camera, recording the event. ‘Chop down trees, yay.’ Along with the help of a family member, this amateur lumberjack attempts to cut down a tree in his yard . The Outer Banks is a several hundred mile-long string of barrier islands off the coast of North Carolina in the US. While the video starts out harmless enough, the experience quickly becomes a nightmare for all involved - and potentially those walking by. As the man slices the chainsaw through the thin trunk, the entire top gives way and comes crashing down on top of him. However, the boy pulling the rope below didn't quite do so correctly, causing a major mishap . Once the top was severed, it came crashing down - on top of the man who had just cut it! In the process, the man also lost grip of his chainsaw, allowing it to fall several stories to the ground . If that's not horrifying enough, the chainsaw also slips from his hands, falling several stories down. The aspiring outdoorsman himself also falls, supported by the elevated platform he was standing on. Following the debacle, the videographer declares: ‘There’s no way that was safe.’","In North Carolina, a man's attempt to cut down a tree went horribly wrong .

"A family who were planning a dream trip to Disneyland, Florida, were forced to scrap their holiday after US border officials got confused about a date. Mark and Sally Fell hoped to take their son Max on the family trip after returning form a previous Disneyland holiday which they loved. But when they booked the break with Thomson and applied for new online visas known as ESTAs (Electronic System for Travel Authorisation), their applications were rejected. Mark and Sally Fell, with their son Max, who was due to accompany them on their trip to Disneyland, Florida . US border control rejected the family's request on the grounds that Sally, 50, had 'overstayed' on her previous holiday. When the family phoned the US Customs and Borders Protection agency they were told a computer had recorded she had overstayed for three months. They eventually realised it had confused the different UK and US date formats and recorded her departure date as 11/8 - November 8 instead of 8/11 - August 11. The family complained to Thomson but were told nothing could be done and they would not be issued with new ESTAs and had to cancel the holiday. After a two year compensation battle they have finally received vouchers from Thomson to the £3,000 value of the flights they lost. But Sally and civil engineer Mark, 52, say they are still £500 out of pocket because they have not been reimbursed for the accommodation bill. Beauty therapist Sally said: 'With everybody we contacted to try and fix it we came across an attitude of 'it's your problem not ours'. 'We lost all the money on the flights and accommodation and spent hours of our own time sending emails and making calls without getting anywhere. 'What I can't believe is how long it took us to prove to people what date I travelled back. It is a black and white thing really and they didn't believe me. 'It is unbelievable really that we were able to get on a flight out of America without us even being recorded.' She added: 'It is not really Thomson's fault but they didn't deal with the situation quickly and we lost our holiday. 'They are offering us free flights but it has cost us money and caused us a lot of unnecessary stress. 'They weren't interested in sorting out the problem despite it being on their flight using a company they contracted.' The Fell family had previously been to Florida and wanted to return to Disneyland with their youngest son as they had enjoyed it so much . Mark and Sally took all their children - Ashleigh, 25, Jake, 23, and Max, 15 - to Disneyland, Orlando in 2012 and hoped to go back with Max the following summer. They later found that hundreds of people had been affected by the glitch with Ultra Electronics - used by US Customs and Borders Protection - that occurred around October 2013. Sally claims that Ultra Electronics notified the US Customs and Border Protection but the authorities refused to act on it for almost a year. She added: 'Hundreds of other people were affected and we don't know why my husband and son didn't have the same problem. 'I think when it got to August 13th somebody must have realised there weren't 13 months in a year.' But Sally, from Hertford, Herts. added that they only managed to achieve justice after an investigation by the BBC Rip Off Britain programme. Thomson said a third-party company was responsible for the error. Thomson has now paid out for the lost flights, but the Fells claim they are still out of pocket for the cancelled accommodation due to the mix-up . A spokesman said: 'We sympathise with the Fell family and understand their frustration and disappointment at not being able to travel to Florida. 'We did everything that we could to support the family. 'However, as Thomson has no influence over the operations of, or the decisions made by, the US Customs and Border Protection agency and the local departure control system provider, there was unfortunately nothing that we could do to enable the family to travel.' He added: 'Whilst our terms and conditions do state that Thomson is unable to provide compensation for unused flights that result from the necessary documentation and authority for travel not being in place, and the original issue was unconnected to Thomson, we believe it is unfair that the Fell family is out of pocket as a result of an error at a third-party company. 'We have therefore offered them flights to Florida up to the value of the original flights purchased as a gesture of goodwill. 'We would like to reassure customers that this was an extremely rare situation and we understand the system issue has been resolved by the local departure control system provider.'","Mark and Sally Fell booked family trip after returning from Disney holiday .

"Health officials are reporting seven more cases of measles in an outbreak tied to visits to Disney theme parks in California last month. The new cases confirmed Monday by the California Department of Public Health brings the total to 26 people in four states. Officials say 22 of the cases are in California and two are in Utah, with one apiece in Colorado and Washington. Scroll down for video . Outbreak: Public health officials confirmed that most of the 26 people who contracted measles all visited Disneyland in Anaheim, California (pictured) Most of the patients visited Disneyland or Disney California Adventure between December 15 and December 20, but some may have contracted the illness from others who visited. The new cases include three reported Monday in Southern California, including two in San Bernardino County and one in Long Beach. Disney officials have said they are working with public health authorities to provide any necessary assistance. According to a health alert issued last week: 'Based on information from current cases, it is likely that a person infectious with measles was at one of the theme parks on these dates. 'People can be infectious with measles for nine days. Measles typically begins with fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and within a few days a red rash appears, usually first on the face and then spreads downward to the rest of the body. The measles virus, pictured, can survive in the air or on surfaces for two hours after a cough or sneeze . Measles sufferers first develop a fever, cough and runny nose then an irritating rash, file photograph . 'Measles is a highly infectious, airborne disease.' The California Department of Public Health stated that measles was eradicated in the US in 2000, although the country remains at risk from foreign visitors carrying the infection. The alert continued: 'Large measles outbreaks have occurred in Western Europe, Pakistan, Vietnam and the Philippines in recent years. 'Travelers to areas where measles is endemic can bring measles back to the U.S., resulting in limited domestic transmission of measles. Disney and other theme parks in California are international attractions and visitors come from many parts of the world, including those where measles is endemic.' Of those diagnosed with the highly contagious ailment, 12 were unvaccinated and six were vaccinated. California Public Health official Dr Ron Chapman said: 'The best way to prevent measles and its spread is to get vaccinated.' He urged anyone who may have been infected to check immediately with a doctor. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in an infected person's nose and throat mucus and spreads through coughing and sneezing. The CDC warned: Measles virus can live for up to two hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed . 'If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected.' Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes and a red rash that usually first appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. Disney officials said they had not received any reports of staff contracting measles. Park officials are working with the health department to provide any necessary information, said Dr. Pamela Hymel, chief medical officer for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. The CDPH warned medics to ask patients if they have either travelled to areas with a measles problem or locations domestically with a large number of foreign tourists from infected areas.","Twenty two of the cases are in California and two are in Utah, with one each in Colorado and Washington .

"A social network for sex toys has been revealed that aims to allows users to meet and interact with each other easily has been launched. Called FriXion, the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex toys from differentmanufacturers easily. It even hopes to develop games and live broadcasts using the technology, where one performer can control thousands of devices around the globe. Scroll down for video . The firm  is adapting this $199 computer game controller to work with sex toys as part of the project to link couples remotely. The Florida -based cyberdildonics company FriXion is currently beta-testing the system. 'Frixion is a software company, we want to take off the shelf products and work with them, the firm's founder Seth, who would not reveal his last name, told dailymail.com . 'We are working with robotic devices that we are adapting for this.' The firm is initially adapting a $199 game controller with a built in vibration function. 'We met the guys who invented this, and it fitted perfectly. 'Eventually we will sell out own devices - we have some great ideas.' 'We are an ambitious startup with the goal of getting people interacting physically on the internet,' it says. 'With this in mind, our beta explores ways that intimacy can be augmented by technology. 'Using sophisticated haptic teledildonics two or more FriXion users are able to touch each other and even have sex at any distance.' The network uses off-the-shelf sex toys and already existing technologies and connects them using its network. It allows teledildonic devices — dildos, vibrators, and sleeves, for example— to interact with each other using real-time bidirectional force feedback. Called FriXion, the firm says it will allow people to easily and remotely control a range of sex aids from different manufacturers easily. 'On the next generation haptic social network innovative and affordable haptic peripherals empower FriXion users to come together and touch each other in tangible, stimulating ways; from holding hands and kissing up to and including full penetrative sex whether your partner is across the room or across an ocean,' the firm says. Founder Seth, says the effect is extremely realistic. 'Frixion is a software platform we're developing to enable people to connect physically over distance,' he told Nerve. 'It feels like the act of sex. While you're thrusting, I'm being penetrated. You're pushing back. I'm feeling the resistance.' Elsewhere, people who want to hold hands with someone miles away can buy a pair of Freebles. When one user squeezes their Frebble (pictured), the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. When one user squeezes their Frebble, the corresponding Frebble in their loved one's hand will gently apply pressure to the back of their hand, simulating what they would feel if you were holding hands right next to each other. When combined with Skype, for example, the experience is said to be 'immersive'. Frebble uses haptic technology, or 'tactile feedback' to mimic the sensation of hand-holding through two devices. Once the Frebbles have connected to each other through the internet, when one user squeezes their device, the other user will feel the sensation of their hand being held. They do this thanks to two pressure sensors at the front of each device to register squeezing, two vibration motors on the side to make the sensation feel more real, and one integrated 'squeeze bar' to replicate holding hands. A multicolour LED will indicate connection status and when a squeeze is waiting. 'For a granddaughter calling grandma with special news, for a husband far away from a wife, for distant grown daughters who crave the comfort of their mother's touch, for a best friend who wants to let her friend know it will all be ok, Frebble connects – as simply, subtly and as powerfully as though the person was right there with you,' the company says. 'While there are many ways to see and hear your loved ones through the power of the internet, the tactile element has been missing – until now.

"A father sick of his teenage son's battered car has put the 'dustbin' motor on eBay, listing all the things wrong with it - and frankly asking, 'Who would buy it?' Nigel Stewart-Stone uses the advert to apologise for the state of the black Renault Clio, which he says is full of litter and boasts multiple dents thanks to his son Dalton's bad driving. Among the many faults with the vehicle are a passenger seat which doesn't move because girls are always getting in and out, according to the jokey eBay listing. Battered: Nigel Stewart-Stone is selling his son Dalton's old Renault Clio in a brutally frank eBay advert . Damage: The car is badly dented because of its teenage owner's erratic driving, according to his father . Mr Stewart-Stone, 50, suggests that the car would be best for another teenager - because Dalton's trashing of the vehicle 'will save them all the time and effort'. Other problems with the 10-year-old Renault include a slipping clutch, which its owner failed to notice because he's always blasting loud music, his father said. The mischievous father, from Newton Abbot in Devon, is selling the car because Dalton, 19, has a new one - but Mr Stewart-Stone says the replacement vehicle 'will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come'. He signs himself off as a 'devoted father with much patience', and admits the car has 'absolutely no warranty'. But despite the brutally honest advert, the online auction for the car - which has done 130,000 miles and would normally fetch £1,500 in good condition - has already reached £117, with another five days left to run. Defensive: Dalton, pictured with his new Vauxhall Corsa, says he is 'quite a clean person' Mr Stewart-Stone said: 'I wrote the advert after my son's car packed up and he had a bit of a panic. 'He's an estate agent so needed something nice to go to work in. I sat down and looked at the car and thought, who is really going to buy it anyway? 'Then I started grinning to myself about the things that he had done to the car. It's just typical of a teenager. When we bought it there was nothing wrong with it. 'I have had so many text messages and emails through eBay and on Facebook. Some of the responses have been really great. I find it really amusing. 'I don't think my son expected so many people to read it. He might actually start to get a little bit embarrassed.' Knackered: A handle has come off one of the car's doors, and the upholstering has a tear in it . But Dalton said: 'I'm not really embarrassed at all as my dad cracks jokes all the time. He thinks he's really funny. 'I hadn't even sat down from work when he started reeling the advert off to me. I think he's been quite pleased with the attention - he put his best clothes on for the photo. 'There are certain ground rules with my new car. I'm not allowed food or McDonald's. No smoking and no girls except my girlfriend. He's a joker really because I'm quite a clean person.' Even eBay users with no interest in buying the car expressed appreciation for the humorous tone of the listing. Jon Zaple, 25, wrote: 'Thanks for entertaining me and my friends for five minutes whilst we read your eBay article. 'I'd like to take this opportunity to wish you the utmost luck in selling your son's car. We actually considering buying it for a laugh at one point.' This car belonged to my 19-year-old son, who now has a new car, I can only apologise for the state of it, clearly he will treat his new one the same. OK, the passenger side has a large dent on it, were my son tried to climb the corner of my house, I did tell him that if he is going to insist on going back and forth on the wall the dent will get bigger!!! And the driveway is only 10ft wide after all. The clutch is now slipping, again he did not know this, as loud music is the preferred thing, and could not hear it slipping, just wondered why it took him longer to get up a hill!!! Still there is enough clutch left to get you home, I think? Surprisingly the electric windows still work well, considering the amount of times they go up and down calling to his mates, and banter with the passing girls, many of whom have been taken for rides in the car, which may explain the passenger seat not moving back and forth anymore, still makes it hard for them to escape his deafening music. Honest: This advert lists all the flaws of the car, which dates back to 2005 and has done 130,000 miles . There may or may not be any oil and water in the car, despite me repeatedly telling him to make sure it was maintained, I believe he thought this meant sitting in it on the driveway listening to his music whilst having a smoke, he would have washed it occasionally, but said 'not really worth it now is it dad', as it's got a big dent on it!!! And anyway, surely I would know if it needed oil, the red light would come on!! Still he does have a brand new set of mats in the boot, bought when he first had the car. There may be the odd ripple in the front of the bonnet, but according to my son that was there when it was bought for him, and nothing to do with sitting and chilling on it, may be it was a better place to sit than the passenger seat!! It does have the other alloy wheel in the boot, with a puncture, but if he gets another puncture he will use one of the other three on the car. The drivers seat has a hole in it, this was done killing time, whilst stuck on the side of the house performing modifications to the side of the car. The rear of the car is in fact a large dustbin for discarded fruit, and Mc Donald's, not for carrying passengers, but still he says he's loving it!!! Anyway if you think this car may be suitable for your son, please go ahead and buy it, it's after all in the perfect state for any teenager lad, and will save them all the time and effort that my son has put in to it, getting it this way. It's now down to me to dispose of this wonderful car I bought him many years ago, now he has a new one, he thinks that you just leave it parked on the side of the road until someone comes and takes it. It's not how he has treated the car since he has owned it that worries me, its the fact that he now has a new 14 plate car, which incidentally will be coming up for sale in a similar state in some years to come, although he informs me he will look after this one because it has 'no dents', and is clean and shiny, and doesn't need washing, to my surprise he went and bought a new set of mats for it - 'They're in the boot', is this history repeating itself? When I told my son I was selling it, because he now had a new car, he said well who gets the money? I said me of course, but it won't be much as the car has had it, to which he then replied,'That's not fair, it's a good car, nothing wrong with it,' and that he should get the cash. I offer absolutely no warranty with this car, and many thanks for looking. Nigel, a devoted father with much patience.","Nigel Stewart-Stone has decided to sell teenage son Dalton's Renault Clio .

"A stalk carries a newborn baby, a hummingbird flutters in front of an exotic flower and a colourful parrot takes flight ... or so it seems. At a first glance these incredible images could be mistaken for portraits of our feathered friends, but on a closer inspection it's clear to see they feature painted models. The set of fascinating photos was created by expert bodypainter Kate Dean who transformed naked men and women into birds using nothing but a lick of paint and inventive photography. Scroll down for video . Anyone expecting a stork? A newborn baby is carried in one of Kate Dean's incredibly lifelike portraits featuring painted human bodies . The collection, called Life In Flight, tells the story of human life through birds, from finding a partner and settling down to having children then watching them grow up and leave the nest. The peacock symbolises the search for a mate, the lovebirds perched on a branch represent the intimacy of a relationship, and the stalk delivering a baby stands for birth. The incredible images took eight months to plan, paint and perfect, and Kate juggled creating the collection with being pregnant with her first daughter Jemima. Feeding baby chicks: Kate's work is said to represent different stages of human life including settling down and having children . The lovebirds perched on a branch represent the intimacy of a relationship in Kate's body-painting works . Kate paints a model's hands so they look like a parrot taking flight . Kate, 32, from Bristol, started face painting aged 17 but it wasn't until 2005 when she went to an event that specialised in her niche that she decided to make the switch from the face to entire bodies. 'I had a part-time job doing face painting when I was 17 and it was something I kept doing through university' said Kate. 'I started to do high-end corporate events and celebrity parties but it wasn't until I went to the World Body Painting Festival in 2005 with my two sisters, who are both models, that I really got into it.' Kate says that it was meeting other talented artist like herself that encouraged her to improve her craft even further. 'Somehow we fell in with the right crowd and we became mates with some of the best body painters in the world. 'When you hang out with the best you have to up your game so I went home and did a bit of work, put it online and got some really good recognition for it.' Kate's more intricate creations can take up to 15 hours to complete and include up to 12 painted models - including this peacock . Kate produced six images of birds for her project Life In Flight - including this hummingbird 'representing the intimacy of a relationship' After trying it out Kate realised that she wanted to turn her hobby into a full-time job despite not having professional qualifications in the area. 'About five years ago I decided that body painting would be my main profession. 'I've not had any formal training but I've always been creative - it is something that comes naturally to me and I love doing it.' Kate wasted no time in getting started despite the fact that she had recently become pregnant. 'I came home one day and decided I was going to get together a really high quality set of images. We had just decided to have a baby at the time so that put a bit of time pressure on it.' Kate juggled her project with her first pregnancy which actually helped to influence the message behind the work . The final collection is the result of seven to eight months of continuous work . Kate's recent life development seemed to have influence on her work with settling down and pregnancy taking a subconscious theme in her work. 'When I made the images I didn't really have anything in mind apart from the fact that I wanted to create six images of birds. 'I painted them in the order they appear in the collection without actually realising that they tell a story of human life and of my life at that time. 'They show how you find a mate, settle down, have kids and then they grow up and leave the nest.' Some of the more intricate body painting took as long as 15 hours to get right. Kate ensures that every part of the process is entirely organic, never relying on computer trickery to perfect her images. 'Everything you see in my work is a person - there's no props, it's just my painting and clever photography. Even the colourful backgrounds are done with lighting. 'The collection is the result of about seven or eight months' work. The more complicated images can take up to 15 hours to paint the models and get the right shot. 'I'm really proud of the collection - it's the best work I've ever done.'","Kate Dean from Bristol has created six images of birds by painting human bodies .

"Defiant congressional Republicans attacked President Barack Obama's agenda from all sides Tuesday, ignoring the five veto threats he has issued in a week's time and pushing bills to uproot his policy agenda. Immigration, Wall Street, the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline and a sweeping reboot of how the White House enacts costly regulations are all on the chopping block, and the president's insistence on his way has some in the GOP steamed. 'I'm a member of Congress; I'm not a potted plant. I don't take my orders from the White House,' Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent told the Associated Press after GOP members met behind closed doors to discuss their strategy. 'There's a new sheriff in the Senate, and so he's not going to have a compliant majority leader in the Senate who's going to bottle up and bury everything,' Dent said. 'I'M NOT A POTTED PLANT!': Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent said Tuesday after his leadership warned President Obama would negate their work if it's not to his liking . Obama (center), joined by top congressional leaders from both major parties on Tuesday at the White House, spoke to media before laying out his ultimatums and warning that he holds a veto pen . That was a nod to new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans had complained in the first six years of the Obama presidency that former leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, frequently refused to bring any bill to a vote if the White House opposed it. Obama invited his antagonists to the White House for their first face-to-face meeting since the new Republican-controlled Congress convened. But their show of cordiality for the cameras did little to mask the partisan hostilities between Capitol Hill and the White House. 'The key now is for us to work as a team,' said Obama, despite his prolific veto warnings. He cited taxes, trade and cybersecurity as areas for potential cooperation. Back at the Capitol, the Senate debated legislation to force Obama's administration to green-light the Keystone project, and the House moved toward a vote late Tuesday on a regulatory reform bill that the White House says would impose 'unprecedented and unnecessary' requirements on agencies trying to write rules. It would require more justifications and notice, particularly for regulations that would cost the treasury millions of dollars. That may be followed Wednesday by votes on two other bills. One would alter a key section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in a way that would help banks; the other would block Obama's executive actions on immigration, including removal of protections for immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children. The Keystone bill passed the House last week and is expected to clear the Senate next week and head to Obama's desk. Vetoes almost surely await, although the White House's official policy statements are couched in language that guarantees only that the president's aides will recommend he reject the legislation. Far from cowed, with the Senate in GOP hands for the first time in eight years Republican lawmakers are ready to make him uncap that veto pen. COOPERATION: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's role this week is to promote the talking point that the president has his arms open and is willing to work with Republicans . WORK AS A TEAM? Obama charmed legislators on Tuesday but did little to assuage Republicans' suspicion that he's playing political games . While the president mouthed words of cooperation, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest openly criticized Republican lawmakers during a daily press briefing, painting Obama as the only non-obstructionist with any meaningful power in Washington. The GOP's approach to the opening days of the new Congress, Earnest told reporters, raises questions 'about how serious they are about trying to work with the president.' 'In the first five days that they've been in session, they've advanced five pieces of legislation all the way to the Rules Committee that they already know this president strongly opposes,' he said. Republicans have no plans to stop there. Citing the terrorist attacks in Paris, GOP senators proposed on Tuesday to restrict how Obama can transfer terror suspects out of the federal prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the remainder of his term. That move would make it far more difficult for him to fulfill his 2007 campaign promise to close the facility.","GOP members resent being pushed around by the White House after their stunning electoral sweep two months ago .
Obama warns that he'll reject five specific bills that disagree with his policy agenda but insists that Republicans 'work as a team' with him .
House GOP is moving ahead anyway with an attempt to neuter the president's immigration amnesty push .
They seem intent on forcing Obama to uncap his veto pen and take a stand on issues where they perceive the public is on their side ."
"A size 24 bridesmaid that was so horrified by her weight that she believed she had ruined her friend's wedding pictures was shocked into losing seven stone. Karen Copeland, 39, was overjoyed to be maid of honour at her best friend's ceremony in August 2013 - but was left mortified after seeing the photographs from the big day. The mother-of-two, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, says she felt her bulky 17 stone 8lb frame had spoiled the pictures and vowed to straight away to lose weight. Karen Copeland, pictured left as a bridesmaid weighing 17 stone 8lbs, was so horrified after seeing herself in her bridesmaid dress that she was inspired to lose seven stone, pictured right . Karen swapped her bad eating habits for healthy food and within 12 months she lost almost 7 stone, weighing 10st 12lbs and a svelte size 12. She revealed she started piling on the pounds after an accident five years ago which left her with metal pins and plates in her ankle. Her injured foot would swell up at the end of a long day hairdressing, forcing her to sit on the sofa with her feet up when she got home, where she would munch on chocolate and crisps. She also didn't eat proper meals while at work. Desperate to lose weight, Karen joined her local Slimming World group and replaced her unhealthy diet with cereals, pastas and stir-frys. Determined to change her ways Karen joined Slimming World and dropped six dress sizes . Karen began piling on the pounds, left, after injuring her ankle which would leave her inactive after a hard day working in the salon, but after joining Slimming World Karen even won 'Slimming Woman of the Year' (right) Now Karen has Weetabix for breakfast with fresh berries and bananas and will take a healthy pasta salad or leftover stir fry to work for lunch. Karen said that it was seeing the photographs in full size finally gave her the wake-up call that she needed to lose the weight. 'At the time of my friend's wedding I thought I looked fine,' she said. 'But when we had some photographs blown up to put around the house I just looked at myself and thought ""oh that's shocking."" 'It looked like someone had pumped me up with a foot pump.' Karen says that she was so ashamed by the photographs that she felt guilty for spoiling them for her friend. Karen has completely changed her eating habits, swapping her diet of crisps, chocolate and junk food with healthy cereals, pastas and stir-frys . 'When I saw those photos I just realised I looked horrendous. 'I felt like I spoiled all of those photographs. I really did. I felt really bad. I just thought ""what's that fat lump doing in those nice pictures"".' Karen says that the transformation was so dramatic that her customers thought she had left the salon. 'Now I don't look like that person whatsoever and people don't even recognise me.' 'When people come into my salon they ask ""where's Karen?"" and I'll say ""It's me."" 'I've gone from a size 22/24 to a size 12 so people really don't believe it - especially because I did it in 12 months.' Karen says that as well as dramatically changing her appearance her weight loss has allowed her to enjoy whole new experiences that she would have otherwise been unable to do. 'It's great because now I can go swimming, play with my kids and do things like going to theme parks and flying which I was worried about before because of my size. 'Shopping is a new experience too. I'm not stuck in what I call the 'fat shops'. I can go where I like. 'It's completely changed my life.'","Karen Copeland was so ashamed by wedding photos that she dropped 7st .

"Lesbians are less likely to suffer mental health problems than bisexual women, new research claims (file picture) Bisexual women are more likely to suffer mental health problems than lesbians, new research claims. The largest British survey of its kind found bisexual women are more likely to feel depressed, self-harm, and develop eating issues. Bisexual women were 64 per cent more likely to report an eating problem and 37 per cent more likely to have deliberately self-harmed than lesbians, according to the research published in the Journal of Public Health. They were also 26 per cent more likely to have felt depressed, and 20 per cent more likely to have suffered from anxiety in the previous year than lesbians. Using data from the 2007 Stonewall UK Women's Health Survey, researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine analysed responses from 5,700 bisexual and lesbian women living in the UK aged 14 or over. The study found bisexual women were less likely to be 'out' to friends, family and work colleagues and also less likely to be in a relationship. While they were less likely to experience sexuality-related discrimination from work, healthcare services, education and family than lesbians, they were more likely to suffer problems with friends. The new findings differ from those of a similar UK survey in 2003, which found no difference in psychological distress between bisexual women and lesbians. Study lead author Lisa Colledge added: 'These disturbing results echo international findings on mental health differences between bisexual and homosexual people. 'Although non-hetrosexual women as a group have far poorer mental health than heterosexual women, bisexual women report even worse mental distress than lesbians.' Study senior author Dr Ford Hickson, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'Bisexual people are at particular risk of invisibility and marginalisation from both gay and lesbian communities and mainstream society. 'Although bisexual women in our study reported experiencing less sexuality-based discrimination than lesbians, this did not benefit their mental health. 'Mental health services should be aware of both the differences and the similarities in bisexual and lesbian women's mental health care needs, and tailor the services they provide accordingly.' The researchers also found that older bisexual women had more suicidal thoughts than younger bisexual women. They were also more likely to report poor physical health and more likely to use marijuana or tranquilisers than lesbians. Ms Colledge added: 'All women deserve equal chances of mental well-being and happiness, regardless of their sexuality. Bisexual women are 'more likely to feel depressed, self-harm, and develop eating issues' (file picture) 'Homophobic prejudice is now widely and rightly condemned; specific stigma around bisexual identity needs to be similarly confronted.' In the UK, where the study was conducted, the numbers of women identifying as lesbian and as bisexual are similar. However, only 16 per cent of the survey participants were bisexual women. The researchers suggested this may be linked to bisexual women's reluctance to disclose their sexual identity. The researchers said that 'concealment of sexual orientation is known to be related to poorer mental health in sexual minority women'. The study authors suggest that bisexual women may have a more negative attitude towards themselves, and expect more social rejection, putting their mental health at risk. The authors suggest that legal and social changes in subsequent years, such as the 2004 Civil Partnership Act, and improvements in public attitudes towards lesbian and gay people, may have benefited lesbian women more than bisexual women.","Bisexual women are more likely to feel depressed and self-harm .

"Labour will lose the election if it allows Ed Miliband to be pitted against David Cameron in a presidential-style contest, John Prescott warned yesterday. The former deputy prime minister said Labour had to ‘run as a party’, rather than relying on its struggling leader, who could cost it the election. Lord Prescott, who has previously criticised the ‘pointy-heads’ running Labour’s campaign, suggested the party still had to explain to voters ‘what we stand for’. Labour will lose the election if it becomes a presidential contest between David Cameron and Ed Miliband (left), former deputy prime minister John Prescott (right) warned . Asked whether it was in good shape ahead of the election, he said: ‘It could be in better shape and I think it’s working to it. It’s seen that they've got to get over to people and convince them.’ In a frank admission of Mr Miliband's personal unpopularity with the voters, he added: ‘Don’t run, Ed, as a president – you won’t win. ‘Run as a party so people can understand what we stand for and what our values are.’ Tory strategists are determined to run a presidential-style campaign that offers voters a straight choice between Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband as prime minister. A YouGov poll at the weekend found that 40 per cent of voters think Mr Cameron is doing a good job, while 52 per cent do not, giving him a net satisfaction rating of minus 12. By contrast, just 18 per cent of people said Mr Miliband was doing a good job, compared to 70 per cent who said he was not – giving the Labour leader a net satisfaction rating of minus 52. Lord Prescott’s intervention came as former prime minister Tony Blair renewed his veiled criticism of Mr Miliband, saying Labour needed a ‘strong’ leader to win. Lord Prescott was quizzed about the state of the Labour party on Jack Whitehall's chat show Backchat . Labour floundered yesterday on how it would plug Britain’s huge budget deficit – suggesting higher fees for gun owners. Chancellor George Osborne said Labour seemed not to want ‘to mention the deficit at all’ and challenged it to spell out tax rises it would bring in. Labour’s plan to soften spending cuts if it wins the election would mean borrowing up to £50billion a year more by 2020 than the Tories, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, risking adding £170billion to the national debt by 2030. The main parties last night agreed to back a new Charter of Budget Responsibility, which will mean billions more pounds being wiped off spending. Mr Osborne said he would not raise taxes, but save £13billion from Whitehall departments and £12billion from welfare, and £5billion from reduced tax avoidance to balance the books. But Chris Leslie, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, struggled to explain how the party could sign up to the charter while not setting out cuts or tax rises. He could only name Labour’s plan to increase the top rate of tax to 50p and £17.2million extra from ‘gun licence changes’ – money already promised to the police. A Tory spokesman said: ‘This shows the total chaos in Labour’s economic policy.’ Mr Blair said it would be up to the electorate voters to decide whether Mr Miliband had the necessary leadership qualities to be prime minister. But in a lukewarm endorsement of the man who hopes to follow in his footsteps and return Labour to power, the ex-premier said voters would make up their own minds about whether Mr Miliband had a ‘problem’. Interviewed by BBC political editor Nick Robinson as part of a new Radio 4 series called Can Democracy Work?, Mr Blair repeatedly said that firm leadership was the key to success. With Labour failing to establish a clear lead in opinion polls, Mr Blair was asked what Mr Miliband's ‘problem’ was. ‘I'm not sure he has got a problem. That’ll be for the people to choose. I'm Labour Party and I’ll be backing him.’ Latest polling shows Mr Miliband's net satisfaction ratings are far worse than David Cameron's . Tony Blair issued a thinly-veiled warning that Labour needs to show strong leadership in the run-up to the election . Last month, Mr Blair was forced to issue a ‘clarification’ after apparently suggesting he expected Mr Miliband to lose the election after dragging the Labour Party to the Left. In an interview with the Economist, Mr Blair said the election could be one ‘in which a traditional Left-wing party competes with a traditional Right-wing party, with the traditional result’. Asked if he meant a Tory win, Mr Blair replied: ‘Yes, that is what happens.’ The following day, Mr Blair said his remarks had been ‘misinterpreted’, and insisted he hoped and expected Mr Miliband would win.","Former Deputy PM warns the Labour party 'could be in better shape'

"German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined thousands  who marched to condemn the terrorist attacks in Paris, promote tolerance and send a rebuke to a growing anti-Islamic movement today. The chancellor was among the marchers at a Muslim community rally today, a day after a record 25,000 people attended a right-wing protest. The German Chancellor said: 'Hatred, racism and extremism have no place in this country. We are a country based on democracy, tolerance and openness to the world.' Scroll down for video . German President Joachim Gauck (centre) gives a speech in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin at a Muslim community rally today . Vigil: Thousands of people, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel turned out to condemn the terrorist attacks in Paris, promote tolerance and send a rebuke to a growing anti-Islamic movement . (l-r) German President Joachim Gauck, chairman of the Central Committee of Muslims in Germany Aiman Mazyek, and Chancellor Angela Merkel at the vigil . President Joachim Gauck addressed the event at Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, organised by the Central Council of Muslims under the banner 'Let's be there for each other. Terror: not in our name!' Imams recited Koranic verses, including a passage that condemns the taking of life, and this was followed by speeches given by Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious leaders and a minute's silence. Announcing the vigil, the Muslim Council and the Turkish Community of Berlin had condemned 'the despicable terror attacks in France in the strongest terms' and stressed that 'there is no justification in Islam for such acts'. With a view to a nascent anti-Islamic movement, they said they wanted 'to send a message for peace and tolerance, against hatred and violence and for a cosmopolitan Germany which respects and protects the freedom of expression and religion'. The rallies are in response to last week's terrorist attacks in Paris which shocked the world. Last night, tens of thousands of people joined the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamisation of the West, or PEGIDA, rally in the city of Dresden in the former communist east Germany. The right-wing movement was founded on Facebook and launched with several hundred people in October. It has grown week-by-week and spawned smaller copycat groups nationwide, with the group's 12th march held last night. But across the country, 100,000 people took to the streets in counter-demonstrations on Monday, voicing support for multiculturalism and Germany's four-million-strong Muslim community.

Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, Aiman Mazyek (left) and  German Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) were among thousands at a Muslim community rally, less than 24 hours after a record 25,000 people attended a right-wing protest . Merkel, who is often known to avoid controversial issues, has weighed in strongly, condemning PEGIDA's leaders and stressing on Monday that 'Islam is part of Germany'. Representatives of Germany's Green party (l-r) Anton Hofreiter, Katrin Goering-Eckardt and Simone Peter lay a wreath in front of the French embassy in Berlin . Her comments were broadly hailed in the media, but not everyone agreed. 'Naturally, Muslims belong in our society,' said Merkel's former interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, a Bavarian conservative. 'But the question is knowing what constitutes the identity of a country, and in Germany it is a Christian identity built on Judeo-Christian roots.' Commentary on news site Spiegel Online meanwhile praised Merkel for speaking out against PEGIDA, at the risk of losing voters at the fringes of her conservative party. 'The chancellor is not playing tactical games but in her New Year's address placed herself at the forefront of the anti-PEGIDA movement,' it said, after Merkel condemned the group's leaders as having 'prejudice, coldness, even hatred in their hearts'. Bild, Germany's top-selling daily, said the Paris attacks seemed to have shaken the usually unflappable Merkel, a pastor's daughter who grew up in the communist east. 'She has two issues where, when she speaks, she doesn't sound like she is simply droning on with platitudes: religion and freedom,' it said, noting the rare public signs of emotion she showed with Hollande at Sunday's solidarity march. 'She knows that gestures are now necessary... it is about freedom and protection from a terrorist war.' On Sunday, Merkel joined French President Francois Hollande and other world leaders at a huge Paris solidarity rally. At the right-wing protest on Monday, one placard depicted German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had spoken out against the protests, wearing a headscarf .

There is no clear favourite to replace Napolitano, although former Prime Minister Romano Prodi and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, have been mentioned as potential candidates. 'I would like us to salute Napolitano, a committed Europeanist who in these hours will leave his post,' Prime Minister Renzi said in a speech to the European Parliament today, . The Italian president plays little part in day-to-day . politics, but has the power to choose a prime minister and . dissolve parliament, a crucial role in the last few years which when a divided parliament struggled to agree on a government. The upcoming election of Napolitano's successor carries political risks for Prime Minister Renzi, a 40-year-old centre-left leader who has been in power for almost a year. Big task: Prime Minister Matteo Renzi now face the difficult task of finding a strong presidential candidate to replace the 89-year-old political veteran . Some analysts believe Renzi will push for new elections if he . cannot find broad support for a new candidate. Napolitano was first elected to parliament in 1953 and became president in 2006 as a prominent member of the Democratic . Left, the rebranded Cold War-era Communists. Former PM Romano Prodi is said to be among the possible candidates to replace Napolitano . His supporters say he has been an anchor of stability in the . country's political maelstrom, while his detractors see him as . a relic of a discredited political class and . accuse him of overreaching his powers. He is expected to formally resign on Wednesday. Laura . Boldrini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, parliament's . lower house, will name the date for the election of his . successor by 1,009 parliamentarians and regional . representatives, which must begin within 15 days. The voting, which requires a two-thirds majority in the . first three rounds, can be highly unpredictable, with lawmakers . using the secret ballot to scupper candidates and settle . political scores. Renzi said this week he was confident a president could be . chosen in the fourth round, when only a simple majority is . needed. The search for a new president will be closely watched by . other EU countries, who will be hoping it does not cause instability in the . euro zone's third largest economy. They are already concerned by . elections due to take place in Greece on Jan 25 which point to a likely victory . for the far-left Syriza party. That election was triggered by the failure of the country's prime . minister to win support for a president. The search for a new Italian head of state comes at a difficult time . for Renzi. He is thought to have many enemies in his own Democratic Party (PD) who resent his uncompromising leadership style and oppose his . plans for reform of the electoral law and the labour market. Meanwhile the economy is still in recession a year after Renzi took . office while promising a rapid recovery. He has also struggled to . produce the deep reforms requested by the European Commission. The reform process is likely to come to halt while . parliament is occupied with the election of a new president.","Giorgio Napolitano, 89, is 'imminently retiring' as President of Italy .

"The View is dimming at the show that Barbara Walters built. Network insiders tell Daily Mail Online that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. Currently in its eighteenth season, the show created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez. Now under the umbrella of ABC News, the network is considering the possibility of ending the show and replacing it with an extended version of 'Good Morning America.' 'The brass at ABC feels like they've tried to do everything possible to breathe new life into this show,' said the insider. They moved it from ABC Entertainment Daytime to the ABC News division, that was having so much success with Good Morning America. Scroll down for video . Is this it?  Network insiders tell Daily Mail Online that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts - particularly Whoopi and Rosie . Promises, promises: The new season of The View with Whoopi, Nicolle Wallace, Rose Perez and Rosie O started off with high hopes . But in spite of the changes, nothing seems to be helping the sluggish ratings for the show. 'They're ready to abandon ship at this point,' the source told Daily Mail Online. When contacted by Daily Mail Online, a show spokesperson denied any plan by ABC to end the show. ABC News is winning in the morning show wars with GMA and the network hoped that the magic of that team could rub off on The View. Despite multiple changes to the set, a new show introduction, a shift to softer topics and adding guest co-hosts to the show, ratings still have still declined. 'ABC feels it's exhausted their options with The View and now it's time to expand the existing franchise, GMA. They feel that since GMA is already beating NBC's Today during the first two hours of the broadcast, why not extend the morning broadcast,' the insider revealed. In 2012, following the cancellation of talk show The Revolution, ABC launched a test show called Good Afternoon America, the network's first extension of GMA. The temporary summer series hosted by Lara Spencer and former GMA anchor Josh Elliott performed well in the ratings for ABC and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back. 'The idea to bring back Good Afternoon America is something that's strongly being considered. They believe the success of GMA could carry over right into that 11am slot that The View currently holds,' another insider said. GMA squared: Lara Spencer and former GMA anchor Josh Elliott performed strong in the ratings for ABC when they tested Good Afternoon America and the network said then that it would consider bringing it back. There's internal talk that ABC would use one of the newer GMA contributors Ryan Smith (left)or T.J. Holmes as her co-anchor on the re-launched show. Spencer, who previously hosted the news magazine series The Insider, has been itching to do that show again because she likes the pop culture-oriented format. There's internal talk that ABC would use one of the newer GMA contributors Ryan Smith or T.J. Holmes as her co-anchor on the re-launched show. 'They plan on shooting some test shows in the coming weeks to freshen up the Good Afternoon America concept. They plan to shoot a few pilot episodes following GMA going off air and retooling the show just in case they need to have it ready for a late summer launch,' the source revealed. Canceling The View would be costly for ABC, as Goldberg has one more year remaining on her contract and her pay-or-play agreement would require she be compensated her $5 million a year salary whether the show aired or not. Good old days: Joy Behar, Star Jones, Meredith Vieira and Barbara Walters from The View . O'Donnell only signed a one-year deal to return for $4 million. Perez and Wallace have three-year contracts for $400,000; however they wouldn't have to be compensated if the show ended. 'Whoopi is the winner either way. She's wanted out of this contract for years and begged to be let go during the show overhaul last summer. To get paid to just go home would make her very happy,' the source offered. The View launched in 1997 and became successful in the 11am time slot on ABC, a time period that no other morning show had been able to perform well in. The show originated with Walters, Meredith Vieira, Star Jones, Joy Behar and Debbie Matenopoulos. It went on to have Sherri Shepherd, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Lisa Ling and Jenny McCarthy join the panel series. O'Donnell signed on to moderate the show in 2006, but departed the show after a heated on-air altercation with Hasselbeck in 2007.","The long-running talk show could end after this season .
Behind-the-scenes clashes between Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg and even Rosie Perez have created a bad vibe on the set .
ABC may extend Good Morning America and bring back Good Afternoon America .
Rosie has a one year-contract that ends this season .
Whoopi is the winner no matter what -  she has one more year remaining on her 'pay or play' contract even if the show ends ."
"A disturbing report has revealed some of the disgusting conditions visitors experience in Australian hotels, with faecal matter discovered on kitchen utensils. An investigation into the Broadbeach Savannah Resort on the Gold Coast in Queensland has uncovered severely unhygienic conditions, despite the fact the hotel is accredited as a ‘four star hotel’. The ‘hotel from hell’ was inspected by A Current Affair after teams of negative reviews and concerning photographs were posted online from disturbed guests. Biotech scientists took swabs of the rooms and were revolted by what they discovered. The most concerning were faecal particles on the kitchen’s chopping board. Scroll down for video . This image of a mouldy bathroom was submitted online by a disgusted person who checked into the hotel . People have complained about dirty sheets (left with mysterious red mark) and mouldy ceilings (right) An investigation into the Broadbeach Savannah Resort on the Gold Coast in Queensland has uncovered severely unhygienic conditions, despite the fact the hotel is accredited as a ‘four star hotel’ ‘Mould on the taps, on the wall fittings, the mirror wasn’t cleaned properly, it’s just really grubby,’ former hotel guest Michael (pictured) explained . ‘The fact that we found faecal choloforms means that they’re not cleaning it properly at the end when people move out,’ biotech scientist Glen Pinna told A Current Affair. Swabs of glasses and mugs from the kitchen found bacteria levels that are twenty times the acceptable standard. ‘They should have less than six bacteria per square centimetre. We found it had in excess of 120 bacteria,’ said Dr Pinna. The presence of such a high level of bacteria could have catastrophic effects on the health of guests, meaning contracting a sickness during their holiday is highly likely. ""We're now looking at a situation where you could actually get sick by using some of these facilities,"" Mr Pinna said. ‘If someone’s had food poisoning, were getting over it and they’ve used that glass, there’s every chance (the germ) is going to be on it and it’s then going to be passed onto the next people that stay in the room.’ Discoloured and hole-ridden curtains were a shock discovery from guests expecting four star accommodation. However, despite the awful exterior, the unseen bacteria and faecal matter should be holiday makers biggest concern . Images show that the hotel is in a state of decay and disrepair, with this door cracked and peeling . Last week, a Perth family who stayed in the hotel were horrified when their two-year-old daughter suffered flea bites from playing on the carpet in the hotel, according to the Gold Coast Bulletin. Despite being charged $2500 for their week-long stay, the Fergusons found ‘the bathroom was mouldy, the carpets filthy, there were only three chairs and the louvres were broken. They were offered another room but claim it was ‘just in the same condition.’ Manager Shawwal Khalil told the Bulletin that their four-star rating was legitimate as it had been awarded by Star Rating Australia. He also claimed Star Rating Australia gave the hotel 90 per cent for cleanliness. After A Current Affair’s investigation, Mr Khalil also claimed that the reason so many people complain is because they have deliberately damaged property in the room. He says people are ‘clever cheats’ who ‘go to extreme to find fault to get discount especially when our prices are at peak high prices.’ Manager Shawwal Khalil denies all accusations and insists his hotel is deserves its four star accreditation . Dr Glen Pinna studied swabs taken from one of the hotel room and was disgusted to find faecal matter and intense concentrations of bacteria . Mr Khalil was also adamant that the hotel was not guilty of false advertising. ‘I argue that the words magnificent and luxurious or any other terms are open to broad interpretation,’ he said in a statement to Channel Nine. ‘Savannah holds high priority in all areas of cleanliness, Room services and general amenities,’ he said. ‘Issues do happen and they get fixed in any business.’ However, during a hidden camera investigation the reality of the rooms’ revolting conditions were unveiled. Stomach churning images unveil the hotel's ‘dirty secrets.’ ‘Mould on the taps, on the wall fittings, the mirror wasn’t cleaned properly, it’s just really grubby,’ former hotel guest Michael told A Current Affair, after he and his family were revolted when they arrived for a recent holiday. He was bewildered as to how the hotel could possibly be rated four stars, remarking ‘I couldn’t put a star to it.’ A for effort: At least the hotel tried to repair this bin, albeit a little haphazardly with sticky tape. However, maybe replacing the cheap plastic item would have been preferable . Stomach churning images unveil the hotels ‘dirty secrets', even though the manager insists people are lying to try and scam cheap or free accomodation . The hotel claims it rarely receives complaints and rooms are cleaned thoroughly. However, the Savannah Broadbeach Resort has been bombarded with scathing reviews online. ‘We entered the smelly walkway which wreaked of garbage to the room, uhh ohh we thought,’ wrote Bianca. ‘The room was dark, dirty, dusty, mouldy and housed a disgusting foul odour.’ Eleni was horrified when her partner cut himself in the pool and the blood was left by cleaners for an extensive period of time. ‘My partner and I went for a swim in the pool where he stepped on something sharp at the bottom and cut open his toe. ‘He got out of the pool and there was plenty of blood all over the floor. When I went to tell the man at reception he didnt seem to care much.. nor did they clean the blood for over an hour!’ wrote Eleni. The hotel has been bombarded with complaints and during the investigation many of the current guests voiced their disgust on camera . The walls are marked but it's alleged there has been no effort to fix them, allegedly making the hotel extremely unwelcoming . Janine and Shane both separately called the hotel the worst and the dirtiest motel rooms they have ever had the displeasure of staying in. ‘Dirty and old room. In the hallway, there were empty beer bottles left for the 3 days which we stayed. Was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in,’ wrote Janine. ‘The dirtiest motel room I have ever been in. There was mould on the curtains, in the bathroom and under the surface saver on the kitchen bench tops,’ Shane wrote. ‘There were sweat stains on the lounge chairs, stains on the pillows and the carpet was disgusting.’ However, the manager insists that guests have a lovely time when they stay at the Savannah. ‘Savannah value its guests and provide best and efficient services to all it's (sic) guests to make it comfortable and enjoyable in all circumstances during their stay,’ he wrote. ‘Our staff's (sic) go out of their way to make sure their demands are fulfilled.’ However, when asked if former guest Michael would recommend staying at the hotel, he responded, ‘just don’t do it. Please, please don’t do it.’ This image shows the delightful view from one of the hotel windows: a rank, dirty rooftop .","The Broadbeach Savannah Resort in Broadbeach has been inundated with complaints from disgusted guests .

"It seems that life really does begin at 40, if the latest string of celebrity romances is anything to go by. Cameron Diaz, George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston are just a few of the A-listers who have found love after the landmark birthday. Famed singleton Cameron, 42, who is known in the showbiz world as the eternal female bachelor, made waves  when she finally tied the knot with Good Charlotte rocker Benji Madden, 35, at their mansion in Beverly Hills. Scroll down for video . Cameron Diaz, 42,  once known  as the eternal female bachelor, tied the knot with tattooed rocker Benji Madden after only eight months together - and she's not the only A-lister finding love later on in life . Cameron has had her pick of men for the past two decades, dating everyone from Matt Dillon and Jared Leto to Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez. The actress had always been adamant that she has no desire to settle down and marry, but after an eight-month whirlwind romance, the Annie actress tied the knot last week. 'We couldn't be happier to begin our new journey together surrounded by our closest family and friends,' the couple said in a statement to People magazine. Only last year, Cameron told the May issue of InStyle magazine that women should never feel under pressure to get married, saying: 'A lot of people chase after it because they've been told, ""This equals happiness"". They chase it, they get it.' The actress, here with new husband Benji, has always been adamant that she had no desire to settle down . Benji Madden, holistic expert Vicky Vlachonis, and actress Cameron Diaz together at a party . A year earlier, she told a magazine: 'It [marriage] just wasn't the thing I was drawn to. I certainly didn't want it in my 20s. Or my 30s. 'I don't need to have the children in my life be a part of my literal flesh. And anyway, there's still a possibility of that, I ain't that old.' Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the romcom that many feared might never find lasting love in real life, engaged Justin Theroux in 2012, when she was 43 . And she's not the only star following this mantra. Her good friend Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the rom-com who many feared might never find lasting love in real life, became to engaged Justin Theroux in 2012 aged 43. The actress starred in a steady stream of romantic comedy films since the end of the phenomenal TV hit Friends yet seemed unable to find lasting love after the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt. But she has been dating Theroux, an actor and screenwriter, for the last few years, and recently declared: 'Yes, I'm very happy. I'm extremely lucky, and I'm extremely happy.' Following her marriage split, Miss Aniston's high-profile romances made the headlines, most notably her time with womanising rock singer John Mayer, nine years her junior. She previously had a long-term relationship with actor Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break Up, before their split in 2006. She then dated British model Paul Sculfor for a few months in 2007, before moving on to her on-off romance with Mayer, 34. Theroux, who has never been married, was first linked with Miss Aniston in May 2011. Miss Aniston at the time confessed to being annoyed by the fact that she was seen to be unlucky in love, adding: 'It's very narrow-minded, I think. It doesn't measure the level or my happiness or success in my life and my achievements or any of that.' Just before meeting Theroux, she said she did plan to become a mother, and admitted: 'I think people honestly just want to see me as a mom and married and barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. And I just want to say, “Everybody, relax! It's going to happen”.' George Clooney, 53, also once known as one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors, shocked fans when he married Amal Alamuddin last summer. Just a year before, he said he hadn't met the love of his life yet, but last summer, it seemed the search was well and truly over. Jennifer, with Justin Theroux, recently said: ' I'm very happy. I'm extremely lucky, and I'm extremely happy' George Clooney, pictured with wife Amal at the  Golden Globes on Monday night, finally remarried  aged 53 . After a whirlwind romance with the British human rights lawyer, George walked down the aisle in front of friends and family in Venice. George's love life before Amal was packed, with one of his first famous relationships being with actress Kelly Preston in 1987. George then entered into his most serious romance (up until Amal) when he reunited with his ex-girlfriend, fellow actress Talia Balsam, who he had already dated for three years. In 1989 the pair drove to Vegas in a Winnebago to tie the knot at a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator, but after three years the couple divorced reportedly over  arguments about money. Clooney admitted in a Vanity Fair interview: 'I probably – definitely – wasn't someone who should have been married at that point. I just don't feel like I gave Talia a fair shot.' He then went on to date Kimberly Russell, Vendela Kirsebom, Celine Balitran and Lisa Snowdon before finding love with Amal at the age of 53. After a whirlwind romance with Amal, George wed in front of friends and family in Venice last September . Simon Cowell has also seemingly found true love at 55, after welcoming a baby son with girlfriend Lauren Silverman last summer. And, although they've been in a relationship for well over a year - and welcomed their son Eric into the world in February - it appears the honeymoon phase is certainly not over. The couple were pictured looking loved up during their month-long stay in Barbados this week. Salma Hayek, meanwhile, is one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation - but she didn't settle down until the age of 42, when she tied the knot with French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault. The glamorous star, now 48, recently opened up about ageing and dressing to impress her husband in an interview with InStyle. Simon Cowell found love at 55, after welcoming a baby son with girlfriend Lauren Silverman last summer . Lauren SIlverman and Simon Cowell have been in a relationship for well over a year and have a baby son Eric . The mother-of-one also said: 'When I turned 40, I started thinking, ""This is the last year,"" whenever I’d wear a strapless dress,' she said. 'I always thought you can’t wear them after a certain age, but I’m still getting away with it. 'I’m not really a fashionista,' she said. 'I have an eye. I can pull it together, but a lot of the effort I make is for my husband, because I want him to be attracted to me.' Elle DeGeneres also proves that you can find true love later in life. She met Ally McBeal actress Portia de Rossi in 2004 at the age of 44. The  wed in 2008 after the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California. The talk show host denied divorce rumours to a March 2014 issue of People magazine, revealing: 'I love her so much it kills me. The truth is, and this is corny, I fall more in love with Portia all the time. I really do. 'She surprises me all the time. It's what anyone experiences when you find that person that gets you, wants to take care of you, wants the best for you. We're really lucky because we know how rare it is.' Salma Hayek didn't find love until the age of 42, when she married French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault . Salma, pictured at her 2009 wedding, makes an effort as  she still wants her husband to be attracted to her . Speaking about finding love later in life, celebrity life coach, Sloan Sheridan-Williams (sloansw.com), said: 'Finding love after 40 need not be daunting. The truth is the common factor in your relationships is you and therefore your life experience now puts you in a much better place to choose your perfect match resulting in long lasting love. 'By the time you reach 40, unlike young love you have understood the concept that your happiness is not the responsibility of another person. 'This results in better choices. By taking personal responsibility in life you can put in place the steps that will move you forward to attracting, not only the right partner, but one that complements you. 'Celebrities over 40 already have their career path planned, so their focus can now turn to relationships. 'There is a whole society of individuals that do not gain significance from relationships but from their career instead and as such attracting lasting love has not been their first priority. 'Your brain provides you that which you focus on with intense emotion and as such if that focus is not pointed towards your love life then it takes a back seat. 'The good news is that science is actually on your side. As we get older it is suggested that gender differences often displayed earlier in life mellow. This is because brain biochemistry is rebalancing the sex hormones that affect our behaviour. 'There is also research to suggest that passion increases with age, so a change of perception and a shift of focus towards bringing out your passionate side will allow you to nurture love once it comes along to an even stronger level than perhaps you would have had embarking on the same relationship earlier on in life. 'The key to finding love is to take action towards meeting people, to learn lessons from past experiences and to use your knowledge to give the best to your partner and to yourself.'

"This is the society fixer alleged to have helped find underage girls for pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein - helping Bill Clinton celebrate his daughter's marriage. Ghislaine Maxwell was photographed at the former First Daughter's glittering July 2010 wedding to Marc Mezvinsky - despite Epstein having been convicted of soliciting underage girls. Clinton had cut ties to Epstein after his arrest over allegations of sex with girls as young as 14. But this photograph shows that he maintained close ties to Maxwell, who is accused in court papers of procuring underage girls for Epstein, her former boyfriend, as she smiles as President Clinton walks a beaming Chelsea down the aisle. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Friends in high places: Ghislaine Maxwell is a good friend of President Bill Clinton and can be seen on the right at his daughter Chelsea's wedding in July 2010 . Maxwell, now 50, attended the wedding in Rhinebeck, NY, on July 31, 2010, with the cream of Washington D.C. Described as feeling like a 'family wedding', guests included former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Terry McAuliffe, Governor of Virginia, and leading figure in the civil rights movement Vernon Jordan. For Maxwell to remain a Clinton chum is an interesting turn of events. Just two years earlier, her former lover and friend Jeffrey Epstein was sentenced to 18 months behind bars after pleading to a single state charge of soliciting prostitution. He served 13 months in prison. President Clinton had been so close to both to Epstein he had joined him on his private jet and stayed on his private Caribbean island. Speaking to the Mail On Sunday in 2011, Virginia Roberts - who claims in court papers she was kept as Epstein's 'sex slave' and forced to sleep with Prince Andrew three times  - said she met President Clinton twice, but was never 'lent out'. Buckingham Palace vehemently denies the claims, as does Maxwell. Her legal team stresses she was not involved in, or connected to the criminal proceedings against Epstein and with regards to Virginia Roberts' claims, they stressed she denies each and every allegation. Virginia, now a married mother of three, claimed that President Clinton traveled with Epstein to a number of destinations, including three times on the billionaire’s private jet, and enjoyed intimate dinners with both him and Maxwell. On one occasion, she said that Epstein flew the former President, Hollywood actor and staunch Democrat Kevin Spacey and another actor friend of Mr Clinton’s, Chris Tucker, to Africa, to ‘discuss AIDS policy’. Epstein, who has donated more than £75,000 over the years to candidates from the Democratic Party, also flew with President Clinton in November 2003 to destinations including Russia, Oslo, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing. On one occasion, she alleged, Epstein did invite two young brunettes to a dinner which he gave on his island for President Clinton shortly after he left office. But, as far as she knows, the ex-President did not take the bait. Mysterious: Ghislaine Maxwell beams as her ex-lover, disgraced billionaire Jeffrey Epstein hugs her as they attend a Manhattan bash on March 15, 2005 - the same day Palm Beach police launched an investigation into his abuse of underage girls . ‘I’d have been about 17 at the time,’ she said: ‘I flew to the Caribbean with Jeffrey and then Ghislaine Maxwell went to pick up Bill in a huge black helicopter that Jeffrey had bought her. ‘She’d always wanted to fly and Jeffrey paid for her to take lessons, and I remember she was very excited because she got her licence around the first year we met. 'I used to get frightened flying with her but Bill had the Secret Service with him and I remember him talking about what a good job she did. ‘I only ever met Bill twice but Jeffrey had told me that they were good friends. 'I asked, “How come?” and he laughed and said, “He owes me some favours.” Maybe he was just joking but it constantly surprised me that people with as much to lose as Bill and [Prince] Andrew weren’t more careful.' She said that when dining that night, Maxwell sat at President Clinton's left, while they were joined by two 'olive-skinned brunettes' who had been flown in from New York. Virginia claimed: 'I’d never met them before. I’d say they were no older than 17, very innocent-looking. ‘They weren’t there for me. They weren’t there for Jeffrey or Ghislaine because I was there to have sex with Jeffrey on the trip. ‘Maybe Jeffrey thought they would entertain Bill, but I saw no evidence that he was interested in them. He and Jeffrey and Ghislaine seemed to have a very good relationship. Bill was very funny . 'He made me laugh a few times. And he and Jeffrey and Ghislaine told blokey jokes and the brunettes listened politely and giggled. Star of the night: Rod Stewart and his wife Penny at the Cipriani Wall Street event, where he performed in front of a crowd including Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein . New York elite: Padma Lakshmi (left) and Sean Lennon (right) both attended the Cipriani Wall Street event . Indeed, the trio were so close that DailyMail.com told last week how Epstein kept 21 numbers for President Clinton in his contacts book, under the name of his adviser Doug Band. As Virginia Roberts' astonishing claims have made headlines around the world, it was reported last week that President Clinton's continuing friendship with Maxwell has caused a rift between him and his wife, potential Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. However, the pair were pictured looking cosy together as they left the funeral of former New York Governor Mario Cuomo. Epstein and Maxwell met shortly after she moved to New York in the 1990s following the death of her father, shamed newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell. And they remained just as close even after an initial romance faded. For Epstein, Maxwell was a useful conduit to some of the most powerful people in the world, from PresidentClinton to Prince Andrew. Close: Not only was Ghislaine Maxwell friends with Prince Andrew, but his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson as well. The pair are pictured together at the opening of the Asprey Flagship Store on 5th Avenue on December 8, 2003, in New York City . Allegations: Ghislaine Maxwell is accused of 'facilitating Prince Andrew's acts of sexual abuse by acting as a madame for Epstein'. Above, Miss Maxwell looks on as Prince Andrew smiles with Virginia Roberts in 2001 . While Maxwell became used to the luxuries that Epstein could afford her, trips by private jet and his very own Caribbean island. Rarely photographed or seen out in public unlike his friend Maxwell, Esptein was however pictured with the brunette as they partied the night away on March 15, 2005, at a Manhattan charity event featuring singer Rod Stewart. But as they socialized with the cream of Manhattan society, including CBS President Les Moonves, his wife Julie Chen, Sean Lennon and Padma Lakshmi, at the Wall Street Rising event, Epstein, now 63, and Maxwell, would have been entirely unaware of a police probe that was launched that very day. In May 2006, a 'probable cause affidavit' revealed that Epstein was the subject of an 11-month undercover investigation by police after a complaint in 2005 from the stepmother of a 14-year-old girl, who claimed she was paid $300 to give him an erotic massage at his flamingo-pink villa in Palm Beach. Close: Ghislaine Maxwell with Jeffrey Epstein (left) at The Queen's residence of Sandringham in 2000. The picture shows just how close she and Epstein were with Prince Andrew . The girl is said to have been taken there by 18-year-old student Haley Robson, who claims in a sworn statement that she was recruited at the age of 17 to provide the billionaire with a $200 nude massage. One of the girls ‘cried hysterically’, according to a police report, as she recalled how she was recruited to provide services for Epstein when she was 16. She claims in a sworn statement that he introduced her to a woman whom he said he had brought from Yugoslavia ‘to be his sex slave’. Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting sex from a minor - a minor in the US is someone younger than 18 - and served 13 months in prison. Now, lawyers for four of Epstein's alleged victims are fighting to get a federal non-prosecution agreement against Epstein thrown out so he can potentially face criminal charges for allegedly sexually abusing the women, one of whom says she was only 13 at the time of the assault. Bizarrely, Maxwell was initially served with a subpoena in September 2009, as she was leaving the Clinton Global Initiatives Conference in New York.

"The ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded one of the biggest divorce settlements in American history says she is still planning an appeal even though she cashed the $970million check. Sue Ann Arnall, the ex-wife of Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm, cashed the check that Hamm provided her last week. In November, an Oklahoma court ordered the Continental Resources (CLR.N) chief executive to pay his ex-wife about $1 billion in cash and assets when the couple divorced after a 26-year marriage. Scroll down for videos . Appealing: Sue Ann Arnall, the ex-wife of an Oklahoma oil magnate who was awarded one of the biggest divorce settlements in American history says she is still planning an appeal even though she cashed the $970million check . Pay up: Harold Hamm and his ex-wife did not have a pre-nup - the check represented the entire balance owed by Hamm according to the court's decision . Thanks: Hamm penned this check to his ex-wife for $974.8 million, which she cashed last week . The check represented the entire balance owed by Hamm according to the court's decision. But Arnall has appealed the case in the Oklahoma Supreme Court, claiming that the earlier ruling allowed Hamm to keep the vast majority of a marital estate worth up to $18 billion. Legal experts say it may be more difficult for Arnall to pursue an appeal after accepting the benefits of the trial court's award. Real estate portfolio: Arnall also picked up three properties in the divorce, including this home in Enid, Oklahoma . The Enid home has been valued at $800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in Oklahoma . Arnell's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce . Arnell also got the couple's second Oklahoma home located in Nichols Hill and worth $4.6million . 'I will not dismiss my appeal and do not feel that my right to appeal should be denied because I have accepted, in the interim, a small portion of the estate that we built over more than two decades,' Arnall said in a statement through her lawyers. Last week, one of Hamm's lawyers, Craig Box, told Reuters that Arnall's deposit of the oil man's check in an Oklahoma City bank was likely to end her case. If she continues an appeal, Box said, Hamm will try to have it dismissed on grounds she has already accepted the benefits of the earlier ruling. The couple never signed a prenuptial agreement. The Hamm divorce has been ongoing since 2012 and last month, Hamm pledged to appeal the decision, after a sharp fall in oil prices cut billions from his personal fortune. The earlier court ruling allowed Hamm to retain his 68 percent stake in Continental, which he founded in 1967. Hamm had already paid his former wife more than $20 million during the divorce proceedings. Arnall has taken ownership of the Oak Ridge Ranch in Carmel, California, a property purchased by the couple in 2011 for $14.7million, along with the couple's two of their Oklahoma properties, as per the court's ruling. Mr. Hamm will take their $750,000 home in Branson, Missouri and a $300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in Major County, Oklahoma. Big growth: During the course of their marriage, Hamm's company's worth jumped from $50million to $20billion . Arnall made it clear she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued. The only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the United States was Jocelyn Wildenstein, who reportedly received $2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband Alec in 1999. Arnell stated that she felt that the decision by Judge Howard Haralson to allow lawyers for both her husband and for Continental Resources to be involved in the proceedings was 'inappropriate' in that it allowed them to 'double team' her. The crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and Mr. Hamm made beginning in 1988, the year he and Arnall were married. During the trial it was argued that Continental’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors, such as rising oil prices, and, under Oklahoma law, only the 'active' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division. Arnall’s lawyers contend however that Judge Haralson miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $14billion rise in the value of Hamm's Continental shares during the marriage - 6 percent. 'As Sue Ann has stated previously, 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage, and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal,' her legal team said in a statement. Big score: In 2012,  Hamm was one of the select few named to the Time 100, an event he attended with his wife . Arnall, who worked as a lawyer for Continental when she and Hamm married, and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company, also claims that Judge Haralson undervalued her own contributions to the couple’s wealth. Most estimates have stated that Continental Resources was worth around $50million in 1988 when the couple married, which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $20billion behemoth it is today. A behemoth that Hamm has a 68 percent stake in, a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be 'separate property.' All this, combined with lingering timeline questions presented by Arnall that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple's 1988 wedding, will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years. And there's somehow more. Friends in high places: 2012 was also the year Hamm became an adviser for the Romney campaign . That aforementioned $9billion fortune of  Hamm's was in fact a $20billion fortune as recently as August, with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil. Filing for divorce in March 2013,  Arnall alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair, citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage. Hamm had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world, a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the American dream. Born one of 13 children to a sharecropper, Hamm worked his way up, picking cotton as a child, pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well. And while  Hamm, who was previously married and has three children from that union, is no fan of the spotlight, he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years. In 2012,  Hamm became a big part of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser, a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $985,000 to the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Mr. Hamm also hosted a fundraiser at his $4.6 million Nichols Hills, Oklahoma mansion for the Republican candidate, which raised more than $2million. It is worth noting that the Nichols Hill mansion is no longer  Hamm's but, along with a $800,000 home in Enid, Oklahoma, the property of Arnall. It was also in early 2012 that Hamm earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was added to the Time 100 for that year. He and his wife attended the ceremony together that April in New York that also honored, among others, Marco Rubio, Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, President Barack Obama and Rihanna. The two posed on the red carpet together, smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another, looking happy and excited. Arnall would file for divorce less than a year later.","Sue Ann Arnall is the ex-wife of Oklahoma oil magnate Harold Hamm .

"Father-of-three Barry Kadleck, who also served as a magistrate, was discovered at his home the day before he was due to appear at Teesside Crown Court . An ex-government computer specialist who admitted making 4,000 images of child abuse has been found dead hours before he was due in court. Father-of-three Barry Kadleck, who also served as a magistrate, was discovered at his home the day before he was due to appear at Teesside Crown Court. The 61-year-old, who also worked on the London 2012 technology team, was warned to expect prison  when he pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing last month. The court would have heard that he was fixated on young girls aged around eight and stockpiled the photographs of children being sexually assaulted. Court papers say that Kadleck, from Hexham, Northumberland, worked for the Government on secret IT contracts in Dubai and served as a magistrate in Newcastle. The separated father was arrested at work last year, and told police:'I have been expecting it for some time, and it's no more than I deserve.' The court heard how investigations discovered thousands of images and videos on his mobile phone, laptop computer and on other storage devices around his house. Kadleck admitted that he had been looking at the images for the last seven years and told probation officials he was 'fascinated and horrified' by them. He was supposed to be appearing for sentence on Friday, January 9, but the court heard he was found dead at his home in what was suspected to be a suicide. A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'Police received a report at approximately 12.30pm on Thursday expressing concern for a man at an address in Hexham. 'Officers attended and paramedics were already working on the 61-year-old man, however he was later confirmed to be dead. 'It is believed that there was no third party involvement and a report is being prepared for the coroner.' Barry Kadleck,61, had been warned that he faced prison at Teesside Crown Court, pictured above, after admitting the offences at an earlier hearing last month . Kadleck was a senior systems specialist with computer giant IBM for more 20 years and also worked in the technology team involved in the football events at the 2012 Olympics. He worked as a volunteer driver for a charity based in Hexham,Northumberland, and most recently worked as a senior manager with STME Ltd who describe themselves as the Middle East's leading IT solutions provider and systems integrator. He was head-hunted by the Government to work on the confidential contract in the Gulf, and returned to the UK five years ago. Kadleck, whose wife lived on North Tyneside, resigned from his delivery driver job for a supermarket and as a magistrate following his arrest in March last year. The case, being heard on Teesside because of his links to courts on Tyneside, will be listed again this Friday when it is expected to be discontinued.","Barry Kadleck admitted making and possessing images of child abuse .

"Criminal activity has often been associated with $100 bills - and the type of people that carry them. But a study has revealed that the consumer most likely to carry them is a person who is aged over 55 and has been educated past that of high school. The research, carried out by Claire Greene and Scott Schuh of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, states that on a typical day in the United States one in twenty people carry $100 bills. Criminal activity has often been associated with $100 bills - and the type of people that carry them. But a study has revealed that the consumer most likely to carry them is a person who is aged over 55 and has been educated past that of high school . It is often assumed that they are used by criminals or tax evaders as cash is difficult to track and $100 bills is the easiest way to transport large amounts of cash, . For this reason Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University, wants the bills to be taken out of circulation, and told NPR in August: 'Think about countries like Mexico, Colombia, where they're really at war with the drug money, where the United States is not only buying the drugs but it's providing this resource that very much helps the drug dealers.' But the study suggests that 5.2 percent of consumers admit to carrying one or more $100 bills and the researchers found no evidence these people were anything but law abiding, reports Business Week who analyzed the findings. There  does not appear to be evidence that consumers try to get rid of $100 bills either - the study states: 'On any given day, between 75 percent and 80 percent of respondents to the 2012 DCPC who carried a $100 bill held on to it. 'There does not appear to be evidence that consumers try to get rid of $100 bills.' The study also does not support the idea that people who are rich only use credit cards or debit cards to pay for goods - it found that those who carry around lots of cash actually earn more money. A graph to show which bills consumers are most likely to carry - $20 came out top . The paper states that consumers who make more than $75,000 are about 50 percent more likely to be carrying around $100 than those who make less than $35,000. But the study does point out that the reason for carrying a $100 bill could be for ease - 'consumers who carry a lot of cash find them easier to carry than a fat wad of 20s, 10s, or lower denominations.' Cash is still used for 40 percent of all purchases - in general the amount of cash in circulation keeps rising with $1.2 trillion in cash outside banks, up 20 percent since 2011. Although the use of credit and debit cards is rising, these is in replacement of checks going out of use.","Criminal activity has often been associated with $100 bills - and the type of people that carry them .

"Dinosaurs flourished in Europe right up until the asteroid impact that wiped them out 66 million years ago, a new study shows. While the theory that an asteroid rapidly killed off the dinosaurs is widely recognised, up until recently fossils of the last dinosaurs were found almost exclusively from North America. The new study brings together a series of studies on European dinosaurs over the past two decades, which found Cretaceous dinosaurs in Spain, France, Romania, and other countries. Pictured is the evolution of the European continental ecosystems around the time dinosaurs went extinct. The diverse vertebrates of the latest Cretaceous are shown, with dinosaurs in France, crocodiles in Hungary and other mammals almost wiped out (bottom image), with a few groups surviving into the Paleogene (top image) It claims to address speculation about whether the sudden decline of dinosaurs in the American and Canadian west was merely a local story. By looking at the variety and ages of these fossils, a team of researchers led by Zoltán Csiki-Sava of the University of Bucharest, determined that dinosaurs remained diverse in European ecosystems very late into the Cretaceous. The  Cretaceous is known for being the last portion of the 'Age of Dinosaurs' and lasted 79 million years, ending 65.5 million years ago. In the Pyrenees of Spain and France, the best area in Europe for finding latest Cretaceous dinosaurs, meat and plant-eating species are present and seemingly flourishing during the final few hundred thousand years before the asteroid hit. The new study suggests that European dinosaurs were thriving up to the asteroid impact. In this artist's depiction, a Daspletosaurus (predator on the left) attacks a herd of Centrosaurus during the Cretaceous . Dr Csiki-Sava said 'For a long time, Europe was overshadowed by other continents when the understanding of the nature, composition and evolution of latest Cretaceous continental ecosystems was concerned. 'The last 25 years witnessed a huge effort across all Europe to improve our knowledge, and now we are on the brink of fathoming the significance of these new discoveries, and of the strange and new story they tell about life at the end of the Dinosaur Era.' Dr Steve Brusatte of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences , an author on the report, added: 'Everyone knows that an asteroid hit 66 million years ago and dinosaurs disappeared, but this story is mostly based on fossils from one part of the world, North America. 'We now know that European dinosaurs were thriving up to the asteroid impact, just like in North America. This is strong evidence that the asteroid really did kill off dinosaurs in their prime, all over the world at once.' For years scientists have debated whether an asteroid, climate change or a combination of catastrophes were responsible for the demise of dinosaurs. But last year, a study claimed that the majority of the prehistoric creatures were wiped out by a perfect storm of ‘colossal bad luck’. Dinosaurs might have survived the asteroid strike that led to their extinction if it had come slightly earlier or later in history, scientists said. But when the six-mile-wide (10km) asteroid hit what is now Mexico approximately 66 million years ago, dinosaurs were experiencing environmental upheaval, which left them vulnerable. The study by an international team of palaeontologists led by the University of Edinburgh looked at an updated catalogue of dinosaur fossils, mostly from North America. They found that widespread volcanic activity, changing sea levels and varying temperatures had weakened the dinosaurs’ food chain when disaster struck. If the asteroid impact had come a few million years earlier, when the range of species was bigger and food chains more robust, they may have survived, according to the study.","Until recently fossils of last dinosaurs were largely found in North America .

"A never-seen-before diary purportedly belonging to the woman who claims she had underage sex with Prince Andrew reveals explicit claims of the alleged night they slept together in London. Virginia Roberts, now 30, claims that she had sex with the prince when she was 17 and a 'sex slave' to his billionaire friend Jeffrey Epstein, the convicted pedophile. In the 24-page diary, obtained by Radar Online, Roberts details the night they allegedly met as well as graphic details of their sexual encounter. Virginia Roberts, pictured with Prince Andrew, claims she was supplied to the royal when she was underage by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein . Roberts, who had told her parents she was being trained as a masseuse, says she was taken shopping by Maxwell for expensive clothes, before meeting the Duke of York at the private townhouse . Roberts writes the group went to private, members-only nightclub Tramp in central London where she claims Prince Andrew grabbed them both an 'alcoholic cocktail'. She adds: 'He was the most incredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen' She claims Epstein invited her to accompany him on a six-week trip in 2001 - they flew to Paris, then Spain, then Tangier and finally, they went to London. She alleges the first time she met the prince was at the home of Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, in the city. Roberts, who had told her parents she was being trained as a masseuse, says she was taken shopping by Maxwell for expensive clothes, before meeting the Duke of York at the private townhouse. She writes how they stayed at the club for just over an hour, but she could he wanted to move on by the way he was 'fondling me on the dance floor, I knew that was a man's polite way of saying he wanted to intimately get acquainted' Roberts, now a mother-of-three, says the pair returned to Maxwell's house.'I led him into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in,' she writes in the diary obtained exclusively by Radar . Roberts, who lives in a small town in Colorado, claims the fifth in line to the throne 'spoke kindly of his daughters … [and] the conversation turned to me next, starting with Ghislaine playing the 'guess my age' game, which was one of her favorite's among her morally impaired friends.' 'He guessed 17 and Ghislaine chuckled, 'She'll be too old soon,' and told him I was really only 16.' One picture, said to have been taken by Epstein during this alleged encounter in March 2001 shows the Prince with his arm around her waist as Maxwell looks on. She claims Prince Andrew, father to Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, paid particular attention to her toes and claims he was licking them . In her large and curly scrawl, she writes they had sex, which was' short-lived' and then he 'quickly got dressed, said his goodbyes and slipped out of my bedroom to the driver still waiting for him outside' Roberts claims the group headed to dinner during which time 'the Prince's attention towards me amplified… making eye contact at every given chance and concentrating at my plunging V-neck top,.' Roberts, now a married mother-of-three, writes the group then went to private, members-only nightclub Tramp in central London where she claims Prince Andrew grabbed them both an 'alcoholic cocktail.' 'He was the most incredibly hideous dancer I had ever seen and not to mention how embarrassing it was to have to be the one he was smashing pelvics with, even if he was a prince.'

Roberts, now a mother of three, says the pair returned to Maxwell's house. 'I led him into the upstairs bathroom next to the room I was staying in,' she writes in the diary obtained exclusively by Radar. 'I was doing my best trying to put on a good show for him by slowly undressing and started to pour a bath. 'The room quickly filled with steam from the hot water as I turned to Andrew and began to kiss his neck and undress him. 'He was caressing every part of my naked body and filling my head with endless compliments about my blossoming figure.'

Pictured: Prince Andrew left and right, Epstein . She claims Prince Andrew, father to Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24,  paid particular attention to her toes and claims he was licking them. 'That was definitely a 1st for me, but I went with it all, fearful of letting down the Prince and in turn Jeffrey and Ghislaine.' In her large and curly scrawl, she writes they had sex, which was' short-lived' and then he 'quickly got dressed, said his goodbyes and slipped out of my bedroom to the driver still waiting for him outside.' In her entries she also claims that Epstein told her to recruit other girls, writing: 'I never brought back a girl that ever said no, or didn't want to participate in an erotic massage.' On Tuesday his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson defended him against 'shockingly accusatory allegations' that he had sex with Roberts. The Duchess of York described Prince Andrew as a 'humongously good man' when she was asked about the scandal on US morning television show Today. In her entries she also claims that Epstein told her to recruit other girls, writing: 'I never brought back a girl that ever said no, or didn't want to participate in an erotic massage' She told the presenter the family stood by the denial issued by Buckingham Palace. Sarah said: 'I won't stand by, because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you, and not support him so publicly because they are just shockingly accusatory allegations, which I don't think that's right. 'It's defamation of character and, as a great father and humongously good man and all the work he does for Britain, I won't stand by and let him have his character defamed to this level.' She added: 'I'll have not one word said about him on any level.' When asked if Andrew knew the woman involved Sarah said she would not discuss the subject. She said: 'Buckingham Palace has put out the denial and I, as his best friend and my best ex husband ever and the most wonderful father to the girls, will not be drawn on any subject.' Adamant: Sarah Ferguson passionately defended her ex-husband, Prince Andrew, as she appeared on the Today show on Tuesday morning. She called accusations against him 'salacious lies' All smiles: The Duchess of York smiled as she left the Today studios in New York on Tuesday morning . In a strongly-worded statement Buckingham Palace has said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Andrew was named in US civil court documents as having sex with Roberts on three separate occasions when she was a minor. She is said to have been 'procured' for him by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire American financier, who she accuses of using her as a 'sex slave'. The Duke vehemently denies the allegations against him. Maxwell and Epstein have also dismissed the allegations. Roberts, a US citizen, waived her anonymity in an interview with The Mail On Sunday in 2011, in which she claimed she had been sexually exploited by Epstein - a former friend of the Duke. In the US court papers, she alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein where an orgy took place. Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims. Family: Ferguson and Prince Andrew, pictured with their daughters Eugenie, left, and Beatrice, right, in 2001 married in 1986 and divorced 10 years later, but have remained good friends . Attorney and former Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz said the accusations were 'totally false and made up'. The accusation is contained in a motion filed last month in a Florida court by Roberts who wants to join an existing lawsuit, launched by two other alleged Epstein victims, against federal prosecutors' handling of the financier's case. Epstein was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution but lawyers for the women claim a secret plea deal he struck with prosecutors granting him, and any potential co-conspirators, immunity from further prosecution violated their clients' rights. Two years after his 2009 release, Epstein was pictured in New York City with the prince, and their friendship was a source of controversy. Prince Andrew ultimately stepped down from his role as a U.K. trade ambassador in July 2011. Court documents also allege that Prince Andrew was among those who made 'efforts' to secure Epstein a favorable plea deal, but Buckingham Palace has denied this. In a strongly-worded statement, a palace spokesman said: 'It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. 'The allegations made are false and without any foundation.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Virginia Roberts claims that she slept with the prince when she was 17 .

"An eastern Alabama school principal is asking students to bring cans of food such as corn and peas as a way of fighting off a school intruder. W.F. Burns Middle School Principal Priscella Holley revealed the Valley school's enhanced intruder plan in a Friday letter to parents. Holley wrote 'The procedure will be the same as we have done in the past with the addition of arming out students with a canned food item. We realize at first this may seem odd; however, it is a practice that would catch an intruder off-guard.' Scroll down for video . New tactic: W.F. Burns Middle School Principal Priscella Holley is asking students to bring cans of food such as corn and peas as a way of fighting off a school intruder . Training: Both Auburn University and the middle school have adopted the ALICE program. A training video from the university shows students pelting an intruder with books after he 'shoots' a student  in a demonstraton . 'The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive,' she continued. 'The canned food item will give the students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters their classroom.' The cans are set to be given to a food bank when the school year is over, Holler wrote. The letter was sent after school employees received training from Auburn University's public safety department, Chambers County Schools Superintendent Kelli Hodge told The Associated Press. Hodge said throwing cans or other items would be a last resort for students unable to evacuate. She said the cans would be stored in classrooms and students wouldn't be carrying them around school. Both Auburn University and the middle school are using the ALICE program, WRBL reported. The acronym represents the ideas Alert; Lockdown; Inform; Counter and Evacuate. Speaking to Daily Mail Online in an email exchange, Hodge said  'We actually have received 0 calls from parents complaining. Certainly there was chatter on social media where the letter was taken out of context by individuals who did not understand or research ALICE. 'We had a parent meeting last night to explain ALICE and there were only about 15-20 parents present. Of those we have received several emails today for being proactive in the area of student safety. Ready: The ALICE program is now being used by W.F. Burns Middle School, pictured. The acronym stands for Alert; Lockdown; Inform; Counter and Evacuate . The ALICE program's website says 'The purpose of ALERT is to notify as many people as possible within the danger zone that a potentially life threatening risk exists. 'The purpose of LOCKDOWN is to secure in place, and prepare to EVACUATE or COUNTER, if needed. 'The purpose of INFORM is to continue to communicate the intruder’s location in real time. 'The purpose of COUNTER is to interrupt the intruder and make it difficult or impossible to aim. This is a strategy of last resort. 'The purpose of EVACUATE is to remove yourself from the danger zone when it is safe to do so. Both can-throwing and text-book throwing are considered 'Counter' elements, WBRL reported. According to WHNT, the ALICE program meets the Department of Education's 2013 school safety guidelines published.","W.F.

"A domestic abuser murdered his girlfriend with a kitchen knife then told police he 'enjoyed' being Tasered and they needed 'more volts', a court heard. Andre Bright, 30, is accused of stabbing Victoria Adams to death while their baby daughter slept in her home in Oldham, Greater Manchester - just two days after she voiced fears he would kill. The 22-year-old told friends Bright had thrown a bottle at her, spat in her face and talked about having sex with her friends, a jury heard, prompting her to flee tearfully in her dressing gown. Relationship: Andre Bright, 30 (left) is accused of stabbing Victoria Adams (right) to death while their baby daughter slept in her home in Oldham, Greater Manchester - just two days after she voiced fears he would kill . Bright denied murder as a trial began today at Manchester Crown Court, where the public gallery was packed with relatives of Miss Adams and her alleged killer. The pair met in 2007 when Bright was 23 and Miss Adams was just 16, and entered into an on-off relationship before she had his daughter in August 2013. But the jury heard Bright had a number of girlfriends and other children, would only meet Miss Adams late at night and they never did things as a couple. When his girlfriend took a pregnancy test in January 2013, she sent a text to Bright telling him she was pregnant - to which he allegedly told her to delete his number and never speak to him again. Their relationship reconvened, but events came to a head on December 5, 2013, when the college graduate went on her first night out with friends since giving birth. Bright called at her home in the early hours of the next day, and his alleged behaviour was said to have led his tearful girlfriend to flee in her dressing gown and bare feet to a friend's house. Bright was said to have begun calling other girls in front of her and putting them on loudspeaker. Fears: Miss Adams had been in an on-off relationship with Bright since she was 16 and he was 23 . Mark Kellett, prosecuting, said: 'She told them that she had run from her house fearing that Andre Bright would kill her.' Then on the night of December 7, Bright was out drinking in Oldham with friends when he was refused entry to a bar. Said to be a known troublemaker, Bright - who was barred from a number of nightspots - confronted a bouncer and then attempted to urinate on him, said Mr Kellett. Party: The court heard Miss Adams was on her first night out since giving birth to Bright's daughter . CCTV footage showed Bright pulling an Afro comb from his hair and repeatedly stabbing the bouncer's face and head, causing cuts and grazes, jurors heard. Bright also denies a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in relation to this incident. Miss Adams left her home for a second time when he arrived in the early hours, and did not return until she knew he had gone. But he later arrived at about 9.35am drunk and high on cannabis and cocaine, prosecutors said. Nearly 30 minutes later he rang the emergency services and told the operator: 'Someone is dying in front of me... someone has stabbed her, I don't know what's happened. She's dying.' But he allegedly became angry as the call handler asked for more information, and when asked for the third time how the stabbing had happened he replied 'shut up' and put the phone down. Miss Adams died two hours after the attack at Manchester Royal Infirmary . Post-mortem results showed she had been stabbed once to the chest, causing a wound 8cm deep, and once to the abdomen. That wound was 12cm deep and had penetrated her kidney. When police arrived Bright was allegedly standing with a 'fixed, almost vacant gaze', with his hands in his tracksuit pockets while Miss Adams lay dying on the floor near the front door. Fearing he may still have a knife, police Tasered him and warned they would do so again - to which he replied: 'I enjoyed that. You need more volts in your Taser', the jury heard. One female officer said Bright looked directly at her and smiled as he was put in a police van. Mr Kellett said: 'The Crown say this defendant knowing what he was doing was seeking to ridicule and intimidate the officers. 'A paramedic with the North West Ambulance Service saw Victoria Adams lying in the hallway of the property on her back with her legs facing into the sitting room. 'She was bleeding heavily to the chest and officers were administering first aid. 'He tried to question her, but she kept asking where the baby was. The baby was upstairs, safe, where the officers could take control.' Aftermath: Dozens of floral tributes were laid at the scene of the killing in Oldham, Greater Manchester . Bright, from Oldham, denies murder, saying it was a combination of an accident and psychotic incident . The court heard Bright accepts that he killed Miss Adams, but will argue that it was a combination of an accident and a psychotic incident. But Mr Kellet told the jury: 'The Crown say that you will be sure that stabbing Victoria twice was not an accident, it was a deliberate intentional act. 'Moreover, in terms of his intention to cause really serious harm at least, what other intention could the defendant have at the point of stabbing her? 'The Crown say that he was fully aware of his actions and their consequences.' Bright, from Oldham, denies murder and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The trial, which is expected to last around two weeks, continues.

"When the tendrils of a neighbour’s clematis started creeping into his garden, Stanley George decided to give it a trim. After climbing a step ladder, he said he carefully snipped off a 4in section of the hedge – knowing it was his neighbour’s pride and joy. So he was ‘gobsmacked’ when the 45ft-long plant slowly folded over and collapsed into a large heap on the ground. Before: The wall in Rhona Parker's back garden decorated with the clematis bush prior to the trimming . After: Here it is pictured after Stanley George and Claire Condy trimmed it from the neighbouring property . Stanley George (left) and Claire Condy (right) pictured outside court, where they were found guilty of criminal damage . Now, the secateur-wielding pensioner has ended up with a criminal record at the age of 86 after magistrates decided he and a fellow octogenarian ‘accomplice’ had cut down the clematis on purpose. The row has shattered the tranquillity of the smart bungalows in the seaside town of Prestatyn, North Wales. A court heard George’s green-fingered neighbour, Rhona Parker, 76, had an immaculate garden with honeysuckle and climbing roses. But the crowning feature was the clematis. Planted to celebrate the birth of her youngest grandchild, it had grown for 18 years on a wall adjoining George’s property. But after taking exception to the ever-expanding plant, he and another neighbour, Claire Condy, 81, took matters into their own hands. First, they removed several plastic ties attached to it. Then George used his secateurs to snip off the 4in section. ‘To my astonishment, the clematis wobbled a bit then folded up and descended very slowly,’ said Condy, a retired teacher. ‘It curled downwards until it all collapsed.’ The clematis bush (pictured) had been planted to celebrate the birth of her youngest grandchild . But as soon as it was trimmed, the bush immediately folded over and collapsed (pictured) When the police were called, Rhona Parker (pictured left and right) was found 'crying, shaking and very upset' Rhona Parker (pictured) had a new fence built to try after her old separating wall was left looking ruinous . The owner of the clematis, Mrs Parker, told Llandudno magistrates she came home on June 18 to find Condy standing on an aluminium ladder while leaning over the fence and cutting her plants. ‘I asked her to stop and she told me to get back in and shut my cakehole. The whole length was being cut away, she was just telling Mr George what to do when he was on another ladder.’ As she watched in horror, the clematis slowly collapsed. Police were called and found Mrs Parker ‘crying, shaking and very upset’. Philip Wilson, a gardener who examined the damage, said: ‘All the plants had been cut in many places, mainly evergreen clematis but others such as roses which had grown into the clematis.’ However, George blamed Mrs Parker’s gardening skills, saying: ‘The whole cause of this was that proper clematis frames had not been put in.’ Alex Fitzgerald, defending, told the court George and Condy thought the plant would be supported, even though the ties had been cut. The clematis bush had to be pulled off the fence and binned (pictured) after it was ruined by the trimming . ‘Accidents do happen,’ he said. ‘But is it a criminal offence? Stupidity or lack of imagination should not lead to conviction. At this stage of their lives their primary concern will be the loss of their good character.’ But chairman of the bench Peter Hughes said: ‘We find the prosecution evidence was compelling and the damage was deliberate.’ George and Condy were found guilty of criminal damage, given a conditional discharge and ordered to pay a total of £808 compensation to their neighbour as well as court costs. After the day-long trial, Mrs Parker smiled and said: ‘I’m just relieved it’s all over.’","Pensioner Stanley George, 86, decided to trim the plant using secateurs .

"A young woman whose mother claims she has stage 3 brain cancer is saying she is a 'liar and a fraud.' Jessica went on the Dr. Phil show to confront her mother Patricia, who also claims she has suffered 17 strokes, flatlined twice in the past year and at one point in the hospital lost 100 pounds in six days. Patricia says all these things are true, which makes the fact that she is now a self-proclaimed world record weightlifter even more impressive. Scroll down for video .

Speaking out: her daughter Jessica (above) claims it is all a lie and that her mother just wants attention . Confrontation: Jessica took her mother on Dr. Phil (above) to confront her and try to get her help . 'I have 12 titles in weightlifting, and I have cancer,' says Patricia at the beginning of the program. That is not what Jessica believes however. She says her mother has never had cancer. Instead, Jessica explains, she had brain surgery in 2010 after a blood vessel burst in her head, leaving her with a plate in her head. Patricia however claims she discovered she had brain cancer in 2012, and that the doctors 'removed her face, jaw and ear' to perform surgery. They then rebuilt her head using mesh she claims, and she lost the ability to walk and talk following the surgery, and in the six days she was in the hospital went from 185 pounds to 85 pounds. She relearned to walk and talk, and this is when she began weightlifting and claimed multiple titles, something Jessica also claims is not true. Squalor: Jessica also takes issue with the way her mother lives and how dirty her home is . Sad: Jessica also claims her mother neglects her animals, pointing out one dog cannot even open his eye .

"A 32-year-old electrician who died in his burning sports car after allegedly fleeing a gun-wielding gang on mopeds is the victim of a 'cold-blooded murder', his friends say. Father-of-two Michael Paxman died when his high-powered Audi RS4 slammed into a bus stop then a tree on Old Kent Road in south east London in the early hours of Sunday morning. Mr Paxman, from nearby Rotherhithe, was allegedly fleeing gunmen on mopeds who were shooting at him when he lost control as he sped past an Asda supermarket at 100mph. Michael Paxman (pictured) died when his Audi slammed into a tree and burst into flames on Old Kent Road . Police detectives are keen to trace the driver of a dark BMW M5 sportscar seen following Mr Paxman's sportscar minutes before the high speed crash. But an unnamed friend of Mr Paxman remained convinced he was 'murdered' and added: 'He was a real petrol head, we were all petrol heads. 'They're saying three shots were fired at him and I know he wouldn't have lost control if he wasn't dead already - it was a grand theft auto attempt. 'He was a good-driver and a petrol head, if he thought he was losing control he would've slammed on his brakes but there are no brake, or skid marks, anywhere on the road. 'He was killed for his car, it was cold-blooded murder.' Scotland Yard said: 'Police believe that Michael left his home in Rotherhithe between 0.30am and 1am on Sunday. 'He was driving a black Audi RS4, registration number KE07 HWH. At around 2.20am he was seen driving over the flyover at the Bricklayers Arms heading away from Central London towards Rotherhithe. Tragedy: The 32-year-old died at the wheel of his car after a high speed chase in south London . Attack: Witnesses said they heard gunshots just before the car crash and friends of Mr Paxman fear it was a car-jacking that led to his death . 'At 2.27am police were called to reports of Michael's car on fire after it collided with a bus stop by a tree in the Old Kent Road, east of the junction with Albany Road. 'Officers, London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade attended the scene and the fire was extinguished. 'Michael was pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination was held today at Greenwich Mortuary, which was unable to determine a cause of death at this stage. Further tests will be carried out. 'Detectives have established that Michael was in New Kent Road and Newington Causeway area for an about an hour before the collision.' Detective Inspector Dave Reid said: 'Michael was a family man who leaves behind two young children, his family are devastated by his death. 'We believe Michael left home that morning to go and buy something to eat. Exactly what happened after he left is something that we are working hard to establish, and I need the public's help. 'At this stage our forensic team continue to work on establishing the cause of the holes that were found in Michael's car. Carnage: Witnesses described how the incident unfolded like something 'out of a film' when he died at 2.30am on Sunday . Collision: Part of the black Audi RS4's engine block was thrown several metres down the carriageway by the force of the explosion . 'I appreciate that there is a lot of speculation that these were caused by shots being fired at the car. Until those forensic tests are complete I cannot confirm that this is the case. 'There have been numerous reports about armed men on mopeds chasing the car and multiple shots being fired, but at this stage we have found absolutely no evidence to support that as a chain of events. 'I would appeal for anyone who saw Michael driving his black Audi RS4 in the Elephant and Castle area, or anyone who can help us clarify exactly what he was doing between 1am and 2.20am, to get in touch with us. 'I particularly would ask anyone who saw the car being driven along the Old Kent Road to contact us. 'Michael was driving at high speed prior to the collision. We are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a dark car that was travelling behind him after the traffic lights at the junction with Albany Road.

That is the only other car driving near Michael, in the same direction at the critical time. 'Finally, a number of people tried to help Michael after the car crashed. I would ask them to contact us as soon as possible, or indeed anyone who witnessed the aftermath.

"Rumours circulating online that former Cuban leader Fidel Castro has died have apparently been put to bed by Argentinian football hero Diego Maradona. The sporting idol has appeared on a South American TV network  holding a typed letter which he claims is signed by 88-year-old Castro. If it turns out to be authentic, then the note will be the first contact the elder Castro has had with the outside world since a newspaper column which appeared in Cuba's state paper on October 17. Scroll down for video . Diego Maradona claims to have received a typed four-page letter signed by former Cuban leader Fidel Castro after rumours he had died began spreading online last week . Talk of the elder Castro's demise began just a few days after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died at the age of 41. Maradona seemed to put those rumours to bed today . Talk of the revolutionary's death began spreading online last week, perhaps sparked after Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of a prominent Kenyan politician, died  at the age of 41. On Friday night South American media, including Venezuelan paper Diario de Cuba, reported that a government press conference was imminent, but no such event ever took place. Today Maradona told television network Telesur, which is funded by allied countries including Cuba and Venezuela, that he received a four-page letter signed by Castro on Sunday night. He said the note discussed global oil consumption, the release of Cuba's three intelligence agents by the U.S. last month, and a recent summit of the leftist ALBA bloc of Latin American countries. 'I'm very happy to know he's well,' Maradona told reporters at the Havana airport as he prepared to leave Cuba. He added: 'Here's the signature ... I'm showing it to you so you can show it to the world.' The elderly Communist revolutionary was last pictured in July 2014 shaking hands with foreign politicians including Chinese leader Xi Jinping . Russia leader Vladimir Putin was also pictured shaking hands with Castro, who has retreated from public life in recent years after suffering health problems . No images were shown of Castro, who has not appeared in public for more than a year. The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed shaking hands with the Chinese president Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin in July. A serious illness forced Castro to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul. Analysts have been predicting the imminent demise of Castro almost continuously throughout his life, but these have increased in recent years as the politician has withdrawn from public. Castro, who passed on Cuba's leadership to Raul in 2008, became Prime Minister of Cuba after overthrowing the government in 1959 and under his rule turned it into a one-party state. Castro became Prime Minister of Cuba in 1959 after overthrowing the government before turning the island into a one-party state with himself at the helm . The revolutionary passed leadership of Cuba to his elder brother Raul in 2008. His last contact with the outside world was in October last year, when he wrote a column for the state newspaper . He has lived in increasing seclusion ever since he retired from the leadership amid speculation that his health was suffering. It is understood he was recently being cared for by his wife and by a team of nurses. Once an enthusiastic food connoisseur, he has long since stopped visiting Havana restaurants. Castro and Maradona first met in 1986 when Maradona visited the island after winning the world cup with Argentina.

"Derek Mitchell 36, (pictured) left wife, radio DJ Suzie McGuire feeling like a 'broken woman' who tried to kill herself in a bid to escape her 'life of terror' The disgraced husband of former top Scottish radio DJ Suzie McGuire has been spared jail after being convicted of a string of domestic abuse charges including breaking her finger. Accountant Derek Mitchell 36, of Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, left his wife feeling like 'a broken woman' who tried to kill herself in March 2013 in a bid to escape her 'life of terror'. After being convicted of committing a number of assaults in 2011 in November last year after a three week trial at Paisley Sheriff Court he today learned he will not be jailed. Pop Idol winner Michelle McManus gave evidence during the trial, when she told the court she saw Mitchell grabbing his wife’s arm and calling her a ‘slut' as she hosted an event at a luxury hotel in Scotland. She told the court: ‘He grabbed Suzie by the arm and said, “You’re really embarrassing me”.’ Ms McManus claimed Mitchell also told his wife: ‘You’re behaving like a slut, but then again you are a slut.’ She told the court she was ‘quite taken aback’. Today Sheriff Susan Sinclair told him: 'You now accept you have a serious issue with the abuse of alcohol and have started taking steps to deal with it. 'Neverthelessm your conduct during 2011, in particular May 20 2011 was reprehensible. 'Your actions were that of a spoiled, jealous, possessive man with a predilection for violence.' The sheriff added: 'You have been convicted of a serious assault in the presence of two small children and two further minor assaults on the complainer all during 2011.' She said that the relationship was 'volatile' and that she 'cannot be satisfied' that there is no alternative to a custodial sentence. The accountant was found guilty of three assaults between May and December 2011, including breaking his wife's wedding finger after a local fair. He was also found guilty of committing a breach of the peace at the family home in Eaglesham in November 2009, the day after a family party. Mitchell was found guilty of three assaults between May and December 2011 against radio DJ Suzie McGuire . Mitchell drunkenly pulled his wife's wedding finger back - breaking it, in front of her terrified daughters in May 2011 near to their home in Eaglesham. In a rage at a military event in September 2011 that Ms McGuire was hosting, Mitchell grabbed his wife and pulled her away, calling her a slut. Months later in December 2011 the violent dad-of-two humiliated the DJ after she had hosted the Cash for Kids event and slapped her while she chatted with businessman Mike Ashley and even threw a punch at him. He lodged a special defence of self-defence in relation to the broken finger claiming he was trying to stop his wife attacking him, but the jury rejected this version of events. The former drivetime presenter gave evidence from behind screens at the court and described her husband as 'controlling' and 'manipulative'. Suzie McGuire and Derek Mitchell on their wedding say in October 2011 at Eaglesham Parish Church . Mitchell, she said, was a 'prince charming that turned into a Jekyll and Hyde character' who had anger management issues that she couldn't predict. The 45-year-old claimed she was flattered when a younger man showed her attention and wanted a family - as she did - and claimed she repeatedly took him back despite being berated daily and assaulted by the man who claimed to love her. She told the jury: 'That's the embarrassing thing, I went back to that. I will never ever forgive myself for putting my children through that.' She said she was so 'broken' in March last year, she went to an area behind Bonnyton Golf course in an attempt to end her life with painkillers and vodka. The court heard Mitchell's actions were that of a jealous and possessive man with 'a predilection for violence' Addressing the court in  mitigation, Mr Lavelle said: 'This was a relationship in which both parties were engaged in volatility towards each other and of course the accused has been convicted by a jury of assaults over the course of 2011.' He said the 'shock' of his conviction made Mitchell accept he was an alcoholic and he has since been getting help. Referring to the most serious charge Mitchell was convicted of, breaking Ms McGuire's finger, he said that while it is admitted, Mitchell maintains he was acting in self-defence. He said it was 'highly significant' that the jury deleted parts of the charge, including that Mitchell grabbed hold of his wife's hand, and they left the part that was always admitted. Mr Lavelle invited the sheriff not to send Mitchell to jail. He said: 'It would of course materially impact how it would affect his relationship with the kids, that's clearly something which is close to his heart.' Today Sheriff Susan Sinclair handed Mitchell a community payback order with the conditions that he will be supervised for two years, must carry out 300 hours of unpaid work in six months and attend a domestic abuse programme. He must also go for alcohol counselling and conform to a non-harassment order for the next six months, not to approach or contact or attempt to approach or contact Ms McGuire. Passing sentence the sheriff told him: 'You now accept you have a serious issue with the abuse of alcohol and have started taking steps to deal with it.

"Federal prosecutors are accusing a former Army marksman of the cold attempted murder of his wife of 35 years who is suffering from dementia. Wife Rachel Owens, 55, was staying at a friend's house last month when prosecutors say her husband, 58-year-old Gregory Owens, broke in and shot her and her friend's husband because his mistress threatened to go public with their six-year affair. Both Mrs Owens and the husband survived the attack, though prosecutors wouldn't reveal their conditions. While his wife continued to recover from her nearly-fatal injuries, Owens spent New Year's Eve with his girlfriend in Wisconsin, renting a limousine and sure that he had been ruled as a person of interest in the December 12 shooting. But authorities arrested the Londonderry, New Hampshire man on Sunday, after amassing damning evidence they say proves he planned the shooting and places him at the scene of the crime. Heartless: Gregory Owens, a former Army marksman, was arrested Sunday after prosecutors accused him of shooting his wife and a family friend at this home in Saco, Maine last month . Double life: Prosecutors say the shooting happened two weeks after Owen's mistress of six years threatened to expose their affair. Above, investigators take evidence at the scene of the shooting . Owens appeared in Maine federal court for the first time on Monday, dressed in yellow prison garb indicated his status as a maximum-security prisoner, as he was charged with interstate domestic violence and discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. If convicted of both crimes, Owens could spend the rest of his life in prison. The Owens have been married for 35 years, but at least for the last six, Gregory was engaged in an affair with a woman only identified as 'B.W.' in court papers from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Owens' job working for a Florida paramilitary company involved travel, so it perhaps didn't raise any alarms to Mrs Owens that he spent so much time away from home. Each month, prosecutors revealed, Owens spent living a double life in Oshkosh with his girlfriend and socializing with her circle of friends. Two weeks before the shooting however, Owen's mistress became upset when he accidentally called her from New Hampshire and she overheard a conversation with his wife which convinced her that he would never get a divorce. The mistress, who was visiting with the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh police chief at the time of the distressing call, allegedly threatened to reveal the affair 'by publishing photos of the two of them together in the local newspaper' according to an affidavit. A week before Christmas, Mrs Owen's lifelong friend Carol Chabot picked her up in Londonderry to spend some time at her home in Saco, Maine. Shaky alibi: Owens told police that he was at home on the night of the shooting, but they found evidence that shows he may have plotted to kill his wife, and which places him at the scene. Above, The Owens' home in Londonderry, New Hampshire . Mrs Owen's elderly parents live in the Maine town, and Mrs Chabot thought it would offer Owens a break from caring for his dementia-stricken wife. The shooting happened at the Chabot's home in the early hours of December 18, while Mrs Owens was sleeping in one of their guest bedrooms. Carol rose the alarm when she heard breaking glass around 3am and woke her husband. Investigators later found a window into the garage broken, believed to be the intruder's point of entry. Her husband Steven Chabot left their bedroom and entered the hall where he first saw the male intruder 'dressed in dark clothing and wearing a ski mask, carrying a handgun at the top of the stair landing'. The intruder proceeded to the second guest bedroom where Rachel Owens was sleeping and shot her four times - including once in the back of the head. He then chased Mr Chabot, who hid in a closet and tried to call 911. Mr Chabot later told investigators that the masked-man was wearing glasses similar to a pair he had seen Owens wear before. Mr Chabot was also shot at three times in the arm, shoulder and back as he barricaded himself in the closet. His wife Carol remained unharmed in the attack, hiding underneath a piece of furniture. According to court documents, Owen's behavior immediately before and after the shooting made him a suspect in the crime. Footprints at the scene, suspicious Google searches and blood stains also connected Owens to the heinous crime. Three hours after the shooting, police arrived at Owens home and felt that the hood of his car was warm. They later pulled Owens over as he drove to a convenience store near his home and informed him that his wife had been shot. Instead of asking what had happened and how his wife was doing, Owens immediately feigned a heart attack, though he refused to go to the hospital. He told police that he spent the night at home, working on his computer, and only left once to go get donuts and coffee. Security camera footage shows him going to a Dunkin; Donuts at 4:50am. Prior to that he was also captured on a convenience store's CCTV at 12:11am, giving him plenty of time to drive to and from the Chabot's home to commit the crime in between. While an analysis of Owens' computer show she was using it at 2:16am, it was also revealed that he looked up how to change the clock on a computer to conceal the actual time it was used early the previous day. They determined that the files had actually been accessed some two hours after the shooting. Owens' boss also told police that he asked him to lie and say that they had been video chatting at the time of the shooting. He says Owens is no longer employed at the company, based in Florida. In a search of Owen's home and car they also found clothes matching the description of the intruder in a washing machine and blood stains. Two 9mm handguns and about 15 rounds of the same 27-year-old ammunition used in the shooting were also found at Owens' house. Investigators took a cast of a footprint imprinted in a flower bed on the Chabot's property and discovered that it matched Owens' size 11 boots. Mrs Owens and Mr Chabot were rushed to Maine Medical Center in the aftermath of the shootings where they both underwent multiple surgeries. It's unclear what condition they are in as prosecutors refused to say, citing privacy. Instead of dutifully attending to his wife as she continued to recover at the hospital, a confident Owens spent New Year's Eve in Wisconsin with his girlfriend, even renting a limousine. He allegedly told his mistress' family and friends that he had been cleared as a person of interest in his wife's shooting, claiming he was in Afghanistan at the time and had a letter to prove it. Owens was ordered held without bond on Monday, at least until his next hearing on January 21.","Gregory Owens was arrested Sunday in connection to a December 12 shooting which injured his wife and a family friend .

"Baffled, bewildered and afraid, a little Cocker Spaniel padded around the bodies of her friends - the journalists and cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo. Running from office to office she was the silent witness of a horror unfolding that would rock the world. As the 'house' dog and mascot of the staff, Lila was a familiar and much loved figure to staff and visitors alike. She greeted all with a friendly wave of her tail but that morning, the day of the slayings, she was sticking close to her favourite - cartoonist Jean Cabut - known as Cabu. Scroll down for video . Mascot: As Charlie Hebdo's 'house' dog, Lila (pictured), was in the office when her 'friends' were killed . Final moments: Lila the dog stuck close to her 'favourite' cartoonist Jean Cabut - known as Cabu (pictured) - on the day he was killed . He'd arrived in the office clutching a large dried ham wrapped in a bag, a gift for the magazine's first editorial conference of the New Year. Lila knew that the ever generous Cabu was a soft touch, so she stuck close by him as he took his place at the conference table where all were gathering. Earlier, she had greeted the staff one by one as they came to the office, running between their legs, delighted to see them all together again. In a moving interview with Le Monde, Sigolene Vinson, crime reporter with the satirical magazine, held on to the normality of the dog's pleasure as she described the horror that unfolded. One by one, with no time to react, her colleagues were murdered. Sigolene, who had left the conference room for the kitchen, started to crawl on hands and knees to another office as the gunfire exploded. From around the corner a masked man emerged, gun trained on her. It was Said Kouachi. His eyes she remembered were large, dark - and soft. Six of the Charlie Hebdo journalists and staff members killed in Wednesday's attack are pictured together in this photo, taken in 2000. Circled top from left is Philippe Honore, Georges Wolinski, Bernard Maris and Jean Cabut. Below them on the stairs, from left, is editor Stephane Charbonnier and Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . Last meeting: The Charlie Hebdo staff were attending their first editorial meeting of the year when the Kouachi brothers burst into the office with automatic weapons (file photo) She recalled: 'He looks into my eyes and says: ""Do not be afraid. Stay calm. I won't kill you. We don't kill women"". 'But think about what you are doing. What you are doing is wrong. I'm sparing you but because of this you must read the Qur'an.' Desperate not to inadvertently give away the still living - hidden men and women - Sigolene nodded. She lay still until hearing the terrorists flee and then crawled to the horrific scene in the conference room. 'As I lay there, not sure if they were really gone, shots rang out in the distance, in the street. 'And then I heard Lila with her tiny steps.' She pauses to mimic the click clack of the paws as the dog moved from office to office searching for her beloved, now dead, Cabu. Escape: New amateur video shows the Charlie Hebdo killers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, in a gun fight with police shortly after killing six staff members in the office inside . Triumphant: One of the brothers was caught on video chanting: 'We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad' Charlie Hebdo's first edition since the attack will feature a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad on its front page - weeping while holding a 'Je Suis Charlie' placard. With the magazine's demand surging since the attack on January 7, they're planning to print three million copies of the controversial publication, which dwarfs its normal run of 60,000. Digital versions of the magazine will also be available  in English, Spanish and Arabic - while  Italian and Turkish versions will be printed. Thousands of extra police have been drafted in to provide security for the country after 17 innocent people were killed in three days of violence last week.","Lila stuck close to her 'favourite' cartoonist, Jean Cabut, on the day he died .

"It's most women's dream (and every hair dye company's worst nightmare) - a pensioner from Coventry celebrated her 104th birthday last week and revealed she still hasn't gone grey. Freda Taylor, from Coventry, still has a full head of naturally brown hair, despite having received four cards from the Queen to mark her ripe old age. But instead of any fancy beauty creams or hair treatments, Freda puts her fantastic flowing locks down to clean living. Scroll down for video .

And despite her many years, Freda's brown hair isn't the only thing perfectly intact - her memory is equally sharp. She said: 'One of my earliest memories happened over 100 years ago on July 28, 1914 in Blackpool - I remember overhearing my father telling someone on the beach that he'd just heard on the radio that we were at war. 'One of the main memories I have of the Second World War was on November 14, 1940 - the night Coventry suffered its biggest bombing raid. 'I had four-year-old Keith with me and my dad drove us in his car from the outskirts of Coventry to relative safety in Bulkington. 'It was a wicked journey and a night I will never forget. The bangs were horrible and made us all jump.' Freda Taylor with a staff member at Fairfield Care Home. The pensioner celebrated turning 104 last week .

She said: 'I remember my brothers and I being under strict orders from dad not to smoke, and because I looked up to him so much, it was something I never did.

"A Frenchman who was in contact with one of the Charlie Hebdo killers before the massacre has been arrested in Bulgaria while trying to enter Turkey. Fritz-Joly Joachin, a French citizen of Haitian origin, was intercepted at a border checkpoint in  on January 1, a week before the Paris killing spree. Public prosecutor Darina Slavova said the 29-year-old had been 'in contact several times' with Cherif Kouachi, one of the brothers behind the newspaper attack. The arrest came as French police said as many as six members of a terrorist cell involved in the attacks may still be at large, including a man seen driving a car registered to the widow of one of the gunmen. Fritz-Joly Joachin (pictured), a French citizen of Haitian origin, was intercepted at a border checkpoint in Bulgaria on January 1, a week before the Paris killing spree . Frenchman Fritz-Joly Joachin is seen inside a Bulgaria courtroom after he was arrested while trying to cross into Syria. He had been in contact with one the Charlie Hebdo killers before the massacre, prosecutors claim . Links: Joachin had been in contact 'several times' with Cherif Kouachi (left) who with his brother Said (right) killed 12 people in an attack on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices before being killed in a hostage siege . The 29-year-old was arrested with a European warrant alleging he had abducted his three-year-old son and was likely to take him to Syria to be educated in the principles of radical Islam. The child has now been returned to his mother. A second European arrest warrant cited his possible association with one of the attackers and 'conspiracy in terrorism', a spokesman for the Haskovo regional prosecutor's office said. The chief prosecutor's office in the Bulgarian capital Sofia confirmed that the second warrant was issued on the grounds that Joachin was part of a criminal group planning terrorist acts. Merciless: Masked gunmen Cherif and Said Kouachi shoot a police officer dead as he raises his hands in a plea for his life after they stormed the offices of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hedbo last week . The man has agreed to be sent back to France and a Haskovo court will make a final decision on the extradition on Friday, one prosecutor said. According to the initial arrest warrant, Joachin's wife told authorities on December 30 that he was likely to take their son to Syria, that he had converted to Islam 15 years ago and had become radicalised in recent years. Fritz-Joly claimed he was travelling with his son and girlfriend for a holiday in Istanbul. Cherif and Said Kouachi and their accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly, were killed Friday by police after a murderous spree at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket. The three all claimed ties to Islamic extremists in the Middle East. Two police officials said authorities were searching the Paris area for the Mini Cooper registered to Hayat Boumeddiene, Coulibaly's widow. Turkish officials say she is now in Syria. One of the police officials said the cell consisted of about 10 members, and that 'five or six could still be at large,' but he did not provide their names. The other official said the cell was made up of about eight people and included Boumeddiene. France said it will mobilise 10,000 soldiers today and its defence minister said the country remained at risk of further attacks. Details are emerging of the mystery man seen with France’s most wanted woman – Hayat Boumeddiene (pictured) Details are emerging of the mystery man seen with France’s most wanted woman – Hayat Boumeddiene – entering Turkey before she fled to Syria. Mehdi Belhoucine, a 23 year old French national was already known to the country’s security forces, but it’s now been revealed that his older brother was jailed for his part in sending fighters to the Pakistan-Afghanistan area. Mohamed Belhoucine, according to Le Monde, regularly released jihadist propaganda films produced by As-Sahab, Al Qaeda’s media outlet. The Prosecutor at his 2014 trial stressed ‘the depth of his convictions and his jihadist relay role of propaganda on the internet.’ Before being sent for training in Afghanistan, would be jihadists were shown the latest vidoes of fighting by Belhoucine in a safe apartment. His younger brother, then 18 and an electronics student, was often there but according to one witness he ‘just played on his console.’ When interviewed by police on another occasion two years later, he allegedly made no secret of the fact that he felt ‘particularly concerned by the situation in Afghanistan and Iraq but also in Palestine, Somalia and Chechnya.’ He said: “ I thought about going to one of these countries but not necessarily to take up arms initially. The idea would be to be there with them, to help them perhaps in the form of humanitarian aid. ‘And perhaps, if pushed, then if asked, to take up arms.’ Until named by police as the man who accompanied the wife of the killer of a policewoman and hostages in the Jewish supermarket, Amedy Couliblay, on a flight from Madrid to Turkey, Belhoucine had faded from view. Police in Turkey say that the slim, long haired man by Boumedienne’s side in a video released of her airport arrival, is Mahdi Belhoucine. There are now suggestions that Couliblay may have first met the senior Belhoucine brother in jail where he underwent further radicalisation.
