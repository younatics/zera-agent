A 'monster nanny' was caught abusing a two-year-old girl when the child's parents secretly installed a video camera in their house. The couple had become concerned about their child's aggressive behaviour, prompting them to set up the surveillance in their home outside Moscow. They watched in terror as the childminder struck their daughter Sasha and threatened to push her face into a bowl of soup as she was being fed. Scroll down for video . CCTV: A nanny, named as Larisa Zhulitskaya, 42, was pictured abusing two-year-old child Sasha after her parents set up a secret video camera . Aggressive: The parents, who live outside Moscow, posted a video of the abuse online, showing the nanny grabbing the child's head and slapping her . Threat: In the video Zhulitskaya can also be heard telling the two-year-old that she will force her face into a bowl of soup she is being fed . Denial: Larisa Zhulitskaya, a qualified teacher, responded by denying she routinely abused Sasha or other children in her care . The nanny is also pictured forcefully cleaning the girl's face after the meal, before pushing her away. The middle-class Russian parents - who are not named but are known to have an older daughter studying in London - released an edited version of the footage as a warning to other parents. They claimed video clips allegedly showing even worse abuse are in the hands of police. 'We have posted just one small clip, the worst is with the police and cannot be disclosed because of the investigation,' the couple wrote. The parents name the nanny as Larisa Zhulitskaya, a qualified teacher, who responded by denying she routinely abused Sasha or other children in her care. 'That day I was simply in a foul mood,' claimed the 42-year-old. 'I had problems in my family, and I was in a really bad mood. But actually children adore me more than their own parents.' The couple said that the nanny had worked for them for a year. They stated: 'Larisa Zhulitskaya is two-faced monster. We thought that they exist only in the movies and horror stories and, of course, they do not look as cute as Larisa Zhulitskaya.' Forceful: Images show the nanny, who said she was in a 'foul mood', grabbing the child's head in a forceful manner . Locked: The parents said the footage revealed that the nanny was sitting on the sofa, watching TV, while their child was locked in the kitchen . 'But it turned out that this was a mistake as a monster turned to be among us. Do not trust her your children.' They described the nanny as 'cheerful and responsive', and said she told them how Sasha 'spent time reading books' and playing happily. The couple became suspicious when Sasha began to talk, saying they were surprised by her aggression towards toys. When the couple set up the video camera they were 'horrified' to find Zhulitskayalying on the sofa watching TV all day, while their child was locked in the kitchen. In one clip, the nanny scolds Sasha: 'Why do you stare into that bowl? What did you see there? Haven't seen food before? I told you not to lean over the bowl.' She told the child: 'If you'll keep leaning to the bowl I'll put your face in that bowl.' Push: After finishing feeding the child, the nanny forcefully pushes her out of her chair . Investigation: The couple said that the nanny had worked for them for a year and they had passed other videos to police . The helpless child is seen flinching as the nanny grabs her hair and says: 'There you are, now you are closer to the bowl.' She yells at the child, telling her to 'close her mouth',Â  before striking her on the face. But the nanny claimed that the child is 'very attached' to her and that she finds it 'easier to get along with her than her parents'. She said that Sasha's father told her they had secretly filmed her before terminating her employment. 'I asked to see the video but I was told that they no longer want to see me and that I will have to communicate with the investigators,' she added. The nanny's adult son Anton said: 'She is pretty rough with the girl. It is unusual behaviour for her, an emotional breakdown. But all this could have been discussed with my mother - she is a professional educator and a sane person.' He attacked the parents for posting the video online. He said: 'They sent a letter to me, my girlfriend and her parents. In a letter written to my girlfriend's parents, they told them to think twice and asked if they were ready to have this woman to bring up their future grandchildren. 'But her former students speak about my mother very well.'

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 08:08 EST, 21 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 22 January 2013 . Arrested: Nehemiah Griego admitted to police that he shot his family members when he was mad at his mother . The 15-year-old pastor's son told police the gruesome story of how he killed his mother because he was 'annoyed with' his mother, and then went on to shoot dead his three younger siblings before taking an AR-15 assault rifle and waiting for hours until his father arrived home so that he could kill him too. Nehemiah Griego is in police custody and the formal statement of probably cause tells how, after telling several false versions of events, he eventually admitted to killing five of his family members. The 15-year-old said that at just after midnight on Saturday he walked into his parent's bedroom where his mother and younger brother were sleeping and took a .22 caliber rifle from his parent's closet. He then shot his mother Sara in the head, and when his 9-year-old brother Zephania awoke and said that he did not believe that she was dead, the police report states that Nehemiah 'picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face.' When Zephania began to cry, Nehemiah shot him dead too before proceeding into the room where his 5-year-old sister Jael and 2-year-old sister Angelina were sleeping. 'Nehemiah stated he lost his sense of conscience and went to the bedroom his two younger sisters share. Nehemiah stated when he entered he noticed that his sisters were crying and he shot both of them in the head,' the police report says. Scroll down for video . Suspected shooter: Nehemiah Griego, 15, was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood . 'Quiet': Nehemiah was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled . It is unclear why the boy's father Gregory Griego, 51, who was a former pastor at nearby Calvary Church was not home at the time of the shooting, but Nehemiah appears to have been prepared. After allegedly killing his siblings and his mother, he then went back to his parent's closet and grabbed the AR-15 military-style assault rifle that they kept there and then went to wait fro his dad in the downstairs bathroom. When his father arrived at around 5am on Saturday, he waited until his dad had walked past the bathroom so that he was able to shoot him multiple times with the assault rifle. Nehemiah admitted to police that at the time of the shooting he was having homicidal and suicidal thoughts. In a chilling note, he added that there would have been more deaths, telling police that 'after killing five of his family members he reloaded the weapons so that he could drive to a populated area to murder more people.' He said that he expected that he would be killed in a firefight that would likely ensue when he tried to kill others. The timeline of events from that point on appears a little less defined as he admitted to texting a picture of his dead mother to his girlfriend. Tragedy: One of the victims of the shooting was identified as Gregory Griego, pictured center, a former pastor at the Calvary Albuquerque church . Killing: Five people were shot to death at the home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the Saturday night shooting . In an earlier story, he told police that he had come home to find his family had been killed, and that he drove to the church with rifles in the trunk of the van in order to protect himself from the potential attacker. In that story, he told his girlfriend about the deaths, and then her grandmother then reported it to the authorities. Nehemiah was arrested after the shooting at his family's Albuquerque home where police found the bodies and they have charged him with two counts of murder, and three counts of child abuse . resulting in death, according to the station. Each of the victims were shot multiple . times, and police found a number of weapons in the house. Nehemiah is believed to be the seventh of Pastor Griego's ten children and because he has no existing records with the county school board, they believe he was home schooled. A neighbor told local news station KRQE that Nehemiah quiet but courteous. Location: The bodies were found at a home on Long Lane Southwest in South Valley, New Mexico . 'He seemed to be a normal kid just walking up and down the road,' said neighbor Jerry Crites. 'He seemed to be a very good kid, he was fairly quiet not real rowdy that we could tell.' One of the only places that Nehemiah . left a trail is online where he lied about his age to make a dating . profile on a site called MeetOne. 'Well I'm a fun loving guy who like . [sic] to make people happy I might be shy but I'll open up once you get . to know me,' he wrote on the site. He wrote that he was 18-years-old, most likely to comply with the site's terms and conditions, and posted a photo of himself in his favorite camouflage fatigues. Family murder: The shooting took place inside the Griego home, and Nehemiah waited there for hours after killing his mother and siblings until his father arrived home from work . House of guns: Investigators were seeking to determine who owned several guns that were found at the home, one of which was a semi-automatic military-style rifle . Crime scene: Authorities investigate the death of Pastor Gregory Griego and family members at his home on Sunday morning . 'There's no other way to say it, except . that we have a horrific crime scene down there that we are working on,' Sheriff Dan Houston said on Sunday. 'Right . now we're to the meticulous points of processing the scene and . collecting physical evidence, and this is a vast scene with a lot of . physical evidence,' sheriff's department spokesman Sid Covington said. Though little is known about Nehemiah, his father was a recognizable figure in the community and previously served as the pastor at Calvary Albuquerque Church. After spending six years working at the Calvary Chapel in Montebllo, California, Mr Griego moved to New Mexico. Since moving to Albuquerque, he has worked in a number of different outreach capacities for the Christian church, including leading the prison outreach program and leading the group Veterans for Christ.","Nehemiah Griego, 15, arrested and charged with shooting his relatives .

A driver forced to abandon his car in a snow-filled ditch after sliding off the road was horrified when he returned to find it destroyed by an irate farmer who used a forklift to remove it from his land. Dan Neal left a note on the windscreen of his Citroen C2 after he skidded off the road and into a fence as he drove home in the snow. But that didn't stop Edward Gilbert from using the twin blades of his forklift to wrench the Â£3,000 car from the ditch, piercing the bodywork and smashing the windows. And when shocked Mr Neal - whose car has now gone to the scrapyard - challenged Edward Gilbert, the farmer demanded he hand over Â£250 for damaging his fence. 'Confiscated': A hole in the roof of the Citroen where farmer Edward Gilbert pierced the bodywork with the blade of his forklift . Shock: Mr Gilbert used a forklift truck to remove the car from his land when Dan Neal was forced to abandon it after sliding from the road in ice and snow . Mr Neal's eight year old car was left with smashed windows, a hole in the roof, a missing wing mirror and scratches all over the doors after Mr Gilbert used the forklift to wrench the vehicle from the ditch. But the 24-year-old said the farmer remained defiant when confronted about his actions. 'He said ""I've confiscated your car because I'm sick of people driving into my fence"",' said Mr Neal. 'He was very matter-of-fact about it. He even said I owed him Â£250 - I couldn't believe what he was saying.' The police have told Mr Neal he cannot prove criminal intent and the incident must be dealt with by insurers. His eight year-old car was towed away and he is now waiting to hear what compensation he will get - and from who. Until then Mr Neal is stuck at home in the isolated village of Fleckney, near Leicester, with no means of getting to his job in the customer service department at British Gas. Scene: Mr Neal is seen standing beside the fence where his car came to a rest after sliding from the road . Write-off: Two windows were smashed on the Â£3,000 Citroen after farmer Edward Gilbert used a forklift to remove it . Mr Neal had been . driving home from work in heavy snow around 6pm last Friday evening . when he skidded off a bend and into the ditch next to Mr Gilbert's Wistow Grange farm in Leicestershire. The . car suffered a few minor scratches but the RAC was unable to attend and . Dan was advised to leave the vehicle with a note on the dashboard. He said: 'I ended up next . to a wooden fence post - there was hardly any damage apart from a . couple of scratches and the post was left at a slight angle. 'I . called the RAC from the scene and they said they couldn't get to me . immediately and to leave a note on the dashboard saying the car would be . collected as soon as possible. 'I . managed to get a lift home from my girlfriend and then I met the RAC . the next morning and went back with them around 9.30am and the car was . gone. 'I called the . police to see if anyone had reported it and they'd heard nothing so I . went on a bit of a detective hunt myself,' Mr Neal said. Dan . and the RAC patrolman drove around the snow-covered area looking for . any sign of the car before they spotted a couple of men in a nearby . field. He said: 'We got out to speak to them and as we did the farmer appeared and told us what he'd done. 'He said he'd confiscated the car and taken it away with a forklift truck and put it in his farmyard.' And when the farmer took Dan to the barn he was horrified to discover his once pristine Citroen was now a mangled wreck. 'Destroyed': Mr Neal has no means of getting to work from his home in the isolated village of Fleckney, Leicestershire . Mangled wreck: Mr Neal's once pristine Citroen has gone to the scrapyard . Scrapped: Mr Neal's car being removed from Mr Gilbert's farm on a low loader by the RAC . Defiant: Mr Neal skidded into a fence at Wistow Grange farm, owned by Edward Gilbert, as he was driving home from work in the snow . He said: 'We went to his farm and it . was in one of his barns and he took it out with his forklift, although . this time he picked it up underneath. 'The car had been destroyed - both side windows were smashed and the roof had been put through. 'If it had been a Â£50,000 Bentley I might have left it in the ditch' Farmer Edward Gilbert . 'The windscreen was cracked, there were dents in the doors and one of the wing mirrors was missing. It was in a real state.' The undriveable car was lifted onto the back of the RAC's recovery vehicle and taken away as scrap. Mr Neal said: 'The police have told me they don't want to get involved as they can't prove that the farmer acted maliciously. 'My . insurers have said they'll get in touch with the farmer to try to sort . it out and I'm left without a car living in the middle of nowhere and I . can't get to work.' But defiant Mr Gilbert, 38, has defended his actions and said he was 'within his rights' to remove the car. 'It had damaged the fence and there were sheep in the field and a danger they could escape,' he said. 'It was dark and snowing and I couldn't see any sign in the car and the forklift was the only way I had of lifting it off the fence.' He added: 'We get fed up with people going through the hedges and abandoning their cars. 'If it had been a Â£50,000 Bentley I might have left it in the ditch. 'But as it is I'm waiting to send him my personal invoice for the damage he's caused to my fence.'","Dan Neal, 24, was forced to abandon his Citroen after sliding off the road while driving home in the snow .

A Saudi woman was questioned by police for driving a car after she was forced to take over the wheel when her husband fell ill. Officers stopped the woman after receiving reports she was driving near the city of Madinah - flouting a strict ban that prevents females from getting behind the wheel in Saudi Arabia. However, the police soon discovered she had only done so because her husband had complained of feeling unwell. Pushing for equal rights: A woman was stopped by police for driving a car in Saudi Arabia after being forced to take over from her husband when he fell ill. It is the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent years that have led to protests by activists like Manal Al-Sherif (above) against the country's strict ban on female drivers . Her husband, an engineer, was taken to a local clinic for treatment and later pledged not to allow his wife to drive again. The case is the latest in a series of similar incidents that has prompted protests from women calling for a change in the law, it was reported on Gulfnews.com. In November last year, Nassima Al Sadah became the third Saudi woman after Manal Al-sherif and Samar Badawi to file a lawsuit over the ban on women from obtaining driving licences in Saudi Arabia. Manal al-Sherif was arrested and detained for 10 days in May 2011 after posting a video of herself on YouTube as she drove around Khobar. Making their point: al-Sherif and a group of other women started a Facebook page in 2011 which urged authorities to lift the driving ban . al-Sherif and a group of other women started a Facebook page called 'Teach me how to drive so I can protect myself,' which urged authorities to lift the driving ban. Several other Saudi women went on to film themselves behind the wheel of a car in the days after her detention. Women struggle to get around in Saudi Arabia and it isn't just a result of the driving ban. As far as they can go: Saudi women pose in a vehicle at a car show, but as it stands they are not allowed to drive in the Middle East state . Taxis can be sparse and some men refuse to drive a woman without a chaperone - usually their husband or a close male relative. Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world to ban women - both Saudi and foreign - from driving. The prohibition forces families to hire live-in drivers and those who cannot afford the $300 to $400 a month for a driver must rely on male relatives to drive them to work, school, shopping or the doctor. Women are also barred from voting.","Women are banned from driving in the Middle East state .

A policeman today told an inquest how he shot a bodybuilder with a 50,000-volt Taser gun four times in less than a minute. Dale Burns collapsed after PC Kevin Milby repeatedly shocked him with the electric weapon, and struck his head on a TV cabinet. The officer and two colleagues had been attempting to subdue the muscle-bound Mr Burns, who had been rampaging around his flat in a drug-fuelled craze. The 27-year-old died two hours after he was Tasered four times in 52 seconds and was attacked with pepper spray. Death: Dale Burns, left, died after being shot four times by PC Kevin Milby, pictured outside an inquest today . Shot: Mr Burns, pictured with his daughter Honour, died after an encounter with police in August . However, Mr Milby told the inquest into his death that he had taken the time to assess whether or not the Taser hits were having an effect. Mr Burns, a father of two, was described as a 'gentle giant but with a drug habit' who regularly took steroids and ecstasy pills while working as a nightclub bouncer. He had also used cannabis and snorted cocaine, and tried to take his own life after suffering from depression in the months before his death. On the day he died he told police he had taken a 'gram of Madcat', an illegal drug, the inquest into his death in Kendal, Cumbria heard. Police were called to Mr Burns's rented flat in Barrow-in-Furness on August after receiving reports he was trashing the bathroom of the property. Mr Milby, who was authorised to use a Taser, led the team of six officers who found him inside wild-eyed and semi-naked. Family: Mr Burns, described as a 'gentle giant', with his daughter Honour and his son Ethan . 'Immediately I could tell he appeared to be under the influence of some sort of drugs,' Mr Milby told the hearing. 'His eyes were rolling in the back of his head and pupils dilated. He was making sudden, jerky movements. 'I asked him what he had taken. He replied, ""Madcat"".' Mr Milby, with two colleagues, decided they would have to arrest Burns for criminal damage but were also concerned at the way he was behaving, the inquest heard. Mr Burns then began to throw clothes and other objects out of the window into the street below before Mr Milby said he was forced to use his Taser as the suspect bore down on him in the lounge of the one-bed flat. 'He turned towards me, he had both fists clenched... grinding down on his teeth. As he approached I decided to self-authorise the Taser and discharged it at him. 'It was my belief he posed a danger to me and other officers and himself. He was becoming increasingly aggressive. I feared for my personal safety at that time.' Grief: The victim's parents Donna, left, and David, right, photographed at their son's inquest today . Mr Milby said he did not have time to shout a warning to Mr Burns, who fell back, then forwards, and hit his head on the TV cabinet as he went down. The first shot was timed automatically by the device at exactly 6.50pm and each Taser blast is a pulse of electric shock lasting five seconds. So with the next shot timed at 6.50pm and eight seconds, there was a gap of just three seconds between the end of the first blast and the start of the next. Jonathan Hough QC, counsel for the coroner, asked the officer if he should have waited before pulling the trigger again so soon after the first blast. 'I would say it would be unsafe for all parties to do so,' he replied. Mr Burns was then pepper sprayed in the face before Mr Milby fired his Taser again at 6.50pm and 36 seconds. As his two colleagues continued to struggle to get the handcuffs on Mr Burns, the officer pulled the trigger for the final time at 6.50pm and 52 seconds. Mr Milby then put his Taser back in his holster and, with Mr Burns still thrashing his arms and legs, helped his colleagues to bind the suspect at the ankles and wrists with cuffs and leg restraints. Mr Burns was taken to Furness General Hospital in Barrow, where medics administered diazepam at 7.35pm, and he calmed down. But he then suffered a heart attack, and despite hospital staff and a police officer giving him CPR for 40 minutes, he was pronounced dead at 8.41pm. The inquest is scheduled to last up to three weeks.","Officer Kevin Milby was called to flat of drug-crazed Dale Burns .

Several holes were ripped into the roof of the former home of the Detroit Lions - it had already been deflated as part of a renovation plan and officials said they were unconcerned by the damage, according to the Detroit Free Press. A snow band is currently across the northeast with three inches of snow expected for the Syracruse area and a further foot headed there on Thursday. A further winter weather system is also expected to hit the Northeast on Friday. Erie, Pennsylvania has already exceeded all records with 16.3 inches of snow falling on Monday alone making it its snowiest day in January on record, according to the Weather Channel.

The plane's crew had reported suspicious behavior by two men who'd spent several minutes in the bathroom and were sitting near her. Hebshi says she was ordered to remove her clothes, bend over and cough while she was searched. The Sylvania, Ohio, woman filed suit Tuesday. She says she was targeted because she is half-Arab and half-Jewish. She didn't know the men. No one was charged. Frontier and the Transportation Security Administration won't comment on the lawsuit in Detroit federal court. Hebshi's plane had just landed when she noticed that law enforcement officials were huddled in the rear of the plane. But she says she was completely unaware that she had been singled out, along with the two other men sitting in her row, whom she described as Indian. At the time, she had just sent a Tweet on her mobile phone saying '(c)ops in uniform and plainclothes huddle in rear of plane.' Hebshi said: 'Someone shouted for us to place our hands on the seats in front of us, heads down. 'The cops ran down the aisle, stopped at my row and yelled at us to get up. 'One of the cops, grabbing my arm a little harder than I would have liked. He slapped metal cuffs on my wrists and pushed me off the plane. 'The three of us, two Indian men living in the Detroit metro area, and me, a half-Arab, half-Jewish housewife living in suburban Ohio, were being detained.' In shock, she was held in small cell, strip-searched and then questioned by FBI agents. 'They had done some background check on me already because they knew I had been to Venezuela in 2001. 'Suspicious': Passengers are led off the Frontier Airlines plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport after it was stormed by armed officers on Sunday . Security checks: A group of police officers and agents examine the plane on the tarmac after the SWAT team had swooped on Ms Hebshi . 'They asked about my brother and my sister and asked about my foreign travel. They asked about my education and wanted my address, Social Security, phone number, Facebook, Twitter, pretty much my whole life story. High alert: A heavily armed police officer stands guard on Broadway Avenue, New York, during the 9/11 memorial on Sunday . 'I asked what was going on, and the man said judging from their line of questioning that I could probably guess, but that someone on the plane had reported that the three of us in row 12 were conducting suspicious activity. 'What is the likelihood that two Indian men who didn't know each other and a dark-skinned woman of Arab/Jewish heritage would be on the same flight from Denver to Detroit? Was that suspicion enough? 'Even considering that we didn't say a word to each other until it became clear there were cops following our plane?' Mrs Hebshi was later released without charge, along with the two men. But initial media reports claimed she and one of the other passengers had been 'making out' during the flight. Frontier Flight 623, which had 116 passengers on board, landed without incident in Detroit at 3.30pm on Sunday - the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. Security was already on high alert as memorials took place in the cities and the FBI released information on a credible but unconfirmed terror threat. FBI Detroit spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said ultimately authorities determined there was no real threat on the Denver to Detroit flight. 'Due to the anniversary of Sept. 11, all precautions were taken, and any slight inconsistency was taken seriously, Ms Berchtold said. 'The public would rather us err on the side of caution than not.' Mrs Hebshi has since vowed not to fly again on September 11.

Most babies of 12 months of age cannot walk, while their vocabulary might just about stretch to a few goos and perhaps the odd âMumâ. However, a new hi-tech tablet for babies will go on sale at a price of Â£84.99 in time for Christmas. The InnoTab 2 Baby â effectively an iPad for babies â was launched today at the 2013 Toy Fair, a showcase for what manufacturers hope will be the big sellers of the year. Mily La, 2, tries out the Â£84.99 InnoTab 2, with the help of Charlotte Johnson. The tablet is aimed at babies and children from 1 year to 4 years . The InnoTab 2 has a library of apps that can downloaded . Using the touchscreen, babies will, in theory, be able to navigate their way around educational games identifying colours or animals, complete with sound. It comes in a hard rubberised case that protects it from being chewed or dropped, while there is music to soothe and eBooks to flick through with parents. Just as with an iPad there will be a library of apps to download that, in theory, will allow the baby to use it as they develop until the age of nine, when, no doubt, they will be screaming for a real iPad. The Innotab 2 Baby is made by toy tech company Vtech, which claims it has spotted a gap in the market in terms of providing a tablet for youngsters under three. The device will appear to the âTiger Mothersâ who are set on raising the next generation of brain surgeons, nuclear physicists, City bankers and concert pianists. The firm describes the tablet as a âmust have gadgetâ and boasts: âParents no longer need to be worried about their child with a tablet. âInnotab 2 Baby features a baby proof design and tailored apps and content.â The innovation provides telling evidence as to how technology and tablets are replacing old fashioned toys, whether it is rocking horses and Teddy bears or Barbie and Action Man. Sales of traditional toys that involve handling, building or the imagination fell by 1per cent last year as youngsters switched to screens. Traditionalists will rue the change in culture, for many technology based games involve solitary play, rather than groups, and leave little room for imagination. VTech's Charlotte Johnson with the InnoTab 2, which is aimed at babies and children from 1 year to 4 years old . Vtechâs Charlotte Johnson said: âIt has a special casing that means that you can leave it alone with a child and they can chew it and they wonât damage it at all. âIt is pre-loaded with 12 musical melodies that will soothe a child. 'It also has a cartridge that teaches the recognition of animals, such as an elephant and explain what it is and what noise it makes. âIt is educational as well as designed to entertain and soothe. The baby can use it on their own or with the parent. A 12 month old can use the touchscreen.â Mily La, 2, tries out the InnoTab 2. It has a special case designed to withstand being dropped . One of the games sees the screen showered with golden stars which disappear one by one as they are touched with tiny fingers. The tablet also has a built in video camera to allow parents to capture their baby at play. Miss Johnson said it was far better than simply putting a child in front of a TV screen because it has interactive elements, while it can be used by a parent and child.

We are living in a world of technology and everyone is using the iPad and it is nice to encourage children to learn in this way.

Astronomers have released the first pictures of what they think what a black hole will look like - but admit they don't yet have to technology to check their theory. Black holes are invisible, as not even light can escape their gravitational pull. But it is believed that the boundaries around themÂ  - a point of no return called the event horizon - should be visible from the radiation emitted by matter as it is sucked in. Crescent shape: Astronomers from Berkeley have created this prediction of what a black hole looks like based on observations of Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the centre of our galaxy . It is that expectation that led Ayman Bin Kamruddin of the University of California, Berkeley to present this image of what a black hole picture could look like at the 221st meeting of the American Astronomical Society. As the picture shows, it is expected that the first black hole pictures - which will in fact show the boundaries around them - will take a crescent form, rather than the blobby shape they are popularly given. 'A black hole's immediate surroundings have a lot of really interesting physics going on, and they emit light,' Mr Kamruddin told LiveScience. 'Technically speaking, we aren't exactly seeing the black hole, but we are effectively resolving the event horizon.' Mr Kamruddin's picture is not just an exercise in astronomical speculation. It is based on a model that astronomers are using to to prepare to interpret the images that will become available from apparatus under construction. A new project called the Event Horizon Telescope will combine observations from a worldwide network of radio telescopes to get data on objects in space that would otherwise be too tiny to see. 'The Event Horizon Telescope is the first to resolve spatial scales comparable to the size of the event horizon of a black hole,' said Berkeley astronomer Jason Dexter, who collaborated with Mr Kamruddin on the image. 'I don't think it's crazy to think we might get an image in the next five years.' This is NOT what a black hole looks like: A previous artists' impression of a black hole . A black hole is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform spacetime to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called 'black' because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other matter and with electromagnetic radiation such as light. The new telescope has already gathered preliminary measurements of the black hole at the centre of our own Milky Way galaxy, known as Sagittarius A*. The researchers matched this data to various models and found that they best fit crescent-shaped images rather than the 'asymmetric Gaussian' blob shape previously used in models. This crescent shape reflects that doughnut-shaped disk of matter which orbits a black hole as it is inexorably sucked inside. As gas spins around the black hole, the side which points towards observers on Earth will appear brighter as a result of a process called Doppler beaming, while the other side will appear dimmer. The centre of the crescent is a dark circle which represents the black hole itself. Ultimately the researchers hope to use the first pictures of Sagittarius A* to weigh the black hole at the centre of our galaxy. They also hope to prove certain aspects of the theory of general relativity that have thus far escaped confirmation. Nevertheless, Mr Kamruddin said just getting an image at all will be 'mind-blowing'. He told LiveScience: 'It will provide direct confirmation of the event horizon, which has been predicted, but no one's ever actually seen it. Seeing what it is like will rule out certain physics.'","Invisible black holes are 'imagined' by scientists using boundaries around them .

Heart failure brought on by syphilis claimed the life of one of the UK's top composer, it has been claimed. In a new book to mark what would have been Benjamin Britten's centenary year, author Paul Kildea claims that by the time he was diagnosed he was beyond treatment. In his book Benjamin Britten: A Life In The Twentieth Century, Mr Kildea claims that Britten contracted the disease from his long term partner Peter Pears. Talented: Composer Benjamin Britten suffered from syphilis according to a biography released next month . Secret: Author Paul Kildea claims Britten was never told he had syphilis because he was beyond treatment . Britten died in 1976 having never fully recovered from heart surgery three years earlier because of the disease he was carrying. According to the book, Mr Pears never knew of his condition either and carried the disease without showing any symptoms. Mr Pears died a decade after Britten - who is credited with composing some of the finest music for the voice ever written and for a revival of English opera - and was buried next to him at Aldeburgh, Suffolk. Mr Kildea told the Guardian: 'It was a series of tragedies, syphilis did not kill him, but it meant that his heart was not in the condition required to recover fully from the procedure he underwent and from which his consultant (though not his cardiologist) expected him to make a full recovery.' The composer's former assistant Colin . Matthews, who is now on the board of the Britten-Pears Foundation, which . promotes the pair's work, said that he believes the claims are . 'probably true'. He added he is unsurprised that the decision was taken by doctors not to tell Britten . of his condition given the stigma then attached to the disease, and that . treatment would have had no effect. Partners: Britten, sitting at the piano, and Peter Pears met following the death of a mutual friend . Royal visit: The Queen Mother and Peter Pears at the Snape Maltings Concert Hall in 1971 . Mr Matthews said: 'Nothing could be . done. In those days people would undoubtedly have been shocked, and to . people of a certain generation it may still seem so today.' In the biography, Kildea says that Britten predicted his own ill health while working on Death In Venice in 1971. Syphilis is the oldest recognized STI and can result in death if untreated. The bacteria that cause syphilis are called Treponema pallidum. They can enter your body if you have close contact with an infected sore, normally during sex. Syphilis has three stages which can overlap and are not always experienced in the same sequence. Generally however, the first stage begins with a painless but very infectious sore on the gentials or around the mouth. It lasts between two to six weeks before disappearing. Secondary symptoms include flu-like symptoms such as fever, a skin rash and sore throat. These tend to disappear after a few weeks. There is then a latent stage that can last for years. The third stage is the last and most dangerous - it affects around a third of people who are not treated for the STI. It can damage the brain with symptoms ranging from tremors to mood disorders causing ravings and muscle weakness. Syphilis also has a tendency to damage the walls of the aorta, the artery that leads from the heart. It can also cause blindness. The third stage can develop up to 25 years after the initial infection. Between 2009 and 2010, there were 2,624 cases of syphilis diagnosed in the UK. If caught early the disease can be easily treated with antibiotics, usually penicillin injections. Mr Kildea makes the assertion that Britten may have suffered from syphilis from as early as 1940. He . writes: 'It seem likely that as he sweated and hallucinated his way . through a bout of streptococcal tonsillitis in the early months of 1940, . only two years after his heart was given the all clear and just as he . was about to write his love song to Pears, Seven Sonnets of . Michelangelo, his body was in fact reacting to syphilis, now in its . secondary stage. All the symptoms were there.' The book, which is published on February 7, is being serialised by the Telegraph prior to its release. The centenary of Britten's work is to be celebrated in 12 months of dedicated programming from the BBC. The Suffolk-born dentist's son showed . musical talent from a young age and went on to be a key figure iof . classical music in the 20th Century. His . earliest attempt at a composition, entitled Do You No[sic] That My . Daddy Has Gone To London Today, came in 1919 when he was just . six-years-old, and two years later he began piano lessons. Britten . attended the private school South Lodge, where he had viola lessons, in . his home town of Lowestoft, and later became a border at Gresham's . School in Norfolk before being awarded a scholarship at the Royal . College of Music in London. A . visit to the Norfolk and Norwich Festival in 1924 had left a lasting . impression on a young Britten after hearing the orchestral suite The Sea . by Frank Bridge. His viola teacher introduced him to the composer, who . had taken the budding musician under his wing. Britten, who became the first composer to become a lord when he was given a life peerage in 1976, had his first composition - Three Two-part Songs' which set three poems by Walter de la Mare to music - published in 1932. He began working at GPO Film Unit, writing music for the 1936 documentary Night Mail, which also featured poetry by W. H. Auden. Influence: Britten, pictured conducting on his 47th birthday, is sparked a revival of the English opera . Sufferer: Mr Kildea believes that Britten may have had syphilis from as early as 1940 . The composer met Pears, a young singer, a year later when a mutual friend Peter Burra died in a plane crash, and the pair struck up a friendship ahead of a homosexual relationship. The couple, who moved to the U.S. in 1939 before returning a few years later, both registered as conscientious objectors during the Second World War. Britten made a name for himself in 1945 with Peter Grimes, credited by the Britten-Pears Foundation for putting 'British opera back on the map'. It was first performed at Sadler's Wells in London. Another piece, Glorianna, was performed at the Royal Opera House in the capital to celebrate the Queen's coronation. Britten - interviewed by police in the 1950s over his homosexuality but was never charged - and Pears set up the Aldeburgh Festival in 1949, having moved to the Suffolk seaside town. New works by Britten were regularly performed at the festival. During his remarkable career, some of his most celebrated works included The Turn Of The Screw, Death In Venice, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Noye's Fludde - described as the first community opera, having been written for a church or large hall, with parts for younger performers. He was also asked to write for the renowned cellist Mstislav 'Slava' Rostropovich, and in 1962 completed the powerful choral masterpiece War Requiem, which mixes the Latin requiem mass with Wilfred Owen poetry.

"By . Mail Today Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:28 EST, 11 February 2012 . More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest passenger jetliner but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly. The damage has been found in two more A380 superjumbos, just two weeks after tiny cracks were first reported in the wings of the 525-seat, double-decker aircraft, which entered service just over four years ago. The initial discovery led to Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association last week called for the aircraft to be grounded amidst safety concerns. Safety concerns: More cracks have been discovered in the wings of the world's biggest jetliner, the 525-seat, double-decker A380 superjumbo, but Airbus has insisted the aircraft are still safe to fly . 'Airbus confirms that some additional cracks have been found on a limited number of non-critical brackets ... inside the wings of some A380s,' the planemaker said in a statement. 'Airbus emphasizes that these cracks do not affect the safe operation of the aircraft.' The European Aviation Safety Authority (EASA) confirmed it would issue a bulletin Friday mandating precautionary checks. The latest cracking problem was discovered in two aircraft during a routine two-year inspection, an Airbus spokeswoman said. EADS subsidiary Airbus has so far delivered 68 superjumbos, starting with Singapore Airlines which took the first aircraft in December 2007, followed by Dubai's Emirates and Qantas Airways of Australia. Other operators include Air France, Germany's Lufthansa, Korean Air and China Southern. A380 breakdown . So big that many airports had to modify their facilities to accomodate it, the A380 was designed to challenge Boeing's monopoly of the large passenger aircraft market. The aircraft's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, allowing for a cabin space of 5,145 sq ft - some 49 per cent more than Boeing's 747, the next largest passenger jet currently in service. The A380 is designed for a range of up to 9,600 miles (15,400km), enough to fly from New York to Hong Kong, at a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (560mph or 900km/h). However, since the first deliveries of the aircraft in 2007, the planes have already been plagued with a series of problems. A blowout in the superjumbos' Derby-built Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines led to an emergency landing of a Qantas A380 in November 2010. Qantas grounded its Airbus fleet for more than a fortnight after the midair explosion over Singapore, which was found to have been caused by a faulty pipe. Rolls subsequently admitted dealing with the fault, including replacing the engines on several aircraft, had cost it Â£56million. Even the A380's massive size has posed difficulties. Last June an Airbus 380 lost its wing-tip in a taxiing collision with a building at Le Bourget airport Paris. The collision mirrored an incident at JFK airport earlier that year when a private jet was spun round after it was hit by the wing of an A380. The latest problems were discovered in the same type of part as the earlier set of cracks, an L-shaped bracket which connects the wing's exterior to the internal 'rib' structure. A380 wings are manufactured in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol, before they are shipped to Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, for final assembly. Each aircraft is powered by four Rolls Royce Trent 900 engines, built in Derby. In total, some 20,000 British workers' jobs rely on the construction of the mammoth planes. Industry journal Air Transport Intelligence said the brackets, known as rib feet, had been stressed during the manufacturing process and that this was being fixed. The A380 has enough room on its wings to park 70 cars and a wingspan of 79.8m (261ft 10in).","Wings are built in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, near Bristol .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:49 EST, 29 August 2011 . Motorways are have to have their hard-shoulders opened up in a string of plans aimed at reducing congestion, it emerged today. Radical proposals for 19 separate schemes on Britain's motorways are currently under consideration. Twelve of these will include widening the roads to four lanes. The plans could see parts of the M60 near Manchester, the M1 near Wakefield and the M25 around London switched to 'managed motorways'. While the A14 from Rugby to Felixstowe would be hived off to private firms to convert to a toll road. Congestion: Traffic moves along the M1 close to junction 10, where part of the motorway could be widened by opening up the hard shoulder . But the plans would mean constant monitoring of the roads through a network of CCTV cameras and desk-workers. Road controllers would be employed to communicate with drivers through digital road signs. Lanes would also be opened and closed depending on the amount of traffic. Hundreds of new speed cameras would be rolled out, in addition to magnetic devices that measure the amount of cars and their speeds. The idea is that sudden changes in traffic flow would be recognised and lanes could be closed or reopened. The extra lanes have also been outlined for the M1 between junction 10 and 13 in Bedfordshire, junction 28 and 31 in Derbyshire, junction 32 to 35a in Sheffield and Junction 39 to 42 in Wakefield. The M4 in Bristol could see the hard shoulder used between junction 19 and 20 while the M5 could be opened up between 15 and 17. Plans: Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond is considering road changes . In Birmingham, the M6 between junctions 5 and 8 would be widened while the M25 will see changes betweenÂ  junctions 5 and 7 in Surrey and junctions 23 and 27 in Hertfordshire. Changes to the M60 in Manchester would be between junction 8 and 15 while the M62 would be widened between 18 and 20 and 25 and 30 in West Yorkshire. Proposals for changes to roads will be published by the national network this Autumn.Â  The statement will include measures that officials hope will bulldoze road and rail schemes through the planning system faster. Civil servants at the Department for Transport prefer the schemes over more expensive widening work or building new roads. But residents and environmental campaigners have reacted angrily to the plans. They claim that road congestion will increase. Stephen Joseph from the Campaign for Better Transport told the Sunday Times: 'Spending billions of expanding motorways simply shifts traffic jams to the bottleneck, generates extra traffic and causes environmental damage. 'The A14 toll road idea is especially barmy because the cost will push people onto country roads lanes. The M6 toll road has shown that such roads lose money.' The plans under consideration by Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond come after a trial on the M42 east of Birmingham where the hard shoulder was used. Traffic was managed and officials claim that accidents were reduced while the flow of vehicles improved. Jack Semple from the Road Haulage Association said: 'We have had a decade of a war on motorists but the more congested our roads becomes, the more it slows our economy.'","Road controllers will monitor cars through network of speed cameras .

The ten senior Sun employees arrested in the probe so far have included the deputy editor, the news editor, the paper's picture editor, its chief foreign correspondent and senior executives.

Mourners gathered in Harlem this morning to celebrate the life of famed soul food restaurant owner Sylvia Woods, who was remembered by famous patrons, neighbourhood locals, tourists, and friends as a welcoming trailblazer who turned her small eatery into a New York icon. Former president Bill Clinton was one of many to pay tribute, saying in a moving eulogy: âWhen people came to see me from all over America and the world and wanted to know what Harlem was like, I sent them to Sylvia's, and they were made to feel welcome and at home.â Mrs Woods died last week at the age of 86 after battling with Alzheimerâs disease, and ran Sylviaâs until she retired at the age of 80. Paying tribute: Former President Bill Clinton spoke late in the funeral for Sylvia Woods, saying that he always sent those from out-of-town to Sylvia's Restaurant so they would feel 'welcome and at home' Spreading Harlem to the world: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke during a public service for Sylvia Woods, praising her dedication to the Harlem community . Smiles: Former New York City Mayor David Dinkins gives a thumbs-up while speaking, wearing a double-breasted pinstripe suit and colourful bow-tie . New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg also spoke kind words of Mrs Wood, praising her dedication to Harlem as a community, and her charity. 'She brought the world to Harlem, and she made sure that the world took Harlem back home with them,' he said at the public service and wake at Abyssinian Baptist Church. 'That's the Sylvia we'll remember, and though they called her the Queen of Soul Food, it was her warmth, her grace and her generosity that truly made her royalty,' Mr Bloomberg said. David Dinkins, who served as New Yorkâs mayor in the early 90s, said Sylvia's Restaurant 'is more than a business; it is a testament to our tradition, a comfort zone, a home away from home.' He said her customers also were her neighbours 'who needed a place to celebrate special occasions or simply a place to enjoy friends over a great meal.' He called Mrs Woods 'a friend, a mother, a grandmother, a matriarch of a community. She put her soul in the soul food.' Celebrated: Sylvia Woods, centre, seen in 2002, moves to the music outside her restaurant, Sylvia's, during the restaurant's 40th anniversary celebration; the restaurant recently celebrated its 50th anniversary . Institution: Sylvia's became a Harlem institution after opening its doors in 1962, founded by Mrs Sylvia Woods . Mrs Woods once said that her restaurant, with its purple awnings and flashing lights and located at 127th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard, is more than just a place to eat. âIf you come alone, youâre never going to dine alone,â she once said. 'She brought the world to Harlem, and she made sure that the world took Harlem back home with them.' -New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg . The Rev Al Sharpton once said that Sylviaâs was âmore than a restaurant, it has been a meeting place for black America.â Food critic Gael Greene, a co-founder of the Citymeals-on-Wheels food delivery service, said that when she first went to Sylvia's in the late 1970s, 'it was not an era when downtowners coolly trekked up to Harlem for fun ... but off we went for glorious ribs and transcendent candied sweets, and there she was, a sweet-faced little woman in a rumpled apron, behind the counter, grinning.' Mrs Woods and her husband, Herbert, natives of South Carolina who met as children, started Sylvia's in 1962. Remembering: Cooks from Sylvia's walk past a casket bearing her body before a public service for Mrs Woods; she was remembered today by her patrons and friends as a warm and welcoming trailblazer .

Family ties: Michaella Phillips, right, a grand-daughter of Sylvia Woods, becomes emotional as she sings during her grandmother's service . The restaurant is a Harlem fixture, with tourists and locals going there for the traditional Southern food staples of cornbread, ribs, collard greens, and fried chicken. The restaurant is also a magnate for politicians. President Barack Obama made frequent visits to the Harlem institution while on the campaign trail. Mr Clinton also frequented the restaurant. On Tuesday, mourners filed past an open casket. Mrs Woods was laid out in a cream-colored brocade suit. The altar was adorned with white flowers: roses, orchids and calla lilies. A Harlem block was closed by barricades, with police keeping very tight security as a line-up of black limousines arrived for the service. A horse-drawn carriage took her casket in a procession to the restaurant. Mourners arrived dressed in their Sunday best, many in black. 'She was our shining start,' said Audrey Quintano, who worked for Woods as her executive catering chef in the 1990s and is now preparing to open her own restaurant. Ms Quintano said that 'Miss Sylvia' was her mentor and that Herbert and Sylvia Woods provided a wonderful example of a happy marriage. 'He would act as if he had just met her and he was 19,' Ms Quintano said. 'They were the perfect couple.' Greeting: Former President Bill Clinton shakes hand with one of Sylvia's chefs as he exits the memorial service . Grand memorial: Sylvia Woods' casket is carried in a horse-drawn hearse by her former apartment in New York today . Decorated: Mrs Woods' casket was pulled by two white horses ornamented with purple plumes; calla lilies rested on top of her hearse . Preparation: Police barricades are set out in front of Abyssinian Baptist Church ahead of Mrs Woods' funeral; the church is located in Harlem . Yvonne Maddox, a frequent customer and neighbourhood resident, said, 'I've known her 17 years. 'She inspired all of us, especially women. Running a business must not have been easy for a black lady 50 years ago and at the same time raising a beautiful family.' From its start as a restaurant, Sylvia's has grown to include multiple cookbooks and a nationwide line of food products. The restaurant marked its 50th anniversary in August. Mrs Woods officially stepped down from running the restaurant when she was 80, leaving it in the hands of her children and grandchildren. Herbert Woods died in 2001. Another service is scheduled for Wednesday at Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon, where Woods lived, just north of New York City. Saddened: Rev.

Battle: For years Caroline Dowdall struggled with a phobia of vomit, so much so she would starve and drug her own children . A womanâs extreme fear of vomit led to her starving her young children in case food would make them sick. Caroline Dowdall would even give her three sons car sickness drugs before long journeys to ensure that they would not throw up. The 54-year-oldâs emetophobia controlled her life during her sonsâ childhoods as she was too scared to feed them more than a basic diet of rice, toast and the occasional boiled egg. Carolineâs battle with emetophobia - the irrational fear of vomit - began when she was eight and her pregnant aunt was sick on her during a car journey. âIt . was a hot sticky day and I was horrified,â Caroline explains. âIt was . of course an accident but the smell repulsed me and after that I began . to actively avoid people who I thought might vomit.â At . school she avoided pupils who had been off sick as well as the canteen, . which she considered a high risk area, and feared pregnant women. She . would cross the street if saw a woman she suspected was pregnant and as . she got older and her friends became pregnant she would simply cut them . out of her life. âI lost friends because it would be too stressful otherwise,â she says. When Caroline herself fell pregnant at the age of 20, she lied to midwives to obtain medication to prevent her from . being sick. âI said I had terrible morning sickness, thankfully I hadnât . but I wanted to take something to prevent me getting it.â Despite warnings of side effects she took the medication throughout her pregnancy and gave birth to first son Anthony. She was a happy mother to a healthy baby boy, but it did not take long before the phobia took control of her parenting. âAt first it was OK, the baby sick didnât really smell of anything and there wasnât much. The real anxiety came when it was time to wean him because I knew that once he was on solid food he would produce what I called âproper vomit.ââ Controlled: Caroline, pictured with her oldest sons Anthony and Philip,Â  was so terrified of vomit that she would not give her sons any food she thought might make them sick and they grew up on a diet of toast, rice and eggs . After pressure from her partner a reluctant Caroline agreed he should be on solids. âI only gave him food I was happy wouldnât make him sick and tiny amounts too.â It was the same routine when his brothers Philip and Tim were born. By then her first marriage had ended and Caroline had remarried, again managing to keep her phobia a secret. Dinner for her sons was often toast and occasionally a boiled egg. âIt would break my heart when they asked for dessert as I considered sweet foods to pose the highest risk and so I always lied and said we didnât have any. âIf they wanted snacks I gave them crackers and other meals were limited to plain rice and chicken, easy to digest and always well cooked.â Enough to survive: Caroline justified her children's low calorie intake of a few hundred a day with the argument that they had more than children in other parts of the world . Shockingly, Caroline also kept their portions tiny, fearing that overfeeding them could induce sickness. âThey . were probably on just a few hundred calories a day. At most meal times . they would ask for more like Oliver Twist. It was awful. âIt . broke my heart when they said their tummies hurt. I knew it was because . they were hungry but I was so scared of not being able to cope if they . were sick I never relented. âI knew they had enough to survive on and reasoned that they still ate more than a lot of children in the world.â Thankfully her sons grew into healthy boys and in the mid-eighties Caroline attempted to seek help. But when she saw her GP she was ushered out of the door and in her desperation Caroline turned to alcohol to cope. âI was left to cope in the only way I knew how. On the rare occasion that any of her kids were sick she downed Brandy to give her the courage to clean it up. âI still couldnât cuddle them or hold them in the way a mum should if they were sick. And I would swig alcohol believing it might stop me from catching whatever bug they had by killing the germs.â Finally free: Caroline, pictured on holiday in Florida with her husband John, eventually began to deal with her phobia when she came clean to her family about her behaviour . Holidays were also a nightmare, as she could not bear to watch them on funfair rides and feared travel sickness. âThankfully my parents were always keen to take them on holiday so I managed to avoid it most of the time.â But when she did have to take the boys somewhere by car Caroline resorted to shocking methods to prevent sickness. âI would drug them with travel sickness pills that caused drowsiness. If they were asleep then they couldnât vomit,â she says. When they grew older she would pay them to take the drugs, despite them not even feeling sick. âThen they would close their eyes for the rest of the journey and I could relax and get us there without worrying.â Coping: Caroline now lives in Spain and can enjoy meals in restaurants and time with her grandchildren without fear . Caroline . calls her actions during these years âtruly awful and unspeakable . behaviour for a motherâ but says the phobia was in control of her life. âItâs very hard to distinguish right from wrong, you are just trying to get through the day in any way you can. âI loved them dearly and I didnât want them taken off me.â She says: âMy phobia stopped me being a good mother. But Iâm adamant that I will not let it stop me being a good grandmother. 'My sons are now old enough to understand why I acted the way I did when they were little.â Eventually Caroline divorced again and met third husband John. By then two of her sons had become fathers and Caroline was already starting to avoid the babies through fear they would be sick. âI knew I had been a terrible mother and I didnât want to repeat my mistakes but I could feel history was repeating. 'I was desperate to be a good grandmother and have my grandchildren come to stay but once again my fear was controlling my life.â Eventually she broke down and admitted to her husband why she was so afraid of spending time with her grandchildren. âIt was the first time anyone had listened and understood. He promised to help me and I donât know it is simply a case of sharing the load, but since I started being honest with my family I feel more in control. âMy family was relieved, my odd behaviour over the past 46 years finally made sense and I have said sorry to my sons. âI was determined fear would not stop me being a grandmother.' Now Caroline can spend time with her grandchildren and even enjoy a meal in a restaurant and has written a book about her journey. âThere are other sufferers out there, and I want them to know they are not alone. âNow itâs still a struggle but itâs much easier. Thereâs a long way to go but I will get there.'","Caroline Dowdall kept her children on a strict diet of a few hundred calories a day to keep them from being sick .

Passengers aboard an easyJet flight claim they had to organise an impromptu whip-round to persuade people to disembark after the pilot said they couldn't take off because there were too many heavy men on board. The 7.05am flight from Liverpool's John Lennon Airport to Geneva was delayed by an hour-and-a-half because the plane was 300kg overweight due to an 'exceptionally high proportion of male passengers'.

Mr . Lay said a group of passengers at the front of the plane made up the . compensation to Â£200 per person which was enough to persuade four . passengers off the flight. He said the rest of the passengers then had a whip-round to help reimburse the out-of-pocket passengers at the front. easyJet said the plane was over regulatory limits due to there being an ""exceptionally high proportion of male passengers'. Whip-round: Passengers on board said they had to organise a whip-round as the airline was only offering Â£100 compensation which was not enough to persuade people to disembark .

An indoor house cat made an incredible journey after disappearing on a family outing and returning to her hometown by traveling about 200 miles over two months. Holly, a 4-year-old tortoiseshell, was separated from her owners Jacob and Bonnie Richter at an R.V. rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, in early November. Two months later, on New Yearâs Eve, Holly was found in a familyâs backyard about a mile from the Richtersâ house in West Palm Beach. She was weak and emaciated. Separated: Holly, a 4-year-old tortoiseshell house cat, was separated from her owners Jacob and Bonnie Richter at an R.V. rally in Daytona Beach, Florida, in early November . Reunited: Two months later, on New Year's Eve, Holly was found in a family's backyard about a mile from her owners Jacob and Bonnie Richter Richters' house in West Palm Beach . The Richters cried when they saw Holly, who instantly relaxed when placed on Mr Richterâs shoulder. Her owners are still unsure of how she found her way home. âHer pads on her feet were bleeding,â Ms Richter said. âHer claws are worn weird. The front ones are really sharp, the back ones worn down to nothing.â Even scientists are baffled by how the house cat managed to travel nearly 200 miles back home. âAre you sure itâs the same cat?â John Bradshaw, director of the University of Bristolâs Anthrozoology Institute, told the New York Times. In other cases where missing cats allegedly were found by their owners weeks and months after disappearing, Bradshaw has suspected, âthe cats are just strays, and the people have got kind of a mental justification for expecting it to be the same cat.â But in addition to the unique black-and-brown harlequin patterns on Hollyâs fur, she also had an implanted microchip to allow people to identify her. âI really believe these stories, but theyâre just hard to explain,â said Marc Bekoff, a behavioral ecologist at the University of Colorado. âMaybe being street-smart, maybe reading animal cues, maybe being able to read cars, maybe being a good hunter. I have no data for this.â Long journey: Holly traveled 200 miles from Dayton Beach back home to West Palm Beach . Dr. Bradshaw says Holly may have gotten a lift and perhaps hid under the hood of a truck heading down Florida's I-95. However, the condition of her paws suggests Holly was not driven the entire 200 miles, nor did she travel easily. Scientists say it is more common, although still rare, to hear of dogs returning home. Dr. Bradshaw said dogs may have inherited their genetic relative wolvesâ ability to navigate using magnetic clues. It is also possible that dogs get taken on more family outings, and that lost dogs are more easily noticed by people along the way, scientists say. Cats, on the other hand, typically navigate well around familiar landscapes, memorizing locations by sight and smell, Dr. Bradshaw told the New York Times. All in all though, there is little scientific knowledge about cat navigation. Migratory animals such as birds, turtles and insects have been studied more closely. Many of them use magnetic fields or orientation by the sun to navigate. Holly the house cat hardly seemed an adventurous wanderer, her owners say, though her bloodline may have given her a genetic advantage. Her mother was a feral cat that had been roaming the Richtersâ mobile home park, and Holly was born inside somebodyâs air-conditioner. At about six weeks old, Holly padded into their carport and jumped into the lap of Mr. Richterâs mother, Ms Richter said.

A British woman sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail after being found guilty of having drunken sex in the back of a taxi has said it is not fair she has had 'to rot' in the country 'for something I didn't do'. Rebecca Blake, who turns 30 today, finds out tomorrow whether she will go to jail or be deported after appealing her initial sentence. She is currently on bail along with Irishman Conor McRedmond, with whom she was caught. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Convicted: Rebecca Blake was sentenced to three months in jail after being found guilty of having sex in the taxi, but was bailed until the outcome of the appeal . Distraught: The 30-year-old broke down as she spoke of her ordeal since she was accused of the crime in Dubai . He was also convicted, received the same sentence, despite DNA tests to find evidence of intercourse coming back negative, and has appealed along with Blake. Speaking to ITV Daybreak, she said she was finding it hard to prepare herself for what will happen if the appeal does not go her way. She said: 'Unfortunately Iâm in a situation where Iâve got these allegations against me and I didnât do it so I donât think itâs fair that Iâve had to rot over here with no form of income, no medical insurance for something I didnât do.' The recruitment consultant, from Dorking in Surrey, was arrested on May 4 after meeting McRedmond just hours earlier. Their taxi driver alerted police after allegedly spotting her in his rearview mirror with her top off, straddling McRedmond and âmaking the sounds of a woman having sexâ. Blake, who moved to Dubai in September last year to take up a Â£100,000-a-year-post at Manpower recruitment firm, had been at a drink-all-you-like Â£35-a-head brunch in the Rotana Hotel. Accused: Rebecca Blake, left, and Conor McRedmond, right, denied having sex in the back of a Dubai taxi in May, but admitted to indulging in an all-day drinking binge . Hearing: Ms Blake, left, wore a hjab to court. She and Mr McRedmond from Tullamore, County Offaly, were arrested on May 4 . She told Daybreak she had been at the brunch with McRedmond, who she 'kind of knew', before the pair got into a taxi where they got into a heated row with the driver. She said: 'Next thing I know he has pulled up in front of a police patrol car, gets out the taxi and talks to the policeman.' She went on to say at that point she was not scared as she thought it was just an argument. But she said: 'Next thing I know he gets in the taxi and drives us to the police station. 'Yeah it wasnât nice because then it dawns on you ""wow you know Iâm in the Middle East, Iâm in trouble"", it was about midnight or one in the morning by the time Iâd had my breathalyser and everything. 'I just thought Iâd wake up in the morning and hopefully Iâd get to go home.' Embarrassing: Rebecca Blake has said how difficult it has been to tell her parents of the charges . Blake said she did not know why the taxi driver would lie, although she added she had been told by her lawyer incidents like this were common, but her case had received the attention as she was from the UK. She went on to say how difficult it had been to tell her parents of the charges. She said: 'Itâs not nice to have your daughter accused of those things and itâs also embarrassing for them. 'Obviously theyâve got to read it in the papers, when my dad goes to his local pub for example everyone sort of stops talking and makes him feel uncomfortable. 'Itâs been really hard for them as well.' During the hearing Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29, told the court in a statement the couple seemed confused and McRedmond swigged from a bottle. He said: âI told him it was not allowed to have alcohol inside the taxi. âThe next thing, I looked in the mirror and saw the woman sitting on the manâs thighs. She was naked, moving up and down and making sounds.â Mr Khan said he pulled over, spotted a police patrol and called over Emirati officer Abdullah Obaid Khamis, 22, who said he found the pair still having sex. Mr Khamis said: âThe manâs shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear.â The taxi driver claimed Blake offered him âa lot of moneyâ to tell prosecutors the pair were kissing rather than having sex but he refused. Sentenced: Rebecca Blake, left, and Conor McRedmond, centre, walk with their lawyer Shaker al-Shammary outside the Dubai Courts in November . The coupleâs defence lawyer said there were gaping inconsistencies in the witness accounts. He also said the pair could not have been having sex because Blake was on her period at the time, adding: âThis is Dubai, not a mosque. Everyone drinks.â Neither witness gave evidence in the trial. Their statements were instead submitted to judges in the misdemeanours court. Blake and McRedmond denied having consensual sex and indecency. They previously pleaded guilty to consuming alcohol and were fined Â£512.

The fearsome arsenal, which even includes a gold-plated axe, was put on display yesterday by West Midlands Police as part of a new anti-weapons campaign. Other dangerous arms featured in the grim haul are nunchuks, knuckle dusters, a giant flick knife and crude planks of wood with nails hammered into them.

Britain is to send spy planes, unmanned drones and special forces to Mali to âfind and dismantleâ the Al Qaeda network behind the slaughter in Algeria. In an escalation of the UKâs support for French forces fighting the militants in the African country, David Cameron said he would commit âintelligence and counter terrorism assetsâ. The Prime Minister said the UK must âact with an iron resolveâ to tackle what he called a âgenerational struggleâ against the âscourge of terrorismâ after the Algerian attack. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron used a statement in the Commons to warn Britain had to 'tackle this poisonous thinking at home and abroad' At a meeting of the National Security . Council today, Mr Cameron is set to approve plans to send manned . Sentinel R1 spy planes and Reaper drones to operate in the skies over . Mali from an American base in neighbouring Burkina Faso. They will target Al Qaeda affiliated . groups including the Blood Battalion, led by one-eyed Mokhtar Belmokhtar . and behind the atrocities at the BP gas facility. Mr Cameron will also give the green . light to sending around 20 soldiers â including members of the SAS â to . join a 500-strong force to train Malian troops and provide force . protection. The UK is also considering offering . to refuel French fighter aircraft with VC10 and Tristar planes operating . out of Gibraltar and Cyprus. Mr Cameron said Britain was 'in the midst of a generational struggle against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the Islamic faith' And two C-17 transport aircraft, . already ferrying French hardware to the war zone, will be made available . for several months if necessary. The Prime Minister explained he is . prepared to commit military assets because the Sahel region of Northern . Africa is âbecoming a magnet for jihadists who pose a threat to . Britainâ. âThis murderous violence requires a strong security response,â he said. âWe will contribute British . intelligence and counter-terrorism assets to an international effort to . find and dismantle the network that planned and ordered the brutal . assault.â But a ComRes poll for ITV News last . night suggested Mr Cameron has not yet secured public backing for . another foreign military adventure that already shows signs of âmission . creepâ. By a margin of 36 per cent to 23 per . cent, voters think events in Mali could threaten Britain, but just 18 . per cent want to see British ground troops committed to the fight. Just one in four voters says the UK . should offer whatever military support is necessary and 41 per cent . think Britain should not play âany roleâ. In a stark warning, Mr Cameron told MPs: âTogether with our partners in the region, we are in the midst of a generational struggle against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the Islamic faith, and which holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but necessary. âWe must tackle this poisonous thinking at home and abroad and resist the ideologues' attempt to divide the world into a clash of civilisations.â He said Britain must pursue a âpatient, intelligent but tough approachâ to defeat terrorism and ensuring national security. He warned a military response would not be sufficient, and urged governments in north and west Africa to work together to defeat terrorist 'franchises' in the region. Mr Cameron promised that during the UK's chairmanship of the G8 this year he would put 'terrorism and how we respond to it... right at the top of the agenda'. He told MPs that there . were 800 . employees working at the In Amenas site at the time of the attack, . including around 135 foreign nationals. At least 12 were killed with at . least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead, he said. 'The Algerian Prime Minister has said . today 37 foreign hostages were killed. The number of terrorists was . over 30. Most were killed during the incident but a small number are in . Algerian custody.' The first of the British victims to . be officially named was 46-year-old Paul Morgan, reported to be a former . Foreign Legion soldier and Gulf War veteran who was in charge of . security at the In Amenas plant. Mr Morgan was described by his mother . Marianne, 65, and partner Emma Steele, 36, as a 'true gentleman' who . died doing the job he loved. Kenneth Whiteside, a 59-year-old from . Glenrothes, Fife, who lived in Johannesburg with his wife and two . daughters, and Garry Barlow, 49, a married father of two from Liverpool, . who was a system supervisor for BP at the In Amenas plant, were also . killed. A further three Britons are believed . to be dead, Mr Cameron said, along with Carlos Estrada, a Colombian . executive for BP who lived in Chelsea. 'Now our most vital work is bringing home those who died. An international team of British, American and Norweigian experts is in close co-operation with the Algerian ministry of justice undertaking the task of formally identifying their bodies,' he said. 'We want this process to happen as swiftly as possible but it will involve some intensive forensic and policing work and so may take some time.' All 22 British . nationals caught up in the attack who either escaped or were freed have . been safely returned to Britain, to be debriefed by the police and, of . course, reunited with their families. Terrifying: This image shows the moment that workers were first taken captive by Al Qaeda terrorists at the remote plant in Algeria . There was a marked change of tone from Mr Cameron's statement on Friday, when he made clear his unhappiness at not being informed by the Algerian PM about a rescue attempt until it was underway. Mr Cameron said: 'I am sure the House will understand the challenges that Algeria faced in dealing with over 30 terrorists bent on killing innocent people in a large and extremely remote and dangerous industrial complex. 'This would have been a most demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said the attack in Algeria was 'pre-meditated, cold-blooded murder of the most brutal kind'. 'And . behind each lost life is a family of loved ones who are in our thoughts . today.' He said the new threat facing the West . was 'more decentralised, more fragmented' and 'taking advantage of the . ungoverned spaces and security vacuum in parts of North Africa'.

The Deputy Prime Minister repeated his attack on Mr Cameronâs âvagueâ promise of a renegotiation of Britain's membership of the European Union, claiming it would damage jobs and growth. But he insisted he did not object to a referendum âin principleâ as Business Secretary Vince Cable predicted the British public would vote to stay in the EU. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg used his weekly radio phone-in to reveal he would not block David Cameron's EU referendum in the event of a new coalition in 2015 . Mr Cameron used his long-awaited speech yesterday to announce plans to start drawing up legislation for a referendum and renegotiating powers from Brussels before putting a fresh settlement to the people before 2017. Today the PM met some of the European leaders face-to-face at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. His speech to the gathering of political, economic and business leaders focused on Britain's priorities for its 12-month presidency of the G8, including counter-terrorism, tax and transparency. But he touched on the European question, insisting that his EU policy was ânot about turning our backs on Europe - quite the oppositeâ. Mr Cameron used a speech at the World Economic Forum today to insist he was not turning his back on Europe . David Cameron was today was branded . 'Europe's Scaredy-cat' in an editorial by the German news magazine . Spiegel over his plans for an EU referendum. In an online piece published today, it was claimed the PMâs pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 was driven by âfearâ. âFear . of his party, fear of voters, and fear of the EU itself, which he . neither fully understands nor has ever really been interested in,â it . said.It claims his . long-awaited speech on Europe was âboringâ and was âan attempt to shake . off a troublesome issue by postponing it to a later dateâ. âHe . wants Europe to be a free trade zone with beach access. He missed an . opportunity on Wednesday to haul Britain back to the centre of Europe. âApart . from vague demands like competitiveness, flexibility and fairness, he . has no idea how the EU should develop. âHis thinking on Europe is . indecisive and chained to the present. 'What . Europe witnessed on Wednesday was a speech delivered by a politician . prone to knee-jerk reactions who lacks values or a vision. He lacks . gravity. Cameron floats above Europe like an astronaut.â He said: âThis is about how we make the case for a more competitive, more open and more flexible Europe and how we secure the UK's place in it.â Setting out his case for reform of the EU, Mr Cameron added: âIt is not just right for the United Kingdom, it is necessary for Europe. âEurope is being out-competed, out-invested, out-innovated and it is time we made the EU an engine for growth, not a cause of cost for businesses and complaint for its citizens.â The speech came shortly after Mr Clegg repeated his criticism that delaying a referendum for five years created âuncertainty which could deter investors from setting up businesses in Britain. âI simply donât understand the point of spending years and years, and years tying yourself up in knots first, so called ârenegotiatingâ the terms of Britainâs membership in ways that at the moment at least, are completely vague,â Mr Clegg said during his weekly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3. âThat discourages investment and inhibits growth and jobs, which has to remain our absolute priority at a time when the economy is still struggling to recover.â Labour leader Ed Miliband yesterday told MPs: âNo, we don't want an in-out referendum.' But Mr Clegg insisted he was not opposed to a referendum in theory: âItâs not the principle of a referendum. Iâve got absolutely no fear of a referendum at all.â With opinion polls pointing to a possible hung parliament at the 2015 general election, Mr Cameron made clear delivering a referendum would be a deal breaker in any new coalition. Mr Clegg made clear the Lib Dems would not block it. âIf a coalition is necessary following the votes of the British people then weâll play our part,â he said. It follows former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy saying he could not envisage his party agreeing to a referendum if the Conservatives failed to win a majority at the next election and wanted to form another coalition. But Business Secretary Vince Cable today insisted the Liberal Democrats have no quarrel with a referendum. He said he and his party were confident Britain would remain within the EU, and that the public would make sure of it. 'We have no quarrel with the principle of a referendum and indeed, Parliament in the UK has recently voted for the conditions under which a referendum will happen,' Mr Cable said during a trip to Dublin. 'I am pretty confident that the British people, when it comes to it, will support it. They have to engage in that debate now and make sure it's won.'","Lib Dem leader says he does not object to a referendum in principle .

A total of 41 people were injured when the two trains collided shortly before 9am in the Penzing district in the west of the Austrian capital. Emergency services said yesterday that two of those injured, including one of the train drivers, were in a 'life-threatening' condition in hospital. Scroll down for video . Crash: Two packed commuter trains collided head on in the Austrian capital Vienna . Rescue effort: Commuters are helped from the wreckage of the train by emergency services personnel following the crash . Injured: A commuter is stretchered away from the scene of the crash which saw 41 people hurt in total . Huge operation: Firefighters and emergency medical services work at the scene in Vienna . A huge rescue operation saw 25 fire engines, a helicopter and a special 'accident train' rescue the injured, with many having to be pulled from the wreckage using special cranes. Emergency services spokesman Ronald Packert said: 'One good thing was that the crash happened right next to an emergency services station, meaning that our people were there in seconds.' One of the five seriously injured passengers was trapped and had to be cut free by firefighters. It took almost two hours to evacuate the two trains. The cause of the crash was initially thought to have been a technical fault that caused both trains to be heading towards each other on the same track. Head on: The two trains were heading towards each other on the same stretch of track in the west of the city . Hurt: Rescuers come to the aid of one injured person, five were seriously hurt in all with two people said to be in a 'life threatening' condition . Point of impact: An injured person is carried past the front of the two wrecked S45 trains yesterday . Austrian Railways spokesman Sarah Nettel said: 'One of the trains received a signal to proceed that it shouldn't have.' But a later statement issued by OBB, Austria's state railway, said early investigations showed that a supervisor neglected to trip a signal after manually activating a rail switch. The switch usually works automatically and sets off the signal but was stuck due to snow and ice. Had the switch been activated, one of the trains would have been instructed to wait on a separate track until the other had gone past. Last September a train derailed in the same area, without causing any injuries. An inquiry blamed human error for that incident after a rail worker switched a point the wrong way. Wrecked: Investigators assess the damage suffered by the two trains which collided in the Austrian capital .

Britain's baffling tax system should be radically simplified to help pensioners, the Government's tax advisers said yesterday . Britain's baffling tax system should be radically simplified to help pensioners, the Governmentâs taxÂ  advisers said yesterday. The Office of Tax Simplification wants older people to receive a colour-coded letter each year that will clearly explain all their tax codes, in a victory for a long-running Money Mail campaign. The OTS slammed the current system that bombards pensioners with different tax codes, leaving them unsure how much tax they should pay. The codes, which consist of a series of letters and numbers that few people except accountants understand, dictate how much money one can receive before paying tax. As a result, many get a nasty shock when they open a letter from HM Revenue and Customs demanding taxes they did not know they owed. The OTSâs report, published yesterday after an 18-month investigation, said it is wrong that retirement for many pensioners means a move from âsimple to complexâ tax affairs. It follows a long- running Money Mail campaign to make the tax system easier for pensioners to navigate. Many people are never responsible for their tax affairs when they were working, under the pay-as-you-earn system. As a result, when they retire they are often overwhelmed by HMRC sending them different tax codes for each source of income, such as their pensions and interest from savings. The OTS has now proposed a new âForm P2Câ letter for pensioners, which would âoutline the code for each source of incomeâ that will apply to the following tax year. Its report states: âThis would enable pensioners to check more easily that their tax affairs were correct and would reduce the anxiety of receiving multiple [tax code] notices without a clear understanding of how they are connected.â It is also calling for a new âDWP60â form to be sent every April, which would explain how much pensioners should have been taxed on their income in the previous tax year. In a controversial move, it has also proposed that the 10 per cent savings rate, which allows people to pay lower tax on savings income of up to Â£2,710 a year, should be scrapped. The OTS has now proposed a new 'Form P2C' letter for pensioners, which would 'outline the code for each source of income' that will apply to the following tax year . The OTS says it should be removed because âawareness and claim levels are so low that it is ineffective in incentivising savingsâ â but HMRC figures show around 525,000 people, including many pensioners, claim the rebate, worth about Â£90 a year. The OTS called for the annual tax-free Isa limit, currently Â£11,280 for a share-based account, to be given a one-off increase to offset the impact of this change. It has not proposed how big this should be, but Mike Warburton, of the OTSâs consulting committee, said there is a âgood argumentâ for a Â£5,000 rise. The OTS was set up in July 2010, soon after the Coalition came to power. Its proposals must be approved by the Chancellor, who could announce his decision in the Budget in March. A Treasury spokesman said: âThe Government is committed to simplifying the tax system and ensuring it is straightforward and easy to comply with. We will respond to [the OTSâs] recommendations at the appropriate time.â Tax for pensioners is a minefield. The gradual introduction of allowances, credits, tax breaks and new rates have made the system convoluted and complicated. Every year, thousands are landed with shock bills because HMRC has failed to deduct the right amount of money from their income. In 2011, Money Mail handed a dossier of complaints about the system to John Whiting, the top accountant who was appointed head of the Office of Tax Simplification. Every year, thousands are landed with shock bills because HMRC has failed to deduct the right amount of money from their income . This described how the retired were baffled that the state pension is taxable, but paid without tax being deducted. There was also huge confusion over the 10p tax rate paid on up to Â£2,710 of savings interest. But by far the biggest problem stemmed from the reams of tax codes sent out by HMRC every year. A typical pensioner may have two company pensions, the state pension, and income from savings; there will be different codes for each, which may change two or three times a year. Workers who have spent their whole life in the PAYE system are suddenly expected to understand these, and know when they are wrong. Itâs like learning a new language late in life. The proposal to clarify tax codes is a giant stride to making life easier. It will give pensioners a clearer picture of how much tax they are paying, and help to spot mistakes earlier. It should also cut down on unexpected bills which many struggle to pay. However, in calling for the end of the 10p rate of tax on savings income, the OTS is in danger of stripping away benefits from pensioners at a time when their incomes are already severely squeezed â as it did when it proposed the removal of higher tax-free allowances for the over-65s, a policy that became known as the âgranny taxâ. The OTS says the 10p rate is too complex, and that the Â£50million it costs should be spent on higher Isa allowances for everyone. However, 525,000 save an average of Â£90 a year because of the 10p rate. Scrapping it would mean taking cash from pensioners, and sharing it with everyone else. That is no reward for a lifetime spent saving. Hopefully, the Chancellor will realise that on this occasion, simpler is not better, and reject another stealth tax hike on the prudent.","Office of Tax Simplification wants older .

The last minute dash to secure tickets to one of America's biggest sporting tournaments has begun after the two teams to play in this year's Super Bowl have been revealed. Fans of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens who hadn't already purchased tickets are now doing all they can to try and secure passes to see their teams in action. And with just two weeks to go before the big game, a single ticket is selling for an average $3,000. Winning moment: San Francisco 49ers celebrate after their 28-24 win against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship game on Sunday, which will see them compete in the Super Bowl final . The finalists: Baltimore Ravens players cheer after beating the New England Patriots in Foxborough to advance to Super Bowl XLVII . The prices have shot up from around $2,000 on Sunday morning, just a few hours before the final playoff games determined who would be going head to head in Super Bowl 2013. Director of data and communications at ticket website TiqIQ, Chris Matcovich, told ABC News the match will be a 'golden game' for ticket sales for two reasons. One is that the two teams are coached by two brothers - Jim Harbaugh with the 49ers and his brother John Harbaugh with the Ravens - has added an extra twist to this Super Bowl. Second, is that the 49ers - who haven't won a Super Bowl since 1995 - has a large fan base in San Francisco who may be happy to travel to New Orleans to see their team's triumphant return. Some brotherly competition: Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, left, and San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh, right, will see their teams go head-to-head in the Super Bowl . Long time coming: The San Francisco 49ers last played in the Super Bowl against the San Diego Chargers back in 1995, pictured above . Mr Matcovich told ABC News: 'At the end of the day, marketers and ticket sellers are hoping for a good game and praying for the right teams.' The official list prices for the Super Bowlâs upper bowl, lower bowl and club seats are $850, $950 and $1,250 respectively for 2013. But any fan hoping to get their hands on a ticket now, will pay a minimum of $1,700, according to prices listed on TiqIQ. And if last year's prices are anything to go by, with an average ticket selling for $10,000, then the cost is going to just keep soaring until kick-off on February 3.

A woman caught up in the Algerian hostage crisis in which dozens died today described her daring escape - and her terrible fear that she would be raped. The French nurse, who asked to be described solely by her first name of Muriel, said that she 'refused to give up to terrorists'. In a deeply moving interview, Muriel said: 'At best, I'd get a bullet in the head straight away. At worst, as a woman - well, I don't need to draw you a picture.' Victim of cowardice: Algeria gas plant hostage survivor Joseph Balmaceda (pictured) tells how he was used as a human shield as helicopters attacked the Islamic militants . Lucky: Mr Balmaceda said he survived a bomb blast that killed nine hostages on a van because he was sadnwiched between two tyres . On the first day of the crisis last . Wednesday she heard a security alarm sounding as up to 40 al-Qaeda . gunmen began to over-run the BP-run In Amanas BP gas installation, in . south east Algeria. Muriel . and three male colleagues immediately hid in their living quarters, . despite some thinking they should run away from the heavily armed . Islamists. 'Two of us wanted to try and get out, the two others said it was safer to stay,' Muriel told Paris's Europe 1 radio station. But . after hours of hiding away in terrified silence, Muriel suggested to . her fellow workers that it was time to get out of the complex. 'I told them we had to take our chance,' said Muriel. 'You can't submit to them, otherwise you are giving in to the terrorists. 'Even . with a little act, saying to yourself they are trying to capture me but . I won't let them succeed, you regain your identity,' she said. 'These people were ready to commit any kind of barbaric act but I succeeded in thwarting them.' Macabre clean-up: Firefighters and police officers transport bodies of victims of the hostage crisis to a hospital in In Amenas . Chain of events: Details of the death toll and missing workers are constantly changing this graphic give the latest information as of this morning . Using a pair of pliers which Muriel found in an ambulance on site, the escapees cut through a perimeter fence. They then disappeared into the desert, constantly fearing that the terrorists would capture them. She admitted she feared the worst as the noise of explosions and gunfire filled the air. Muriel . knew that being French made her a particular target because the . terrorists were trying to get French forces to pull out of neighboring . Mali, where an anti-terrorism war is currently taking place. 'I . said to myself they cannot find me, I am a women and I am French. With . what is happening in Mali they'll kill me immediately,' said Muriel. 'We . stayed hidden in the office for hours, jumping out of our skin at every . little noise. Every time we heard someone in the corridor, we said . ""that's it, the terrorists are coming to get us"". 'It . was our good fortune that they didn't come and search where we were, in . a little corner out of the way. But for those left behind it was really . awful.' It is not clear how many woman work at the plant, but BP told MailOnline that none of its 18 employees were female. The British firm said 14 staff had returned home safely, two had been killed and two were still unaccounted for. One-eyed fugitive: Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian who fought against Soviet forces in Afghanistan in the 1980s, has reportedly claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of up to 41 foreigners at an Algerian gas field . Armed to the teeth: The terrorists' weapons, recovered by Algerian special forces, included six machine guns, 21 rifles, two mortars with shells, two rocket-propelled grenade launchers and ten explosive belts . Meanwhile, another hostage has told how Islamic . militants used their captives as human shields to stop Algerian . helicopters from strafing them with gunfire. Father-of-four . Joseph Balmaceda said he saw one Japanese hostage draped with . explosives, while he and others had their hands bound with cable ties . during the ordeal at the In Amenas gas plant in the Sahara Desert. 'Whenever . government troops tried to use a helicopter to shoot at the enemy, we . were used as human shields,' the Filipino said shortly after arriving . back in Manila. 'We were told to raise our hands. The government forces could not shoot at them as long as we were held hostage.' Balmaceda, nursing abrasions to his . face and a loss of hearing, said he was the only survivor out of nine . hostages who were aboard a van that exploded, apparently from C-4 . explosives that the militants had rigged to the vehicle. Terrifying: This image shows the moment that workers were first taken captive by Al Qaeda terrorists at the remote plant in Algeria . Destroyed: Men look at the wreckage of a vehicle near In Amenas. Algerian bomb squads scouring the gas plant found numerous new bodies as they searched for explosive traps left behind . He said two militants were . transferring the nine hostages to the central facility of the gas plant, . but the bomb went off during a clash with Algerian security forces. 'The only thing left of the car was the back portion of the Land Cruiser,' said Balmaceda, 42. 'I . was the only one who survived because I was sandwiched between two . spare tyres. That is why I am still here and can talk to you.' Balmaceda said the two militants driving the vehicle were also killed. 'But (other) hostage-takers were firing at me. It meant there were other terrorists,' he said. 'So . I crawled about 300 metres to where the government forces were. And . when I reached them I fainted. When I woke up I was in the hospital.' David Cameron suggested there would be an expansion in British intelligence and special forces in order to combat the terror threat from Africa . The Al-Qaeda-linked 'Signatories in . Blood' group said it attacked the gas plant in retaliation for a French . military operation to evict Islamists from neighbouring Mali. Most hostages were freed on Thursday . in a first Algerian rescue operation, which was initially viewed by . foreign governments as hasty, before the focus of public condemnation . turned on the jihadists. Balmaceda . said the incident in which the vehicle exploded occurred on the second . day of the siege, apparently during the first rescue operation. The crisis ended on Saturday with a final assault by Algerian troops. Their accounts came as it emerged the siege was orchestrated by a Canadian. Documents . found on the bodies of two terrorists â one a ringleader â identified . them as Canadians and Western intelligence agencies were checking last . night whether either was âknownâ to them. Survivors have told how at least one of the kidnappers spoke perfect English in giving them orders. Both Canadians entered Algeria from Libya with members of the âBlood Battalionâ led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar. Their cars were painted in the colours of the Algerian state energy firm, Sonatrach. Only part of one of the menâs names â . âChedad,â which is Moroccan â was released yesterday but British . investigators were seeking to establish whether either Canadian had . spent time in Britain or had UK links. The development raises fears that the . Arab Spring has been a rallying call for extremists. Hundreds of . Britons and Westerners joined the fighting in the Middle East and North . Africa and some may have subsequently joined violent groups abroad or . terror gangs back home. Significantly, a Briton who is . believed to be an Islamic convert in his late 20s with blond hair and . blue eyes is said to have joined one-eyed Belmokhtarâs group last year. He is reported to have visited wounded jihadists at a hospital in . south-east Mali. And a second British jihadist linked . to the terror leader is said to be a Londoner, who was captured by the . Mauritanian authorities last month trying to cross into Mali. Investigators say the men are part of . a âsmall but increasing and significantâ number of Britons or foreign . nationals living in the UK and travelling to join extremist groups with . loose associations to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. It is thought Britons and other Europeans may have attended terror camps in the Sahel region to the south of the Sahara. The Canadian link has long been . feared, according to David Harris of the terrorist intelligence . programme at Insignis Strategic Research in Ottawa. He said the countryâs open borders . and dual language made it attractive to French-speaking immigrants from . North Africa. French anti-terrorism magistrate Jean-Louis BruguiÃ¨re has . called Montreal a hub of North African terrorism. Four years ago, a Canadian, Momin . Khawaja, was jailed for ten years for his part in planning a fertiliser . bomb plot in Britain for which five people were convicted in the UK. Remembered: Paul Thomas Morgan, 46, the first of the British victims of the hostage crisis in Algeria identified . Killed: Garry Barlow (left) and Kenneth Whiteside (right) also died at the oil plant . Khawaja, 33, made numerous trips from his home in Ottawa to London claiming to be seeking a wife. He was actually helping to plan the attack, which was foiled by British police. Algeriaâs prime minister yesterday . said 37 foreigners of eight nationalities and one Algerian worker were . killed during the hostage crisis. At least 29 militants also died. Abdelmalek Sellal, who strongly . defended the actions of his special forces in storming the BP plant, . said the terrorists had worn army uniforms, memorised the layout of the . vast complex and were intending to blow it up. The plant, which is vital to the Algerian economy, is expected to resume operations today. However, a spokesman for BP, which had 18 employees at the plant, said this was unlikely. He told MailOnline: 'I can't see how that could happen. We are not pushing to get it started. It 's a crime scene from the Metropolitan Police's point of view, so it is not a priority.' Jihadists yesterday threatened more hostage-taking unless Western powers leave Mali.

He is the president of Sinn Fein, hailed by many for helping to cement the IRAâs ceasefire in 1994. But one woman last night claimed Gerry Adams âbetrayedâ Republicans, sanctioned the bombing of London targets and ordered the kidnapping of several people thought by the IRA to be traitors. Convicted IRA bomber Dolours Price, 61, of Dublin, claims there is evidence of this in recordings which the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been trying to obtain from Boston College in the US. Convicted IRA bomber: Dolours Price, 61, of Dublin, claims there is evidence of this in recordings which the Police Service of Northern Ireland has been trying to obtain from Boston College in the US . The Massachusetts college made the tapes on the condition they would be kept secret until the 28 IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force terrorists who spoke had died, reported the Sunday Telegraph. But then a book based on recordings of two dead terrorists revealed that former IRA commander Brendan Hughes mentioned the âdisappearedâ - people killed by the IRA and buried in secret graves. He made the allegation that high-profile female murder victim Jean McConville, who died in 1972, was killed by the âunknownsâ squad, claiming: âGerry had control over this particular squad.â Miss Price and her sister Marian joined the IRA in the 1970s. Her sister once claimed her miniskirt got her past British Army officials in a car full of explosives. They had a Republican family tradition. Allegations: Dolours Price (left) and her sister Marian (right, in left), pictured in Belfast in 1972. Miss Price claims Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams (right) 'betrayed' Republicans and sanctioned the bombing of London targets . âMy father used to sit us on his knee and tell us stories about how he'd gone off to war in 1939 at the age of 19 to bomb the English,â Dolours Price told the Sunday Telegraph. 'He said: ""If anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now through the back door at 10 minute intervals"". The ones that were left were the ones that went' Dolours Price on Gerry Adams . She claimed to have told IRA commanders to target London - a plan presented to Mr Adams, who said, according to Miss Price, at a meeting to find volunteers, that it was a âbig, dangerous operationâ, adding: 'This could be a hanging job'. âHe said: âIf anyone doesn't want to go they should up and leave now through the back door at 10 minute intervalsâ,â she claimed to the Sunday Telegraph. âThe ones that were left were the ones that went.â There was firstly a failed attempt to bomb Oxford Street - followed by four car bombs targeting the Old Bailey, an Army recruiting office in Westminster, New Scotland Yard and Whitehall.

The Price sisters and their gang were arrested as they tried to get back to Ireland and were later jailed for life.

A leading surgeon befriended a wealthy and vulnerable widow before bleeding her of her Â£1m fortune, a hearing was told. Gabriella Adler-Jensen, 64, became an easy target for Dr Ashraf Kamal Elnazir after her elderly husband, Harry, died leaving her a Â£1.4m estate. Under the influence of the married father-of-three she âinvestedâ hundreds of thousands of pounds into a bank account to fund business deals. Dr Ashraf Kamal Elnazir (left) is accused of conning widow Gabriella Adler-Jensen (right) out of hundreds of thousands of pounds . Large sums of money were then allegedly transferred to other bank accounts across the world and the money gradually disappeared. A medical tribunal was told Mrs Adler-Jensen also treated Dr Elnazir, 54, to a lavish holiday to Dubai and also paid out for his sonsâ private education. On his suggestion she also bought the flat where he and his family lived in an exclusive block in West Kensington, London for Â£429,000, although the property had only been valued at Â£375,000. Last night the surgeon, a leading colonic specialist who worked at Londonâs Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, was asked to answer the claims. If they are found to be proved the doctor, who qualified in Khartoum, Sudan in 1985, could be struck off the medical register. At a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) the panel was told friendship blossomed between the widow and the surgeon after the death of her husband in 2001. They were living in the same smart block of flats, in Kensington, West London and grief-stricken by the loss of her 84-year-old husband she put her âtrust' in Dr Elnazir and turned to him for guidance. Under the surgeon's influence Mrs Adler-Jensen 'invested' hundreds of thousands of pounds into a bank account to fund business deals . But between 2002 and 2006 the married surgeon is said to have âmanipulatedâ Mrs Adler-Jensen into investing in dubious business and property ventures. In 2002 he allegedly suggested she buy the flat where he and his family lived but failed to transfer the whole property title to Mrs Adler-Jensen and instead retained joint legal and beneficial ownership of it. The following April, the surgeon formed a limited company with the widow and opened a joint HSBC account for the purpose of business investments. Between September 2003 and February 2006, she transferred around Â£779,000 into the joint account, but the doctor withdrew approximately Â£82,000 for his personal use. Ed Morgan, representing the General Medical Council (GMC), claimed there was no evidence that any business investments had taken place. The hearing was told in June 2004, the doctor and Mrs Adler-Jensen opened a joint HSBC US dollar account for the purpose of currency trading. Mrs Adler Jensen deposited Â£645,000 into the account and the doctor is said to have then organised three transfers: one in December 2004 for $20,000 (Â£12,500) to an account in Egypt, one for $30,000 (Â£19,000) to an account in Beirut and another for $440,000 (Â£277,000) purportedly for the purchase of a plot of land in Egypt when no such transaction was intended. The hearing was told all the money that went through two joint accounts belonged to Mrs Adler-Jensen with the surgeon misappropriating almost Â£820,000. Mr Morgan said: âAll the financial capital came from Mrs A throughout the relevant period as his only income came from his hospital salary. âBy 2005, her financial resources had been depleted while in complete contrast the doctorâs fortunes had increased.â The hearing was told that the surgeon, who represented himself at the hearing, believed some of the money had been âa giftâ from Mrs Adler-Jensen to his children while he also claimed he had been owed commission on the sale of the widowâs former flat. The hearing continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Gabriella Adler-Jensen became easy target when her elderly husband died .

But scientists now believe Neanderthal man was actually more of the stay-at-home type. Researchers at Cambridge University have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores. Their remains show they had very big right arms - some 50 per cent stronger than their left arms - which has previously been put down to hunting big game with spears. Mighty hunter or domestic God? Researchers at Cambridge University have found evidence our early ancestors may have spent most of their time carrying out tedious domestic chores . Hunters - or home-makers? Â¿For much of the time Neanderthals might have been performing other tasks, such as preparing skins, which changes our picture of their daily activities.Â¿ . However a new analysis suggests hunting would not have had this effect, and their bone structure is more likely to be the result of hours spent scraping animals hides to make clothes. It was the Ice Age when the Neanderthals roamed Europe and they would have need to wear furs to survive. Dr Colin Shaw, an archaeologist, said: âThe skeletal remains suggest that Neanderthals were doing something intense or repetitive, or both, that had a significant role in their lives. The question is what was it? âThe main theory until now is that it was hunting of mammoths and deer, which has coloured our view of the Neanderthal as a hunter. But we have shown it would not have had the effect we have seen on the bones. âFor much of the time Neanderthals might have been performing other tasks, such as preparing skins, which changes our picture of their daily activities.â The researchers say the shape of the humerus bones which have survived â the long bone which runs from the shoulder to elbow â show the Neanderthals right upper arms were unusually strong. Most right-handed people have arms which are 10 per cent stronger than the left. The disparity in Neanderthals arms is only seen in people such as tennis players. An international team of researchers led by the Universitat AutÃ²noma . de Barcelona and the University of York, has found the first molecular . evidence that Neanderthals not only ate a range of cooked plant foods, . but also understood its nutritional and medicinal qualities. Until recently Neanderthals, who disappeared between 30,000 and . 24,000 years ago, were thought to be predominantly meat-eaters. However, researchers from Spain, the UK and Australia combined pyrolysis . gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry with an analysis of . plant microfossils to identify material trapped in calcified dental plaque from five Neanderthals from the north Spanish . site of El SidrÃ³n. Dr Shawâs team used right-handed volunteers to carry out spear throwing and scraping tasks, while the muscle activity in their chest and shoulder â which influences the movement of this upper arm bone - was measured using electrodes. He said: âWe found that not only was it unlikely that the Neanderthals were throwing spears as regularly as a tennis player hits the ball, but it was not having this effect on their right arm. âAlthough it was thought the right arm would have been holding the back of the spear and doing the thrusting. It was making their left arm, which was closer to the target, slightly stronger. âHowever during the scraping task we saw activity consistent with their arm shape, so that is a plausible explanation.â One of the tools most often found with Neanderthal remains in Europe is a âside scraperâ used to scrape soft tissue from the underside of animal hides, which needed to be removed so it did not rot. The researchers said Neanderthals would have needed around six skins to make one outfit and needed to make one for each member of their family every year. It was a laborious task, as studies of Eskimos and African hunters shows even experienced people would take about eight hours to scrape a single hide. Dr Shaw, from the PAVE research groups and McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, said: âPreparing several hides for each member of the community would have require exactly the sort of repetitious activity attested to by the overdeveloped arms of Neanderthal skeletons.â It paints a new picture of our caveman ancestors who, if they spent a lot more time at home, could have got involved in cooking, child care, butchering and tool making. Neanderthals, who roamed Europe and the Middle East for around 100,000 years, are generally thought of as uncivilised creatures who were out-witted and out-hunted by modern humans around 35,000 years ago.

A man who executed his wife and three children in their SUV will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of their brutal murders. Christopher Vaughn, 37, was sentenced on Tuesday to four consecutive life terms for killing his wife Kimberly, 34, and children Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11 and eight-year-old Blake. Each child was shot once in the chest and head while buckled into the back seat. They were killed moments after watching their mother be shot in the face. Vaughn murdered his family by the roadside in June 2007 as they  drove to an Illinois water park. He had harbored fantasies of starting a new life alone in the Canadian wilderness and viewed his family as the obstacle standing in his way. Scroll down for video . Justice: Del Phillips, father of murder victim Kimberly Vaughn, speaks after sentencing with his wife Susan and Kimberly's twin sister Jennifer Ledbetter . No remorse: Christopher Vaughn expressed no emotion as he listened to the devastating testimony of his wife's parents and sister . The victims' family spoke outside court in Joliet of their relief that the trial was over but wereÂ  devastated that Vaughn had . shown no remorse for taking his family's lives. Kimberly's mother Susan Phillips said now that the family had seen justice they 'can begin to really get with the process of grieving'. Her husband Del Phillips said: 'We had no indication from this individual that he could be so evil or do such acts but we did find out the hard way.' Mr Phillips added: 'I don't think he felt what we feel when he held our (grand)children', according to the Chicago Tribune. Alongside the couple sat their daughter Jennifer Ledbetter who is Kimberly's twin sister. She was so overcome with emotion at the press conference that she could not speak. At Vaughn's sentencing, Mrs Ledbetter . broke down when she told of the 'indescribable . pain' of losing her sister, to whom she bears a striking resemblance, . and her nieces and nephew. Escape: Prosecutors say Vaughn saw his wife Kimberly and children (l-r) Blake, Abigayle and Cassandra as obstacles standing in the way of his new life in Canada . Tragedy: A memorial to the Vaughn family is left outside their spacious home in the Chicago suburbs . Outside the court, the prosecution team said that the murders were a 'diabolical atrocity' committed by a 'heartless, soulless psychopath'. The judge sentenced Vaughn to four consecutive life sentences with no possibility of parole after he was found guilty on September 20. A jury took less than an hour to convict the computer specialist. He was eligible for the death penalty when the case began but Illinois has since abolished capital punishment. Vaughn did not make a statement in court on Tuesday but turned to watch his family as they left the room. On June . 14, 2007, Vaughn ordered his family into their SUV at 5am before pulling . off the road and placing a 9mm pistol under his wife's chin and firing a . shot. Locked away: Christopher Vaughn, 37, has been sentenced to four life terms in prison without parole for the murder of his wife and three children in June 2007 . Family life: Christopher Vaughn, 37, with his wife Kimberly and children (left to right) Cassandra, 11, Blake, eight, and Abigayle, 12. He brutally murdered them in June 2007 . He then turned to each of his three children buckled in the back seat and . fired, once in the chest and once in the head for each of them. Abigayle was found holding a stuffed animal and a copy of Harry Potter while Blake's wounds indicated he had raised his arm to shield himself. According to Christopher Vaughn's account, the family had been headed on a trip and he had stopped to secure luggage on the roof of the vehicle. He told police that his wife started shooting shortly after that and he fled the scene to survive. The married father was arrested at a funeral home hours before a memorial service for his wife and children. Prosecutors said Vaughn had dreamed of starting a new life in the Canadian wilderness and viewed his family as what was holding him back. He posted wistful . Internet messages about building a cabin and settling in the Yukon woods, cut . off from the world. 'He was held back by four major . obstacles,' prosecutor Chris Regis said. 'Those four obstacles were . eliminated on June 14, 2007.' The court was read emails Vaughn wrote to a friend before the murders . saying he longed for a life unencumbered by cellphones and other . hallmarks of modernity. Burdened by grief: Susan Phillips spoke after her son-in-law's sentencing on Tuesday. Her daughter and Kimberly's twin Jennifer Ledbetter was so overcome, she could not speak . Heartbreak: Jennifer Ledbetter (left) told the court on Tuesday of the 'indescribable pain' of losing her twin sister, nieces and nephew. Susan Philips (right) also spoke at the sentencing in Illinois . He cited poet Henry David Thoreau about the . virtue of shrugging off obligations. 'I just want to live plain and simple,' Vaughn wrote in one email. Jurors also heard from an exotic dancer Maya Drake who testified that Vaughn had visited Scores Gentlemen's Club where she worked in the weeks before the murders. She described how Vaughn came to the Chicago strip club on four or five occasions and had discussed a feud he had with his wife over expensive drapes that she ordered for their home. Vaughn was said to be enraged that his wife was materialistic and he shared how he dreamed of breaking free of all responsibility for his family. Grisly scene: The Vaughn family car is found in June 2007 off a remote highway in Illinois with four dead bodies inside . 'He told me that he wanted to leave his wife and move to Canada and build his own home or cabin in the woods,' Drake said. 'He said [his wife] was going to get what she deserved. She wasn't going to see it coming.' Vaughn had been stockpiling wilderness gear, according to police. Officers uncovered a storage unit he had rented that was full of camping gear, tin cups and plates, sleeping bags, boots and camp tools in addition to a jar of peanut butter and a bottle of Jameson whiskey. Another stripper, Chrystal Miller, had testified in late August about Vaughn's visit to the club, describing him as a 'very timid'Â  customer. She said he spent upwards of $5,000 each on two visits to the establishment, in the weeks before his family's murder. Emotionless: Vaughn sat passive throughout most of his trial which described in horrifying detail the murders of his wife and young children . Tragedy: Vaughn shot his three children (left to right) Abigayle, Cassandra and Blake in the head and chest after they watched him kill their mother . Blame: Vaughn's defense team claimed his wife was suicidal and had killed her husband and children but jurors did not buy it . Vaughn displayed little emotion during the trial, even when prosecutors displayed crime-scene photos of his wife, her head hanging back and dried blood from her nose and mouth. The defense told . jurors that Vaughn's wife was to blame, saying she was suicidal over their marriage problems and affected emotionally by antidepressant medication. They suggested she shot her husband in the wrist and . leg, then killed the children and herself. Vaughn's defense attorney added later that Kimberly Vaughn may have seen the murder of her kids as a twisted act of mercy. '(She) was of the mindset that they if she was gone, they were better off with . her ... ""Come with me to heaven,""' Lenard said. Prosecutors balked at that theory, . asking jurors whether it seemed reasonable that a woman who disliked guns . could have shot her husband twice - only grazing him each time - but then killed each of her children with marksman's precision. In closing statements, prosecutors said . Kimberly Vaughn was upbeat in the days before her death. The night before her brutal murder, she had fussed cheerfully over a recipe for 'cheesy potatoes' at the family's spacious home in the Chicago suburbs. 'This case is not just a murder, it's an . atrocity,' said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow said in . closing. 'To annihilate your family, I can't think of a more despicable . crime.'

Britain and the West face a decades-long battle against Islamist terrorism in North Africa, a grim-faced David Cameron warned today. The Prime Minister said the attack was a 'stark reminder' of the threat from the region, which he likened to that from Afghanistan and Pakistan - and vowed to use Britain's chairmanship of the G8 group of leading nations to shape the international response. Government sources played down the prospect of British 'boots on the ground' in support of a French-led intervention against terrorists in Mali but said a new approach was needed to address Africa's 'huge, lawless, ungoverned spaces'. David Cameron said the threat of Islamic fundamentalism in North Africa will require a 'global response' The Prime Minister, who will address . the Commons again on the crisis tomorrow, said: 'This is a global threat . and it will require a global response. 'It will require a response that is about years, even decades, rather than months. 'It . requires a response that is patient and painstaking, that is tough but . also intelligent, but above all has an absolutely iron resolve and that . is what we will deliver over these coming years. 'What . we face is an extremist, Islamist, al Qaeda-linked terrorist group. Just as we had to deal with that in Pakistan and in Afghanistan so the . world needs to come together to deal with this threat in north Africa. 'It . is linked to al Qaeda, it wants to destroy our way of life, it believes . in killing as many people as it can. We need to work with others to . defeat the terrorists and to close down the ungoverned spaces where they . thrive with all the means that we have.' French Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian described the bloodbath in Algeria as an 'act of war'. The French media have dubbed the bloody siege as 'Europe's September 11.' 'What . strikes me the most is that we're saying ""hostage-taking"" but when . there are so many people concerned, I think this is an act of war,' he . said. Speaking on the . BBC's Andrew Marr Show, William Hague, the foreign secretary, said it . was 'quite likely' that some of the Britons were executed by the group, . which identified itself as the Signers in Blood â a splinter group of . al-Qaida in the Islamic Mahgreb. Mr . Hague confirmed that Britain had not been consulted about the Algerian . decision to launch the attack, adding: 'Of course, we would have liked . to have been consulted, but they decided as a sovereign country that . this was something on their soil that they would deal with and that they . needed to deal with urgently.' He . said the Algerians had acted swiftly because their military believed . the hostage-takers were planning to blow up the installation, posing an . imminent threat to the lives of their captives. Foreign Secretary William Hague told Jeremy Vine of BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show that the Algerian army had believed the entire installation where the hostages were being held was going to be destroyed . Government sources sought to downplay the significance of a recording of one of the terror leaders, Abdel Rahman al-Nigeri, saying 'I have spoken to the British' in recording of talks with Algerian Special Forces. Initial contacts are thought to have been made by BP, which runs the refinery where the hostages were taken. But officials say there was 'no question' of negotiations over any concessions being demanded by the group. 'Whatever people think of them, whatever has been said about the Algerian military, they are experienced,' Mr Hague added. 'The Algerians had to make very difficult decisions. We know from decisions about hostage rescues how very, very difficult they are. 'The Algerians believe that the plan of the terrorists was to blow up the entire installation thereby killing all or most of the hostages in any case and so yes, what they have done has been driven by the belief that negotiation couldn't succeed and that the lives of the hostages were in great and imminent danger in any case.' In what appeared to be a concerted effort to row back from initial criticism of the Algerian response, the Prime Minister said responsibility for the deaths 'lies squarely with the terrorists who launched a vicious and cowardly attack'. 'No one should underestimate the difficulties of responding to an attack on this scale with 30 terrorists absolutely determined to take lives, and we should recognise all the Algerians have done to work with us and to help and co-ordinate with us, and I'd like to thank them for that,' he said. Former defence secretary Liam Fox said the 'squeeze' on al-Qaeda in their heartlands of Pakistan and Afghanistan had forced them into other ungoverned areas. Former Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Stirrup said Britain needed to be 'very careful how we tread in this particular area'. He said: 'There is a tendency to characterise this as some sort of global jihadist campaign when, in fact, in many circumstances in many of these areas .","PM issues a stark reminder of the power of violent fundamentalism .

Previously a proponent of the rigid macrobiotic diet, which she followed for two years, in recent years she has relaxed her approach to food and taken to sharing her appreciation of it on her lifestyle blog Goop, or via her own cook book. She even dialled live into the U.S. Rachael Ray talk showÂ  from her kitchen, where she could be seen swigging red wine while she defended claims she had not written the recipes herself. Now, Gwyneth's latest blog post reveals that, unlike so many other women in January, she will not be putting herself through the torture of the annual New Year detox diet. Health guru: Gwyneth is known for healthy lifestyle and beauty regime, which she credits with keeping her looking so youthful and slim at 40-years-old . âHappy 2013! I am not on a detox. I am not on a diet. I know, New Yearâs cleansing and all that. Not this year. Can't do it. Maybe later in the year. Maybe in the spring.â However, the news does not mean she has abandoned her healthy eating principles: âSo for now, I would like to continue with my pasta and cheese, but perhaps be more mindful of ingredients,' she adds. 'I asked my friend Dr. Frank Lipman about his list of superfoods so that I could incorporate them into my diet a bit more.â Preaching the benefits of a healthy . lifestyle (as well as shopping, places to visit, books to read) Goop has . a huge following of fans all keen to emulate Ms Paltrow's pure and . virtuous lifestyle. The New Year post, complied by Gwyneth and Dr Lipman, lists nine suggested superfoods which you can incorporate into your diet, along with a sample recipe for each. Surprisingly non-exotic and obtainable, the list includes blueberries, cruciferous vegetables (lettuce to you and me), dark chocolate, spinach, walnuts, beans, avocado and wild salmon. The only mysterious item on the list is the chia seeds. These small dark seeds are rich in antioxidant, calcium, phosphorus and manganese as well as being high in fibre. Gwyneth used her lifestyle website Goop.com to announce her intention NOT to diet this New Year - but instead to incorporate more superfoods into her diet . Family time: Gwyneth Paltrow posed with her children Moses and Apple while on holiday in St Lucia . Dr Lipman says: âthe simplest path to vibrant health â and a spectacular New Year â starts with these nine superfoods â those naturally perfect foods which support the health, growth and maintenance of your body, just by loading up your plate.â Avocados are one of the 9 suggested superfoods . Some of the recipes donât even sound like health food at all - walnut pesto pasta, Avocado Temaki (Hand Roll), and Spinach & Black Bean Burrito are all on the menu, with step by step instructions, with accompanying photos. However the chia seed pudding and Crispy Romanesco with Lemon Aioli (essentially baked lettuce pieces with sauce) may not quite be to everyoneâs taste. The end of the blog sees Gwyneth posting idyllic photos of her most recent holiday at Sugar Beach in St Lucia which she describes as âheavenâ. One shot sees the 40-year-old star in her bikini, posing with her two children Apple, eight, and six-year-old Moses.

A teenage thug has been jailed for her part in a racist attack in which a Sudanese woman had her hijab headscarf pulled off. Paige Bain, 16, also repeatedly punched a five-months pregnant woman during the assault, which was carried out with her aunt, Eileen Kennedy, 28. Umaimi Musa, from Darfur, Sudan, and her Congolese friend Mary Marandran were sitting in a playpark in Royston, Glasgow, in September last year when they heard foul-mouthed racist insults being hurled at them. They were then set upon. The incident was captured on CCTV and the camera operator raised the alarm with police as the attack happened. Yesterday, Sheriff Kenneth Mitchell sentenced Bain to two years and eight months in prison for the attack. Kennedy was earlier jailed for two years and six days for her part in the assault. The then 15-year-old and Kennedy, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court to racially assaulting 41-year-old Miss Musa to her injury. Kennedy also admitted resisting arrest and claiming she had an infection before spitting on a police officer. Bain admitted racially aggravated assault on Mrs Marandran, 40. Procurator fiscal depute Mark Allan, prosecuting, said: âBain, repeatedly punched the then pregnant Mrs Marandran on her head and pushed her.â He told the court that both accused demanded Miss Musaâs mobile phone and tried to grab it off her after she told them she was going to call the police.

As the US president's daughter, Sasha Obama has had to sit through her fair share of speeches. So it was no surprise that the 11-year-old found her father's second inaugural address, well, a little tedious. During the speech in Washington D.C. a television camera panned to Sasha as she sat beside her sister Malia, 14, and mother Michelle. Scroll down for video . What a bore: Sasha Obama, left, sitting beside her older sister Malia, 14, and mother Michelle, was pictured yawning during her father's second inauguration speech in Washington D.C. Sleepy: The 11-year-old was clearly not overly excited by her father's speech in front of 700,000 spectators . Admiration: Social networks became abuzz with users describing the yawn as the 'best part' of the speech, while some said the schoolgirl 'will be hearing about that yawn for the rest of her life' But rather than looking as if she was hanging on her dad's every word, as he told the nation 'Weâll need to equip our children for the future', she appeared weary. Despite letting out the huge yawn, Sasha still managed to diligently clap her father. The schoolgirl can be forgiven for feeling tired after a gruelling day of preparation for the ceremony, beginning with an early-morning church service. Social networks were immediately abuzz with admiration for the youngster. One user wrote: 'Best part of the inauguration: Sasha's GIANT ""Dad you're boring me"" yawn.' Rachel Mc said: 'Did Sasha just yawn? Love it! #kids', while another said that the schoolgirl would be 'hearing about the yawn for the rest of her life'. While the speech in front of 700,000 spectators might not have been that gripping for the 11-year-old, her interest was certainly piqued when BeyoncÃ© appeared before the family to sing the national anthem. The sisters were also seen laughing and joking with their mother throughout the ceremony, while they also played with their mobile phones.

Birch suffered a stroke during a freak accident, his life was transformed - but not in a way that anyone could have predicted. When he regained consciousness, the 26-year-old â who was engaged to his girlfriend at the time â found his sexuality had completely altered. 'The Chris I knew had gone and a new Chris sort of came along. I came to the realisation that the stroke had turned me gay,' he said. He is now the subject of aÂ BBC3 documentary, chronicling his attempt over the past few months to make sense of his new identity. Transformed: Mr Birch has also altered his appearance since the stroke. Shedding weight and dying his hair . Chris Birch was a 19st beer-swilling rugby fan before his accident (left). A stroke radically altered his personality and he swapped banking for hairdressing (right) Chris had been attempting a forward roll down a hill in 2011 when the blood supply to his brain was cut off causing a stroke. During a stroke the areas starved of oxygen, brain cells die and this can cause damage. However, the brain can make new neural connections and find different pathways to achieve the same thing. Some scientists believe it is possible that during this recovery process a patient could discover a new skill, accent or even a new sexuality. However, personality changes following a stroke are rare and there have been no documented cases of a stroke changing a person's sexuality. Chris Birch points to the hill where he had his stroke . But Mr Birch, for one, is convinced. Within a year of his stroke he had quit his job at a bank and become a hairdresser, moved out of his family home in the Welsh valleys and started meeting men. 'It was a weird experience,' he told the film crew. 'You walk into somewhere and you go from liking that girl to liking that boy.' He found the changes traumatic and . admitted it was a 'lonely time' when he was afraid to tell anybody about . his new sense of self. 'It was quite a scary process. Being with the first guy was a very odd experience. I didn't know what I was doing,' he said. Chris has been putting together a memory box of anything that jogs vague recollections from his past life, such as photos from his schoolÂ  It includes a photo from his school prom and a badge from the Isle of Man TT Race. 'This jogs something in me,' he said, holding a pin badge from a trip to see the Isle of Man TT Race. 'Old Chris likes motorbikes, I really don't care anymore.' He has also developed some old films from a holiday taken just before his accident and wasn't best pleased with the results. 'I look awful,' he said. 'It sums old Chris up, my God I looked chavvy! It feels like looking at somebody else but with my face.' New life: Chris with his fiance Jak Powell . The change has put a huge strain on his family and he has lost several close friendships. He has also had to deal with negative reactions from strangers after telling his story to the media. In a documentary airing tonight, Mr Birch is seen trying to . rebuild his relationship with his mother. The 27-year-old said when he was ill his . mother took him back and forth to the doctors and was very protective. Now he goes to the hospital appointments alone and barely speaks to her. 'It would be nice if my mother played . more of a role in my life, because I always seem happy in the photos . that she is in,' he said, referring to his old albums. However, he said he understood how difficult his radical change in personality must be for her. 'It's a unique bond so when it's altered or changed I think there is a bereavement,' he said. Despite all the difficulties Chris said he has no regrets over how his life has turned out. Within a few months of moving out from home he met his then boyfriend and now fiance Jak Powell. Mr Powell has his own theory that Chris has always been gay and the accident just helped him to realise it. 'People grow up not knowing they are gay and have families and then they realise they are gay, but they don't have a stroke to realise it,' Mr Powell said. 'I think eventually if you hadn't had the stroke it would have happened anyway,' he said. But Mr Birch is not convinced saying he has memories and photos that prove he was definitely straight before the stroke. 'If I read about it I wouldn't have believed it,' he admitted. 'But here I am.' As part of the documentary Mr Birch visited Dr Quazi Rahman of Queen Mary University in London who is an expert in human sexual orientation. Dr Rahman has tested hundreds of gay and straight volunteers and discovered key neurological patterns that he believes reveal if a person might have been born gay or straight.

Prince Charles ranked eighth on the sartorially splendid list - just one place behind Twilight star Pattinson - while his son the Duke of Cambridge came 37th. GQ magazine said William 'epitomises true British style', adding: 'Has the Duchess of Cambridge upped her husband's fashion game? It would appear so.'

The UK is heading towards a triple dip recession with the bad weather threatening to tip the economy over the edge, a leading forecaster warned last night. Official growth figures due on Friday are expected to show the British economy shrank in the final quarter of last year. Many experts predict there will be another fall in the three months from January to March, plunging the nation into its third recession in five years. Scroll down for video . The UK is heading towards a triple dip recession with the bad weather threatening to tip the economy over the edge,it has today been warned . âWe are sliding towards a triple dip recession in my view,â said Peter Spencer, the chief economic adviser to the influential Ernst & Young Item Club, that uses the Treasuryâs own models in its forecasting. âThe snow is not helping. When the economy is bouncing along the bottom anyway, a bout of bad weather can easily tip it into negative territory,â he added. Snowfall over much of the country is likely to hurt the economy because wintry weather deters shoppers from heading to the High Street and also affects internet shopping because deliveries can be delayed, Spencer said. But the worst impact is on construction and on supply chains, where companies find it hard to make up for lost ground. âIf supply chains are hit and production lines disrupted, then it can have awesome effects,â he said. âThen you have costs to business of people not getting into work due to transport problems or illness.â 'An episode of severe bad weather is definitely significant enough to turn a flat growth figure into a falling one.â Economists define a recession as two quarters in a row of negative growth. Dismal growth numbers from the Office for National Statistics on Friday will add to the pressure on the Chancellor George Osborne to abandon the Bank of Englandâs inflation target in order to boost growth. A wave of bad news on jobs and consumer spending has hit the economy in recent weeks. Employees in the shadow of the axe include more than 4,000 at HMV . Many economists believe that the Bank should break with its single-minded focus on the 2pc inflation target â which it has not met for several years in any case â and take on a broader mandate to stimulate the economy. New governor Mark Carney suggested in a recent speech he might favour a target that included growth as well as inflation. âThe inflation target is well past its sell by date, which it reached at the turn of the millennium,â Spencer said, adding that the UK is doomed to at least two years more of sluggish growth if the Bank and the Chancellor do not take a different approach. Critics, however, fear it could send out signals that the Bank has turned soft on inflation, with potentially ruinous consequences for pensioners and others on a fixed income. The Item Club forecasts growth of just 0.9pc for the whole of 2013 with a slow revival to 1.9pc in 2014 and 2.5pc in 2014. Spencer said the governmentâs âmid-term report should read âcould do betterââ and urged more infrastructure spending and investment in the housing market. The UK crawled out of recession in the third quarter of last year but otherÂ  economists also fear it is hurtling back into a slump. Howard Archer of IHS Global Insight said that a dip in growth in the fourth quarter of last year would in part be due to an unwinding of the âOlympic effectâ that boosted the economy over the summer. But he added: âThere is significant concern that the weakness goes deeper than that and the UK is headed for a genuine âtriple dipâ. A wave of bad news on jobs and consumer spending has hit the economy in recent weeks. Employees in the shadow of the axe include 800 staff atÂ  Hondaâs Swindon plant, 1,300 at collapsed camera chain Jessops,Â  760 at movie rental business Blockbuster and more than 4,000 at HMV. Employment overall has remained strong despite the downturn because firms have been holding on to staff in the hope of a recovery round the corner. There are fears the growth in private sector jobs could go into reverse if an economic revival fails to materialise.","Official figures expected to show British economy shrank in final quarter of 2012 .

The mid-term review suggested ministers want to extend a scheme to cut fuel duty in areas which have been worst hit by prices hitting Â£1.40 a litre or more. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander has already introduced a 5p fuel duty discount in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, and the Isles of Scilly. Countryside: Drivers living in remote rural areas could receive a 5p a litre discount on the price of petrol . But the mid-term review revealed the Government is to consider extending it to remote mainland areas, too, such as Cornwall, the Scottish Highlands and North Wales. âWe will consider the case for extending the rural fuel discount scheme to remote mainland communities,â the document said. A fuel duty discount can be introduced only if the Government can persuade the European Commission that it would not breach competition laws. Precedents have been set by the French island of Corsica and Portuguese and Greek islands, which already enjoy fuel tax discounts approved by Brussels. A Government source said: âThe precedents are there in Greece and elsewhere. For the areas affected by these very high prices, it will be a significant cut.â Another flagship transport policy signalled in the review, however, is causing significant splits within the Government.

The Coalition document mentioned only forthcoming plans for âlong-term investment in Britainâs transport infrastructureâ. David Cameron is keen on plans to encourage private sector investment in the roads network by allowing them to charge tolls in return for building and running new motorways, trunk roads and lanes. Drivers who use motorways and trunk roads could also pay a higher level of road duty, while those who stick to B-roads and single-lane A-roads would get a cut. However, the Liberal Democrats â and Tory ministers in the Department for Transport â are understood to be cool on the proposal, arguing motorists are unlikely to welcome the idea of new tolls and charges. A senior Government source admitted it was unlikely that significant progress would be made before the next election in 2015. âHave you seen how long it takes to build a new road in this country?â the source said.","Mid-term review suggests ministers want to extend scheme to cut fuel duty .

A motorist who drove up the highest mountain in England and Wales in a 4x4 twice has been jailed. Craig Williams, 40, was convicted of two offences of dangerous driving, two weeks apart, on 3,560ft Snowdon in September 2011 by a jury. It was revealed that Williams had failed to answer bail for the start of the trial and that a manÂ  resembling him had been seen on CCTV in the early hours of Thursday placing a message on the window of Caernarfon Crown Court saying: 'Can't catch me, try to catch me if you can.' Prosecutor Matthew Curtis said on Wednesday morning the defendant sent an email to his solicitors with a letter to the judge. Mr Curtis told Judge Merfyn Hughes QC: âThe letter addressed to you indicated that the defendant was going to be at the summit of Mount Snowdon as the verdicts were going to be returned.â There was a suicide note in the form of a long poem. Mr Curtis said police were sceptical of the suggestion of a suicide attempt but could not ignore it and started a search. A member of the Llanberis mountain rescue team went to the snowy summit of Snowdon. The North Wales police helicopter also flew from its Rhuddlan base to Snowdon and searched the railway line, footpaths and ridges. The cost for 50 minutes was Â£1,767. On Thursday morning Williams was found sleeping in a vehicle in Snowdonia. The court heard that the bill for repairs to the Snowdon mountain railway and recovery of the vehicle following his two ascents in a 4x4 amounted to thousands of pounds. Williams was jailed for six months for . the first count of dangerous driving on September 3, 2011 and ten months . for the second offence later that month. He admitted failing to answer . to bail and was jailed for six months. Dangerous: Craig Williams drove up Snowdon in a 4x4 on two occasions two weeks apart. Hikers are pictured stopping to look at the Vauxhall Frontera 4x4 . The judge told Williams: 'The danger you created on both occasions was both obvious and serious.' But the sentences were ordered to be served consecutively making a total jail term of 22 months. He was also banned from driving for three years and until he takes an extended driving test. Judge Hughes told him : âThe danger you created on both occasions was both obvious and serious. That no-one was injured is no thanks to you. This was a deliberate act on both occasions and can be correctly described by the prosecution as a stunt . âIt was committed by you for your own selfish reasons and in complete disregard for the safety of others exercising their lawful right to enjoy Snowdon. You have showed no remorse whatsoever. Your involvement has cost many thousands of pounds to the public who have had to clear up the mess you have left behind.â The judge said Williams had sent a hoax letter and poem to the court making it clear he had no intention of coming to his trial. The letter also indicated he intended to commit suicide on the summit of Snowdon and he provided coordinates.

Two âthrill seekingâ men who were racing their high performance cars at 80mph to see who had the fastest vehicle have been jailed for four years after causing the death of a cyclist. Mohammed Khan, 25, was at the wheel of a blue Audi RS3 in Bradford, West Yorkshire, at 1.45am on September 16, 2011, when he struck cyclist Vitalijs Rozenbergs, hurling him into the air and killing him almost immediately. Shajah Rehman, 31, was driving a black Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG in the outside lane, almost alongside the Audi, as the pair raced to see whose car was the quickest, Bradford Crown Court was told. Jailed: Mohammed Khan has been jailed for four years after killing cyclist Vitalijs Rozenbergs. He was racing friend Shajah Rehman in a high performance Audi RS3 in Bradford when he struck Mr Rozenbergs . Flee: Shajah Rehman did not stop following the accident but handed himself into the police the next day . Mr Rozenbergs, 22, a Latvian national who lived in Bradford, was cycling across the road on his way to Leeds for a night shift. The court heard there were no lights on his cycle and he was wearing headphones but the bike had a reflector and the road was well lit. Khan and Rehman, both pleaded guilty to causing the death of Mr Rozenbergs by dangerous driving. Khan also admitted causing death while driving uninsured. Prosecutor Richard Clews told the court on Monday that the defendants were racing at about 80mph, twice the legal speed limit. Khanâs Audi struck Mr Rozenbergs, throwing him 15 metres along the road, and causing him fatal injuries. The Audi collided with the Mercedes, as it tried to avoid a crash, and the Mercedes hit the central reservation. Khan stopped at the scene and waited for the emergency services to arrive. Rehman kept going but handed himself into the police the next day. Mr Clews said CCTV images showed the powerful cars almost side by side at high speed at the time of the impact. Khan had driven 223 miles to Bradford from Cardiff shortly before the crash at speeds averaging 85mph. He mistakenly believed he was insured to drive the Audi on a motor tradersâ policy. The two men were jailed for four years today at Bradford Crown Court . In mitigation Khanâs barrister, Yunus Valli, said his client was deeply affected by what he described as a 'mindless death'. He came from a respected family and was genuinely and sincerely remorseful. Andrew Dallas, for Rehman, said he too was very sorry and his mental health had suffered. It was 'a few moments of dangerous stupidity', said Mr Dallas. Rehman had been driving for ten years with a clean licence. Judge Peter Benson said: 'Racing is a seriously aggravating feature of this type of offence.' He banned Khan and Rehman from driving for four years. After the case, Sergeant Garry Alderson, of the Major Collision Enquiry Team at West Yorkshire Police, said: 'For a few moments of thrill seeking, these two men have found themselves with a lifetime of regret, alongside a significant custodial sentence. 'Racing on West Yorkshireâs roads is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated. The consequences of which can end lives and ruin many more, as we have witnessed in this particular case.' 'We will notice the temperature dropping over the next few days and there is a chance of snow on the high ground in the north of the country on Thursday,"" said Helen Chivers, of the Met Office. 'From next week temperatures will be around 5C and there will be a chance of frost at night, when temperatures could fall to minus 5C in the countryside.'","Mohammed Khan and Shajah Rehman were racing .

US federal regulators are ordering a comprehensive review of Boeing's brand-new fleet of 787 Dreamliners, after a string of scares struck the state-of-the-art passenger jet in a week. The Federal Aviation Administration finally launched the probe after a crack appeared in a cockpit window during a domestic All Nippon Airways flight in Japan today. The review is an embarrassing setback to the plane that was heralded as the future of aviation, after four separate malfunctions occurred this week alone, including a brake failure, a fuel leak and an on-board fire. The FAA says the review will include the design, manufacture and assembly of the aircraft. High tech: The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, relies more than any other modern airliner on electrical signals to help power nearly everything the plane does . Speaking of today's incident, ANA said crew noticed a spider web-like crack in a window in front of the pilot's seat about 70 minutes into Friday's flight, which was close to its destination. 'Cracks appear a few times every year in other planes. We don't see this as a sign of a fundamental problem' with Boeing aircraft, a spokesman for the airline said. The 787, which Boeing calls the Dreamliner, relies more than any other modern airliner on electrical . signals to help power nearly everything the plane does. It is also the first Boeing plane to use rechargeable lithium ion batteries and to be made with lightweight composite materials. Concern: On Sunday, another 787 which had arrived caught fire after dropping off 183 passengers and crew from Tokyo at Boston . Trouble: On Monday, a fuel leak forced a 787 operated by Japan Airlines to cancel takeoff at Boston's Logan International Airport (pictured: the fire that broke out the day before) More . than 800 have been sold to airlines around the world, which Boeing has . said will be more fuel efficient than comparable jets and more . comfortable for passengers. But the Dreamliner has flown under a . cloud since its maiden voyage on in October 2011, which itself saw repeated delays lasting more than three years after a slew of faults were detected.

'Reprehensible crime': Claire Mosby, who stole over Â£31,000 from a school safe containing dinner money and funds for trips to fund her bingo addiction . A bingo addict who stole Â£31,000 to fund her habit from the primary school where she worked has been jailed. Claire Mosby was branded 'reprehensible' by a judge for placing her colleagues under suspicion by planting a spare key in the school safe, as the net began to close on her two-year deception. Mosby, 38, a former pupil and parent governor at Swarcliffe Primary School, Leeds, West Yorkshire, worked as office manager when she stole cash from the safe between 2009 and 2011. The cash had been collected for school dinners, from the school's nursery, breakfast club, after school club and a voluntary fund, made up of contributions to pay for extras such as school trips. Instead of banking the takings, the married mother-of-three used it fund her online gambling and bingo habit. She was jailed for 18 months at Leeds Crown Court. Judge Christopher Batty said: 'Swarcliffe Primary School is the heart of the community in which you and your family still live. 'The money that you stole represents the monies collected by the school from parents in the school. 'Money you know only too well they could ill-afford to give in the first place.' He added: 'I'm afraid it comes down to this - you did not care. Your need was too great.' Mosby originally began volunteering as a school governor and quickly became friends with headteacher Susan Sanderson, who recommended that she be put forward for the office manager's job. Suspicions about her behaviour were first raised by a council-employed school finance officer over low income levels in the school's dinner money account. The court heard Mosby's bank account details showed expenditure linked to online gambling and bingo websites, payments to loan companies - and even cash withdrawals from a machine close to a Mecca Bingo. As her deception was about to be discovered in March 2011, Mosby went into the school at a weekend and put a spare key in the safe in a bid to cover her tracks. Jailed: Claire Mosby was jailed for 18 months at Leeds Crown Court, pictured, after stealing more than Â£31,000 from a primary school . The next day she went to police to report cash being stolen. The judge said those actions amounted to Mosby 'laying down your defence'. He added: 'No one needs to tell you how reprehensible your behaviour is.' A jury found Mosby guilty of theft after a trial last year. Mosby, of Leeds, claimed she had known cash was going missing but did not report it as she would be putting the headteacher under pressure.","Claire Mosby, also a school governor, was jailed for 18 months .

Motorists were paid more than Â£22million in compensation for pothole damage to their cars last year, consumer magazine Which? has revealed. And that figure is set to soar as the cold snap increases the chances of cracking and craters on the nationâs highways. The Which? report says councils in England and Wales paid out a total of Â£22.8 million to motorists who made a claim for vehicle repairs or injury caused by badly maintained roads. Damage: Motorists were paid over Â£22million in compensation last year for damage to their cars caused by potholes, a new report shows . The figures suggest some councils prefer to leave potholes in place and settle the claims on their insurance rather than pay to fix the underlying problem from their road maintenance budgets. But individual also motorists face a âpothole lotteryâ depending on where they live, says Which? Councils in the North West of England paid out the most in compensation at Â£8million, according to figures collated for Which? by the Asphalt Industry Association. It was followed by Yorkshire and Humberside (Â£3.3million), London (Â£3.2million), the South east (Â£2.7million) the west Midlands (Â£1.8million) and Wales (Â£1.4million). The Government commissioned a Potholes Review in 2011 and allocated an extra Â£200 million for local highway authorities, citing a âsignificant increase in the number of potholes on the already fragile local highway networkâ. And in December the Government gave English councils an extra Â£140million to maintain the highways. But Which? found that the backlog of road repairs per local authority in England is getting bigger, growing from Â£53.2 million in 2009 to Â£61.3 million last year.

Twenty years after she was chained as a prisoner in a coffin-sized box, Katie Beers says the ordeal she suffered as a 10-year-old was 'the best thing that happened to me' because it allowed her to escape a life of abuse. On the 20th anniversary of her ordeal, Beers has co-written a book with a television reporter who covered her kidnapping. 'Buried Memories: Katie Beers' Story' (Title Town Publishing) has a happy ending. Telling her story: On the 20th anniversary of her ordeal, Katie Beers has co-written a book with a television reporter who covered her kidnapping . Dungeon: A crane raises a 6 foot by 9 foot bunker out of the earth at the property of John Esposito in this January 18, 1993 file photo . Beers is now a 30-year-old married mother of two who earned a degree in business management and works in insurance sales near her home in rural Pennsylvania. Her kidnapping attracted nationwide attention in early 1993, when revelations surfaced while she was still missing that she had suffered years of neglect from her mother and had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by her godmother's husband since she was a toddler. Beers was described in Dickensian terms back then - a louse-infested, filthy waif who had no friends and often was forced to lug the family's laundry down the block or fetch cigarettes and junk food for her elders. After kidnapper John Esposito, a family acquaintance, admitted to detectives on January 13, 1993, that he had kidnapped Beers and showed them the dungeon where she was hidden for 17 days under his Bay Shore, New York, home, the little girl was placed in foster care and raised in a comfortable East Hampton home with four siblings. Her foster parents not only imposed newfound discipline into her life, making her go to school regularly and do small chores around the house, but they also shielded Beers from intense media interest. And reporters largely complied with a parent-like plea from a prosecutor to leave her alone. Now: Katie Beers is a 30-year-old married mother-of-two and has finally decided to speak about her ordeal in her book Buried Memoirs . Then: Katie vanished one day before her tenth birthday and was kept chained in an underground dungeon by John Esposito, a friend of Katie's family . 'We as a society must protect this child, or our professed love for own children is just a fraud, and our so-called compassion for each other is just a mockery,' said James Catterson, who was the Suffolk County district attorney at the time. So Beers had barely been seen or heard from since until this week in a media blitz to promote the book. She appeared on the Dr. Phil show Monday and is the focus of a People magazine feature this week. Ordeal: In the book, Beers writes that she had been molested and raped by her godmother's husband from the time she was a toddler . The abduction and subsequent rescue saved her life, Beers said in an interview with The Associated Press. 'The best thing that happened to me,' she said. 'I would have never gotten out of the abuse situation I was in.' She went on to play volleyball at East Hampton High, participated in drama productions and went to college in Pennsylvania, where she earned a degree and met the man who would become her husband and the father of their two children. 'There's no point really in me right now being sad or wondering what if,' she told the AP. 'I try not to be sad about what happened, because ultimately it made me who I am today, and I'm very satisfied and happy with my life,' she said. Beers agreed about four years ago to co-write the book with WCBS-TV reporter Carolyn Gusoff, although she had thought about writing a book for many years. 'I want to be able to help people who might not know where to turn,' she explained. 'To see that there is a road to recovery.' She has declined to disclose her exact hometown, married surname or college alma mater, citing privacy concerns for her family. In the book, Beers writes that she had been molested and raped by Sal Inghilleri - her godmother's husband - from the time she was a toddler. Inghilleri, who served 12 years in prison for molesting Beers, died in jail in 2009 following his arrest on a parole violation. Beers also writes that Esposito raped her in the dungeon, explaining that she repressed her memory of the sexual assault for many years as a defense mechanism. Dungeon: Esposito finally confessed to police that he abducted Katie and led them to the underground bunker, which was hidden by a 200lb concrete wall built underneath his Long Island home . Esposito, who pleaded guilty to kidnapping, was never charged with rape. He is serving 15 years to life and has been denied parole several times; his next parole hearing is later this year. At a 2007 parole hearing, Esposito described himself as asexual and said while he kissed the child, he never engaged in sexual relations. He told Gusoff in a letter published in the book that he believes he deserves to be released. 'I think Katie knows I will always wish her well,' Esposito writes. 'I'm sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry I even thought it up. It was a mistake.' During her time in the dungeon, Beers writes, she rarely slept, fearing abuse from Esposito. She said she was afraid Esposito . might molest her while she slept, but also was concerned that he would . photograph her sleeping and send the image to police. Breaking her silence: Katie, pictured during an interview on Monday, was found in 1993 after 17 days held captive in a neighbor's dungeon-like bunker . She feared if police thought she was dead, they might stop looking for her. She 'celebrated' her 10th birthday while a prisoner of Esposito's and was heard on an audiotape found in the dungeon after her release singing 'Happy Birthday' to herself, although she says today she has no recollection of that. Esposito, she writes, fed her primarily junk food and soda; to this day she is repulsed by chocolate after-dinner mints because they were a staple in captivity. She did have access to a small television, but says she can no longer listen to Whitney Houston's version of 'I Will Always Love You' because it played incessantly on MTV and VH1 while she in the dungeon. She didn't realize it until many . years later, but says now that she frequently watched Gusoff - then a . reporter for Long Island's News12 cable station - filing reports on the . police search for her while she was missing. 'It was like I had known her for 16 years' when they met in 2008 to begin work on the book, she said. Katie has never spoken publicly about her ordeal . at the hands of Esposito, left, in an attempt to live a 'normal' life . but has now opened up in her book, Buried Memories, . right . Gusoff notes that as abhorrent as Beers' sexual abuse and neglect was at the hands of her elders before the kidnapping, it may have steeled her into a survival mode. Dominick Varrone, the Suffolk County detective who led the investigation, agreed, telling Gusoff in the book that 'because of her upbringing, the sexual experiences, the abuse, and street smarts and toughness, she was much more advanced than the normal 9-year-old, and we believe that contributed to her survival.' Marilyn Beers, who is described in the book as a hard-working but largely absentee mother who ceded responsibility for raising Katie and her older brother to Inghilleri's wife and others, did not return a telephone message seeking comment about the book. 'I hope that more does come out of the book,' Katie Beers said. 'I would love to be able to help other kids or adults or to be an inspirational or motivational speaker, something like that. But if I go back to my life in rural Pennsylvania and go back to my insurance sales job I would love that, too. 'I'm very happy with where I'm at.' Neglect: Marilyn Beers, mother of 10-year-old Katie Beers, often left her daughter with her godmother and husband - who sexually abused and raped her for years . Underground: Even though police were at John Esposito's home after Katie vanished, the bunker was so hidden, they had no idea it even existed and did not hear Katie's screams for help .","Katie Beers, now 30, was held captive for 17 days in a widely publicized case .

When Kay Tate arrives at her son's school each afternoon she's just another mother waiting at the playground gates. But when her son Lewis rushes outside to meet her he knows he has to be careful - because at 3ft tall he is only nine inches shorter than she is. 'He's very active but he instinctively . knows he can't be too boisterous around me,' Kay said. 'It's tricky though because . he thinks because he's nearly my size that makes him a grown-up!' Kay, 25, from Newcastle, has a severe form of Osteogenesis . Imperfecta, more commonly known as brittle bones disease. The . hereditary condition means her body doesn't produce enough collagen - . the 'cement' that provides bones with strength and flexibility. Without sufficient levels the bones develop holes and fracture . easily. It means Kay can break a rib just by sneezing or if a friend hugs her too tightly. 'When I was 22 my friend cuddled me and . it broke one of my ribs. She was mortified but I thought it was funny. I . have to accept I can't stop things breaking,' she said. But . Ms Tate's positive attitude can't disguise the fact she is almost . constantly in pain and only finds relief when lying in a hot bath. 'It''s mind over matter,' she said. 'I've always had it so I've never known any different. I cope with it because there's no other choice.' She admits she finds it . frustrating having to ask friends to help her every time she need to go to . the supermarket as she can't risk carrying anything heavy. 'I . must think ahead all the time about possible hazards. If it's icy then I . can't walk or if there's a slippery floor I need to use my wheelchair,' she added. She also finds clothes shopping 'terrible' as she wears the equivalent to a child's size age six. 'I want to dress like everyone else so I often buy tops at River Island and wear them as dresses,' she said. 'But I can't wear heels in case I . fall over.' Kay must also deal with upsetting encounters with thoughtless strangers. She said: 'I was once at a cash point and the woman behind me was really close, so I looked around and asked her what she wanted. 'And she said ""oh sorry, I thought you were playing with it."" She thought I was a child.' Kay has learned to adapt to her condition and says she is determined to live her life 'properly.' The whites of her eyes are tinged blue, which is another sign of brittle bones . Kay broke her first bone on the day she was born, after she suffered a femur fracture during delivery. Both her mother and sister have less severe forms of the condition so doctors quickly realised she had brittle bones. She was wheel-chair bound until she was 14 because every time she tried to walk she would break something. However, she finally managed to start walking after having physiotherapy every day at school. Despite her difficulties Kay was never bullied at school. 'I was brought up to feel no different from anyone else so I was never insecure or embarrassed about my condition,' she said. This determination to live her own life led her to make the risky decision to have a baby when she was 19. 'Everyone told me not to consider having a baby but I just knew I could manage it,' she said. 'When . I became pregnant some family members were so scared for me they asked . me to consider an abortion but I would never do that. 'When . I was 27 weeks I fell over and broke my leg so had to stay in a wheel . chair. But it wasn't until 35 weeks that I had an elective caesarean at . the Royal Victoria Infirmary. 'Because Lewis was premature he had to go to intensive care for two weeks before I could take him home.' Doctors had warned Kay not to become pregnant but she said she 'knew' she would be able to cope . Ongoing battle: Kay has experienced frequent fractures since childhood (left) her latest operation fixed a plate to strengthen her right thigh bone (right) After three months doctors said Lewis had not inherited her condition. 'Now . I'm older I would only have another child if I could be sure they . didn't carry the defective gene,' Kay said. Life with brittle bones and a child has proved something of a challenge for Kay. 'When . he was 18months I couldn't pick him up any more so if he cried I would . sit with him instead. I had to tell family not to pick him up or he . would expect it all the time,' she said. 'We . had to adapt. Instead of lifting him into the buggy I would ask him to . climb in. He also learned early on how to stand on a block to get . himself a drink. 'By the time he was five he knew how to call 999 if I had an emergency or to get to my mother's house nearby to get help. 'The school has also been good in helping me teach him not to run across the road and to listen. 'He . doesn't really understand my condition - I think he just thinks I have a . permanently broken leg so that's why I can't play football.' Kay says she finds it most distressing if other adults assume she is a child when she is with her son. 'I was with Lewis at Christmas and a woman asked us ""are you . looking forward to santa coming?"" 'And I said ""well I am for him, but I . think I'm a bit old for all that."" 'I hate it if I'm with Lewis because I think they set a bad example and I'm trying to teach him the right way to behave.' Kay following her osteotomy in July 2011. It will take her body at least 18months to heal . Kay has undergone a number of operations to treat her condition. Most recently she had an osteotomy, which is to be featured on Channel 4's documentary series Embarrassing Bodies tonight. 'I had broken my femur (thigh bone) 30 times and it had healed in a crooked position so last year doctors deliberately broke the bone and straightened it before putting in a plate,' she said. 'This should fix it in the right position. It is healing slowly but it takes me at least twice as long as normal to recover.' Despite all her setbacks Kay, who is an ambassador for the Brittle Bones society remains bubbly and upbeat. 'I just think there is always someone worse than you,' she said. 'I won't die from this condition and I've learned there is no point not living my life properly as something will always break anyway. Six months ago I sneezed and broke a rib!

A spring bounce is being predicted for the housing market against the background of a glut of cheap home loans and a boom in demand from foreign buyers. Banks have cut mortgage rates in recent weeks, with some two year fixed rate deals at just 1.99 per cent, on the back of the Bank of Englandâs Funding for Lending Scheme. The Bank is allowing finance giants to borrow up to Â£60billion at a low interest rate on the proviso it is loaned to home buyers and businesses. Separately, buyers from the Far East, Europe and India are racing to buy new-build properties worth hundreds of millions of pounds in London. Sunny outlook: A spring bounce is being predicted for the housing market against the background of a glut of cheap home loans and a boom in demand from foreign buyers . Some Â£600million worth of homes, . which are to be built on the Battersea power station site, have just . been snapped up within four days. Prices . ranged from Â£343,000 for a studio to Â£6million for a luxury penthouse, . while the chief executive of the Battersea Power Station Development . Company, Rob Tincknell(correct), said: âItâs been like the start of the . Harrods sale. âWe had people queuing from 6.30am on Thursday and the London allocation sold out in days.â A . team of the developmentsâ agents are now moving on to Singapore to sell . the final 200 properties of the 800 to be built on the site. The . positive signals were echoed by the chief executive of the house . builder Taylor Wimpey, Pete Redfern, who said: âTwo weeks into 2013, . consumer sentiment towards the housing market is more positive than we . have seen in recent times.â A report published today by estate . agent members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) argues the housing market is âover the very worstâ. It said 24 per cent more agents are . predicting that property sales will increase rather than decrease over . the next three months. RICS . said prices held steady in December, and a net balance of 12per cent of . agents reported increases in new buyer inquiries rather than falls. Some Â£600million worth of homes, which are to be built on the Battersea power station site, have just been snapped up within four days . The group said that its findings add weight to previous forecasts that prices will rise by 2per cent during 2013 and provides evidence that the market has started to âbottom outâ. However, it pointed to a gaping market divide between London and the rest of the country. Strong demand from overseas buyers meant the capital continues to record relatively strong price growth. By contrast, there were falls in Wales and the North East. Significantly, prices in the West Midlands stabilised last month, making it the first time in more than two and-a-half years that prices have not fallen. The number of mortgage approvals has been climbing in recent months on the back of the Funding for Lending Scheme. Most of the new mortgage deals have, so far, been aimed at borrowers with bigger deposits, however lenders such as Barclays, the Yorkshire Building Society and the Co-operative Bank have recently announced loans for people with smaller deposits. Peter Bolton King, RICS global residential director, said: âAs we start the New Year, confidence in the housing market does appear to be improving, helped in part by the impact of the Funding for Leading scheme. âIndeed, our members are predicting that transaction levels will continue increasing in many parts of the country and it may be that we are now over the very worst.â Predictions for the housing market in 2013 have been mixed, with other surveys suggesting that prices will be flat or show a small drop this year. The Council of Mortgage Lenders expects sales to pick up amid better credit availability and lower mortgage rates. However, it cautioned that demand could be held back by the weakness of the economy and any rise in unemployment. Economists at Capital Economics, who have a long history of pessimism about the property market, remain cautious. The firm said: âThe Funding for Lending Scheme has helped to ease conditions in the mortgage market somewhat, leading to a marginal improvement in housing market activity. âBut we expect unemployment to start to rise and real earnings to fall yet again this year. With housing still overvalued on most metrics, that points to a year of gently declining prices.â",A report published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors argues the housing market is âover the very worstâ
"The gadget fires a speaker's words back to them causing them to stutter and then stop talking . 'Delayed Auditory Feedback' works because the brain does not like hearing the echo of the human voice . Research has found it works best during a speech, making it ideal for shutting up unpopular politicians . By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 2 March 2012 . It is a new gadget that could be straight out of George Orwell's 1984. Japanese researchers have invented the ultimate conversation killer and instrument of control - a machine that can shut someone up at will. Kazutaka Kurihara and Koji Tsukada have built a gun they call the 'Speech Jammer', which could be ideal for an unruly classroom or noisy library. It forces individuals into 'vocal submission', they say, and is accurate when fired from up to 30 metres away. Shut up! Japanese scientists say the 'Speech Jammer' can silence someone almost instantly . When it is shot at someone speaking it keeps them quiet almost instantly using a technique that stresses humans into silence by freezing their brain. The gun works by picking up speech with a microphone and after 0.2 seconds it fires the same noise back to the person who said it. This technique, called 'Delayed Auditory Feedback', is according to psychologists almost certain to interrupt your speech, make someone stutter and then render them totally silent. It is based on the theory that when we speak our brains need to hear . what comes out of our mouths but it is unsettling and debilitating to hear it twice. Silence is golden: This diagram from researchers shows that when fired the gun muddles the brain . It will not cause the person pain, but it will stress them into shutting up - recreating an uncomfortable feeling that most people will have experienced when they hear their own voice echo back to them during a phone call or on Skype. 'In general, human speech is jammed by giving back to the speakers their own utterances at a delay of a few hundred milliseconds,' the scientists say in a new research paper for the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology in Tskuba and at Ochanomizu University, both in Japan. 'This effect can disturb people without any physical discomfort, and disappears immediately by stop speaking. From the back: The gun has easy to use functions to ensure when fired from distance it can accurately silence someone . 'Our natural utterances are jammed when the auditory feedback is artificially delayed. It is thought that this delay affects some cognitive processes in our brain.' A preliminary study has found that it worked best when used on someone reading a pre-prepared speech rather than more spontaneous chat, meaning it would be perfect to quieten your least favourite politician. But the device is not all bad, because it could improve the lives of people with a speech impediment. It is understood the gun could help improve speech for someone with a stammer. Delayed auditory feedback (DAF) has been shown to improve fluency in many individuals with the problem.","The gadget fires a speaker's words back to them causing them to stutter and then stop talking .

The father of one of the Navy SEALs who was killed in the Libya consulate raid has launched another attack on President Obama's handling of the crisis, saying: 'It's better to die the death of a hero than it is to live the life of a coward.' Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods, revealed his suspicion that Obama was 'responsible for the death of my son' - but he insisted he was not angry at the President. He previously made headlines when he slammed Joe Biden for acting inappropriately during the repatriation ceremony for his son's body.

Speaking to Geraldo Rivera on Fox . News on Monday, Mr Woods returned to his criticism of the . administration, arguing that the consulate raid was in fact 'an attack . on American soil' and merited a more forceful military response. Addressing the President directly, he . asked: 'If this attack on American citizens, on American soil, happened . 2,000 miles away from Washington DC - say in Los Angeles or in Seattle - . would you have waited seven hours before you sent the first airplane? 'Would you have waited seven hours until the attack was over?' Cold: Charles Woods also criticised Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for their demeanour when they met him . However, Mr Woods denied that he was motivated by bitterness, saying: 'First of all, I am not angry at all. 'In fact, Mr President, if I had the . opportunity of speaking to you face to face, and I would really love to, . I would say this: Mr President, I respect your office. However, if you . are responsible for the death of my son, I totally forgive you. 'This is about honor, courage and . about love for America.

'If you are responsible for the death of my son, I forgive you, I love you. I also love America.' Mr Woods last week told Glenn Beck . that he was disappointed by his meeting with senior officials at the . event marking the return of the dead men's bodies. He . said that Biden had acted inappropriately, asking the Woods family in a . 'loud and boisterous' tone, 'Did your son always have balls the size of . cue balls?' Mr Woods asked, 'Are these the words of someone who is sorry?' Violent: Tyrone died during an Islamist assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11 . The President, by contrast, was apparently much more subdued, to the point of coldness. 'When he finally came over to where . we were, I could tell that he was rather conflicted, a person who was . not at peace with himself,' Mr Woods said. 'Shaking . hands with him, quite frankly, was like shaking hands with a dead fish. His face was pointed towards me but he would not look me in the eye, . his eyes were over my shoulder. 'I could tell that he was not sorry. He had no remorse.' When . Mr Woods met Hillary Clinton, she made a reference to the U.S.-made . YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought . to have been behind the attack. 'When she said that, I could tell that she was not telling me the truth,' he said. Aftermath: The events leading up to the raid are still under official investigation six weeks later . His recollection of the reception differs sharply from that of Tyrone's mother, who last month took to Facebook to praise the officials who organised the event. Writing about the repatriation of her son's body, Cheryl Croft Bennett said: 'The entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal. 'Little did I know that I would find myself in a reception room being comforted, hugged, and, yes, even kissed by the President of the United States. Along with the President, there was Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and General and Mrs Colin Powell. 'They were all wonderful. They held my hand, offered condolences, gave warm hugs, and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss, as I fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my SEAL son.' Mr Woods also denounced the White House for officials' failure to protect the four Americans, saying: 'They denied the pleas for help and they watched my son die.' Victim: Ambassador Chris Stevens, pictured here with a Libyan shopkeeper, died in the attack . Fallen: Diplomat Sean Smith, left, and SEAL Glen Doherty, right, were the other two American victims . In a statement he described Tyrone as 'a true American hero' who had 'voluntarily sacrificed his life to protect the lives of other Americans'. He called for further investigation of the circumstance of the attack, concluding: 'This is an opportunity for the person or persons who made the decision to sacrifice my son's life to stand up.' This is not the first time a parent of one of the victims has publicly spoken out against the President's handling of the tragedy. Sean Smith's mother Pat has slammed Obama for describing the situation as 'not optimal', telling MailOnline, 'It's . insensitive to say my son is not very optimal - he is also very dead.' She added: 'I am still waiting for the truth to . come out and I still want to know the truth. I'm finally starting to get . some answers but I won't give up.' The Benghazi raid has become one of the most divisive issues in the presidential battle between Obama and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney. GOP congressmen have accused the White House and the State Department of misleading the nation by pinning the attack on the anti-Islam video, entitled Innocence of Muslims, when there were early signs that it had been a premeditated terrorist operation. In addition, government officials have been criticised for scaling back security in Benghazi over the summer, despite Stevens' concerns about his safety and that of his team.","Charles Woods, father of SEAL Tyrone, sharply criticises President .

"Lufti claims she shaved head to beat hair strand drug test . Her parents contend he crushed up tablets and put them in her food . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:55 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:50 EST, 19 October 2012 . Civil case: Sam Lufti alleged Britney Spears, pictured last week was once addicted to amphetamine . Britney Spears' former bodyguard has revealed explosive revelations about the singer, claiming she was once hooked on prescription drugs, downing up to 30 a day, and was in such a grip of addiction she shaved her head to beat a drugs test. Joe Schleimer, lawyer for Spears' former manager Sam Lutfi made the bombshell claim in opening statements at Los Angeles Superior Court. Lutfi is suing Spears, her mother Lynne and father Jamie for defamation, breach of contract and libel. 'She liked to use amphetamines. Mostly everything that went wrong was because of this drug,' Mr Schleimer told the jury on Thursday, alleging that Mr Lutfi was made a scapegoat for the singer's mental breakdown back in 2008. Schleimer told the jury that Spears had a 'prescription for amphetamines, and overdosed on them' before being put in the involuntary 5150 hold. Lutfi felt that Spears should not perform at the 2007 MTV Awards as she was still overweight and did not rehearse. However 'Britney wouldn't hear it.' The star's subsequent lacklustre performance at the ceremony was roundly criticised . Schleimer added that Lutfi was trying to help the singer but lost control in a series of events that led to her being hospitalised and placed under a court-ordered conservator. Lutfi is also seeking a share of the singer's fortunes, claiming he had an agreement to serve as her manager in exchange for 15 percent of her earnings. Schleimer conceded the case would be a complicated one. His opening statements included flashing photos of Spears with a shaved head and striking an SUV with an umbrella back in 2007 during a period of her life which he described as a 'complete shambles.' He said one of Lutfi's first actions after being hired as manager was having drug-sniffing dogs search the singer's hilltop home. He claimed Spears favoured . amphetamines and that the dogs turned up a substance the Grammy-award winner . told Lutfi was probably crystal meth. Turned sour: Lutfi, pictured with Spears in 2008,was once an integral part of the singer's camp but is now suing his former client and her parents for defamation and breach of contract . But Jurors are unlikely to hear directly . from the singer, who remains under a conservatorship overseen by a judge . who has ordered her not to appear for trial or a deposition. Superior Court Judge Susan Bruguera told Schleimer during a break in . proceedings that all the accusations he raised during his opening . statement should be supported by evidence to be presented at trial. Schleimer said he would prove them through either 'testimony or documentary evidence.' Attorneys for Spears' parents and conservators will have their own opportunity to present opening remarks to jurors. Lutfi and Spears' parents, Jamie and Lynne, were all in court as Schleimer made his opening statements to the panel of eight women and four men; Britney's parents took notes throughout. Jamie Spears did not look up at the photos of his daughter that Schleimer displayed. Lacklustre: Lutfi claims he did not want Spears taking part in the 2007 MTV awards but she 'wouldn't hear it' Lutfi is seeking millions of dollars from Spears and her family, claiming her mother's Lynne's 2008 book: Through the Storm: A Real Story of Fame and Family in a Tabloid World, lied about him drugging and isolating the pop superstar. He is also seeking a portion of the singer's profits, claiming he was a key player in her 2007 album Blackout and had the right to serve as her manager for years. The case is the culmination of years of acrimony between Lutfi and Spears' family and conservators, who successfully obtained a restraining order against him to keep him from contacting the singer or trying to intervene in her life. The order has expired, but conservatorship attorneys are seeking repayment for more than $93,000 in legal fees - a judgement Lutfi is appealing. Lutfi sued back in February 2009, roughly a year after Spears was hospitalised and placed under the conservatorship to take control of her health and finances. The move by Jamie Spears came after months of erratic behaviour by his daughter, including shaving her head, speaking in a British accent and other bizarre incidents that also led to her losing custody of her two sons with ex-husband Kevin Federline. Lutfi was a constant presence around Spears during this tumultuous period of her life, her parents accused of him of crushing tablets into her food. It's also been claimed  that Britney was going broke during her time with Lufti. With no source of income, the star - who was worth $32 million - was spending $700 a month, paying huge legal bills in her custody case with ex-Kevin Federline and renting luxury mansions, one of which she spent just three nights in. In his court case he maintains that he was trying to help her, though her parents say Lutfi cut her phone line, hid her cellphones and used the paparazzi as 'henchmen.' He also said that Britney shaved her hair to avoid the courts finding drug residue - which can remain in the strands for months after use. Turned life around: Britney now has a role as a U.S. X Factor judge and plans to wed agent Jason Trawick . Schleimer claimed Lutfi befriended . the paparazzi so that they would treat Spears with more respect and . claims he tried to assemble top talent agents to jumpstart her career. 'Sam was trying to find top notch people to work with Britney,' he told the court. Lufti is also planning to call Lourdes Torres to testify that Britney is being controlled by her parents via the conservatorship. 'Lulu ended up quitting her job because she was so disturbed by what she saw was happening to Britneyâ¦Luluâs testimony could have significant impact on the jury because she spent a great deal of time with Britney and her parents after the conservatorship was put in place. Lulu isnât after money, she just wants the truth to come out and it will be shocking,' a source told Radar. Many of the claims about Lufti were included in court filings used to obtain the conservatorship, but Lynne Spears also included them in her book. Lutfi . is suing for libel based on three chapters in the book that describe . him as a 'general' to the paparazzi and portray him as a man trying to . manipulate not only the singer, but also her mother. Although she is still under conservatorship, Spears is now firmly back on track with a role as a judge on X Factor USA. She is also now preparing to . marry long-term love Jason Trawick. The court case resumes tomorrow.","Lufti claims she shaved head to beat hair strand drug test .

Teenagers who do not have the internet are at a serious disadvantage in their education, a study shows. Pupils whose families have a computer are likely to achieve higher grades because the benefits of such technology outweighs any perceived risks. Hundreds of thousands of British kids are unable to access the internet at home either because parents cannot afford it or fear the disruptive affects of social networking websites. The study found that teenagers who did not have internet access at home were at a major social and educational disadvantage . The study by Oxford University, . carried out between 2008 and 2011, estimated about ten per cent of the . teenagers were without online connectivity at home - with most living in . poorer households. The . Office of National Statistics suggests this dropped to five per cent in . 2012 but that still leaves around 300,000 children without internet . access in their homes. Those without have a strong sense of being 'educationally disadvantaged', according to a survey of over a thousand households and interviews with more than two hundred teenagers and their families. The study by Oxford University, carried out between 2008 and 2011, estimated about ten per cent of the teenagers were without online connectivity at home - with most living in poorer households. The Office of National Statistics suggests this dropped to five per cent in 2012 but that still leaves around 300,000 children without internet access in their homes. Teenagers said they felt shut out of their peer group socially and also disadvantaged in their studies as so much of the work set for them to do at home required online research or preparation. There was a high level of anxiety among parents about the potential of social networking sites to distract children and some despaired at their tendency to multitask on mobile devices. But researchers at the university's department of education found there are substantial educational advantages in teenagers being able to access the internet at home. One teenager, whose parents had separated, explained he would ring his father who had internet access and any requested materials were then mailed to him through the post. Dr Rebecca Eynon said: 'While it's difficult to state a precise figure for teenagers without access to the internet at home the fact remains in the UK there is something like 300,000 young people who do not - and that's a significant number. 'Behind the statistics our qualitative research shows these disconnected young people are clearly missing out both educationally and socially.' One 14 year-old boy said: ""We get coursework now in Year 9 to see what groups we're going to go in Year 10. The emergence of tablets has seen many teenagers using them for homework and running educational apps. Now, those without could be at a disadvantage, researchers say. 'And people with internet, they can get higher marks because they can like research on the internet...my friends are probably on it [MSN] all the day every day. 'And like they talk about it in school, what happened on MSN.' Another 15 year-old said: 'It was bell gone and I have a lot of things that I could write and I was angry that I haven't got a computer because I might finish it at home when I've got lots of time to do it. 'But because when I'm at school I need to do it very fast.' Strikingly, this study contradicts claims that others have made about the potential risks of such technologies adversely affecting the ability of teenagers to concentrate on serious study. The study contained in a new book Teenagers and Technology being published by Routledge in January found no evidence to support this. It showed the internet has opened up far more opportunities for young people to do their learning at home. Co-author Dr Chris Davies said: 'Parental anxiety about how teenagers might use the very technologies they have bought their own children at considerable expense is leading some to discourage their children from becoming confident users. 'The evidence, based on the survey and hundreds of interviews, shows parents have tended to focus on the negative side - especially the distracting effects of social networking sites - without always seeing the positive use their children often make of being online.' Teenagers' experiences of Facebook appear to be mixed. Some teens claimed that using Facebook regularly caused arguments between friends . Although some regarded the site as an integral part of their social life others were concerned about the number of arguments that had escalated due to others wading in as a result of comments and photographs being posted. The age of teenagers using Facebook for the first time was found to go down over the three year period from around 16 years old in 2008 to 12 or 13 by 2011. Even the very youngest teenagers who were not particularly interested felt under some peer pressure to join. But the study also suggests the popularity of Facebook is waning with teenagers now exploring other forms of social networking. Dr Davies said: 'There is no steady state of teenage technology use - fashions and trends are constantly shifting and things change very rapidly when they do change.'","300,000 British children do not have online access at home .

IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the Budget in March would be a good time to slow the pace of austerity . George Osborne should curb Britainâs austerity plan within months, the International Monetary Fund warned today. The Chancellor was told the economy still âlooks badâ and the Budget in March would be a âgood timeâ to reconsider his Plan A programme of cuts. Growth forecasts for this year have been downgraded from 1.1 per cent to just 1 per cent, amid growing fears of a âtriple dipâ recession. IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard said the anaemic growth in the UK meant Mr Osborne had to reconsider the decision to impose deep spending cuts across government. âWe've never been passionate about austerity. From the beginning we have always emphasised that fiscal consolidation should be slow and steady,â he told BBC Radio 4âs Today programme. âWe said that if things look bad at the beginning of 2013 - which they do - then there should be a reassessment of fiscal policy. We still believe that,â he said. Mr Osborne has previously relied on the support of the IMF for his plan to deal with the nationâs debts. But Mr Blanchard said the time had come for the change of tack, and Mr Osborne should use the Budget on March 20 to put the brakes on cuts to public spending. âYou have a budget coming in March and we think that would be a good time to take stock and make some adjustments,â he said. âWe think that slower fiscal consolidation in some form may well be appropriate.â Chancellor George Osborne is urged to slow the pace of spending cuts in the Budget, due on March 20 . There are concerns that official . growth figures for the last three months of 2012, due to be published . tomorrow, will show the economy shrank, adding to pressure on Mr Osborne . to ease his approach. Mr . Blanchard said the global economy was ânot out of the woods yetâ and . governments had to be prepared to rethink they austerity approach. Yesterday the IMF trimmed its forecast for UK and global economic growth this year and next year. Britain will only expand by 1 per cent in 2012-13, according to the respected body, 0.1 per cent less than previously predicted. The forecast for next year has been downgraded from 2.2 per cent to 1.9 per cent since October. The IMF's World Economic Outlook update predicted that the global economy would grow 0.1 per cent less than anticipated in each year, by 3.5 per cent and 4.1 per cent respectively. Much of the reduction stemmed from a weaker outlook for the eurozone. âPolicy actions have lowered acute crisis risks in the euro area and the United States. But in the euro area, the return to recovery after a protracted contraction is delayed,â the IMF said. Labour's Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, said: 'David Cameron and George Osborne must finally heed the IMFâs advice. 'They have repeatedly warned that a change of course would be needed in Britain if the economy turns out worse than expected. After two and a half years of flatlining and a double-dip recession the IMF is now clearly losing patience.' A Treasury spokesman said: 'As the Governor of the Bank of England said this week, the UK economy is moving in the right direction. 'Yesterdayâs report by the IMF highlights the continuing challenges facing the global economy. It also emphasises that advanced economies âneed steady and sustained fiscal consolidationâ.

A teenager held as a captive sex slave in a house for more than three years before escaping with a relative's help initially went there voluntarily but wasn't allowed to leave when she wanted to go home, an Illinois police chief said on Friday. Washington Park Police Chief David Clark said the 19-year-old St. Louis woman bolted from the home on Monday and told investigators her time in captivity included almost daily beatings and sexual assaults. One of those attacks resulted in a now-2-year-old boy rescued when a police SWAT team raided the home next to a gas station on Thursday and arrested a 25-year-old man and his mother, Clark said. Saved: The teenager's baby is carried away by the SWAT team after it was rescued from the home in Illinois . Horrific abuse: The teenager told police she escaped her daily torment earlier this week with a relative's help . According to Washington Park police, the woman claims she was held . against her will for more than 2 years as a sex slave at the house on . Kingshighway by the 25-year-old man and his family. A boy, aged 16, was also removed from the home in his school uniform, according to BND.com. The police chief said the three days between the teen's report and the raid on the home was largely spent substantiating her story. Clark also said investigators were working a separate sexual-assault case and lacked the manpower to go any faster. No charges have been filed in the case. Clark wouldn't publicly identify the suspect - originally reported as 17-years old - his mother or the teenager, citing the ongoing investigation. He said investigators planned to have the child's DNA tested to determine whether the man is his father. St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly, the county's top prosecutor, told The Associated Press on Friday that conditions in the home were 'definitely deplorable.' Initial evidence suggests that 'some of the details are consistent with what the young lady is saying, and I think there's something to it.' he said. 'We're still trying to figure out what the heck is going on.' Hideaway: A man passes outside the home where the 19-year-old St. Louis woman claims she was held captive for more than three years before managing to escape on Monday . Aided kidnapping: The young woman told police that the mother of the 25-year-old man arrested helped her falsify her name during child birth two years ago to prevent her rescue . Baby: A baby stroller rests alongside the home where the young woman claims having given birth to her kidnapper's child . Clark said the teenager met the man socially 'through someone else when they were partying, and a relationship built,' eventually leading to her visit of his home about the time she was reported missing. 'When she (soon) decided to go back to her parents, he wouldn't allow it,' Clark said. She was listed as a missing . or runaway juvenile on April 6, 2010 in St Louis, Missouri, close to . the state line. She was 15 years old when she disappeared. He said the man's mother helped detain the young woman and helped falsify medical records when she bore her son in the first year of her captivity. The teen told investigators the man and his mother coerced her into using a false name when giving birth to conceal that she was under-aged, Clark said. The young woman has told police she repeatedly tried to escape the house, which is on Washington Park's busiest street and next door to a convenience store, just a half mile from a freeway. But her captor chased her down each time and forced her back to the home at gunpoint, Clark said. Conditions: The home was described by police to have been in deplorable conditions, with six mattresses seen stacked in its backyard . Captivity: Local children look on as SWAT teams swarm the home in Washington Park, Illinois, next to a Mobil garage, where the woman said she was held for more than two years and repeatedly raped . Dramatic raid: Heavily-armed officers swarmed the home yesterday afternoon with their assault rifles drawn . Washington Park is a village of 4,200 people tucked on the edge of East St. Louis in one of Illinois' poorest regions. Known for its strip clubs and poverty, the community has grappled for years with corruption and violent crime punctuated by the 2010 shooting death of the village's mayor, John Thornton. The village twice has filed for bankruptcy since 2004, the last time in 2009. Neighbors told The Associated Press they had little reason to suspect anything amiss at the one-story bungalow on a parcel cluttered with trash, including a stack of six mildewing mattresses on a concrete slab surrounded by tall weeds. A child's car seat, baby stroller and car tires were nearby. A neighbor, Lakeitha Smith, opened her front door a crack and told the AP that during the few times she saw the young woman outside, the teenager didn't appear bruised or traumatized. Smith said the man would step away from the home at times with the toddler, who 'looked like a healthy baby,' and often came to Smith's house, where he played with her 3-year-old son. Rescue: A baby was taken from the home in Washington Park, Illinois where his mother had been held captive . Disappearance: The 19-year-old has been described as missing or a runaway by police since 2010 . 'They was like normal people,' Smith said. 'I really didn't know what was going on over there. I never knew it was something like that.' 'I used to see her come out of the house, back and forth,' Smith said. 'I didn't think she was being held hostage in the house.' The teenager and the toddler taken from the home were later turned over to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services. Her ordeal has been compared . to international bestselling novel Room by Emma Donoghue which tells a similar story of a woman who was abducted and held captive by a man who fathers a . child with her.

Apparently it's not just the weight of the evidence against a defendant that matters at trial. Male jurors are 'significantly more likely' to convict an obese woman than a slender one when both females are accused of the very same crime, according to a new study by Yale researchers. Fat bias: Yale researchers asked 471 mock jurors to evaluate photographs of slender - as well as obese - defendants in arriving at their shocking findings . In order to arrive at the findings, the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity team presented 471 mock jurors the details of a hypothetical case of check fraud, along with images of four fake defendants - two men and two women. One photograph depicted a portly man; one a slender man; a third a svelte woman, and a fourth a larger female. The mock jurors then rated the pretend defendants' guilt on a five-point scale, given their appearances. And not only did male jurors generally rate the guilt of the fatter woman higher than that of the slender woman, the bias was greater if it was a thin man who was deciding their fate. Twelve biased men: Like the iconic movie that long-ago explored a jury's bias based on a defendant's race, the Yale survey explored another kind of prejudice . Male participants with trim waistlines were, the study found, more likely to label fat women 'repeat offenders' with 'awareness' of their crimes than the slender defendants. âAccording to research ...the . prevalence of weight-based stigmatization is now on par with rates of . racial discrimination,â Natasha . Schvey, lead author of the study, reportedly said. âThe present study identifies yet another setting in which obese persons are vulnerable to bias and discrimination.â Interestingly, the male jurors' bias did not apply to the hypothetical fat male check fraudster. How does the jury find: The study found the bias against obese women was more pronounced among men with trim waistlines . On that point, the study, which was published online in the International Journal of Obesity, discovered no concrete disparity between how guilty the jurors thought the portly man was versus his slender, male counterpart. As for the women who participated, researchers also found no evidence the size of the person in question mattered when they made their decision about their guilt. The study, a copy of which was obtained by The Mail, takes a stab at why the findings were so. 'Obese individuals are vulnerable to negative societal attitudes, stigma and prejudice in multiple domains,' the study read. 'Driving such discrimination and bias are stereotypes that depict overweight individuals as greedy, lazy, unmotivated and lacking in self discipline and will power.'","Researchers at the Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity at Yale University discovered the shocking bias in a recent survey of 471 mock jurors .

A boy who shot his neo-Nazi father in the head at age 10 has been found guilty of murder by a California judge. Joseph Hall, now 12, was convicted of killing Jeff Hall, 32, despite arguments from defense lawyers . that the child was beaten and kicked by his abusive father and that he was too young to understand what he was doing. Riverside Superior Court Judge Jean Leonard found that Joseph was legally responsible for the death, but opted for a lesser charge of second-degree murder - indicating that the killing was not premeditated as prosecutors had argued. Troubled: Joseph Hall was just 10 when he admitted to shooting his father in the head at point blank range while he slept . Neo-Nazi: Jeff Hall, 32, was a regional leader of the white supremacist group the National Socialist Movement - though prosecutors argue that had nothing to do with his murder . Prosecutors say the boy has a history of violent behavior - choking his teacher, stabbing his sister and clubbing his uncle - and that he planned the killing because he didn't like his father. He will be sentenced on February 15 and could remain in custody until he is 23 - the maximum possible sentence for a juvenile his age. Joseph could be sent to a juvenile detention lockup or could spend the time in a private care facility that would provide treatment, therapy and schooling. Defense lawyers have argued for the latter sentence. Jeff Hall was the regional leader of the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group and was an outspoken white supremacist. Prosecutors have urged Judge Leonard to ignore Hall's racist affiliations - arguing that they have no bearing on the murder trial. Joseph's younger sister bolstered the prosecution's case last week by testifying that the boy plotted the shooting days in advance. 'This boy laid awake and thought about shooting his father. He told investigators that he ""thought this thing between father and son had to end,""' Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Mike Soccio said last week, according to the Desert Sun. Prosecutors say he waited until Jeff Hall passed out drunk on the couch after an argument with his wife and then retrieved his father's Rossi .357 magnum revolver and shot him in the head at point-blank range. Prosecutors argue that the child killed his father to keep him from . splitting up with his stepmother, who at first said she had killed . 32-year-old Jeff Hall but then quickly retracted her statement. She was . not charged in the case. Brutal: Joseph Hall, age 10 at the time, admitted to using his father's .357 magnum revolver to shoot him in the head at point blank range . Abusive: Defense lawyers said Jeff Hall beat and kicked his son and that he raised in children in a household infected by violence . Joseph admitted to the shooting and told police that he didn't think he would be prosecuted because he saw an episode of the TV crime drama criminal minds where a young boy killed his abusive father and wasn't arrested. 'A bad father did something to his kids and the kid did the exact same thing I did - he shot him,â the boy said in a video recording of an interview played at the trial. âHe told the truth and wasn't arrested and the cops believed him. He wasn't in trouble or anything. I thought maybe the exact same thing would happen to me,â Joseph said. Defense attorney Matthew Hardy said his client grew up in an abusive and . violent environment and learned it was acceptable to kill people who . were a threat. Hardy contended the boy thought if he shot his dad, the . violence would end. 'He was kept in an environment where he was conditioned to use violence. He learned that from his dad,' Hardy told the judge. He said the California Department of Public Social Services received 20 complaints about the Hall household over seven years, but never took action. Joseph was also permanently expelled from elementary school. 'Society told him, ""Youâre all alone, kid,""' Hardy told the judge. Prosecutors, though, say Joseph - even by age 10 - had a history of using violence to get what he wanted. He choked a teacher, stabbed his little sister and hit his uncle in the head with a club, according to authorities.","Joseph Hall was kicked and beaten by his father and grew up in a household infected by violence, defense lawyer say .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 16:49 EST, 7 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:10 EST, 8 November 2012 . Dr Justin Welby, Bishop of Durham, has emerged as favourite to become the new Archbishop of Canterbury . A former oil industry executive who opposes same sex marriage and the appointment of gay bishops emerged yesterday as the favoured candidate to take over as the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Bishop of Durham, the Right Reverend Justin Welby, will be announced as the successor to Dr Rowan Williams in the next 48 hours, sources at Westminster said. The confirmation that the 56-year-old is the choice to take over as head of the established Church comes after months of tortured deliberations and less than a year after Dr Welby took up his first appointment as a bishop. The long delay - Dr Welby has been widely named as the leading contender for the job for the past three months - has led to charges that the leadership of the CofE is hopelessly divided. It has even exposed the Church to mockery from bookmakers who stopped taking bets over the appointment, saying they were worried that clerics are trying to stage a betting coup. An old Etonian, whose mother was private secretary to Winston Churchill, Dr Welby is thought to have been preferred because of the managerial skills developed during his career as an oil industry executive before he joined the Church. The new Archbishop will bring an experienced eye to back the Churchâs criticisms of unethical practice in banking and in industry, and he is also thought to be likely to be more sympathetic to David Cameronâs modernising Tory instincts than the instinctively left wing Dr Williams. He is considered an opponent of same sex marriage and the appointment of gay bishops. But he is likely to be much less abrasive in his opposition to the gay rights movement than his defeated opponent for the Archbishopâs post, the one-time favourite, the Archbishop of York, the Right Reverend John Sentamu. Dr Sentamu is thought to have lost ground because of his conservative thinking on some social issues, although he is in agreement with the CofEâs liberal establishment in his criticisms of the excesses of capitalism. His ability to command public attention may also have failed to endear him to some CofE insiders who prefer a more straight-laced brand of leadership. The new Archbishop will move into Lambeth Palace after Dr Williams becomes Master of Magdalene College in Cambridge, where he spent many years as an academic, in December. The new Archbishop will replace Dr Rowan Williams who is to become Master of Magdalene College in Cambridge . Dr Welby, whose mother and father were divorced when he was two, has himself been happily married for more than 30 years. He has three daughters and two sons. His own father was sent to America in 1929 after his family lost their money and went on to make his own living as a bootlegger at the end of the Prohibition era. Archbishop of York, John Sentamu, was favourite for the post but is thought to have lost ground due to some of his conservative views on social issues . The father, Gavin Welby, is also said at one stage to have dated actress Vanessa Redgrave. The relationship is said to have ended after her family decided he was âa rotten piece of workâ. Dr Welby went to Eton and Trinity, Cambridge, and then to a high-flying career as a financial director in the oil business. He was treasurer of exploration company Enterprise Oil in 1987 when he quit industry for the Church. He became rector of a church in Southam in Warwickshire in 1995, joined the staff of Coventry Cathedral in 2002, and was made Dean of Liverpool, leading the cityâs Anglican cathedral, in 2007. He was consecrated as Bishop of Durham - number five in the hierarchy of CofE bishops - at the end of October last year. While he has little experience running a diocese he has spent years dealing with ordinary parishioners as a local priest - something missing from his predecessorâs job qualifications. Dr Williams has been known in the Church as a theologian and intellectual. By contrast Dr Welbyâs published writing has been mainly about the ethics of finance and management. Dr Welby appears to have made few enemies during his Church career and is not identified with any one of its warring factions. This could help him as he tries to steer the Church through its troubles over gay rights. Dr Williams, who was considered a supporter by the gay rights lobby, lost the backing of some fellow liberals for good after he blocked the appointment of gay rights champion Dr Jeffrey John as a bishop soon after he arrived at Lambeth Palace. Dr Williams announced his decision to resign in the last week of March this year. The new Archbishop will move into Lambeth Palace, pictured, replacing current incumbent Dr Rowan Williams (addressing the media in the picture) The 16 members of Crown Nominations Commission, the committee that recommends a successor to the Prime Minister, were appointed in April under the leadership of former Tory minister Lord Luce. Their failure to agree a name at a meeting in September led to speculation over division, over the development of an anyone-but-Sentamu faction, and the lack of enthusiastic support for Dr Welby. However, Dr Welby has been consistently spoken of as the likely successor through the autumn. Further delay would mean the Church would go into a meeting of its Parliament, the General Synod, in 10 daysâ time, without a figurehead beyond December. The authority of a new Archbishop would provide a boost for CofE hopes of at last passing its law allowing women to become bishops. Bookmakers last night mocked the Church because of the risk of a betting coup over the new Archbishop. Major chains suspended betting after a flood of money backing Dr Welby. The price on the Bishop of Durham dropped in a day from seven to four to odds on one to two. Graham Sharpe of William Hill said: âHeavens above, if it does turn out to be Justin Welby we wonât be âholyâ surprised but will be left wondering whether anything is sacred, as this race always seems to end with a betting coup. âIn the space of less than an hour we had to cut the odds three times, so took the decision to close the book as we know a decision is already overdue and it seems word may have leaked out.â Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: âPunters were backing Welby like defeat was out of the question. The money weâve seen suggests an announcement is only moments away. 'Perhaps people thought weâd be too preoccupied with events in America to spot a gamble on the next Archbishop of Canterbury.â","Sources at Westminster say that the Right Reverend Justin Welby will be announced as successor to Dr Rowan Williams in the next 48 hours .

Food prices should be raised to stop housewives throwing out so much, a hereditary peer has said. The Countess of Mar, one of only 92 members of the House of Lords who inherited their seats, made the contentious call following revelations that Britons waste up to half of their weekly groceries. Lady Mar - who is a specialist cheese producer and has her own breed of âMar goatsâ on her extensive Worcester estate - made the call despite food prices rocketing in recent years and many families being forced to turn to foodbanks. Half of all food we buy from supermarkets goes in the bin, despite much of it being perfectly edible, according to a report published last week by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Thrown away: Lady Mar, pictured in 1999, says too much food is wasted and higher food prices would deter families from chucking away groceries . But experts blamed the waste on the confusion caused by sell-by dates as well as âbuy one, get one freeâ offers that encourage overbuying. They did not blame it on low prices. Lady Mar, who has sat as a cross-bench peer since inheriting her fatherâs title in 1975, said higher prices would make people think twice. She told the House of Lords yesterday: âFood in this country is too cheap. It costs the price of its production in most cases. If it gave the farmers a bit more profit, householders, housewives perhaps, who prepare food would be more careful about wasting it.â Yet food inflation was at 3.8per cent in the three months to December last year. Economists have warned that prices will rise further in coming months after a drought in America last year destroyed nearly half of the corn and more than a third of soya bean crops. Russia and the Ukraine also had very bad crop yields, putting pressure on prices. Rural Affairs minister Lord de Mauley told peers he âwould not wish anything in the way of increases in food prices on consumersâ. Up to half of all food is thrown away, according to research. Much of it is perfectly edible . He said the government was already trying to tackle waste with landfill taxes. Lady Marâs remarks were also panned for being wildly out of touch by Labourâs agriculture spokeswoman, Mary Creagh, who said: âAt a time when family budgets are being squeezed by food inflation and stagnant wages, it is astonishing that the Countess of Mar wants food prices to rise.â She added: âThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs figures show that we are in a nutritional recession with people on low incomes buying less food and eating less fresh fruit and vegetables than five years ago. This year, 250,000 people will turn to food banks to help feed their families. Perhaps the Countess should visit one to get back in touch with reality.â Liberal Democrat Lord Greaves said the report on food waste, by the showed âa shocking example of inefficiency within the capitalist free market we haveâ. But Labourâs Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale called for a change in the âridiculous use of best beforeâ dates instead. He also called for an end of the âdominance of almost perfect-looking potatoes and apples and other forms of vegetables and fruit in our shops.â Dumped: But a Lib Dem spokesman said the poor were already suffering from high food prices . Lord de Mauley said the government had already published guidance for the industry on best by or expiry dates: âUse by or sell by labels should only be used when the safety of food cannot be guaranteed after that date. Most other food should have a best before date only to indicate when the food is no longer at its best but still safe to eat.â Lady Mar can trace her title back to the 1st Earl of Mar in 115. It is one of the oldest earldoms in Scotland. She has been married three times and has a daughter, interior designer Lady Susan Helen of Mar, who goes by the title of the Mistress of Mar. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: âThe Countess may be surprised to hear that the price of food has been rising pretty steadily for a while now. 'For most people thatâs not something to celebrate. In tough times we should be making life easier for people who are feeling the squeeze, not hiking up food prices.â","Lady Mar says a spike in prices would deter the waste of food .

A Tory MP was criticised after referring to catering staff in the House of Commons as âservantsâ. Christopher Chope, MP for Christchurch in Dorset, was calling for lower prices in the dining rooms, arguing few MPs were using them.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:19 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:19 EST, 24 January 2013 . A jury is deadlocked by one vote in charging a Florida woman with the murder of 4-year-old foster child Rilya Wilson who disappeared after being barbarically locked in a cage more than a decade ago. Jurors in Miami-Dade County revealed a vote of 11 to 1 on Thursday in charging 67-year-old Geralyn Graham with the child's murder which carries a potential life sentence. The note did not say which side had the majority or what the verdicts were on kidnapping and aggravated child abuse charges, which carry less severe sentences than murder. Verdict is in: A verdict in the death of 4-year-old foster child Rilya Wilson, pictured, has been reached by jurors but with a deadlock by one vote on charging a Florida woman with murder . Prosecutors said Graham, who was Rilya's caretaker, smothered the girl with a pillow in December of 2000 before disposing of her body, which has still never been found. The jury could opt for a less severe manslaughter charge rather than murder. All verdicts must be unanimous. 'All of us are depending on you to make a wise and legal decision in this matter,' Circuit Judge Marisa Tinkler Mendez told jurors earlier in the day. After more than three additional hours of deliberations Mendez ordered the panel to return on Friday morning to continue. Authorities long suspected Graham in Rilya's disappearance, but didn't charge her until 2005 when prosecutors said she confessed to an inmate while serving time on an unrelated fraud charge. That purported jailhouse confession by Graham to career criminal Robin Lunceford became key evidence against her after Luceford said Graham told her she did it because Rilya was evil and demonic. Before that in November, shocking court testimony and evidence revealed Rilya was kept in a dog cage, tied to her bed with plastic restraints and forced for long periods to stay in a small laundry room as punishment for disobedience. Trial: Rilya (right) disappeared in 2000 aged four. Her foster mother, Geralyn Graham, now 67, is on trial more than a dozen years later . Caged: Detra Coakley Winfield testifies in a Miami-Dade Criminal Court last November about the steel dog cage, left, she loaned Geralyn Graham to put Rilya Wilson in before the four-year-old child disappeared . 'She was being brutalized. She was . being punished to the extreme,' Assistant State Attorney Sally Weintraub . said in closing arguments. Prosecutors . brought the wire dog cage into the court room and placed it in front of . the jurors as Graham's friend Detra Coakley Winfield testified she . loaned it to her specifically to keep the child in. She . said Graham asked to borrow it and told her it was so she could keep . the four-year-old in it at night 'to stop her from doing harm to . herself'. However she did admit she had never seen her inside the cage. 'I . saw her in timeout but I never saw her in the dog cage,' she said, . adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once. She also said the girl often seemed 'sad' during her eight-month stay at the Graham home and once saw her play with feces. Lost: Rilya's body has never been found . 'To me, she had some issues, some mental issues,' Winfield told jurors. Rilya's name is an acronym for 'remember I love you always' given by her birth mother. Graham has always maintained that a child welfare worker took Rilya from her home in January 2001 and never returned her. Her . disappearance was not discovered for 15 months, leading to major . reforms at the Florida Department of Children and Families and . high-level resignations. A . caseworker who failed to check up on Rilya in person during all those . months eventually pleaded guilty to official misconduct charges for . falsifying time sheets. Graham's . defense raised the possibility Rilya might have been sold and could . still be alive. They questioned the credibility of Lunceford â whose . life sentence was cut to 10 years in exchange for her testimony â and . the fact that no physical evidence exists showing a crime was committed. 'There's no evidence of it because my client never committed murder,' said defense attorney Michael Matters. Two other prison inmates also testified that Graham implicated herself in Rilya's killing. Friends . and acquaintances said Graham told various stories about the girl's . disappearance, such as trips to Disney World and New York. She also told . investigators the girl, who was taken . into care after being born to a crack-addicted mom, had been taken for mental tests by a state caseworker and never returned. Authorities found no evidence to back up those explanations. Before jurors began deliberations, . three alternates were sent home but instructed by the judge not to talk . to the media or read news account of the case until a verdict in the . high-profile case is reached. In November another family friend, . Laquica Tuff, told jurors that she saw Rilya with scratches and a gash . on her forehead about two months before the girlâs disappearance. She also said Graham told her the same story about her being taken to New York by a friend. Accused: Geralyn Graham is sworn by a judge, pictured, at Miami-Dade Criminal Court where she is charged with the murder of Rilya Wilson, who was in her care when she vanished in 2000 . In the afternoon, a crime scene detective dispatched to Graham's home in Kendall in 2004, more than three years after Rilya disappeared and after the family had already moved, testified that little forensic evidence was found at the home except for latent evidence of human bodily fluid or blood in the garage, according to Local10.com. Graham's attorney raised the possibility that Rilya could still be alive because her body has not been found. Attorney Scott Sakin suggested Rilya . could've been relocated to a new home and lost in a system that has a . history of caseworker incompetence. Sakin also reminded jurors that jailhouse snitches have much to gain for helping out prosecutors. 'Is there any evidence at all that . this child is dead?' Sakin said. 'Where is the body? We don't have to . prove that she's alive. They have to prove that this child is dead.' Prosecutors said Graham confessed to . killing Rilya, who would be 16 now, because she believed the girl was . evil and possessed by demons. Rilya and a younger sister were both . given over to state care because their drug-addicted, frequently . homeless mother could not care for them. One now-retired DCF supervisor, . Willie Harris, testified that in April 2000 he received a call from . Graham claiming Rilya's first foster home was 'deplorable' and might be . unsafe. Testimony: Mrs Winfield told the court that she saw the girl in timeout but never saw her in the dog cage she provided, adding that she had never saw Graham strike the child once . Rilya's younger sister was living . with Graham and her unrelated companion, Pamela Graham, and Rilya had . recently visited their house. Harris said he decided to remove . Rilya from the first foster home when he was denied access to . investigate its condition. He took the girl to the Grahams' home. 'I thought it would be necessary to . remove the child because I couldn't prove whether she was at risk or not . at risk,' Harris testified. The key to the case, both sides agree, is the testimony of career criminal Robin Lunceford, who befriended Graham in jail. Lunceford claims that Graham, . referring to Rilya as 'it,' told her she smothered the girl with a . pillow and buried the remains near water 'because water represented . peace,' Weintraub told jurors. Another inmate also claims that Graham . confessed at a different time. Weintraub said Lunceford was reluctant to snitch but 'couldn't stomach' knowing about the death of a child. 'If you tell me you killed an . innocent child, I'm going to snitch, and I'm going to snitch proud. Because it's different,' Weintraub quoted Lunceford as telling . detectives. Lunceford had been facing a life . sentence as a repeat offender but has had her sentence reduced to 10 . years because of her cooperation, court records show. With time off for . good behavior, she could be released by the end of December, Sakin . pointed out. 'She's a rat,' Sakin said. 'Robin Lunceford would do anything, anything, to get out of prison.' Graham also has a checkered past, . including a history of convictions for fraud. Authorities said she has . used 47 different aliases and had 10 different driver's licenses when . she was arrested. Weintraub said Graham forged . documents falsely claiming she was Rilya's grandmother in order to . collect state benefits â even after police believed the girl was dead.

Striking subway workers in Athens have returned to work, hours after the Greek government used riot police to clear strikers from a train depot, ending a bitter stand-off over new austerity measures. The nine-day strike - which knocked out a system serving more than a million people a day - was the biggest labour unrest Greece's uneasy, conservative-led governing coalition faced since taking over last June. It was only overcome after authorities resorted to issuing a rare civil mobilisation order to workers who had defied a court ruling that their strike was illegal. The order meant that staff refusing to return to work risked dismissal, arrest and jail time. Outrage: Metro staff went on strike over plans to scrap their existing contracts as part of a broader public sector pay reform, with their union saying workers faced a roughly 25% salary loss . Though the subway trains started running again, the city of some four million still lacked bus and trolley bus services, as unions launched rolling strikes in sympathy with their colleagues.

No violence was reported, with the workers not putting up resistance. In the afternoon, dozens of strikers burned their mobilisation papers outside a metro station. The government's order led to a swift backlash, with all other public transport workers declaring immediate strikes that forced Athenians to walk or take taxis through thunderstorms yesterday and today. Traffic slowed to a crawl, and commutes took up to three times as long as normal. Government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou insisted the new austerity measures must be implemented. Punishments: Defying the order to return to work can lead to arrest and jail terms of between three months and five years .

The authority said salaries fell 11.3 per cent and social benefits received by households decreased 10.2 per cent - while taxes on household income and wealth increased 17.7 per cent. Since Greece's finances started to implode in late 2009, incomes have dropped on average by about 30 per cent. Strikes in general are so widespread and frequent in Greece that they have become part of everyday life. 'I agree with the strikers,' said Christos Bousios as he walked through central Athens. 'They have their demands. People will be inconvenienced. With all strikes, it's people who end up paying. ... Those who complain about the strikes today are the ones who strike the next day and make other people's lives hard.'

In the 16 years since the fab five had last performed live together, theyâd all grown up a bit...hadnât they? But when the band reunited for its sell-out Progress tour, it seemed the thirty and forty-something fans cramming into their concerts werenât so mature after all. In classic teenage style, they became tired, emotional ... and very, very drunk. Patience: Take That fans desperate to see their idols queue for concert tickets . Official figures released yesterday show that paramedics had to deal with 792 medical cases â most alcohol or heat related â during the eight summer nights the band played at City of Manchester Stadium. It was already known that more than 100 women, most in their 30s and 40s, had to be treated in hospital after drinking too much after the concerts in 2011. The volume of fans who had overdone it resulted in a 10 per cent increase on average admissions to Manchester Royal Infirmary, severely stretching hospital resources, doctors said at the time.About 160 extra patients had to be treated on the concert dates âÂ  or 27 per day. The new figures, which follow a Freedom of Information request, reveal for the first time the full extent of the mayhem. They also show police dealt with 75 incidents and made 30 arrests. One fan was assaulted and suffered a fit on the pitch. But after being released from hospital, the concert-goer refused to press charges against those arrested. Official figures released yesterday show that paramedics had to deal with 792 medical cases - most alcohol or heat related - during the eight summer nights the band played at City of Manchester Stadium . In a separate incident, a large-scale police operation began after a âhandâ was spotted in the canal. Thankfully it turned out to be a glove. The City of Manchester Stadium, also known as the Etihad Stadium, is the home ground of Manchester City Football Club. It was sold out for Take Thatâs eight-night run in which they performed to nearly 500,000 fans. At the time, the Mail reported how disappointed fans, who had paid more than Â£50 a ticket, accused stewards of failing to tackle concert-goers who had clearly been drinking all day. Fan Vanessa Buck said her night was ruined by a bunch of drunk and abusive women sitting behind her. âI regularly enjoy nights out in city centre bars and this was worse than anything Iâve ever seen in Manchester or Liverpool on a busy Saturday night,â she said. Steward Adele Wilkinson said: âThe amount of women we have found slumped on the concourse and in the toilets is unbelievableÂ  â absolutely trolleyed, being sick, one wandering around the toilet with no pants on, fighting with friends.â Police had asked licensed premises around the ground not to sell alcohol to concert-goers to prevent trouble but it was still on sale inside the ground.Â  Among drinks at bars were Â£18 full-size plastic bottles of Chardonnay. The new details come from a meeting of the Safety Advisory Group, made up of club officials, police, and health and council staff. A staggering 1.76million tickets were sold for Take Thatâs 27 British shows, eight of which were staged at Wembley. They were their first concerts since Robbie Williams rejoined after splitting from Take That bandmates Gary Barlow, Mark Owen, Jason Orange and Howard Donald in 1995.","Official figures show .

"By . Tim Collins . PUBLISHED: . 20:34 EST, 22 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:53 EST, 22 January 2013 . Captain Wales: Prince Harry races out from the VHR (very high readiness) tent to scramble his Apache . My ten-year-old son was delighted the other day to find a quotation from me appearing on the screen while he was playing the PlayStation game Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. But I was just bemused. Ten years ago, in Kuwait, when I spoke the words âIt is a big step to take another human life. It is not to be done lightlyâ, I was preparing the men of my battle group to cross into Iraq for the liberation with every expectation they would be doing exactly that: taking human lives. I never imagined that thought would feature in a computer game. So when I read yesterday of Prince Harry using a striking phrase to describe killing Taliban insurgents â he said the Army would âtake them out of the gameâ â his words had a certain resonance for me. Given that in the same interview Harry also talked about his love of PlayStation and Xbox games, civilians could be forgiven for thinking that soldiers treat war as some sort of glorified game; a boysâ own adventure in which violent death is visited upon the enemy simply by pushing a button. So is killing on the battlefield really done with as little thought as when one blasts the bad guys in a computer game? Nothing could be further from the truth. No one knows better than Captain Wales â who was in charge of the weapons systems on an Apache attack helicopter â that taking someone âout of the gameâ means blasting them to smithereens. That is what happens to a person on the receiving end of a 30-millimetre explosive bullet. Checks: Prince Harry wears his monocle gun sight as he sits in the front seat of his Apache helicopter cockpit . Soldiers who have served on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan know what it is like to kill, to knowingly and purposefully take the life of another human being. They know what the consequence looks like, too. They do not take it lightly, not least because the chances are that they will have lost friends to enemy bullets. All trades have their lingo, and the Army is no different. It just happens that one of the consequences of the military trade is death. It is no surprise that the terrible reality and absolute finality is cloaked in euphemisms. It is a psychological necessity. It protects the soldiers â allows them to get on with the job. Nor is it a new phenomenon. The language changes, but the meaning is the same. In World War I, dead soldiers were said to have âbought the farmâ, or simply âbought itâ. A serious life-changing wound was a âBlighty oneâ, meaning a trip home to the UK. In World War II, meanwhile, Russian soldiers would warn sentries heading out into No-manâs Land to be particularly careful where Nazi snipers were known to lurk with a cautionary: âStick your head up there and no more dinners.â Killing the Taliban: Prince Harry makes his early morning pre-flight checks at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . In my service in the SAS, we would talk about a terrorist âgetting the good newsâ or ârolling a sevenâ. In the Royal Irish, the slang tended to be more direct: a dead enemy had been âslottedâ or âdroppedâ. Comments: Iraq War Colonel Tim Collins said Prince Harry's words had a 'certain resonance' for him . When it comes to death and destruction, all soldiers need a way to talk about it without talking about it. Fighters need to cast a glance at death, often on a daily basis, yet never look him in the eye. All armies do it. But it is not just the business of killing that is spoken of in a different language. All areas of army life have their jargon, and the British Army has always adopted terms from wherever it served. Even when I joined in 1981, long after the demise of the Empire, the language of the Army was loaded with words in Urdu and Hindi left over from the days of the Raj: laundry was âdhobiâ; tea was âchaâ; a small wall was a âbundâ; the toilet was the âkhaziâ. A look was a âshuftiâ â from the Arabic. In the SAS, we would talk of going to oneâs âbashaâ (the Malay for âhouseâ), and the jungle was the âuluâ. This jargon serves a purpose. To know . the lingo was a sign of achieving acceptance, and to be accepted means a . soldier has a better chance of survival in combat because he must . almost always rely on his colleagues. It . is also a handy way of dealing with some horrible realities. I recall . enquiring about one of my sergeants who had sustained terrible leg . wounds from an improvised explosive device (IED). I was told that it was . likely that he would be âexcused bootsâ. âExcused salutingâ with a left . or right arm â or both â speaks for itself. It is the kind of black humour that has helped soldiers cope with the bloody reality of war for millennia. Strength: An Apache ground crew member wears a t-shirt describing the firepower of the helicopter . On the day we crossed into Iraq, I had my sergeant major organise some Iraqi POWs to bury one of their number killed in the fighting. Tired and hungry, they did a bad job. The next day my own soldiers had to dig a proper grave to reâbury the dead man because rigor mortis had made him bend forward and upwards and out of his very shallow grave to present something for the local dogs to gnaw on. My sergeant major explained that he had . found him âsitting up in bedâ and our lads had made him âmore comfyâ. Of . course, in reality, the scene was one of horror, putrefaction and . appalling stench. Going for a walk: Prince Harry at Camp Bastion, where he was serving as an Apache helicopter pilot . And that is the point. You never talk about the business of warfare directly, or if you do, you do it very precisely. It is either slang and jargon, or the emotion-free military terms and language honed at Staff College. I recall in Northern Ireland how a would-be petrol bomber, having lit his device, tripped and ended up in flames of his own doing. âOh, heâs put his blazer on,â quipped one soldier. The avoidance of stating the obvious is international, but it is the British above all who keep their emotions in check with euphemisms â sometimes to the frustration of our U.S. colleagues, who donât always get it. This can have unintended consequences, as when Brigadier Tom Brodie â commanding the Commonwealth 29th Brigade in Korea â was asked by a U.S. general how things were going as his 600 soldiers were being attacked by a force of 30,000 Chinese troops. Brodie admitted to the American that âthings are a little sticky up hereâ. The U.S. general took that to mean ânot too badâ and so held back support. As a result, the Royal Ulster Rifles only escaped by a miracle and the Glosters were over-run. Even as I gave my eve-of-battle speech in Kuwait, I did so in a manner meant for the men. I did not refer to killing or being killed; I talked of âtaking livesâ, or ânot seeing the end of the campaignâ. The boys knew well enough what I meant. It is the same when Prince Harry talks about taking Taliban âout of the gameâ â and let us not forget that this is exactly how all his comrades-in-arms talk. He knows too well what it means. He may joke that his PlayStation has honed his reflexes, but once again that is a soldierâs flippancy disguising the deadly seriousness of his mission. For this is also a man who has looked down from his helicopter cockpit, identified enemy fighters running for their lives and witnessed the result when he has unleashed the awesome power at his fingertips.","Iraq War Colonel Tim Collins: Harry's words had a 'certain resonance'

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 05:17 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:12 EST, 24 January 2013 . The number of people in work is at a record high of almost 30million. Figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the total workforce across public and private sectors last year was 29.7million, the largest number since records began in 1971. At the same time, unemployment dropped by 185,000, the biggest annual fall for more than a decade, to 2.49million. This is around the same level as when David Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010. Statistics: Despite the overall fall in unemployment, the change was not uniform throughout the UK . The ONS also said the number of job . vacancies has jumped to nearly 500,000, the largest since 2008, the year . the recession began. While the number of workers has never . been higher, the overall percentage in employment has fallen slightly . due to a growing population. Of people aged 16 to 64, the ONS said 71.4 . per cent are working, compared with 73 per cent at the beginning of . 2008. Neil Carberry of the CBI said: âPay restraint has played an important role in preserving jobs.â More than one in four private sector . workers have suffered at least one annual pay cut or a freeze, rising to . 48 per cent in the public sector, according to a report by the National . Institute of Economic and Social Research. This has helped to protect jobs . because bosses have been able to keep control of their wage bill, . avoiding staff cuts. But the squeeze on income is fuelling the crisis on . the high street as consumers have less money to spend. The average pay . rise last year was just 1.4 per cent, while the consumer prices index, a . measure of inflation, is 2.7 per cent. The strength of the jobs market is at odds with the weak economic recovery. ONS figures due tomorrow may show that . economic output fell in the final three months of last year, raising . fears of a triple-dip recession. Rise: The number of people in employment has reached an all-time high as the overall rate has improved . A number of high-street retailers including Jessops and HMV have recently collapsed into administration. Nida Ali, economic adviser to the . accountancy firm Ernst & Youngâs Item Club, said: âThese are pretty . impressive figures for the labour market in the face of a weak economic . environment. âBut the story remains similar to . previous months, with the data betraying hints that the labour market . might be starting to run out of steam.â However, . Lloyds TSB distracted from the good news today as it emerged that the . bank is set to cut more than 940 jobs, bringing total job losses there . to 1,300 in just a few days. Exeter-based airline Flybe is axing 300 jobs - 10 per cent of its workforce - in an attempt to cut its costs by Â£35million. Unemployment . was at its worst in the North East, with 9.1 per cent of people looking . for work. In the South West, by contrast, the jobless rate stood at . just 5.5 per cent. The . number of people classed as economically inactive, including those . looking after a relative or who have given up looking for a job, fell to . just over 9million. Part-time employment fell by 23,000, . but this was offset by a 113,000 increase in the numbers employed . full-time in the three months to November. Back to work: The unemployment rate has now fallen for 10 consecutive quarters . Data from the Office for . National Statistics also showed a 26,000 increase in the number of women . out of work for up to six months, to reach 571,000, which may reflect . changes to the benefits system which have resulted in more single . mothers looking for work. The . number of job vacancies in the economy increased by 10,000 to almost . half a million at the end of last year, the highest number for four . years, a hint that further falls in unemployment could be on their way. McDonald's is set to create at least 2,500 new jobs over the course of this year, taking its workforce in the UK to 93,500. The fast food giant's announcement comes after the firm created 3,500 jobs in 2012, growing by more than 20,000 over five years. McDonald's said its growth was the fruit of investing in new technology as well as extending opening hours and menu choice in its 1,200 UK restaurants. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'A highly-skilled workforce is an important part of any growing business. That's why I am pleased to see how McDonald's is providing training and apprenticeships in a range of skills. 'McDonald's is also to be applauded for helping adult employees get qualifications in maths and English.' Jill McDonald, chief executive of McDonald's UK, said: 'These remain challenging economic conditions but I'm pleased that, together with our franchisees, our continued focus on serving quality, affordable food and giving our customers a great experience is enabling us to keep investing in our business and creating jobs. 'Whilst today's job market is hugely competitive, we offer many people their first experience of work and we're focused on doing what we can to help more young people get into quality jobs and careers.' Other figures revealed that the number of self-employed workers has increased by 7,000 to 4.2million. In . another encouraging sign of life for the economy, long-term . unemployment has fallen - down by 10,000 for those out of work for more . than two years, to 434,000, and by 5,000 for people unemployed for at . least a year, to 892,000. But the number of 16 to 24-year-olds out of work increased by 1,000 to 957,000, the first rise since last summer. Average earnings increased by 1.5 per cent in the year to November, lagging behind inflation at 2.7 per cent. The average pay packet in Britain was Â£472 a week at the end of last year - the equivalent of around Â£24,500 a year. Britons worked an average of 31.8 hours a week during the period covered by the statistics, up slightly from the previous year. Employment minister Mark Hoban welcomed the figures, claiming that the British employment rate was increasing fast than any other G7 country. 'These are very positive figures showing employment rising for 15 months and despite difficult economic circumstances, unemployment is lower than when this Government took office,' he said. 'It's good to see long-term unemployment falling and the number of young people claiming jobseeker's allowance dropping again, while the increase in vacancies shows there are jobs out there. 'But we are not complacent, and will continue making sure we give jobseekers the support and training they need to achieve their goal of returning to work.' But Unison general secretary Dave Prentis cautioned against overconfidence, saying: 'Any fall must be welcome but progress is still painfully slow for the 2.49million people still desperately looking for a job. 'The number of High Street names going into liquidation shows there is no room for complacency. And only yesterday the Government announced more than 5,000 cuts to Army personnel. 'We know that many thousands of public sector workers' jobs are under threat as council budget cuts mean that elderly care centres, nurseries, swimming pools and other valued services face the axe.' Liam Byrne, shadow work and . pensions secretary, said: 'Today's headline fall in unemployment is . welcome news, but today's figures show no roaring recovery, they show . very shaky foundations. 'Half . of the country saw yet another rise in unemployment, nearly half a . million people have been on the dole for more than a year, and youth . unemployment rose.' Boost: David Cameron will take comfort from the positive new employment statistics . The Federation of Small Businesses warned that hiring could slow if new companies were not encouraged to expand. 'With small firms more likely to hire the long-term unemployed, they need additional incentives to create new jobs,' chairman John Walker said. 'We continue to call for an extension to the current regional National Insurance Contributions holiday to all micro firms across the UK. This could create around 47,000 new jobs and add Â£1.3billion to GDP.' David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, argued that the strong unemployment figures cast doubt over the gloomy statistics on Britain's GDP. 'The new figures reinforce favourable trends that have been apparent over the past year, and raise continued questions over the accuracy of the much more pessimistic GDP figures,' he said. Losses: Lloyds TSB has announced it is to shed 940 jobs in the UK, damping down the good news . Lloyds confirmed its plans to cut hundreds of jobs, adding: 'Lloyds Banking Group is today announcing 940 role reductions within the group operations, insurance, retail, wealth and international and commercial divisions. 'Lloyds Banking Group is committed to working through these changes with employees in a careful and sensitive way. All affected employees have been briefed by their line manager today. The group's recognised unions, Accord, Unite and LTU, were consulted prior to this announcement and will continue to be consulted. 'The group's policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group.' Ged Nichols, general secretary of Accord, said: 'This is a bleak start to the year for hard-working employees and is bad news for the UK economy on a day when the small fall in the numbers unemployed was supposed to be good news. 'The fact that nearly 200 of the jobs are to be outsourced to India is particularly unwelcome. Accord is certain that this is not what UK taxpayers would want from a bank in which they are the largest shareholder.'","Unemployment falls to 7.7% in 10th consecutive quarterly decline .

The sister of Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing today said she is increasingly convinced by arguments for decriminalisation of drugs - because wealthy addicts are almost untouchable by the law. She said her billionaire brother and his wife were never likely to be imprisoned for their destructive habits and were given easy access to methadone and morphine by psychiatrists. Rich crack and heroin addicts are generally left alone if they have not committed other crimes, such as drug dealing, she said. Disturbing: Hans and Eva Rausing (pictured) were left to sink into their addiction, said the wealthy man's sister . 'Wealthy addicts, gripped by paranoia, eroded by drugs, frantic to keep their supplies flowing, are almost untouchable,' added Ms Rausing. 'Possession alone is unlikely to send . you to prison if you are wealthy, because you are deemed unlikely to be . dealing. 'Families look on in despair, but the fact is that their addicts already live in a world where drugs are largely decriminalised.' In July, her heroin-addict younger brother was arrested after police found the badly decomposed body of his dead wife in the couple's squalid bedroom at their Belgravia mansion. Tragic: Hans Rausing's sister said he and wife Eva (pictured) were almost untouchable because of their wealth . He had banned staff from entering the couple's 'crack den' in their otherwise-immaculate Â£70million London home, claiming his wife was ill. In fact, Mrs Rausing, 48, had been dead for eight weeks, and her disturbed husband had covered her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes, blankets and plastic, sealed with industrial tape and sprayed with deodorant to mask the smell. Ms Rausing, writing in The Guardian today, said that well-off drug addicts like her brother have easy access to large amounts of methadone or morphine from psychiatrists. Despair: Sigrid Rausing said her younger brother already lived in a world where drugs were 'largely decriminalised' In a statement read out at his wife's inquest in December, Mr Rausing said he hardly remembered the run-up to his wife's death because he had been taking prescribed morphine for four years. The heir to his family's Â£4.3billion packaging fortune - and one of Britain's richest men - began abusing drugs during several years travelling in India, after he moved from Sweden to Britain in 1982. After one stay in rehab, he relapsed while staying with his sister. Heartbreakingly, she did not realise what was happening, believing that the plates of rotting food and dirt under his fingernails were just part of who he was - when in fact the dirt was heroin. Ms Rausing, who gives away around Â£20million a year to charity, said she does not think the 'heavy hand of the state' or the 'war on drugs' does anything to help people like her brother. Police raided her brother's mansion . several years ago, after he was spotted driving erratically, and kicked . in the door of his locked bedroom, said Ms Rausing, publisher of Portobello Books and Granta magazine. Then a year ago, on New Year's Day, she visited her brother while his wife was away, despite having been banned from their house. She had heard he was 'not in a good state' and that Mrs Rausing was seriously concerned about him. The bedroom door - still broken from the raid - was locked, and though she knew Mr Rausing could be dead or dying inside, there was little she could do. 'Our only option of outside help at that point was to have him committed, and that, we had learned, was almost impossible,' she said. On July 9, he was again stopped while driving his red Bristol sports car erratically - and a warm crack pipe was found in the footwell. When police asked where Mrs Rausing was, his eyes welled up as he told them she was in California. Horrific: Mr Rausing was arrested after police found his wife's decomposed body in their Belgravia mansion . Her body was soon after discovered in their bedroom, which was strewn with rubbish and drugs paraphenalia and swarming with flies. Mr Rausing's sister Sigrid is married to former Panorama producer Eric Abrahams. When they moved into their own Holland Park home in 1997, it was reportedly the most expensive house ever sold in the capital, at Â£20m, with the second-biggest garden after Buckingham Palace. Today, Ms Rausing called for addiction to be defined as an emotional illness, separately and beyond drug-use. She said studies had shown that a 'culture of recovery' is the best treatment, and addicts who are committed to care have as good a chance of beating their as those who have chosen it. Her 49-year-old brother was excused from attending his wife's inquest in December because he is being treated for drug addiction and a mental breakdown. 'Unable to cope': Mr Rausing, one of Britain's richest men, was convicted of preventing his wife's lawful burial . He was instead represented by a phalanx . of lawyers and public relations officials, led by the Prime Minister's . older brother, Alex Cameron QC. He was initially arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife, but was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a ten-month suspended jail term. Mrs Rausing was found clutching a crack pipe, after her heart-rate soared to six times its normal level. Her husband said he 'could not face the fact she was dead'. In a statement read to the court last month, Mr Rausing revealed that the couple had sunk deep into addiction and barely left his flat. He said: 'We both felt that our lives were completely hopeless.' The inquest heard police have been unable to discover who supplied her the drugs and herÂ  husband said she had 'her own sources'. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Wealthy addicts are 'almost untouchable', claims Sigrid Rausing .

A body has been found in the hunt for a young man who went missing after he lost his job at Blockbuster, hours after his wife launched an emotional appeal begging him to come home. John Ankers has not been seen since leaving for work on Sunday morning, and his wife Katrina Williams has spoken of her concern that he could be caught out in the freezing cold. The store assistant had been depressed since he was told he would be made redundant after the video rental firm went into administration last week. Today police who were looking for him found a body in woodland near a Liverpool hospital. Newlyweds: Katrina Williams, left, has launched an appeal for her husband John Ankers, right, to return home; the couple are pictured on their wedding day in September . Campaign: Friends have put up hundreds of pictures of Mr Ankers in an attempt to find him . Mr Ankers, 28, had worked at the Blockbuster store in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, for five years before receiving the crushing news. His low mood apparently worsened when he opened a parcel containing posters advertising the store's closing sale. Since he left home his bank account has not been touched, and his mobile phone has run out of battery. Police searching for Mr Akers confirmed that they had found a body near to Arrow Park hospital in Liverpool around 11am today. Ms Williams, 27, has been informed of the discovery. 'At this stage there has been no formal identification and detectives are treating the death as unexplained,' a police spokesman said. 'Crime scene investigators are at the scene and the investigation is in its early stages.' Devoted: Ms Williams paid tribute to her husband as 'a very happy person' with lots of friends . Depressed: Mr Ankers was said to be distraught over the impending loss of his job at Blockbuster . Earlier Ms Williams, who married Mr . Ankers in a white wedding last September after the couple had been . dating for eight years, said she was 'desperate' to see her husband . again. 'We're just desperate for John to . come home safe,' she said today. 'Nobody has heard from him or seen him . since he set off work and we are fraught with worry - especially with . the wintry weather. 'I have spoken to everyone who knows him and he hasn't been in touch with anyone.' She added: 'John's a very happy person - really easy-going. Everybody is his friend and everyone loves him. That's why so many people have been looking for him. 'His disappearance is completely out of character. He's been working at Blockbusters for about four or five years but it's been a struggle financially for him. 'He said he wanted to earn more money now he's married, and he recently started driving lessons so he could have some better prospects. 'But last week he was told he would lose his job and he has been down about that. When he found out that he was going to be made redundant it was really bad. Couple: The pair had been together for eight years before they got married in the autumn . Out of contact: Mr Ankers has not been in touch with friends or family since Sunday morning . 'What made it worse was that it didn't matter how many jobs he applied for, no one got back to him. 'We're just hoping he might have gone off somewhere to clear his head. We desperately want him home safe.' Mr Akers is described as white, 5ft 8ins tall of medium build with short, straight dark brown hair. He was last seen wearing a black jacket, white Ralph Lauren polo shirt, skinny blue jeans and black Vans trainers with white soles. Dozens of locals have put up posters with his picture on at bus stations, cafes and factories around the area, while his friends have also started a Facebook page urging his safe return. 'We have had people out looking for John everywhere but have not had any joy so far,' said close friend Brian Granby, who is organising the search. 'We're been using Twitter and Facebook to raise awareness and the response we have had has been overwhelming.' Blockbuster has announced that it is closing 129 of its stores around the UK, with the loss of 900 jobs, after entering administration while it struggles to deal with competition from digital downloads and online retailers.","John Ankers, 28, has not been seen since leaving for work on Sunday .

This pony's hooves turned up like Aladdinâs slippers after he was neglected and forced to live in piles of rubbish. Eight-year-old Bingo, whose hooves will need specialist treatment for the rest of his life, was rescued from terrible conditions by Bristol-based charity HorseWorld. The Shetland pony was overweight and living in litter, having been neglected by his owners for six months to a year. Sore: Bingo's hooves will need special treatment for the rest of his life, after they curled up at the ends . Happy: The eight-year-old, pictured with volunteer Nadine Bennett, 14, was nursed back to health at Horseworld . His hooves had grown to six inches long and curled upwards, which would have hurt as much as trapping a hand in a car door, a vet said. It took a year to get Bingo back down to a normal weight, and his hooves will need specialist treatment for the rest of his life. On a scale of one to five, where five is morbidly obese, Bingoâs weight was ranked a four by the charity, who helped to rehabilitate him. Sarah Hollister, equine training manager for HorseWorld, said: 'Bingo was in a sorry state when he was rescued by HorseWorld. Cruel: Horses' hooves should be regularly trimmed - but Bingo's were left to grow to six inches long . 'It took months of remedial trimming and painkillers to bring his hooves back to a relatively normal and pain-free state.' Amy Williams from HorseWorld, who owns two Shetland ponies of her own, said: 'The vet said that his hooves would have been causing him as much pain as trapping a hand in a car door. He was still making his way around on them but he would have been in excruciating pain. 'Shetland ponies are easy to look after. They are adapted to live in Shetland where grass is sparse. If they are left in a healthy field here, they will literally eat themselves to death. 'I have an electric fence that I move a little bit each day to stop mine over-eating, but Bingo was just left, which is how he got so fat.' Malformed: The Shetland pony's hooves would have hurt as much as a hand trapped in a car door . Bingoâs hooves were so bad when he was found in July 2011 that the tissue had broken down and the bone had moved. He has his hooves trimmed every four weeks to try and get the bone back to a normal position. A regular horse would need their hooves trimming every six to eight weeks. Bingoâs owners were successfully prosecuted in January 2012 and were banned from keeping any animal for two years, except dogs, fish and chicken. HorseWorld volunteer Nadine Bennett, 14, has struck up a friendship with Bingo. She said: 'When I met Bingo I thought he was quite cute - heâs a cuddly little thing, but heâs got a cheeky side too. I often catch him sticking his nose in my pockets to see if Iâve got any treats. 'His favourite is hay - I sometimes sneak him big handfuls when I know that no-oneâs looking. 'I used to work with a horse called Shallou and we got on really well, but she had to be put down a few months ago. Itâs nice that I now have Bingo to keep me company instead.' Bingo is now fully rehabilitated and helping with Discovery Courses at HorseWorld. The courses provide first-hand experiences of working with horses for children and young people. Nadine was encouraged by her mother to start a six-week Discovery course at the charity, and was then asked to stay on as a volunteer. 'I was a bit shy when I started going to HorseWorld, but after a few weeks I gotÂ  really into it,' she said. 'It was like the horses read my mind. They take all the negativity out of you. They understand you. 'Horses like Bingo help kids that are having problems because they have been through hard times as well, so it sort of cheers them up and you can repay them. 'I already liked animals so this helped it along. I would like to carry on as a volunteer at HorseWorld and help support others. I would love to have my own farm one day.' Course leader Sharon Howell said: 'Bingo is extremely well suited to Discovery courses. 'Sympathetic': Bingo now helps with Discovery Courses for children at Bristol charity HorseWorld . 'Itâs as though he is sympathetic and understanding to those who need his help.' The Discovery Courses combine working with horses in an outdoor environment with classroom based studies in numeracy, literacy and art and are open to young people across the West Country. Ms Howell said: 'Many of the young people that have taken part in the Discovery Courses have been able to return to mainstream schooling, or have gone on to college courses, something which would previously have been out of the question for them. 'Our future hopes are to secure enough funding to be able to help everybody who applies for the courses. Weâre always on the lookout for businesses or individuals to sponsor aspects of the programmes - in doing so, they can help change lives.'

Two best friends who drifted 10 miles out to sea when their jet-ski broke down revealed yesterday that they considered drowning themselves. Gavin Smith, 28, and Ben Thomson, 32, spent more than three hours in the icy waters of the North Sea near the Tay Estuary, off the coast of St Andrews, after a jet-ski they had been riding broke down. Another friend on his own jet-ski returned to shore to raise the alarm but by the time lifeboats were launched they had started to drift and three hours later they had travelled 10 miles. Best mates Ben Thomson (centre left) and Gavin Smith (centre right) with the Arbroath lifeboat crew that saved them in the North Sea . Mr Smith, who has a two-year-old son, said: 'When you are that cold, it was easy just to lie back and accept death. It felt warmer when you lay back. 'The . two of us tried to drown ourselves, but if one of us went down the . other one would pick them up. We just kept talking about the children . the whole time.' Agonisingly for the two men, both of Dundee, a rescue helicopter was summoned but did not detect them. The pair could also see the lights of . lifeboats scouring the waters off Broughty Ferry, Angus and Fife and were finally saved after Mr Thomson found the strength to blow on a . whistle attached to his best friend's lifejacket. The two fathers had the rhyme made up by their children - 'Love You Lots Like Jelly Tots' - tattooed on . their arms as these were the words they repeated continuously to help keep each other alive . Mr Smith revealed the two men recited a poignant . rhyme created by his son, Quinn, and Ben's daughter Jessica, five, . which included calling out the words 'Love you lots,' while the other screamed back, 'Jelly tots.' Mr Smith,said: 'The helicopter flew right over us and . once it had been and gone I thought we were done for, I can't tell you . how relieved we were when the lifeboat spotted us. 'We've both got kids . and there were a few moments where we weren't sure if we would see them . again.' Mr Thomson said: 'It . was a series of events that got us into the situation we were in - by the . time Arbroath lifeboat picked us up we were in a really bad way. 'I just . want to express my thanks to the crew. Without them I don't know if I . would be here today.' The dramatic rescue in November saw the men become two of 1,055 people plucked to safety by RNLI volunteers in Scotland last year, in what was this week announced as a record-breaking 12 months for the service. Scene: The men spent more than three hours in the icy waters of the North Sea near the Tay Estuary, off the coast of St Andrews (file picture) Scene: Breaking waves and the Dundee skyline across the Tay Estuary can be seen (pictured in 2008) For the second consecutive year, Broughty Ferry was the busiest of the country's 46 stations with 103 launches and 37 rescues. Mr Smith and Mr Thomson visited RNLI Arbroath lifeboat station before Christmas with a few boxes of beer and a card Ben's son had made with the words: 'Thank you for saving my Daddy and my Uncle, it means the world to me.' Other statistics revealed by the RNLI this week show there were 1,008 launches across Scotland last year, and 29 more rescues than the previous highest count in 2006. A total of 386 shouts took place at night and the busiest inshore station was at Queensferry, near Edinburgh. More than 15,450 hours were spent at sea by Scottish crews in 2012. Regional operations manager for Scotland, Andy Clift, said: 'The figures show that our volunteers dedicate a huge amount of their time to saving lives at sea.'","Gavin Smith, 28, and Ben Thomson, 32, spent over 3 hours in North Sea .

A woman has spoken of her shock after she was attacked by a fox in broad daylight in the middle of London. Nanny Kirsty Poole recounted how she was trying to take a picture of the animal because she thought it was 'cute'. But the vermin ran at her and bit into her Ugg boot, which it seems to have mistaken for another animal. Trauma: Kirsty Poole was bitten by a fox in broad daylight in the middle of London . Ms Poole, 31, had just got off the Tube in Putney when she was surprised to see the bold fox walking around in broad daylight. She told the Evening Standard: 'I saw this fox, and I thought, ""How cute"", and took a picture with my phone. 'It ran towards me and bit straight into my Ugg boot. I was really shocked that it bit in so hard. 'I had to fight to get it away and I suppose it stopped biting when it realised the boot wasn't food. 'Luckily it didn't get to my skin because the boot was so thick.' 'Cute': The nanny took this picture of the fox which she saw after getting off the Tube in Putney . Eventually Ms Poole managed to shoo the animal away, and it started running after another passer-by instead. She told the Standard she partly blamed herself for stopping to take the fox's photo, but also reflected on her bad luck for wearing footwear which looks so much like a fox or other type of animal. The nanny said she was shaken up by the incident, which she will report to the local council in an effort to help others avoid a similar situation. Ms Poole plans to buy a new pair of the Â£85 boots, joking: 'I don't think it looks very good to have a fox bite on the front of your shoe.' Aftermath: Ms Poole plans to buy a new pair of Â£85 Ugg boots due to the damage done by the fox . Wildlife expert John Bryant said that foxes rarely attack humans, and suggested that it might have thought that the boot was either an attacker or prey. 'It might have thought that the furry-looking boots were an animal or animals attacking,' he said. 'I could guess that it may have felt it was under attack.' Ms Poole's ordeal is one of a string of recent incidents where foxes showed aggression towards people. Over the weekend, a fox was filmed trying to drag a three-year-old boy away while he was sledging in his garden.","Kirsty Poole, 31, saw fox in Putney and stopped to take a picture of it .

Two children who went missing after apparently running away from home have been found at their local bus station. Sophie Fletcher, 12, and her 10-year-old brother Jack disappeared from their home in Darlaston, West Midlands overnight or early this morning. Their parents Jessica and Christopher were horrified to find them missing when they woke up and saw their beds empty. Sophie and Jack Fletcher, who were thought to have ran away and were trying to head to Wales where they once went on holiday, were discovered at their town's bus station . But the duo were discovered by a family friend at their town's local bus station at 5.20pm, West Midlands Police said. They are believed to have packed a bag . of clothes and taken money from their mother's purse, and police said . they may have been heading to a place in Wales where they have previously been . on holiday. But the pair were spotted by a family friend, who alerted the police, and now they are in the process of being reunited with their family. As West Midlands Police searched for them, officers said they were 'very concerned' about the children's safety, and warned that they could be at risk from the freezing weather. However, their search for Jack and Sophie was complicated by the fact that the local school is closed, making it harder to contact the children's friends in order to find information on where they might have gone. Home: The house in Darlaston which the Fletcher children abandoned overnight on Tuesday . Up to 50 officers followed up 'a number of leads' and checked dozens of address across a wide area. 'There is now a suggestion that the . youngsters may try to travel by train to a previous holiday destination . in Borth, Wales,' a police spokesman said. Sophie is described as 5ft 2in with collar-length brown hair cut in a bob, and blue eyes. She is believed to be wearing a leopard-print coat with a hood which has small ears on it and purple trousers. Jack is described as 5ft with straight blond hair and has a half-inch scar on his forehead. He is believed to be wearing a black hooded Benzini jacket with bright yellow lettering, black ankle boots and a cap with 'NY' on the front. Hunt: Police have launched a wide-ranging search for the two youngsters . Leading the search, Inspector Stuart Vaughan, of Walsall Police, said the disappearance was unusual for the pair. He said at the time: 'The children have not been missing before and, although they have packed clothes and taken money, we are very concerned about them, particularly in this cold weather. 'It is believed they have left of their own accord. We are continuing to carry out a number of inquiries to try and locate Sophie and Jack and are being supported by a significant number of force resources. 'We are now appealing to the public to help us with this search - if you have seen either of the children today or have any information about where they may be, please contact us immediately.'","Sophie and Jack Fletcher had never run away from home before .

Border officials have found an Â£8million haul of liquid cocaine hidden in tins of carrot juice at Gatwick Airport. The UK Border Agency believes it is the biggest seizure of its kind in British history. Staff made the discovery while carrying out checks on a cargo flight which had arrived from Jamaica on Monday, January 14. Border Agency officers found the huge liquid cocaine haul after carrying out checks on a food shipment which arrived at Gatwick Airport from Jamaica . The shipment was labelled as foodstuffs but officials found the cocaine hidden in tins marked as containing carrot juice. The drugs weighed around 80kilos and would have been worth around Â£8million once cut and sold on the street. During an investigation led by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the shipment was tracked to a number of addresses across London before arriving at premises in Beckenham, south London two days later. Officers carried out raids on a number of properties and said they found evidence of previous shipments as well as large quantities of cash. William Hayles, 50, and Randall St Patrick Lewis, 52, have been charged with conspiracy to import controlled drugs, and were remanded in custody until April 26, when they will appear at the Old Bailey, London. Three people were bailed pending further inquiries. Border Force South Director, Carole Upshall, said: 'This was a major seizure and it demonstrates how Border Force officers are on constant alert to keep illegal drugs and other banned substances out of the UK. 'Working closely with our law enforcement colleagues at Soca we have managed to thwart this smuggling attempt and stop a sizeable amount of cocaine making it on to the streets of Britain. 'Drug trafficking is a serious offence and those convicted face long prison sentences.' The Serious Organised Crime Agency tracked the shipment from Gatwick Airport to several addresses in south London where they arrested five people on suspicion of drug trafficking offences .

An eight-month-old baby has died after her family's SUV plummeted through thin ice on Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota, on Friday. Tabitha Markle was declared dead in the early hours of Monday morning following the accident on Friday afternoon, theÂ Star Tribune reports. She was strapped in her car-seat when the SUV, driven by her father 41-year-old Jonathan Markle, suddenly gave way on the ice at Halstead Bay Bridge, Minnestrista, around 5pm. From the scene: The lights of the SUV in which 8-month-old Tabitha Markle died on Friday were still visible after the car fell through thin ice . The spot is above a channel and known for thin ice according to KSTP. Tabitha's mother Amanda, 31, who is reportedly a speech clinician at Richfield STEM school, and her 2 year-old sister, Isabelle, managed to escape the wreck and were helped to shore. Jonathan Markle desperately tried to free his youngest daughter from below the ice - diving down three times before he was pulled from the water. A retired volunteer firefighter living nearby helped in the rescue effort but they couldn't get the youngest victim out. Firefighters managed to cut her from her car seat 15 minutes later but it was too late. 'The whole car was underwater,' Mound firefighter Paul Jolicoeur told CBS Minnesota. 'It felt like we were fighting it for hours, just finally getting her out of there.' Danger spot: The local sheriff's office has warned drivers not to drive above channels in Lake Minnetonka despite the recent cold weather. Seven vehicles went through ice over the weekend . The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and Orono Police Department are investigating the incident and have done blood alcohol checks on Markle who was driving back from a restaurant. Markle, his wife and Isabelle were treated for hypothermia and are expected to make a full recovery. They have been released from hospital. Hennepin County Medical Examiner confirmed Tabitha's death yesterday and classified it as 'accidental drowning' She is the first fatality attributed to thin ice in the area this season but seven other vehicles suffered the same fate on Lake Minnetonka over the weekend. The family were driving on a channel which the Sheriff's Office particularly warned against. 'Despite the recent cold weather, channels of Lake Minnetonka remain dangerous and should be avoided,' the Sheriff's Office said in a statement.","8-month-old Tabitha Markle dies after rescuers struggle to remove her from her car-seat for 15 minutes under the frozen lake .

One of Paveet Landa's relatives, Chamkh Singh, appears at Isleworth Crown Court charged with kidnapping . A Sikh family 'kidnapped and imprisoned' their female relative's secret boyfriend to stop them marrying, a court heard. Paveet Landa's fled her home to escape an arranged marriage so she could elope with her partner Ramanjit Singh, a builder who is of a lower caste than her. But the 20-year-old's father, mother, older brother and other relatives traced him to a Southall Sikh Temple, where he was trying to book them a marriage ceremony, and allegedly imprisoned him. The nursery nurse's father Balvinder Singh, mother Rani Landa, older brother Lakhanpal and other relatives found him in August last year. In a bid to stop the service going ahead the next day, the three close family members briefly imprisoned Mr Singh, who eventually broke free and called police, a jury heard. But the family intensified efforts to find Paveet, the Evening Standard reported. Next day, the morning of Paveet's wedding, they allegedly kidnapped her friend Harjinder Singh at knifepoint and her father threatened to kill him if he did not disclose their whereabouts. It is claimed he said: 'Tell me where Ramanjit lives â Iâll cut him up into pieces.' When Harjinder denied all knowledge of the coupleâs location, Paveetâs father allegedly punched him in the face, drew a knife and added: 'Iâll cut your throat now. Youâd better tell me where she is or I will kill you.' Opening the four-week trial at Isleworth Crown Court, prosecutor Ian McLoughlin said the case arose from 'a breakdown caused by Paveetâs decision not to marry the groom the family chose for her but to elope with the man she loved. 'This caused the family to pursue her and to threaten and attack her friends to reveal her whereabouts. 'She knew that her family couldnât accept Ramanjit as a suitable husband. He was from a different caste, was from India and didnât speak any English.' Questioned over her proposed arranged marriage to Vikram Shari, Paveet said she had 'gone along with it' at first to please her parents. But she claimed she was allowed to meet Mr Shari just once and spoke sporadically to him on the phone. During that time, she told the court, she became attracted to Ramanjit, who worked at the same nursery in Ilford, and the pair began a secret relationship. Paveet said from behind a dock screen to shield herself from her family that she did not want a life with the man chosen for her. She said: 'I wasnât going to be happy so I decided to run away with Ramanjit and get married.' The court heard that 10 family members traced Ramanjit, called him 'sister-f*****' and demanded to know where Paveet was hiding. He broke free and returned to his fiancÃ©e at a hotel. But on the morning of the wedding next day the family allegedly kidnapped Harjinder and threatened him with death if he did not help. Balvinder Singh, 42, Rani Landa, also 42, and Lakhanpal Landa, 21, have been charged with falsely imprisoning Ramanjit. They have also been charged with kidnapping Harjinder by force, along with relatives Hemat Landa, 40, Chamkh Singh, 42, Kamaljit Singh, 33, and a 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Balvinder has also been charged with making a threat to kill Harjinder and unlawful possession of a knife. All plead not guilty. The trial continues.

British engineers are leading pioneering research to see if train carriages can be 'bomb-proofed' to reduce the carnage caused by terrorist attacks such as the 7/7 bombings. The European project was set up to examine ways to make tube systems more resistant to the kinds of bomb blasts which caused devastation in London and Madrid. After three years of research, experts at the SecureMetro can now offer the rail industry advice on how to better protect passengers. Scroll down for video . Researchers used high-speed cameras to film a controlled explosion in a prototype rail carriage . The research has allowed experts to analyse the explosions and how they damage train carriages in detail . Fifty-two people lost their lives and almost 800 were injured in the 7/7 London bombings in 2005 and 191 died and 1,800 were wounded in Madrid the year before. Conor O'Neill, from Newcastle University's School of Mechanical and Systems Engineering, is leading the EU-funded project which aims to make sure that if any such atrocities are to occur in the future, their impact is minimised. The research has involved looking at the evidence from previous attacks and carrying out controlled explosions on a decommissioned Tube carriage. High speed cameras were used to slow . down the blast, allowing its impact on the vehicle's structure and . interior to be analysed in detail. A similar test was later carried out on a . prototype carriage specially built to reduce the devastating damage . caused by a bomb detonating inside it. Their . findings have pointed to a number of measures which they believe rail . companies could introduce immediately to reduce the damage caused by . bomb blasts and flying debris. The pioneering research will allow experts to advise rail companies how to better protect their passengers . Project leader Conor O'Neil believes tethering panels such as these could prevent dangerous shrapnel from injuring those further from a blast . Part of the aim of the research is to reduce casualties caused by debris - but not just in the initial blast. Following the inquests into the . deaths of the London 7/7 bombings, it was revealed that medical emergency teams were hindered by debris strewn across train carriages. And, had the Tube bombers detonated . their explosives while the trains were at the platform, rather than . while travelling through tunnels, the death toll would have been much . higher, as debris flew outwards like shrapnel. It is this that prompted research . into energy-absorbing materials being fitted, as well as plastic coating . for windows, preventing metal or glass debris from shattering outwards. Tethering down heavy components such as ceiling panels would also reduce the amount of obstacles between rescue teams and the wounded. Conor O'Neill said: 'Preventing flying objects is the key. 'Tethering ceiling panels reduced the risk of fatalities and injury from flying shrapnel and also meant the gangways were kept relatively clear of debris, allowing emergency staff quick access to the injured. 'The window coating we developed was also incredibly effective. Without it the windows are blown outwards - putting anyone outside, such as those standing on a platform, at risk from flying glass. 'With the plastic coating you see a clear rippling effect as the blast moves through the train but every window remains intact apart from the safety windows which are designed to be easily knocked out.' The British-led project aims to find ways to reduce carnage such as this from the 7/7 bombings in London . Engineer Conor O'Neil said tethering ceiling panels in tube trains would reduce the risk of fatalities from flying shrapnel . Railway workers remove debris from the wreckage of a bombed public train in Madrid in 2004 . The engineers also investigated dividing carriages with materials that soak up energy and reduce the impact of a blast wave - though in the case of the 7/7 bombing, the deceased were all travelling in the same carriage as one of the bombers. 'The Madrid bombings in 2004 and the 7/7 attack in London the year after highlighted how vulnerable our trains are to attack - particularly busy metro and commuter trains,' said Mr O'Neill. 'At the same time we have to be realistic. Completely replacing existing vehicles just isn't an option. Instead, we have developed and incorporated new technology and materials into existing carriages to improve performance. 'What we've shown is that companies could make some relatively cost-effective and simple modifications that would significantly improve the outcome of an attack.' The team is now in a position to advise rail industry chiefs on the best design approach, he said. He added: 'A bomb on a train is always going to be devastating but what we are trying to do is find a way in which the vehicle itself can help to mitigate the impact of an attack. 'These are all low-cost, simple solutions that can be put on existing trains which could not only save lives but also reduce the attractiveness of our railways for potential terrorist attacks.'","Experts say tethering panels, plastic windows and energy-absorbing buffers between carriages would reduce impact of a bomb .

Return: Gay businessman Ivan Massow, who quit the Tories over their attitude to homosexuality, is hoping to become an MP for the party . A gay businessman who quit the Tories over their attitude to homosexuality is hoping to become an MP for the party. Ivan Massow has applied to contest the battleground seat of Somerton and Frome in Somerset at the next election. But hours before he put in his bid last Thursday, the local party chairman resigned from the party in protest at David Cameronâs support for gay marriage. Edmund Costelloe, whose treasurer also resigned over the issue, accused the Prime Minister of having lost touch with grassroots supporters. In his resignation speech, the 66-year-old retired surveyor said the party leadership had mounted an âundebated and ill thought-out attack on marriage between a man and a woman for the procreation of childrenâ. Mr Massow, 45, who has made millions in the insurance business, said the Frome seat, which is held by the Lib Dems, was a natural fit for him, with its âprogressive and liberal-thinking votersâ. He defected to Labour in 2000 saying the Tories, then led by William Hague, had become âintolerant and just plain nastyâ. He returned a few years later. Mr Massow, 45, who will be interviewed by local Tories if shortlisted, was unaware of the row when he applied last Thursday. Yesterday he claimed chairman Edmund Costelloeâs views were out of step with locals who are âliberal and progressiveâ. But Mr Costelloe, whose treasurer also resigned over the issue, accused the Prime Minister of having âutterly lost touchâ with grassroots supporters, and said âvirtually everyoneâ he had spoken to disagreed with the plans. He feared a decision to allow gay weddings- with an exemption for the Church of England and other religions - would stop the party winning the seat, currently held by Liberal Democrat farming minister David Heath, and said many local members had expressed an intention not to renew their memberships this month. In his resignation speech to the Somerton and Frome Conservative Association, the 66-year-old retired surveyor said: âI have always been a Conservative through and through and this still stands. âWhat has changed is the leadershipâs undebated and ill-thought-out attack on marriage between a man and a woman for the procreation of children. âDavid Cameron and a group of colleagues have utterly lost touch with the grassroots of the Conservative Party, the majority of whom are outraged by this attack on natural and historic family values.â Ambitious: Ivan Massow has applied to contest the battleground seat of Somerton and Frome in Somerset at the next election. Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party David Cameron is pictured . Mr Massow told the Mail he had âlived in and lovedâ the Somerset constituency all his life. Joining the Conservativeâs youth wing as teenager, his life story is a rags to riches tale, spending years in the care system and leaving school with one O Level, he made millions in his early 20s by setting up the first insurance firm tailored to gay clients. âWhen it came up I saw myself as a natural for itâ, he said. âItâs a liberal held seat and all the ultra-Conservative candidates they have had in the past have failed in some respect to appeal to these more progressive and liberal thinking voters. âA candidate with more inclusive values would be a bonus in the constituency. I think I could do a good job there for that exact reason.â Mr Massow said he could bring life experience to the role and that he was âjadedâ with career politicians. He defected to Labour in 2000 saying the party, then lead by William Hague had become âintolerant and just plain nastyâ, but returned some years later. He said: âIâve always wanted to be an MP, but not for the sake of being an MP. Having grown up in the care system, learned from my successes and failures in business and done charity work I genuinely, genuinely think Iâve got something to give backâ While he disagreed with critics of gay marriage, he said he would âagree to disagreeâ with voters on the issue and conceded many of his friends agreed with Mr Costelloe. âIâve got lots of close friends who seem so open minded and right on who agree with himâ, he said. âI know it comes from a place of goodness and know they genuinely believe in something, but I donât have any time for the view itself. David Cameron has to be strong like Tony Blair had to be strong when he nipped that tendency in the bud.â The West Country seat is held by Mr Heath with a majority of 1,819. Mr Costelloe said: âWhen you have a majority of 20,000 the local party can go hang, but this is a marginal seat and David Cameron has to win it if he wants to form a government and that means a lot of work by local activists before election day. âYou need old ladies stuffing envelopes, people canvassing, and all those things are about keeping your membership as high as possible. In the shires the majority of people are against it and itâs a matter of astonishment to me that something making people leave the party is even being considered. It has been pushed over everyoneâs heads, and there is a form of self-censorship at the top of the party about it.â","Ivan Massow has applied to contest the seat of Somerton and Frome .

An armour manufacturer has developed a whiteboard that doubles as a bulletproof shield, aimed at protecting children in the classroom. Inventor George Tunis was driven to create the board in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut last year, in which 27 people were killed. The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range. Scroll down for video . Bulletproof: A bulletproof whiteboard has been developed by defence suppliers Hardwire for use in schools, following the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre . Protection: The boards, measuring 18 by 20 inches, can stop a bullet from a handheld gun fired at pointblank range without it ricocheting . They are also less dense than water, meaning the armour can float. The inventor hopes the boards can initially operate as teaching tools, but will be able to cover the head and torso in emergency situations. Referring to shooting incidents at schools, Mr Tunis, said: 'It's something I don't think any American can tolerate anymore, and we're in a position to do something about it.' The CEO of company Hardwire, added: 'I was like: alright, let's take everything we got, see what we can throw at this problem, figure out an innovative solution. The boards, which weigh 1.7kg, have three rubberised handles on the back, allowing it to be held in front of the body. The white boards are similar to Hardwire's Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle technology, which is used to protect military convoys in Iraq and Afghanistan. Strong: A closeup of the board after ballistic testing shows how the bullets have been blocked by the shield . The armor . is created from polyethylene-based textile called . Dyneema. Mr Tunis said the boards could buy children and teachers time before the police arrive in possible emergency situations, acting as a last line of defence. He said: 'As teachers are doing their daily lesson plans, it's in their hands. And if there's a crisis, it's in their hands. 'Teachers are not first responders, but sometimes they're thrust into that role.' Raft: The company says the boards, which can be used to rush attackers, are also able to float as they are less dense than water . The inventor donated 90 of the products, valued at $20,000 (Â£12,600) to Worcester Preparatory School, where his children are schooled. Headmaster Barry Tull told USA Today: The products he has provided for us, I have been able to (provide) widespread layered protection throughout all the buildings on our campus.

They subjected their three children aged 5, 6 and 8 to horrific torture when they believed they had misbehaved. Torture: James Taylor, 29, and wife Samantha Taylor, 26, pleaded guilty to child endangerment and unlawful restraint. The boxes were only one form of torturous punishment used against the children . Taped in: This is one of the storage boxes used in the abuse of three children in Steubenville, Ohio. The three children 8, 5, 6 were stuffed in the boxes which were then taped shut . It included restraining the children before taping them into small storage boxes. They were placed inside the boxes for 15-30 minutes with square holes cut out of the lids to expose the top part of their faces. Water was also poured on the children while they were crammed in, struggling to breath. They also had weights dropped on . their toes and were forced to stand on their tiptoes in the corner of a . room with pins placed under their feet when the parents believed they had misbehaved. They would then be given heavy . weights to hold up in the air so when they finally gave way the pins . would pierce through the soles of their feet.

'It also included the children having to stand in a . corner on their tiptoes with pins and needles placed under their feet . while holding weights out in the air. 'I can't imagine that they would be . able to stay on their tiptoes for all that long, so if and when they . were to fall, their feet would have to come down on top of these pins . and needles.'

'To carry around a weight like that would be devastating in the long run.' Scroll down for video . Spotlight: Sheryl Crow's interview in which she speaks about her former fiance Lance Armstrong's doping confession will air on Tuesday night . The Grammy Award-winning singer made the comments during her appearance on the popular weeknight show during which she told interviewer Nancy O'Dell that she only caught 'bits and pieces' of Armstrong's interview. These are the second such comments that she has made with regards to the fallen cyclist, who was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in August. In an interview with Katie Couric last year Crow admitted she was pained by his admission that he used performance enhancing drugs. 'I felt bad. I felt bad for him, I felt . bad for his family and I kind of felt like the rest of America,' said . the singer. 'He is a hero we watched and looked up to and admire.' 'I know how hard he worked to win those titles, and you know, it was hard to watch,' said Crow. However, she know believes that Armstrong should feel a sense of relief that he has said and done the right thing finally. Sheryl Crow was appearing on Entertainment Tonight to speak about her forthcoming role as a judge on ABC's The Voice and reluctantly answered questions on her ex-fiance . Low profile: Sheryl Crow looked ashen-faced and pensive as she left Craig's in West Hollywood on Monday night after dinner with friends . The Grammy Award winning musician was . in a relationship with the disgraced cyclist from 2003 to 2006, which . coincided with the last two of his tainted seven Tour de France wins. This comes as reports claim that Crow, who famously . dated Armstrong a decade ago, knew all about his . cheating ways. The Grammy . Award winner, was reportedly present when Armstrong asked teammate Frankie Andreu and his wife to retract a statement that they'd heard Armstrong tell a doctor had doped in an Indiana hospital room in 1996. Armstrong started dating Crow in 2003 and the couple were briefly engaged before calling it quits for good in 2006.

Celebuzz reported that she was twice named in affidavits given to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency by Betsy Andreu that alleged Armstrong had used performance enhancing substances. Crow herself has not spoken about the doping allegations. In an interview last year with Katie Couric, she said: I felt bad. I felt bad for [Armstrong], I felt bad for his family and I kinda felt like the rest of America.' Crow's reps did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She added: 'He is a hero that we watched and looked up to and admired.' Armstrong refrained from mentioning Crow in his landmark admission interview with Oprah Winfrey that aired last week on her OWN network. After the interview aired, Betsy Andreu spoke to CNN and was on the verge of tears as she spoke of her disbelief and disappointment that the disgraced athlete didn't come clean. Support: Armstrong, seen here at the 2005 Tour de France with Crow and his three children from his . first marriage . The disgraced cyclist battled to fight back tears as he talked about son Luke . Armstrong told Oprah that he believes he deserves to be given the opportunity to compete again . She said: 'He owed it to me. You owed it . to me, Lance, and you dropped the ball. After what youâve done to me . and what youâve done to my family, and you couldnât own up to it? Now . weâre supposed to believe you? 'You had one chance at the truth, and . this was it. If the hospital room didn't happen then just say it didn't . happen. But he won't do it because it DID happen. 'That's . not being transparent. That's not being completely honest. By saying he . won't go there is just skirting around the issue. 'This exchange has made me furious. He used to be my friend and he decimated me. I was willing to give him a . chance and this is how he responds? It just doesn't make sense.' Armstrong was close to tears at times when he spoke about the impact of his drug cheating on his family during the second part of his exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey on Friday night. Winfrey also drew Armstrong out on . his ex-wife, Kristin, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the . doping and lying to ask him to stop. He credited her with making him . promise that his comeback in 2009 would be drug-free. Ex: Winfrey drew Armstrong out on his ex-wife, Kristin, right, whom he claimed knew just enough about both the doping and lying to ask him to stop . 'She said to me, ""You can do it under one condition: That you never cross that line again,'"" Armstrong recalled. 'The line of drugs?' Winfrey asked. 'Yes. And I said, ""You've got a deal,'"" he replied. 'And I never would have betrayed that with her.' Armstrong has also been romantically linked to fashion designer Tory Burch, whom he dated in 2007, but her knowledge of the cyclist's doping is not known. Speaking about his 13-year-old son . Luke, the oldest of his five children, Armstrong told Oprah: 'I saw my son . defending me and saying, ""That's not true. What you're saying about my . dad is not true.'"" 'That's when I knew I had to tell him.' Critics said Armstrong hadn't been contrite enough in the first half of the interview, but on Friday night he seemed to lose his composure when Winfrey zeroed in on the emotional drama involving his personal life.

'Thank God he's more like Kristin (Armstrong's first wife and Luke's mother).' Armstrong also confirmed he has been undergoing therapy to deal with his demons. Armstrong was competing in triathlons, mountain bike events and marathons before he was sanctioned and believes he deserves that opportunity in the future, suggesting a life ban is not right.

Big money: Chief executive David Higgins could pocket an annual bonus of Â£700,000, on top of his Â£560,000 salary, Â£160,660 pension payments and Â£15,000 additional benefits . Bosses at Network Rail could be in line for bonuses worth 125 per cent of their salary, according to a leaked memo. It means NR chief executive David Higgins could pocket an annual bonus of as much as Â£700,000, on top of his Â£560,000 salary, Â£160,660 pension payments and Â£15,000 additional benefits. The news will infuriate commuters and . train travellers facing huge hikes in rail fares for an 'inadequate . service', in which trains are often overcrowded and more than 40 per . cent do not arrive on time. The train company's top bosses already receive bonuses of up to 60 per cent of their salary - but they have now brought in consultants from Deloitte to advise on pay packages. Deloitte said the average package in the 'outside world' includes a yearly bonus of 75 per cent of an executive's salary and a long-term bonus equivalent to half of their annual pay. It also said that NR's pension benefits were at the median to lower end of the scale. The proposed pay package seen by the Daily Telegraph would also push the take-home pay of three other NR directors to more than Â£1million. Operations director Robin Gisby, financial director Patrick Butcher and infrastructure director Simon Kirby would all receive bonuses of around Â£450,000 a year, plus 'golden handcuff' payments of Â£300,000, intended to stop them leaving. They would also be handed long-term bonuses of up to Â£350,000 for 2009-2011, while Mr Higgins does not qualify for this yet because he only got the top job in February 2011. Top bosses: Operations director Robin Gisby and finance director Patrick Butcher would also receive bonuses of around Â£450,000 a year, 'golden handcuff' payments of Â£300,000 to stop them leaving and long-term bonuses . Punctuality: The blue line shows what proportion of trains arrive on time month-by-month; the red line shows a moving annual average; and the green line shows the trains arriving within one minute of schedule (i.e. not precisely on time) Shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: âCommuters facing nine per cent fare rises will be outraged at the scale of the bonus packages being enjoyed by a few at the top of the rail industry. âIt will be unacceptable if payouts on this scale are made when performance remains deeply inadequate, with many passengers facing overcrowded services and too many delayed and cancelled trains. âThe Government should sit down with Network Rail and look again at whether a bonus scheme on this scale is really appropriate in a company funded by the taxpayer by more than three billion pounds every year.â The news comes after NR bosses gave up their bonuses last year, amid pressure to reduce high payouts at a time of public sector austerity. Manuel Cortes, head of the TSSA rail union, said: 'While passengers struggle to cope with ever rising rail fares, it is simply scandalous that they should be looking to reward themselves with double your money bonuses at a publicly funded company. Four bosses could be in line for pay packages of more than Â£1million, while customers face nine per cent fare hikes . 'These executives are living in cloud cuckoo land if they think the taxpayers are going to fund this blueprint to make themselves millionaires at our expense.' NR executives are some of the highest paid in the public sector, as the head of its remuneration committee admitted at a meeting in December. But Graham Eccles stressed that they remain in the 'lower quartile' of private sector organisations, and the company needs to be able to attract and retain top employees. A Network Rail spokesperson confirmed that Deloitte had offered advice to a meeting of its members, but said: 'No decision on bonuses has been made by the remuneration committee and therefore any figures are pure speculation. 'Our pay structure is agreed by the Office of Rail Regulation and any future award of bonuses will depend on company performance.' The final pay packages will be agreed upon at a meeting in May or June.","Would take annual pay packages of four bosses to more than Â£1million .

MIssing: Tom Armstrong has disappeared after travelling to Thailand to take a diving course on the island of Koh Tao . The mother of a 22-year-old who failed to return home from a gap year trip to the Far East is preparing to fly to Thailand to look for him herself. Mother-of-four Helen Armstrong-Bland will go to Bangkok to look for her second child, Tom Armstrong, who said he would return home on January 8 but never did. It is believed that university graduate Tom is still in Thailand, possibly in the Bangkok area, and records have shown that money was withdrawn from his bank account in the city last week. Tom Armstrong, of Suffolk, vanished after taking an eight-month dive master course on the island of Koh Tao, during which time he kept in regular contact with his family. He was due to return home for Christmas, but Mrs Armstrong-Bland, 46, said he changed his flight to January 8 after 'running into trouble' in the Thai capital. However her son, who lived with his parents and two younger siblings in Kelsale, near Ipswich, did not board the plane and has not made contact since January 6. Now Mr Armstrong's distraught family and police are growing increasingly concerned and are appealing for any information that would indicate where he is, and that he is alive and well. New evidence shows money was withdrawn . from his account last week and the police are trying to get hold of CCTV . footage to see if the transaction was made by Mr Armstrong. Meanwhile his increasingly worried mother is preparing to fly out there herself to look for him. 'Tom went out to Thailand last April to relax and do a dive masters course and we had regular emails from him and Facebook updates,' said mother-of-four Mrs Armstrong-Bland, who is a teacher. 'He was meant to come home for Christmas and he had sent lots of emails chatting about what he would do when he returned and how he was looking forward to seeing the family. 'But for some reason he didn't arrive.' Closeknit family: Mrs Armstrong-Bland and her second son, Tom, 22, who has gone missing in Thailand . Mrs Armstrong-Bland and husband Chris Bland, 58, thought he might have been visiting a friend and waited for him to turn up. But they became concerned when they suddenly got an email from him on December 23 saying he had run into trouble in Bangkok. 'He told us he had tried to get another flight sorted but couldn't, so he had returned to the island of Koh Tao,' she said. 'We were relieved he had made contact but then all communication went quiet again. 'We rang the dive school to check if Tom was alright and they said he had become very withdrawn and refused to talk to us on the phone. 'Kind, considerate and sensitive': Tom Armstrong . 'We were extremely worried as it didn't sound like he was in a very good place.' On January 3 they had another email from their son saying he had a flight organised for January 8 but once again, he did not turn up. 'We know he booked the flight but he wasn't on it,' said Mrs Armstrong-Bland, who has three other children, Luke, 24, who lives in Japan, George, 18 and Bella, six. 'The dive school said he left the island on January 2 with all his diving gear, so it looked as though he was going to catch his flight, but it never happened.' Mr Armstrong's family has not heard from him since and Suffolk Police has now launched an appeal urging anyone who knows where he is to contact them. The police have been carrying out extensive enquiries to find him and have been liaising with contacts in Thailand in attempts to trace him. Mr Armstrong did a Btec engineering course at Durham University and planned to go into the Navy. But he broke his leg and had to postpone his application, so travelled to Thailand last April to recuperate and do a diving course. 'He was having a whale of a time and absolutely loving it,' added Mrs Armstrong-Bland. 'But he is a home body and I know he was really looking forward to coming home. 'Tom is a kind, considerate, sensitive person, who often puts others' needs before his own. He loves the outdoors, nature and in particular water sports and ocean life. 'We just don't know what has happened to him, if he is injured or had a breakdown or got in with the wrong crowd. 'We don't mind what has gone on, we just want to know he is ok.' 'I know he was really looking forward to coming home': Mr Armstrong's mother is preparing to fly out to look for him . Mrs Armstrong-Bland added: 'We all really miss him and love him and want him to come home. 'If Tom is reading this appeal now, I would urge him to get in touch with us or with police and let us know that he is OK. 'I am planning to fly out there and am waiting for the police to advise me when would be the best date to go.Â  I will go with my husband, my eldest child or my brother.'

Two young brothers have been swept 50 ft to their deaths by an avalanche while on a snowmobiling trip with their family near their Utah home. The parents and sisters of 14-year-old Coleman Sweat and seven-year-old Trevan Sweat watched in horror as the snow beneath the youngsters' feet gave way as they stopped to take in the view. The boys were swept down the hillside in Wasatch County and buried under two feet of snow. When their family found them 30 minutes later, they were unconscious and could not be revived. Tragic: Coleman Sweat, 14, left, and his seven-year-old brother Trevan died in a snow slide on Friday . The tragedy occurred when the Sweat family - experienced snowmobile riders who were well prepared for the trip - were snowmobiling in Duchesne on Friday afternoon and stopped to rest. Coleman and Trevan went to look over a ledge when it gave way, police told Fox 13. 'They parked on the road and then they just walked 50 feet from their . snowmobiles,' Jared Rigby, Wasatch County Sheriff Chief Deputy, said. 'The cornice gave way and they fell.'

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 04:46 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:38 EST, 23 January 2013 . It is nearly four decades since the British people were last given the chance to have their say on Europe, in the first ever referendum held throughout the UK. And now that David Cameron has promised an in-out referendum on the EU by 2017, the parallels between the first European vote and the one potentially looming are striking. In the mid 1970s, Britain was slipping behind its European neighbours, as the government struggled to deal with runaway inflation and was forced to introduce a three-day working week due to severe electricity shortages. Battle: During the 1975 referendum on Europe, Prime Minister Harold Wilson, left, had to face down a rebellion from other members of the Cabinet such as Tony Benn, right . Europhile Conservative Prime Minister . Ted Heath firmly believed that the way to rescue the UK from its economic slump was to join . the European Economic Community. The decision to sign up in 1973 came . after 300 hours of bruising debate in Parliament, and in the end passed . by just eight votes. Labour came to power the following year with a manifesto which promised to offer a referendum on whether or not to stay in the EEC. The position of the new Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, was similar to that set out by Mr Cameron today - he pledged to renegotiate the terms of Britain's membership, then campaign for an 'in' vote in the referendum. However, in a contrast to the current situation, most of the Eurosceptic opposition at that time came not from the Right but from the Left, led by firebrand MP Tony Benn. The referendum was officially called in April 1975, with the date set for June 5 that year - despite many MPs arguing that a public vote would violate the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Support: Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, pictured casting her vote, campaigned to stay in the EEC . Grandees: Liberal Jeremy Thorpe, Tory Ted Heath and Labour's Roy Jenkins (pictured left to right) teamed up to make the case for Britain maintaining close ties to Europe . Despite the brief campaigning period of just two months, the argument was fierce and divisive - but this time, it was Labour rather than the Conservatives which was torn apart by disagreements on Europe. The party chose to remain officially neutral, due to the split between the pro-EEC leadership and the overwhelmingly Eurosceptic membership. Unusually, members of the Cabinet were allowed to campaign against each other, with left-wing ministers facing off against their more moderate colleagues. As well as Benn, future Labour leader Michael Foot and pioneering veteran Barbara Castle found themselves ranged against the likes of Home Secretary Roy Jenkins and James Callaghan, who became Prime Minister on Wilson's resignation the next year. Margaret Thatcher, recently elected leader of the Tories, argued for staying in the EEC, as did most of her party as well as the Liberals. Opposition: Future Labour leader Michael Foot, pictured with his wife Jill, helped lead the 'no' campaign . Count: Volunteers tallying ballot papers in Earls Court after the referendum on June 5, 1975 . England: 68.7% for, 31.3% against . Scotland: 58.4% for, 41.6% against . Wales: 64.8% for, 35.1% against . Northern Ireland: 52.1% for, 47.9% against . TOTAL: 67.2% (17,378,581) for, 32.8% (8,470,073) against; turnout 64.5% . The 'yes' campaign was . supported and funded by big business, anxious to secure access to the . Common Market which covered all of Western Europe, and to share in the . economic boom enjoyed by the likes of France and Germany. It . was strongly opposed by the trade unions, who warned that British jobs . would be lost if labour markets were opened up, and urged the UK to seek . alternative trading partners outside Europe. The arguments deployed by both sides were largely to do with the economic effects of close links with Europe - few would have predicted that the EEC would grow into today's European Union, with wide-ranging powers to make laws for member states. The question on the ballot paper on June 5 read: 'Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (Common Market)?' The eventual result was a landslide for the 'yes' campaign, with 67.2 per cent of the public voting to stay in the Community. Every single council area saw a majority in support of the EEC, with the exception of Shetland and the Western Isles. Parallel: David Cameron now finds himself in a similar position to Wilson's after pledging an EU referendum . The UK therefore remained in the EEC, which had its origins in the Treaty of Paris in 1951 establishing the European Coal and Steel Community involving West Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg. By the 1970s, when Britain joined alongside Denmark and Ireland, the group had expanded to include a customs union and common policies on agriculture and trade, but did not impose regulations within member countries. The EEC was replaced by the European Union as a result of the Maastricht Treaty, which came into force in 1993 after sparking the first signs of Tory Euroscepticism in Britain, with a huge backbench revolt against John Major's attempt to ratify the agreement. The EU has now swollen to 27 countries, with Romania and Bulgaria the most recent new additions, and has wide-ranging powers to set laws which must be obeyed by all its members. In the aftermath of the 1975 result, many observers ascribed the overwhelming result to the deep pockets of the 'yes' campaign and its successful attempts to demonise Eurosceptics as either left-wing extremists, such as Benn and Foot, or xenophobes, such as Enoch Powell. In the forthcoming EU referendum, the 'yes' campaign, which will be supported by the leaders of all three parties, is likely to take a similar approach by painting those wishing to leave the Union as dogmatic isolationists. Recent polls have shown the UK closely divided over Europe - a YouGov survey released this week suggested that 40 per cent would vote to stay in the UK while 34 per cent wanted to leave, but a poll in November showed more than half of people wanted to quit the EU.","Poll on June 5, 1975 was the first referendum ever held in the UK .

Thanks to Twitter enabling famous faces to wax on (and on) about the wonders of face creams, trainers and snack foods with whom they have sponsorship deals, you can't move for celebrity endorsements these days. But some - Elizabeth Hurley for Estee Lauder, David Beckham for Armani, Cheryl Cole for L'Oreal - are rather less embarrassing than others. Celebrities putting their names to some less glamorous products recently include presenter Carol Smillie for 'period pants', performer Dawn O'Porter for a Â£3m Andrex Washlets campaign and singer Katy Perry, reportedly paid Â£1.9m for endorsing Proactiv acne cream. Period pants: Carol Smillie and Annabel Croft, pictured, have come up with Diary Doll underwear to protect young girls from embarrassing mishaps when they have their periods . (And that's before we've even mentioned those JLS-branded Durex condoms, and Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner's confession that she uses Poise Pads to relieve her incontinence problem.) Smillie has just launched Diary Dolls - a pair of 'waterproof but breathable' briefs to protect young girls with irregular periods from having 'embarrassing accidents' - with friend and former professional tennis player Annabel Croft. Describing how the Â£9.99 underpants work, the website blurb says: 'DiaryDoll period pants are there to be your best friend when your period is due! 'Super soft and lightweight, they feel and look exactly like ordinary pants but have a secret waterproof, breathable panel to minimize any embarrassing leaks. Great for heavy periods, overnights, sport, in fact anytime you need a little extra protection. 'DiaryDolls come in their own pretty drawstring purse to keep in your bag all the time so you're never caught short. They'll reduce that worry or humiliation, and buy you enough time to get yourself sorted. DiaryDoll, relax, she's got it covered, period.' Diary Doll: The briefs come in black or white and are priced at Â£9.99 . Meanwhile, Dawn O'Porter - who changed her name from Dawn Porter when she married actor Chris O'Dowd last year - came under fire from Janet Street-Porter after appearing on Andrex's new commercial for Washlets wet wipes. Really? Dawn O'Porter appears on Andrex's adverts for Washlets, telling women they should be using them if they want to be really clean . In her column in the Daily Mail, Street-Porter condemned Dawn for selling women unneccessary hygeine products by making them insecure about their bodies. She said: Dawn O'Porter, once a sassy telly presenter, is reduced to masquerading as Claudia Winkleman, driving around the country in a battle bus, exhorting the female population to start wiping their bottoms with Andrex Washlets. 'Cleanliness warrior Dawn is a traitor to feminism, no matter what she writes on her blog. While there may be justification for buying pads if you suffer from a weak pelvic floor, I'd bet 99 per cent of women have absolutely no need for these products. 'Wet toilet tissues are hardly environmentally friendly because when they're flushed down the loo they take longer to break down. One water company is spending Â£9 million a year on clearing blockages caused by products like this - a cost that will surely be reflected in our water bills. 'More importantly, who thinks women are so stinky we need to wipe our bottoms with WET tissues? What's wrong with loo paper? Obviously, manufacturers have to come up with new, more expensive products to flog us, and to do that, they trade on our insecurity.' Singer Katy Perry was in a spot of bother last summer for putting her face and name - along with Justin Bieber - to a 'miracle' acne cream that was accused of presenting a 'misleading' message to British audiences. Spot of bother: Katy Perry endorsing acne cream Proactiv, though the advert was later banned when a viewer complained the ingredients in the American product were different to those in the English one . British watchdogs banned the Proactiv . commercials in Britain since the UK version of the product - which . boasted celebrities including Elle Macpherson, Avril Lavigne and Made In . Chelsea's Gabriella Ellis among its celebrity endorsers - does not . contain the same active ingredient used in the American brand. The Proactiv ads, shown on a . teleshopping channel, showed Perry - rumoured to be paid almost $3m . (Â£1.9m) for her endorsement - telling viewers the cream had helped clear . up her problem skin. A further series of ads on the . Proactiv website showed other stars, including Justin Bieber, giving . their support for the product.

'At any point during the last 10 years when you were living with Linda, did you ever scream for help?' asked Mr Yacoubian Jr. 'No,' Mr Sanabria replied. But Mr Sanabria also said he was not . allowed to go outside without permission and was typically kept in a . locked basement, attic or wardrobe. Mr Sanabria testified that Weston, .

Threats: Neil Andersen has been handed an indefinite prison term after he admitted setting fire to a sex shop. He previously stalked a BBC actress . A disgruntled customer who admitted setting fire to a sex shop and had previously stalked a BBC actress has been handed an indefinite prison sentence. A judge at Bristol Crown Court told Neil Andersen, 43, he considered him 'dangerous' and that he was imprisoning him for public protection. Andersen, who has a psychotic illness and has previously threatened to fire bomb a pub, said he had set fire to the sex shop on the Lower Bristol Road, in Bath, because he was 'frustrated' with the owners. He told the startled shop worker 'Iâve got a surprise for you' before pouring petrol around the shop - above which lived a family - and then setting it alight on October 21 last year. Andersen, of Wedmore Park, Bath, Somerset, pleaded guilty to arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered after a judge ordered a jury to acquit him of the more serious charge of arson with intent to endanger life. The court heard the defendant had 11 convictions for 18 previous offences which included affray and stalking women. Andersen had previously harassed a BBC actress - who was not named in court - and had turned up at studios in Cardiff armed with a knife, threatening to harm her boyfriend. He had also made threats against mental health staff and in 1993 he had threatened to fire bomb a pub after being thrown out of the premises. Andersen has a mixed personality disorder and following assessments by two psychiatrists was found to be dangerous and delusional. But the court heard that Andersen could not be detained in a psychiatric hospital . because the two psychiatrists who had assessed him did not agree this . was necessary. The court heard he has a number of conspiracy theories and had told police that he was being persecuted because people were mistaking him for Martin Stenning - a freelance photographer who had been barred in the mid-1990s from taking photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales. Recorder Ben Compton QC told Andersen he was satisfied he posed a dangerous risk to the public based on the psychiatric reports. 'Dangerous': A judge at Bristol Crown Court (above) told Andersen that he was imprisoning him for public protection . Passing an indefinite prison sentence, the judge said Andersen would have to serve at least four years in prison before being considered for parole. Prosecutor Richard Posner told the court Andersen had bought a green petrol container from DIY store Homebase before going to a Sainsburyâs petrol station to fill it up. He then walked the short distance to the sex shop, which sells sex toys and pornographic material, at about 7pm. Mr Posner said shop worker Mark Morris remembered telling Andersen that a family lived upstairs, before fleeing the shop. The flames destroyed the premises, owned by Darker Enterprises Ltd, but the court heard there had been no intent to endanger life. Prosecutor . 'He (Andersen) was frustrated with the products in the adult shop,' Mr Posner said. 'CCTV footage of what this defendant did shows liquid thrown around the adult shop and then lit. It went up in flames.' The court previously heard Andersen told police after his arrest: 'My gripe is with the company that runs the shop, not the worker. 'I have a gripe about some of the DVDs they sell and produce and I have been receiving hassle from someone. 'My gripe is that the company used to use a courier in the capital and he got dropped into the s*** when he lost some property.' Andersen went on to tell police that he was being persecuted because people were mistaking him for Martin Stenning, a freelance photographer who had been barred in the mid-1990s from taking photographs of Diana, Princess of Wales. 'I am getting hassle left, right and centre,' he told detectives. Dr Sabarigirivasan Muthukrishnan, a locum consultant psychiatrist, told the judge that because of Andersenâs personality disorder he posed a 'varied' risk to the public. He said Andersen was able to premeditate, meticulously plan and carry out certain actions. The psychiatrist told the judge Andersen had threatened doctors and mental health staff and agreed that he had phoned the workplace of the BBC actress, posing as a psychiatrist himself, in order to contact her. James Bennett, for Andersen, said his client took exception with 'some force' to the fact he was referred to as 'delusional' and that Andersen claimed he could prove his 'conspiracies' were factually correct. He added his client felt aggrieved by the court system and believed that his sentencing had been rushed. Balding and bespectacled Andersen showed no emotion as the judge passed sentence.","Neil Andersen already has 11 convictions for 18 offences .

Investigation: Detective Chief Inspector Saunders (pictured) said he was not looking for anyone else in connection with the killings . The police investigation is being led by Detective Chief Inspector Ian Saunders, of the Brunel Major Crime Investigation Team. An incident room has been set up at Marlborough police station. Det Ch Insp Saunders said: 'I am extremely keen for any sightings of Graham Anderson with the two children between Saturday 25 August and Saturday 1 September. 'He was a regular bus user and I now need to trace his movements, and those of the boys during the week leading up to the discovery of their bodies at lunchtime yesterday.' Earlier, Det Ch Insp Saunders said detectives were 'unsure' what had happened before the three died . 'At . this early stage we cannot be sure what has led up to this terrible . incident, but I can say that we are treating the tragic deaths of the . two children as suspicious,' he said. Mark of respect: Residents left flowers at the scene of the tragedy . 'I am not looking for anyone else at this time in connection with this incident. 'The mother of the children has been informed and we are seeking to contact other family members. 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have died.' The alarm was raised yesterday afternoon by Mr Anderson's landlady, who was due to show prospective new tennants around his flat in Auchinleck House, Sidbury Heights. To her horror, she discovered the bodies of the father and his sons. Det Ch Insp Saunders said the case was an extremely tragic one. 'I can say that we are not looking any third party involvement,' he added. Since then, police have launched a major investigation - carrying out extensive door-to-door inquiries in the area. Initial information revealed the last known activity in the flat was on Thursday morning. However, a key piece in the jigsaw will be the results of the post-mortem examinations. This evening, an examination of Mr Anderson's body is being conducted at Flax Bourton near Bristol. Tests on the bodies of the two boys are likely to be conducted over the next couple of days in Southampton. A specialist team of officers has also been assigned to support shell-shocked family members. Among them, is the boys' mother - who is said to have separated from their father. 'It has clearly been a shock for her to find out and she is very distressed,"" said Det Chief Insp Saunders. 'But she will be given the best possible support we can provide.' The tragedy has also sent shockwaves through the rural town of Tidworth and the Sidbury Heights estate - which is home to many families. Neighbours have continued to leave flowers, soft toys and messages of condolence outside the building's main entrance. As police staged a press conference outside the house this afternoon, . Superintendent Matt Pullen told the gathered crowd: 'Obviously the deaths has caused shock in the local community. 'Our heartfelt sympathies go to the families of the deceased. 'Local police are intimately involved with the inquiry to ensure we provide an appropriate presence and reassurance at this difficult time.'Anyone who has information that may assist police is asked to call Wiltshire Police on 101 and ask for the incident room, or if they wish to remain anonymous they can call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Bodies of Graham Gordon Anderson, 36, and two sons discovered at a home in Tidworth, Wiltshire .

It is a problem which will be familiar to many parents: how to curb junk food. Today David Cameron lifted the lid on his own battle to stop his three children drinking too many fizzy drinks. Speaking in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said he was trying to stop 'excessive' amounts of Coca-Cola being consumed in the Cameron household amid calls for a 'war on sugar'. David Cameron, pictured with son Arthur and daughter Nancy in 2007, said he was trying to stop them drinking too much Coca-Cola . Mr Cameron said the government was putting pressure on the food industry to cut the amount of sugar in food and drinks, branding it one of the biggest public health challenges facing in the country. He added: 'That is why we challenge business through our responsibility deal to . try to reduce levels of sugar and that has had some effect. A can of Coke contains up to eight teaspoons of sugar, the Commons was told . 'Frankly, this is one of those health challenges that is not just a . challenge for the health service, it is a challenge for local . authorities for schools and for parents as well. 'And as someone trying to bring up three children without excessive . amounts of Coca-Cola, I know exactly how big this challenge is.' Mr Cameron and wife Samantha have three children, Nancy, aged eight, Arthur, six, and Florence two. As Tory leader, he famously spoke out against 'irresponsible' shops fueling Britain's health problems. 'As . Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith's promote half-price . Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?' he said in . 2006. Today he was . challenged in the Commons by Labour MP Keith Vaz, who has diabetes and . called for steps to reduce childhood obesity, warning it could leave the . next generation with a diabetes epidemic. He said more should be done to curb the amount of junk food and drink available to young people, fearing obesity will lead to diabetes later in life. The PM was challenged in the Commons by Labour MP Keith Vaz . Mr Vaz said: 'One third of all primary school leavers are either obese or they are overweight, yet they consume cans of Coke and Pepsi that contain up to eight teaspoons of sugar. 'What steps are you proposing to take to engage manufacturers in a war against sugar? 'If we don't act now, the next generation will be overwhelmed by a diabetes epidemic.' The exchanges followed calls from Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham for a 30% cap on the level of sugar in some popular breakfast cereals - which would ban brands such as Frosties, which has 37g of sugar per 100g.","Prime Minister challenged over high levels of sugar in junk food .

A personal assistant whose boss told her he wanted 'to trade her in for a younger model' has won a claim for unfair dismissal at a tribunal. Dawn Bailey, 52, said she felt she had to leave her Â£75,000 a year job at defence giant Lockheed Martin last February after she developed the chronic illness sarcoidosis and depression around the time she turned 50. She was PA to chief executive Stephen Ball but told the tribunal he repeatedly poked fun at her age and said her illness was 'disruptive'. Dawn Bailey, right, won her unfair dismissal case but the tribunal found comments made by Stephen Ball, left, about 'a younger model' were made in jest . When she confided in him that she had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a disease which causes swelling of the joints and a shortness of breath, he told her: 'You being ill is disruptive to me and others in the office'. Despite working for the company for 19 years she resigned last February because it was 'impossible' for her to stay, she said. The Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that Miss Bailey, of Winfarthing, Norfolk, had been wrongfully dismissed from her job and subjected to unfavourable treatment because she suffered from depression. They said that the multi-billion pound company should have appreciated that 'more attention' needed to be given to supporting Miss Bailey after she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in November 2011. The tribunal said the comment about 'a younger model' was made as a joke and rejected a claim for age discrimination but ruled she had been treated unfavourably because of her disability. The tribunal had heard that Miss Bailey had an 'unblemished' career at the military giant, but her relations with her boss Mr Ball began to sour towards the end of 2010 after she was diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a chronic illness she had watched her father died from 25 years earlier. Over the following year Miss Bailey took several weeks off work sick, and the tribunal found that in her absence her job was slimmed down and sidelined. The 52 year-old also told the tribunal that around this time Mr Ball repeatedly told her 'I need to trade you in for a younger model' and 'It is time for a younger, new team'. In December 2011 she was suspended on 'management directed leave' pending an evaluation of her health by an occupational health expert, and escorted from the companyâs offices. Three months later she resigned having 'concluded that all confidence and trust had been destroyed by the company'. Finding that Miss Bailey 'was marginalised' after her return to work, the tribunal said: 'First, such treatment did occur, in the sense that, as we have found, the claimant did not receive proactive support from HR reintegrating and her withdrawn behaviour was met with a degree of cold-shouldering, rather than proactive and sympathetic support.' They did not find that her boss' comments constituted age discrimination because it was said in jest. The ruling said Mr Ball had 'intended the remark to be humorous and friendly'. Miss Baileyâs solicitor Paul McAleavey said her case highlighted the discrimination faced by many middle aged women in UK workplaces. He said: 'We are really pleased with the ruling. Only three per cent of discrimination claims that reach a tribunal are successful so to have arrived at that upper percentile is great. It is a weight of Miss Baileyâs mind. 'This was a woman in her fifties taking on a multi national arms manufacturer and winning on the majority of her claims.' Mr McAleavey said his client had sent out a job application for every working day she has been out of work but has not been invited for one interview. He said: 'She believes it is because of he age. Companies donât want to hire people in their fifties.' Branding as 'puzzling' the tribunalâs dismissal of comments made by Mr Ball that he wanted to trade Miss Bailey in for a younger model as 'humorous', Mr McAleavey said they would consider appealing that part of the ruling. He said: 'It is very strange. On the face of it it would give any business the right to say, for example, ""I want to get rid of you because you are Irish and get someone more reliable in"" and then say ""I am not racist, it was only a joke"". It does lead to that slightly uncomfortable proposition.' Miss Bailey declined to comment on the ruling. A remedy hearing will beheld at Central London Employment Tribunal next month when a panel will decide how much compensation Miss Bailey will be awarded.","Dawn Bailey, 52, resigned after her boss said her illness was 'disruptive'

One tweet wished her a 'horrible death' But Dappy was found not guilty of two counts of common assault which related to allegations that he spat at Miss Burton and Miss Cochran, both 19. Paul Greaney, representing Dappy, argued that the pair were unreliable witnesses because they sent Twitter messages saying they were going to sell their stories to the national newspapers. The court heard that Miss Burton tweeted: 'Ha ha ha, love life, now we are famous', to which Miss Cochran replied: 'Buzzing to be papped.' And Miss Burton sent a BBM (BlackBerry message) saying: 'We need to sell our stories now, to be fair.'

A deadly batch of super-strength ecstasy known as âDr Deathâ is suspected to be behind a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers. Five people have died in the last month â three last weekend just hours after they apparently took the drug. The first was 20-year-old Charlotte Woodiwiss, a promising student in the final year of an art degree. Her body was found on December 22 in a flat in the picture-postcard town of Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire. As her funeral was held there yesterday, tributes from friends were piling up on a Facebook tribute page. Warning: Charlotte Woodiwiss, who died in Derbyshire last month after apparently taking the drug. Her uncle has issued a warning to young people to think before they use such pills . Jordan Chambers, 19, from Wigan, left, who died on Sunday and Gareth Ashton, 28, right, who died on Monday. It is thought they both took contaminated ecstasy tablets . Beside them was an emotional message from Charlotteâs uncle, warning teenagers of the perils of taking illegal party drugs. Dr Death, often shaped like Love . Hearts sweets and also called Pink Ecstasy, has the chemical name PMMA. It is thought to be behind a wave of hospital admissions with nine . people being rushed in for treatment in the last week. It is sold to clubbers for as little . as Â£3 a pill and dealers claim it offers a similar high to ecstasy . (MDMA) but it is around five times as strong and causes a dangerous rise . in body temperature. The effects also take longer to act than ecstasy causing some users to take pill after pill, leading to fatal doses. Earlier this month PMMA was linked to . the deaths of eight revellers in Canada and there have been other deaths . in Eire, Norway and Denmark. The five suspected UK victims â . Charlotte and four men â all died within a 60-mile radius in Manchester, . Liverpool and Derbyshire. Charlotte was a student at Macclesfield . College in Cheshire. On her Facebook page, 40-year-old Matt Woodiwiss . wrote: âIâm Charlotteâs uncle and am absolutely devastated by my . familyâs loss. Our beautiful girl gone far too early. I am heartened by . the fact that so many of you have commented but let this tragic sequence . of events teach you a few things. Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, from Chapel-le-Frith and Dale Yates, 18, from Buxton, both of whom died in December, sparking police to issue a warning of the perils of using pink 'ecstasy' âThink long and hard about how you . live your lives, about which group of people you hang about with and . about who influences you. Itâs all very well writing a few âniceâ things . on a FB wall but if you carry on living your lives as so many of you . are then â as much as it seems like a laugh at the moment â you are . running the risk of your families being torn apart with grief like mine . is. âSo, by all means quote the poems and . write the testimonials, but donât let our little girlâs tragic death be . in vain. Some of you have the chance to be shining stars whilst still . here, and believe me that is far better than being one in death. âSo remember Charlotte with happiness, . remember her vitality, carry on loving her as some of you did, and most . of all learn from this as that is the best testament that you can give . to my beautiful niece.â The second victim was 18-year-old Dale Yates, who died in a flat in the neighbouring town of Buxton on December 23. His father Lawrence Beever, 40, said: . âSo many kids take these recreational drugs but they just donât know . whatâs in them. They go out to parties, they see their friendsÂ  taking . them, so they have some too, and they donât realise theyâre playing . Russian roulette. These pills are deadly, and whoever made them needs to . be caught and locked up.â Mr Beever, who is separated from . Daleâs mother, Carol, said his son was âjust a really lovely, likeable . ladâ who hoped to follow him into the offshore oil and gas industry. In the wake of the deaths, police made . 11 arrests in a series of raids in Derbyshire and warned recreational . users of the dangers of using Pink Ecstasy. Then last weekend three men . died after taking similar drugs within the space of 24 hours. Gareth . Ashton, 28, a plastererÂ  from Wigan, suffered an adverse reaction after . he apparently took the drug and began sweating profusely. He went out . into his girlfriendâs freezing garden to cool down and collapsed from . a massive heart attack. Friends paid tribute to Jordan Chambers, pictured, saying he was 'such a nice lad' who will be 'truly missed' Paramedics were called and he was taken to . hospital but suffered another heart attack and died later the same . night. His girlfriend, Catherine Fulton, 29, . revealed that their ten-day-old daughter, Millie Mai, had died of a . chest infection a year ago. She said: âIt was the one year . anniversary since her death on January 16 and then four days later . Gareth had gone too. Christmas was hard because it was without Millie . and we should have had her there. But Gareth was my rock and I wouldnât . have been able to get over her death without Gareth. This has come as a . massive shock not least because he wasnât a drug abuser. Iâd tell other . people just not to do drugs.

Yesterday police in Greater Manchester . confirmed that toxicology tests were taking place and that they are . liaising with other forces.

A pastor awaiting trial in the 1999 death of his first wife was convicted today in the 2008 death of his second wife. Arthur Schirmer, a former associate pastor at a Methodist church in Reeders, Pennsylvania, blamed his second wife's death on a slow-speed car crash and said that his first wife fell down the stairs. Authorities ultimately charged him with killing both women. The guilty verdict came on Tuesday after prosecutors argued in court that Schirmer clubbed Betty Schirmer on the head with a crowbar, then loaded her into their PT Cruiser and staged an accident. Scrutiny: Arthur Schirmer leaves court during a break in his murder trial at the courthouse in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania earlier this month . Monroe County First Assistant District Attorney Michael Mancuso had asked jurors on Tuesday to convict the 64-year-old of premeditated murder. However Schirmer's attorney insisted in his closing argument that while his client cheated on 56-year-old Betty he had no motive to kill her. 'Accidents happen,' Brandon Reish told jurors. 'Sometimes there are no explanations. Car accidents, falling down stairs, falling off ladders. People die in accidents every day.' Schirmer was convicted of first-degree murder and evidence tampering. He pleaded not guilty and maintained his innocence. His attorney pledged to appeal. The ex-clergyman is charged separately in the 1999 death of his first wife, 50-year-old Jewel Schirmer, and awaits trial in Lebanon County. Schirmer, a longtime United Methodist pastor, claims that Jewel - his wife of more than 30 years - fell down the basement stairs while vacuuming. He said he found her with the cord of a Shop-Vac wrapped around her ankle. 'That's staging 101,' Mancuso said on Tuesday. Questions: Schirmer's first wife Jewel (left) died in 1999 after an alleged fall down the stairs while Betty was beaten to death with a crowbar in 2008 . In cuffs: Schirmer denies having anything to do with either of his wives' deaths in 1999 and 2008 . Like Betty Schirmer, he said, Jewel . Schirmer suffered 'forceful, hard blows to the back of the head. It was . murder, and it was going to happen again'. Schirmer . took the stand in his own defense last week and testified that he was . driving his second wife to the emergency room for treatment of jaw pain in 2008 . when he swerved to avoid a deer and hit a guard rail. Schirmer said that she had removed her seat belt to get comfortable. Local police initially treated it as a . straightforward car crash. State police began a more thorough . investigation months later, when a man committed suicide in the pastor's office after learning he was in a relationship with his wife, . the church secretary. Authorities ultimately concluded the crash could not have caused Mrs Schirmer's extensive head and brain injuries. Police also found her blood on the . garage floor, along with evidence that someone had tried to clean it up. Schirmer contends she was cut while helping him move a wood pile weeks . before the crash.

Aerospace firm Rolls-Royce has announced plans to shed nearly 400 jobs at one of its plants - but is blaming it on the government, a union has claimed. The firm is consulting on shedding the jobs at the Ansty site near Coventry in the Midlands, according to trade union Unite. The announcement puts 378 jobs at risk, the union says, adding that staff were informed of the company's plans in an internal memo. The Rolls Royce site plans to axe nearly 400 jobs, it told staff in an internal memo . Unite has further claimed Rolls-Royce is proposing to shut the plant in the next few years but has put the blame for the company's decision on the Government for what it called 'short-sighted' cuts to the national defence budget. Ian Waddell, Unite's national officer for aerospace and shipbuilding, said the company had sent an internal memo to staff detailing its proposals. Ian Waddell warned that high-skilled jobs will be lost . He said: 'The blame for the loss of these highly skilled jobs in the key defence sector lies with the Government and its short-sighted determination to ram through massive spending cuts in the defence budget. 'Once again, Unite calls for a coherent defence industrial strategy to be drawn up as matter of urgency to safeguard jobs and a defence industry at which Britain excels. 'This is vital - otherwise more high-skilled jobs will be lost, perhaps forever. 'There is a very long timescale for consultation and implementation, so we hope that compulsory redundancies will be avoided. 'However, the underlying reason for the job losses is the Government's defence spending cuts announced a couple of years ago. 'The scrapping of the Harrier jumpjet fleet, for instance, has led to redundancies at the Ansty factory, which will close. 'Meanwhile, work from Germany will be transferred to Rolls-Royce's site at Bristol. 'Unite will be seeking an early meeting with management to discuss the implications for our members and we will taking every step to safeguard their employment now and in the future.' He said bosses at Rolls-Royce had acted 'fairly' by giving as much notice as possible to the staff of the company's plans to shut down the plant. Unite said that the scrapping of the Harrier jumpjet fleet has led to redundancies at the Ansty factory . The 200-acre Rolls-Royce site at Ansty employs about 800 people and handles the refit and repair of both aeroplane and marine engines. Components for the company's Trent series of civil aviation engines are also manufactured on the site. A Rolls-Royce spokesman said: 'We are in consultation with trade unions over reductions in our defence workforce at Ansty. 'We hope to achieve this without compulsory redundancies.

The design team behind the project aimed to capitalize on the sense of 'openness' in the tiny units. The new homes are all between 250 to 370 square feet and have ceiling heights of around 9ft. Each unit has an open-plan living space with kitchen, a separate bathroom, balcony and long storage area packed in close to the ceiling. The apartments were designed with a pull-out pantry, fridge, range and fold-down bed. The new homes will be at 335 East 27th Street inÂ mid-town Manhattan close to the East River.Â  The building will have rehearsal spaces on the ground floor, lecture halls and a cafe. An attic garden and ground-level picnic area have also been planned along with a laundry room, bike room and gym.

Streamlined: The design allows single New Yorkers on limited incomes to live in spaces of under 400ft uin the prefabricated units . Modern living: The design was a joint collaboration by Monadnock Development LLC, Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation and nARCHITECTS . Mayor Bloomberg said on Tuesday: 'New . Yorkâs ability to adapt with changing times is what made us the worldâs . greatest city â and itâs going to be what keeps us strong in the 21st . Century. 'The growth rate for one- and . two-person households greatly exceeds that of households with three or . more people, and addressing that housing challenge requires us to think . creatively and beyond our current regulations.' The current housing codes do not allow for an entire building of micro-apartments in NYC - despite the number of one and two-person households accelerating at the fastest rate. Neat design: Mayor Bloomberg surveys the living space of the new apartment design which will be part of a new exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York . On board: Bloomberg tries the foldaway bed at the apartment which he backed as part of New York's way of adapting for the future . Inspired: The collaborative design is fitted together from different components to make it easier to live in a compact space . City of the future: The building is in mid-town Manhattan close to the East River . Communal living: The apartment complex will also have an attic garden, gym and ground-floor rehearsal spaces and picnic tables . At present 1.8 million people in New York live alone or with one another - yet there are only one million studios and one-bed apartments in the five boroughs.

Two Colorado police officers facing felony charges for shooting a massive elk known as 'Big Boy' by locals have resigned amid an ongoing internal investigation into its death. Sam Carter and Brent Curnow handed in their letters of resignation to the Boulder Police Department on Tuesday following the January 1 shooting which momentarily placed them both under arrest on Friday. 'The Boulder Police Department does not tolerate this kind of behavior,' Police Chief Mark Becknersaid in a statement obtained by ABC. 'Police officers and other members of this department will be held accountable for their actions and behavior, and we want the community to know how seriously we take this breach of trust.' Gunman: Boulder, Colorado, police officers Sam Carter and Brent Curnow, pictured, are accused of maliciously shooting the bull elk known as 'Big Boy' before attempting to coverup their crime . According to an arrest affidavit, . Carter told police the day after the shooting that he encountered an elk . on January 1 that he said was injured and needed to be put down. Carter . then blasted the animal with a shotgun, and Curnow, who was off-duty at . the time, came to pick up the carcass with the help of an on-duty . Boulder County sheriff's deputy, identified as Jeff George, the . affidavit states. Carter did not report the incident or . notify his supervisors that he had fired his weapon that night, though . he told investigators that he called in the incident and said he did not . know why dispatch had no record of it, according to the affidavit. However, cell phone records obtained from phone carriers for Carter, Curnow and George show the shooting was premeditated. Both men face felony counts of tampering . with physical evidence, attempt to influence a public servant and . forgery, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful taking of a trophy . elk, a Samson law surcharge, killing an elk out of season, use of an . electronic device to take an elk, and official misconduct, said District . Attorney Stan Garnett. Guardian: The elk had been seen around the community for several days before he was shot . Carter and Curnow could face prison time and the loss of their official police certifications. An internal investigation will continue past their resignation, according to police. The officers, who had been on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation by the Boulder Police Department, were released on $20,000 apiece, the Denver Post reported. Carter texted Curnow at 2:56am, about ten hours before the shooting, on New Year's Day saying, âfound wapiti (elk) you up?â That was followed by a text at 4:14am saying, âShould I go hunting?â Carter also texted George that night. At 2:45pm, Curnow texted âYou should have killed itâ to Carter. Carter responded, âOh he's dead tonight. His right side is broke off at main beam. And he looks a little smaller. He may not be wapiti, but he's gonna die.â On thin ice: The two officers are facing multiple felony counts and misdemeanor charges, said District Attorney Stan Garnett . When Curnow texted âGet himâ to Carter after 10pm, Carter replied, âToo many people right now.âTwo minutes before midnight, Carter texted âElk downâ to Curnow. All of the texts and phone calls from that night had been erased from Carter and Curnow's phones when they were seized for evidence. Carter allegedly had also applied for a road kill permit with the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department, saying the elk had broken an antler off. Investigators believe Curnow had sawed the antler off. Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace . According to the Colorado Peace . Officer Standards and Training Board, a Colorado police officer could . lose his certification for any felony conviction or one of 43 . misdemeanors, including first-degree official misconduct. The neighboring Colorado community was shaken by the . loss of their beloved elk and held a walk to honor the creature while . accusing the local police department of cruelly misusing their . authority. Several dozen . residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest earlier this month, some blaring . elk calls on their outstretched cell phones. 'We're concerned about the larger . culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying . voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the . walk told CBS Denver. Remembering Big Boy: A woman holds her cell phone, which is blaring elk sounds, as she participates in a walk to honor Big Boy the Elk, who was shot to death by a police officer on January 1 . Memorial: Dozens of people in Boulder, Colorado marched in a silent protest to remember Big Boy on Sunday . The walk was just one in a series of events for the late Big Boy. The week prior, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor. The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some. Curnow had been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera. The Daily Camera revealed that the suspended officer owns a taxidermy website, which advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper. It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat. There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively before it was shot. Vigil: Days after the new year that brought news of the elk's death, hundreds of Boulder residents gathered for a vigil to remember Big Boy .

The body of a Chicago man that was exhumed three days ago for a homicide investigation involving his recently-won lottery money has been buried again Monday. Urooj Khan, 45, had won millions of dollars in a lottery over the summer but died of cyanide poisoning shortly after the windfall. Two of Khanâs relatives stood by his gravesite in Rosehill Cemetery as they watched him being lowered back into the ground. Authorities had called for the exhumation of his body to take samples of flesh, which could provide valuable clues into the manâs mysterious death. Exhumed: The body of Urooj Khan is carried to a hearse for forensic autopsy by the Cook County Medical Examiners office in Chicago Friday morning . New tests: A backhoe is seen at Rosehill Cemetery today as workers begin the process of exhuming the body of Urooj Khan who was poisoned with cyanide after winning the lottery . Cruel death: Urooj Khan (pictured right) with his $1million winnings shortly before his death from cyanide poisoning. His wife Shabana Ansari (left) and his teenage daughter from an earlier marriage Jasmeen (second left) are by his side . The Chicago Tribune reports that the reburial ceremony was quiet and lasted only 20 minutes or so. Family members told the paper that they hope the autopsy will shed some light on Khanâs murder. Medical examiners will take blood, . tissue, bone, hair and nail samples. They'll also examine the lungs, . liver, spleen and contents of the stomach and intestines. Paleologos said tests on Khan's organs also may determine whether the poison was swallowed, inhaled or injected. The autopsy was expected to be finished by Friday afternoon, though it will take two to three weeks to get test results, she said. Khan, 46, died in July as he was about to collect $425,000 in lottery winnings. His death initially was ruled a result of natural causes. But a relative asked for further tests, which revealed he was poisoned. Homicide: Khan, 46, died in July as he was about to collect $425,000 in lottery winnings. His death initially was ruled a result of natural causes. But a relative asked for further tests, which revealed he was poisoned . Process: Cook County Medical Examiner Dr Stephen Cina speaks at a news conference in Chicago on Friday, detailing the process of Mr Khan's exhumation . Khan's wife, Shaana Ansari, and other relatives have denied any role in his death and expressed a desire to learn the truth. However it was revealed last week that she could not eat the final meal of Kofta curry she prepared for her husband because she is vegetarian and her father - who was also in the home - did not eat it because he said he was on a diet. Khan's brother ImTiaz told the MailOnline that his brother was the only one in the house to have eaten the traditional indian meat dish, which was made the day after he collected his check. Uroojâs daughter Jasmeen, 17, also did not eat the food, he said at a court hearing where a judge decided the brother of the lottery winner could be exhumed. Fighting back the tears, ImTiaz demanded justice for his brother and said that the curry he ate shortly before dying was âhighly suspectâ. Uroojâs sister Meraj also revealed dramatic new details of the night he died and said that she was woken up by a 4am phone call with a person screaming at the other end. The voice was so unintelligible she was unable to tell if it was a man or a woman, she said. Khan had come to the U.S. from his home in Hyderabad, India, in 1989, setting up several dry-cleaning businesses and buying into some real-estate investments. Questions: Urooj's sister, Meraj Khan and brother, ImTiaz - who was the one who called police after he suspected foul play after an initial investigation said Urooj died of a heart attack . Anger: . Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone . who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was . 'impossible' that his death was natural . Despite having foresworn gambling after a pilgrimage to Mecca in 2010, Khan bought a ticket in June. He jumped 'two feet in the air' and shouted, 'I hit a million', he recalled at a lottery ceremony later that month. He . said winning the lottery meant everything to him and that he planned to . use his winnings to pay off mortgages, expand his business and donate . to St Jude's Children's Research Hospital. He was just days from receiving his winnings when he died before dawn on July 20. With no outward sign of trauma, authorities initially determined Khan had died of natural causes. But a concerned relative â whose identity remains a mystery â came forward with suspicions and asked authorities to take a closer look. Further toxicology tests found a lethal amount of cyanide in his blood, leading the medical examiner in November to reclassify the death a homicide. Khan died without a will, opening the door to a court battle. The businessman's widow and siblings fought for months over his estate, including the lottery check. Back in the day: The last time that Maria Jones saw her daughter Jasmeen was in 2000 when she and Urooj Khan divorced . Earlier this week, his ex-wife spoke . out publicly saying that she only learned that their teenage daughter . was living in the U.S. after her former husband was found dead under . suspicious circumstances. Khan's . ex-wife Maria Jones said that she thought that Khan had taken their . daughter Jasmeen to live in India after their acrimonious split but only . found out that Jasmeen lives in Illinois when she saw footage of Khan . accepting his giant lottery check. 'I was thinking ""Oh my God! My daughter!""' Jones said. Though Khan's current wife Shabana Ansari is not under formal investigation by police, the dead millionaire's relatives are extremely suspicious that the victim's younger wife may have had a role in the 46-year-old's death. Now that Khan's first wife has spoken out, another element is being added into an already-complicated family drama that resulted in an untimely death and many unanswered questions. Jones lives one state away in Indiana, but believed her ex when he said that he was taking their daughter Jasmeen to India and keeping her there during their split. Mrs Jones was too poor to afford a lawyer at the time so she was unable to contest custody. Even . today her emotional scars are so deep that she has left a dramatic . voicemail on her home answerphone: 'If this is Jasmeen, please leave . your number and I will call you. Iâve been waiting to hear from you. I . love you.' One state away: Khan told Jones that he was taking their daughter to India, and she only discovered after his death that the girl had been living in Illinois this whole time . The disclosure is . another sign that the death of Mr Khan, 46, last July the day after he . collected his winning check has exposed the divisions within his family. Tests . showed he died from cyanide poisoning but no arrests have been made. His second wife Shabana Ansari, 32, has denied she has anything to do . with his death. Speaking to theÂ Chicago Sun-Times,Â Mrs Jones, 43, said that she was 'shocked' when she saw her daughter's face on TV earlier this week. She said: 'I don't know if she knows I'm still alive. I thought she was in India all these years'. Mrs . Jones - formerly Maria Rabadan - met Mr Khan in Chicago where they . worked together. They got married in 1991 but they divorced in 1997. She . said that she later reached out to Mr Khan's relatives and was told . that he had left the US for India with Jasmeen and did not plan to come . back. Mrs Jones did not want . to discuss her relationship with her ex-husband. She merely said it was . a 'really really long story' but said she was desperate to see her . daughter. Desperate: Jones has a plea to her daughter on her outgoing voicemail message . She said: 'I donât know what she knows. She was so little. I donât want to hurt her.' When . MailOnline visited Mrs Jones at her home in Granger, Indiana, her . husband Billy Jones answered the door and said she was in the bath. When . our reporter called later on the phone he said: 'She has decided not to . comment at this time. She's a bit emotional, it's all a bit raw'. 'She didn't know how far she was. She said, ""Oh, mommy. Come and get me. I don't want to be here,""' Jones told NBC. 'There is no telling what she is going through and I'm just so sorry that I can't be there with her. 'I love her with all my heart, and she was always, every minute, every second, in my thoughts and my prayers.' Anger: Urooj's siblings said they had compiled a 47-page dossier on everyone who knew him - including his wife, Shabana Ansari, right, adding it was 'impossible' that his death was natural . Urooj died on July 20 last year the day after he collected the over-sized check from Illinois State Lottery officials at the 7-Eleven near his Chicago home where he bought the winning scratchcard. After taxes, the prize money amounted to $425,000 as he took it in a lump sum. The initial toxicology report did not show up cyanide so the death was ruled as by natural causes. It was only when ImTiaz intervened that the poison was found by further tests. Since then the final meal that Urooj, 46, consumed has become central to the case. According to multiple reports, he was at home at the time with Shabana, Fareedun and Jasmeen. A Chicago police source told MailOnline on Thursday that Shabana did not eat the food, and nor did Jasmeen.

The family of a Texan killed during the gas plant hostage crisis today criticised the Algerian military for not waiting for back-up before launching their botched assault which left dozens of captives dead. Victor Lovelady, 57, a project manager for the Houston-based energy firm ENGlobal Corporation, was one of three Americans who died during the stand-off at the In Aminas plant last week. Around 30 hostages and 15 Al Qaeda gunmen are thought to have died when Algerian helicopters strafed the plant on the second day of the siege just hours after the terrorists threatened to detonate explosives if the authorities intervened. Criticial: Mike Lovelady and his niece Erin Lovelady have accused the Algerian forces of acting too hastily in storming the BP gas plant where their brother and father, Victor Lovelady, died during the siege . 'We could have done better': Erin Lovelady believes her father, Victor (right) may have survived if Algerian troops had waited for support from U.S. and British special forces to launch an 'all-out military assault' The four-day siege then reached its bloody climax when seven workers were executed by their Al Qaeda-linked captors when Algerian special forces stormed the desert facility on Saturday. The botched action took place as an . unarmed American surveillance drone soared overhead - yet the Algerian . government had refused offers of help from America and Britain's crack . special forces as they tried to overcome one of the biggest kidnappings . ever seen in Africa. Mr Lovelady's older brother Mike said: 'My brother should not have had to die this way.' While details of Mr Lovelady's death remain unclear, his family said the Algerian troops should have waited for support from British or U.S. special forces. Terrifying: This newly released image shows an armed Al Qaeda militant (in camouflage) standing guard over Algerian workers outside an accommodation unit of the In Amenas plant . Hands up: This is the moment the gas plant workers surrendered to Al Qaeda militants after they stormed the facility in the early hours of last Wednesday morning . His daughter Erin, 27, told MyFoxHouston: 'I think we could have done better than with an all-out military assault. That's my personal feeling.' She said Mr Lovelady was assured the gas field was safe before he took the job and did so because it would allow him to take one-month periods of time off to see his loved ones. 'There are no words. When I was upset I could call him. I don't have that anymore.' The four-day siege reached its bloody climax when seven workers were executed by their Al Qaeda-linked captors when Algerian special forces stormed the desert facility on Saturday . Victor Lovelady was one of three Americans who died during the stand-off at the plant in In Aminas last week . Two other Americans also died in the . siege - fellow Texan Frederick Buttaccio and Gordon Lee Rowan - while . seven made it out safely. A total of 37 foreign workers are believed to have died at the remote desert facility - part-operated by BP - which was overrun by heavily-armed terrorists. Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand off. Work was continuing today to locate and identify five foreign workers who remain unaccounted for.","Victor Lovelady died during siege after militants stormed Saharan facility .

He appeared in court earlier this month to face accusations of three other attacks on young girls. Further charges: Stuart Hall (pictured left outside court on January 7) was arrested yesterday on suspicion of rape and several indecent assaults, which his solicitor Louise Straw said 'raised serious issues' today .

But now that case will go before magistrates in . Preston on April 16. He has already pleaded not guilty.

The mostly Labrador and Shepherd mixes were found by Palm Springs Police and Animal Rescue Corps officers on Tuesday who raided a boarded up home on Tramview Road after months of neighbors complaints, according to KESQ. What they found was gut-wrenching. 'Unsanitary conditions': 15 dogs were discovered at the property in Palm Springs. The Animal Rescue Corps said the dogs were injured from fighting with each other and lived in unclean surroundings . Complaints: Neighbors had reported the Tramview Road home, pictured left, claiming constant barking and a foul smell. Rescuers ended up finding 15 dogs, one pictured right, living alongside their owner Richard Rutgard . The dogs were covered in bite marks and fresh wounds and lived in unsanitary conditions in the single-family home. They all lived alongside their owner Richard Rutgard, according to the report. Animal Rescue Corps President Scotlund Haisley said: 'The house was very typical to hoarding. It was boarded up, windows were boarded up, doors were boarded up, meaning something is in there and they don't want the world to know what's going on inside.' 'Because you have a large number of dogs in a small area, pack mentality, lots of anxiety, they're fighting over food, they're fighting over space, territory. They're ripping each other apart'. Rutgard says he never wanted the dogs to live in poor conditions. Fighting for food: The Animal Rescue Corps said the dogs were injured because the cramped conditions meant they had fought for space and food . Write caption here . Defense: Richard Rutgard complained to a local broadcaster in August that he had been given an un-neutered puppy by the Palm Springs Animal Shelter. He says this is why he ended up with so many dogs . Five months ago he complained to Palm Springs Animal Shelter saying they had given him a dog that wasn't neutered. He took it home to care for it alongside his two female dogs and that's when the puppies started arriving. 'Why did they sell me a dog that wasn't neutered?' he said in an interview with KESQ in August.Â  ' I'd like to have them [the animal shelter] pay it's like child support for puppies'. The dog-owner was served a notice back then warning he had to get rid of most of the dogs within two months. When asked why he didn't take them back to the home, he added: 'They are so amazingly nice and kind and sweet. I feel safe and secure and happy - they're very therapeutic for a person.' Rescue: The dogs have now been permanently removed from the home, pictured, and will be rehoused . New homes: The dogs rescued in Tuesday's operation, pictured, are now in emergency accommodation at the Palm Springs Rescue Center, right. They will be nursed back to help before hopefully being found new homes . However, they are now in the back in the home and Rutgard faces animal cruelty charges. The dogs will eventually be handed out to new homes across the area . 'Our vet teams are assessing every injury and illness and putting them on a treatment plan,' Haisley added. 'The property owner was very cooperative. He had good intentions but I think he clearly got in over his head and wanted the right thing for these animals.' 'What we see is very difficult, but imagine how rewarding it is to reach into those cages, and break those chains, and look into the eyes of these animals and make them the promise that their suffering has ended forever. It's incredibly rewarding,"" Haisley added. At the time of Rutgard's complaint Palm Springs Animal Shelter said they would look into the allegations.","Richard Rutgard's property was raided by Animal Rescue Corps where they claim they found 15 dogs living in a cramped space .

A reluctant thief, who broke down in tears while demanding the cash register from a Papa John's restaurant, was given a free meal to console himself. The unidentified would-be robber stopped himself half-way through his raid on the pizza chain in Helena, Montana, in the early hours of Monday, theÂ Sun Herald reports . Through his tears the man wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt with a red bandana covering his face told the cashier he had tried to steal in a bid to support his wife and child.

The would-be robber admitted he didn't want to commit the crime on the restaurant at the Prospect Avenue shopping center, pictured . Just moments before - around midnight on Monday - the man, armed with a large knife, had entered the pizza chain on Prospect Avenue handing over a note which demanded money. The clerk was ready to hand over the cash when the intruder had a change of heart and started to cry. In sympathy the cashier gave him a free pizza, wings and a soda and they talked through his problems. 'I'd say the clerk was pretty astute,' Helena Police Chief Troy McGee told the Sun Herald. 'I mean, he knows how to talk to this person. Kind of commiserated with him a little. Talked to him about it and you know actually changed his mind about robbing the place. That was pretty good.' Apparently while waiting for the meal the knife fell out of the intruder's pocket but he never threatened anyone with it. Shoulder to cry on: A cashier at the Papa John's, pictured, comforted a thief who lost his nerve half-way through raiding the restaurant. He gave him some friendly advice and a pizza instead of the cash register . He left the store quietly with his free meal in hand. A manager at the store told the newspaper he couldn't comment on the incident. Police are now searching for the would-be robber - hoping he won't think about turning to crime again. He is described as 5-foot-9, with slender build. 'We would like to locate the suspect,' McGee said. 'Weâd hate to have him do this again.' The police chief said he didn't think he could be charged with anything.","Unidentified thief was trying to steal the cash register from a Papa John's store in Prospect Avenue, Helena .

The brother of EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie today told jurors he has missed his sister every day since he killed her and butchered her body. Window cleaner Tony McCluskie, 35, claims he cannot recall attacking the 29-year-old barmaid, cutting up her body into six pieces and dumping them in a canal. He told the jury he remembers grabbing her by the wrists after she threatened to have his son taken into care - but everything after that is a blank. Trial: Tony McCluskie, 35, (right) admits killing Gemma McCluskie, 29, (left) but claims he has no memory of it . Cordoned off: A police officer by Regent's Canal in east London where Miss McCluskie's torso was found in a suitcase after being thrown into the water in March last year . Asked if he was pretending to forget what happened, bespectacled McCluskie insisted 'No, I'm not.' He claimed his sleep is so tortured by the memory of his sister he wakes every night. 'There is not a moment of the day that passes that I do not think about my sister. I miss her so much,' he said. He added: 'I can't remember attacking her. I didn't have a weapon about me. I have never used a weapon of any sort.' McCluskie has told how his sister made threats to him, his ex-girlfriends and his parents but he denied attempting to portray her as 'a monster' and that he was a 'creative and persistent liar.' But Professor Michael Kopelman, from London's St Thomas's Hospital who is one of the world's top experts on memory loss, told the court there was a problem with McCluskie's claim to have suffered from amnesia. 'There are things that are reminiscent characteristics of the literature on these cases, but there have been inconsistencies in his account and there is a delay in reporting the amnesia,' the professor said. This CCTV footage, shown in court, allegedly shows Tony McCluskie disposing of the body of his sister Gemma in a suitcase . TV: Gemma McCluskie with Dean Gaffney in EastEnders. She appeared in more than 30 episodes of the soap . McCluskie did not tell police when he was first interviewed that he could remember nothing of the killing or hacking his sister's body to pieces. 'He appeared at the beginning to give a vague account of what he had done on the Thursday, Friday and Saturday and then he said no comment,' the professor explained. 'What he told me was he started to remember about the argument at the top of the stairs and grabbing his sister's wrists.' Asked if it was possible his story was true the professor said: 'It is feasible that this might be the case for he might be amnesiac for the actual killing if not for the things that happened thereafter.' But he said it was a matter for the jury to decide. 'There are features which worry me,' the professor added. McCluskie claims he believed his sister was missing and thought it was a 'sick joke' when police charged him with murder. Investigation: A police diver searches Regent's Canal next to Broadway Market, East London, after Gemma McCluskie's body was found in March last year . Ongoing . search: Gemma McCluskie's body was found in Regent's Canal, pictured, . five days after her murder when the suitcase was hit by a canal barge . which caused it to spring open . He says his last memory is of Gemma picking up a knife during a blazing row about him flooding the bathroom at their home in Shoreditch, east London, on March 1 last year. The window cleaner was smoking 15 to 20 joints of powerful skunk cannabis a day and they had also rowed about his drug habit. It is claimed he battered Gemma over the head with a blunt object and then cut her body into six pieces with a meat cleaver at the family home in Shoreditch. On the night of March 2 he was caught on CCTV taking the remains in a suitcase to dump in the Regent's Canal in Hackney. Over the next few days he posed for a picture for The Sun with an appeal poster during the search for Gemma. On March 6 the torso was discovered floating in the water near Kingsland Road by a barge owner. McCluskie admits manslaughter but denies murder. The trial continues.

Eric Prokopi, 38, of Gainesville, Florida, has admitted smuggling dinosaur bones into the U.S. He is pictured with his wife, Amanda and one of their two children . A Florida father-of-two has admitted smuggling stolen dinosaur bones into the US - including those of a Tyrannosaurus he sold for more than $1 million. Eric Prokopi of Gainesville, 38, . stole the skeletal remains of dinosaurs - including a . nearly complete skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus bataar, a relative of the . Tyrannosaurus rex - from Mongolia and China. He came to the . attention of federal officials earlier this year when he sold the . Tyrannosaurus fossils to a Manhattan buyer for $1.1 million. In a plea bargain, Prokopi gave up any claim to the skeleton as well as to others seized by authorities and admitted illegally importing a Chinese flying dinosaur, two oviraptors and a duckbilled creature known as a Saurolophus, the BBC reports. Speaking in court in New York on Thursday, Assistant US Attorney Martin Bell revealed that a second, almost complete, Tyrannosaurus skeleton had also been found at Prokopi's home. He faces up to 17 years imprisonment when he is sentenced in April. The US Department of Homeland . Security conducted an investigation into Prokopi's fossil dealings and . uncovered a laundry list of questionable exchanges, which culminated in . his arrest in October. Upon Prokopi's arrest, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara referred to him as a 'a one-man black market in prehistoric fossils.' Prokopi smuggled the $1.1 million . Tyrannosaurus bataar from Mongolia but claimed on US customs forms . that the fossils were 'broken bones' belonging to lizards and other . reptiles that were imported from the UK, according to an investigation carried out by Homeland Security special agent Daniel Brazier. Prokopi estimated their value at $15,000. Jurassic crime: Prokopi caught the attention of federal . officials when he sold the skeleton of this Tyrannosaurus bataar, which was native to what is now Mongolia, to a . Manhattan buyer for $1.1 million . Forged: . Prokopi smuggled the fossils from Mongolia but . claimed on U.S. customs forms that they were 'broken bones' belonging to lizards and other reptiles that were imported from the . UK, according to federal officials . Convicted: Mr Prokopi outside Manhattan Federal Court in New York, yesterday. He faces up to 17 years in jail when he is sentenced in April . The Tyrannosaurus bataar, also known as the Tarbosaurus, was native to Mongolia and lived nearly 70 million years ago. Their fossils were first discovered in 1946 during a joint Soviet-Mongolian expedition to the Gobi Desert. Mongolia strictly prohibits the removal of dinosaur fossils from its territory. Prokopi, who describes himself as a 'commercial paleontologist,' put the skeleton up for sale in the US with a Texas-based auction house. In his description of the skeleton, he wrote that the dinosaur 'ruled the food chain of the ancient floodplains that are today's Gobi Desert.' He continued: 'The body is 75 percent . complete and the skull 80 percent... Measuring 24 feet in length and . standing 8 feet high, it is a stupendous, museum-quality specimen of one . of the most emblematic dinosaurs ever to have stalked this Earth.' Stolen: A number of smuggled dinosaur fossils were taken from Prokopi's home in Gainesville . Seized: Mongolia does not permit the removal of dinosaur bones from its territory . Arrest: US Attorney Preet Bharara referred to Prokopi as a 'one-man black market in prehistoric fossils' The Manhattan US attorney's office seized the skeleton from Prokopi's transaction and determined, through examinations by several paleontologists, that the bones were dug up in Mongolia. Prokopi had claimed the information on his US customs documents was truthful. He said the fossils were chunks of rocks and broken bones when he received them. Transforming the specimens 'into an . impressive skeleton took thousands of hours and every penny my wife and I . had, but it was fascinating,' Prokopi told theÂ Associated Press earlier this year. 'We . were thrilled and couldn't wait to share him with the world, and hoped . it would inspire others to see the magic of paleontology and develop a . love of science and appreciation of nature,' Prokopi said. At the time of his arrest, Prokopi owned a business in Florida . called 'Everything Earth,' which formerly went by the name of 'Florida . Fossils.' He has a wife and two children. Discovered: Homeland Security agents seized stolen bones from a warehouse near Prokopi's home in Gainesville, Florida . Historic find: The Tyrannosaurus bataar, also known as the Tarbosaurus, was native to Mongolia and lived nearly 70 million years ago . Valuable: Dinosaur bones - such as those smuggled into the US by Prokopi (pictured) - have become big business as demand from collectors grows around the world . The international trade in dinosaur fossils is now a multimillion dollar industry, with collectors prepared to pay huge prices for the most sought-after specimens. Museums and other conservationists want science to come first, but for many of those involved in sourcing fossils today the lure of the mighty dollar appears to be winning out. Many countries have strict regulations on the sale of fossils - and those caught doing so illegally face stiff penalties. A recent case in the US saw renowned dinosaur hunter Nathan Murphy sentenced to three years on probation for stealing 13 dinosaur bones from central Montana's Hell Creek badlands in 2006. He pleaded guilty to theft of government property. Mr Murphy had risen to fame after discovering one of the world's best-preserved brachylophosaurus dinosaur fossils in 2000. The theft of fossils is not a new thing however. In the 19th Century the great 'Bone Wars' were marked by a rivalry between Edward Drinker Cope (of the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia) and Othniel Charles Marsh (of the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale). Each of the two paleontologists used underhanded methods to try to out do the other, including bribery, theft, and even the destruction of bones. The pair searched for fossils in Colorado, Nebraska, and Wyoming, with both using their wealth to finance large scale expeditions between 1877 and189.","Eric Prokopi smuggled dinosaur bones into US pretending they were from lizards 'and other reptiles'

Infuriated by the decapitation of a soldier by Pakistan army regulars on the Line of Control, army chief General Bikram Singh on Monday said the local commanders have been asked to hit back at the place and time of their choosing. A fuming General speaking for India warned Pakistan: ""We reserve the right to retaliate. We cannot be passive when provoked."" Top government sources said limited, localised military conflict with Pakistan was not ruled out. The Army has been put on high alert and Poonch, Rajouri and Uri sectors may see army retaliation. On a day when Gen Bikram Singh talked tough, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh spoke to BJP leaders Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj and assured them that the Opposition would be kept in the loop over the situation. He told them that National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon would brief them tomorrow (Tuesday) on the developments. In sync with the official line of action, an incensed General fumed: ""I expect all my commanders on the Line of Control to be both aggressive and offensive in the face of provocation and fire. I don't expect my commanders to be timid."" The chilling warning was delivered by a combative army chief who termed the beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj of 13 Rajputana Rifles an ""unpardonable"" act completely against the ethics of soldiering. But he was not willing to raise the level of response at this moment as the General asserted that India's payback will be localised and tactical. ""General Bikram Singh has given a good message. He has spoken openly to nail Pakistan's propaganda. The statement was given after four-five days of the incident which means that all investigations have been completed and discussions have taken place. Today's response is not only of the military but also has a political aspect,"" said former army chief General V.P. Malik. Another former army chief, General Shankar Roy Chowdhary, said: ""Definitely there is no gap between the government and the army. Government now should take note of the feeling in the army."" Justifying General Bikram Singh's stand, Lt general (retired) Shankar Prasad said: ""What army chief has said is the position of government of India. He is part of the government. It is a stand taken after going through the developments of the last four to five days. It is a good reaction from India."" Pakistan Army officers (left) and Indian Army officers during the flag meeting . along the LoC at Chakan Da Bagh in Poonch on Monday . Just as the General went public in a manner unusual for an Indian army chief, Pakistan was conveyed the sentiments on the grounds in equally uncertain terms during the flag meeting of brigade commanders held at Chakan Da Bagh in the Poonch sector. The General's outburst was reflected in the flag meeting as Pakistan was bluntly warned to be prepared for retaliation. The Indian side was represented in the flag meeting by Brigadier MVS Kumar of the 120 Brigade. The Pakistani side remained in denial mode. They claimed that they had not intruded into Indian territory on the day the two jawans were killed. When warned by the Indian side of escalation, the Pakistani side maintained complete silence on the issue. It is clear that the Pakistan army establishment is being blasÃ© about this operation, but the Indian Army will no longer tolerate any misdemeanor or misconduct on the LoC. India also asked for the severed head of Lance Naik Hemraj, even though Pakistan denied involvement in the killing. General Bikram Singh was not willing to accept the denial. He slammed the Pakistani army for its blatant lie and claimed that the operation in the Mendhar sector was pre-meditated and executed with planning and after reconnaisance. He denied any provocation from India as claimed by Pakistan army. The General said there was no operation by Indian Army on January 6 in Uri as alleged by Pakistan. The Pakistani army was looking to justify the act on the basis of lies, said General Singh. ""Such operations require time and planning and detailed reconnaissance. They blamed us in Uri and their troops were poised for operation in Mendhar,"" he said. He even claimed that the Indian army has reports about three Pakistan casualties in the firing that has been going on after the Mendhar incident. The army chief's stern warning was in sharp contrast to the soft line taken by the government which was under attack for not nailing Pakistan. The army chief was officially given the signal to go all-out to convey India's anguish. General Singh said clear direction has been given to the northern army commander to retaliate. ""At military level there is clear direction to northern army commander. We got to retaliate in a measured manner and for effect. We shall not be passive. We reserve the right to retaliate at the time of choosing. I expect commanders to be aggressive and assure that army hierarchy is standing behind them,"" said the army chief. While looking to retaliate, India made it clear that it is not willing to up the ante and will reserve its response to the tactical level. ""Their operation was at tactical level. This goes on Line of Control. It has to be dealt with at tactical level,"" said the General, stressing the local commanders will plan when, where and how they have to retaliate. He indicated that Udhampur-based 16 Corps, which commands the vulnerable section of the LoC where the most violations of ceasefire have taken place, will execute the hit-back plan. Northern army commander Lt Gen KT Parnaik . For northern army commander Lt Gen K.T. Parnaik, retaliation for the January 8 incident, where two soldiers of . his command were killed and decapitated, has a more personal meaning. Lance Naik Hemraj and Lance Naik Sudhakar belonged to the 13 battalion . of the Rajputana Rifles. Lt Gen Parnaik is the Colonel of the Raj Rif . regiment. This is significant because regimental affiliations in the . army are thicker than blood ties. Lt Gen Parnaik visited the incident . site on January 9 and confirmed the bodies had been mutilated. The GOC, . described by army officers as spirited and articulate, was seething. It . is not known what he told soldiers of his regiment, but army officers . say he could not have spoken words of restraint.

""It . becomes extremely difficult to control troops in such situations, . especially when they are along the Line of Control,"" an army officer . said.

Office (PMO) said National Security Adviser Shiv Shankar Menon will be . briefing senior leaders of the BJP on Tuesday on the government's plan . of action in response to the brutal murder of two Indian troops by . Pakistani forces on January 8. Sources said Singh told the leaders that . nothing is being done which could not be communicated to the Opposition . leaders. He said the Opposition would be kept in the loop over the . situation. ""The prime minister's conversation with the two leaders was . aimed at apprising them of the steps that are being taken. There is a . perception in the Opposition that the government has not done enough. They believe the government is keeping things outside the public domain. This is not the case. This is an issue of national security and the . government is taking steps,"" a senior PMO official said. The prime . minister is also said to have tried to impress upon the BJP to stop . politicising the issue by making provocative statements. While paying . homage to one of the martyred soldiers, Lance Naik Hemraj, Swaraj . exhorted the government to bring 10 heads from Pakistan if Hemraj's . severed head wasn't returned. ""The Congress had fully supported Prime . Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and defence minister George Fernandes . during the Kargil conflict; the BJP must reciprocate by showing the same . degree of bipartisanship in the present situation,"" a Congress leader . said. The late evening conversation between the PM and the two leaders, . however, has set tongues wagging that the government might be . considering a major step vis-Ã -vis Islamabad in the days to come. The . government's need to take decisive steps has been further necessitated . by the aggressive posturing of the Congress party over the past few . days. Party spokesperson Rashid Alvi, who has been particularly . vociferous in the entire episode, said: ""India never was, isn't and will . never be a soft state. ""India would not like to see a war anywhere in . the world but will not tolerate any humiliation to its soldiers... No . eventuality can cow us down."" The beheading of Lance Naik Hemraj of 13 . Rajputana Rifles and mutilation of Lance Naik Sudhakar's body by . Pakistan Army regulars on the LoC in the Mendhar sector was not a . one-off incident. The Indian Army has accepted that two incidents have . taken place earlier - one in May 2000 and the other in July 2011. The . incidents were hushed up even though they were talked about in the . media. While it showed that the Pakistan Army had broken the rules of . engagement of civilised forces in the past as well, India had chosen to . sweep them under the carpet, fearing the impact on the morale of the forces. In 2000, a raid led by terrorist Illyas Kashmir at Ashok Listening Post . killed seven Indian soldiers. One of them, Sepoy Bhausaheb Maruti . Talekar, was beheaded. In July 2011, the Pakistan Army beheaded two . Indian soldiers of 20 Kumaon Regiment. The incident was denied by the .

He was accused of drunkenly abusing bouncers during the disturbance and at an earlier hearing had denied the charge. Ten witnesses - seven for the prosecution and three for the defence - were due to give evidence. But today at Lavender Hill a court clerk said: 'This matter had been withdrawn. He has already admitted his guilt and received a caution.' A Metropolitan Police spokesman confirmed this, adding: 'He received a caution on Wednesday at a South London police station.'

And certainly the most magical. A mother who admits being completely obsessed with fairy tales commissioned a professional photographer to take a series of beautiful images of her baby daughter, and in all of them her little girl adopts the starring role in all her favourite stories, including Alice in Wonderland, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. The pictures of baby girl Maddie, daughter of Nicole Lepper of Monmouth, Illinois, were taken by American photographer Wendi Riggins in Iowa. Time for tea?

Maddie's mum Nicole, wanted some special pictures of her fourth child, and they were taken when Maddie was six to nine months old. Wendi, 30, said: 'Nicole, loves fairy tales, and her entire family are fans of the TV show Once Upon a Time. It was from this love that the concept of baby fairy tales came about. 'Nicole planned and shopped for the perfect outfits and pieces. We talked multiple times a week, throwing around ideas, picking out props and brainstorming on ways to make each and every set perfect.' Wendi explained that she had to figure out the best way to shoot the session and keep a nine-month-old subject happy, 'knowing that most babies don't have the tolerance or attention span for a long shoot'. She said: 'With six sets to plan, I knew we would have to work quickly, and that setting up and tearing down sets would be the most time consuming part of the shoot. 'We worked quickly, knowing we only need a few really good images of each set, once I felt confident that I had the perfect shot, we moved onto the next set. 'We only spent about 10 minutes for each set, and then let Maddie crawl and play in between to keep her happy.' Can you see my shadow?

"By . Mike Jaccarino . PUBLISHED: . 10:39 EST, 6 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:00 EST, 7 January 2013 . A Christmas party of epic proportions at the Honduran Embassy to Colombia involving prostitutes, booze, an orgy, looting - and worse - hasÂ  forced the resignation of the Central American nation's ambassador. Details of the apparently legendary holiday soiree that left the Honduran mission in the capitol city of Bogota a paper-strewn shambles are still trickling into Honduran media reports. But what a spree the party apparently was. All-night affair: The already-infamous affair reportedly got underway around 11pm and didn't conclude until 5am the next day . The Honduran newspaper El Heraldo reports that 'several' prostitutes were involved in what evidence suggests was a booze-fueled orgy at the embassy . Fired: Carlos Rodriguez Andino, the Honduran ambassador to Columbia, resigned Saturday following a riotous soiree at the embassy in Bogota . Early accounts reveal when mission employees arrived at the embassy Dec. 21, or the next day, they discovered - to their chagrin - Ambassador Carlos Rodriguez Andino's close friend and bodyguard - Jorge Mendoza - dozing without dignity in the laundry room and a Colombian man wandering the embassy's basement. 'A scandal in our foreign service is a stain on the country's name. Diplomatic missions are sacred,' Honduran lawmaker Rodolfo Zelaya reportedly said. A special commission appointed to investigate the incident is still at work, but initial findings have already led to Andino's resignation - ratified Saturday - and he wasn't even present at the shindig. A Stain on Honduras' Name: The nation's Foreign Ministry referred to the incident in such a dramatic manner in accepting Andino's forced resignation . 'In order to safeguard national interests and good relations with the Republic of Colombia, we asked for the ambassador's irrevocable resignation and Mr Rodriguez stepped down, effective immediately,'Â Agence Presse France quoted the the Honduran foreign ministry as saying. The Honduran daily newspaper, El Heraldo, reportedly quoted sources in Bogota as saying the night began innocently enough with Mendoza engaging in some holiday hijinks on the town. The randy revelers reportedlyÂ  returned to the embassy about 11pm, regrouped - and then once again alighted on to Bogota's streets. It was there that Mendoza and company apparently contracted a cadre of sex workers - El Heraldo put the number at 'several' - whom they then squired back to the mission. Then the profligate party got really riotous. Before the blowout reportedly concluded in the wee hours of the morning, or about 5 a.m., the prostitutes snatched computers and cell phones from the embassy. One even defecated on Andino's desk, as well as the commercial attache's workstation, after being asked to leave withoutÂ  the required remuneration. El Heraldo also reported there was evidence of an orgy in the building, although calls placed by The Guardian to the embassy in Bogota went un-returned as of Sunday. Colombian Police Col. Jose Elias Baquero said authorities are searching for what he describes as two 'contracted women' who attended the party. Scene of the Crime: At least two computers - as well as some phones - are missing from the Honduran Embassy in the Colombian capitol city of Bogota . Terrible: One sex worker defecated on Andino's desk, as well as that of the commercial attache, after being asked to leave without remuneration . The fallout is still raining on the small Central American country. The Guardian Newspaper of Britain reports that El Heraldo splashed its story concerning the party on its front page with an article aptly entitled, 'Diplomatic scandal: prostitutes and drunkenness in BogotÃ¡.' The 'embarrassing incident,' according to the paper, could have compromised sensitive information on organised crime and drug trafficking,' El Heraldo reportedly wrote in its pages. 'This means that any drug lord â¦ could have paid a prostitute to seduce the ambassador's friend to gain access to the embassy and steal vital information about investigations.' Colombia is the world's most prolific producer of cocaine and Honduras has become a hub for much of the drug supply headed for the U.S. Dangerous Game: El Heraldo has suggested that such security lapses could have allowed a Colombian drug lord to infiltrate the embassy's databanks . Police col. Baquero said Honduran officials have confirmed that there was a party in which the portable computers were stolen, but that they prefer to handle the matter internally. The U.S. Secret Service was embroiled in a similar scandal involving prostitutes and its agents last April in the Colombian city of Cartagena, where President Barack Obama attended the Summit of the Americas. More than two dozen Secret Service agents and military personnel, tasked with preparing security for Obama's high-profile visit, were sent home. Nine have since left the agency as it seeks to repair its tarnished reputation..","Carlos Rodriquez Andino resigned Saturday - and he wasn't at the shindig!

A mother has revealed her joy at learning that her son, who was abducted by his paternal grandparents in 1994 when he was just five years old, is alive, married and expecting his first child. For nearly 20 years, Lisa Harter knew nothing of the whereabouts of her son, Richard Landers Jr., after his grandparents vanished from their trailer in Wolcottville, Indiana with the young boy. They had been raising the child at their home and are believed to have taken off with him as they were unhappy with the court granting Mrs Harter custody for a trial period. But now detectives have tracked him down through his social security number and discovered the 24-year-old living 680 miles away in Long Prairie, Minnesota under the name Michael Jeff Landers. Scroll down for video . Relief: Lisa Harter (left) 'jumped up and down for joy' when she learned her son Richard Landers (right), who was abducted by his grandparents when he was five, was alive and well - now aged 24 . Mrs Harter, who lives in LaGrange, Indiana, told the Star Tribune she was overwhelmed with relief and joy . when she learned that her long-lost son was safe. 'It's such a relief that he's been found and that he's alive and that he's healthy,' she said. 'I found this out two days ago, and I'm so excited. I'm pretty happy. 'I . know he's married and he has a child on the way. I've seen pictures of . him. He looks like a man. I last saw him when he was a boy. He looks so . different.' While they have not yet had a reunion, she said she is desperate to see her son. 'I'm . a little nervous because I haven't seen him for a long time,' she said. 'I want to tell him I want to see [him]. I want to talk to [him.] But I . might cry.' She was 'jumping up and down for joy' when investigators revealed her son had been found, her husband Richard Harter said. He added that his wife is 'the happiest woman on earth'. Missed: The boy was taken amid a custody battle between his mother and paternal grandparents . When Landers was tracked down this . past fall, he admitted to police that he knew his real name, though he . had been living under a different alias almost his entire life. Minnesota officials say the . grandparents, now using the names Raymond Michael Iddings and Susan Kay . Iddings, verified Landers' identity. Authorities said they do not know . what they had told him about their swift departure from . Indiana 18 years ago. But . when he was five and caught in the middle of the custody battle, he . said he wanted to live with his grandparents, the Star Tribune reported. 'He . appears to be well adjusted, there was no indication or signs of any . kind of abuse over the years,' Indiana State Police Sgt Ron Galaviz told . MailOnline. 'It just appears on its face that his grandparents raised . him as their own child over these last 18 years.' Before the abduction, Landers' paternal . grandparents, then known as Richard and Ruth Landers, were raising the . young boy as his mother had had a troubled relationship with . their son. Child . welfare services stepped in after she ended up in a homeless shelter . and because she has some developmental disabilities, Harter's attorney . Richard Muntz told the Star Tribune. But in 1994, when she was living in her own home, working and remarried, she began fighting to regain custody of her son. However, the grandparents were . upset about the court proceedings. Just days before Landers' mother was due to take him for a one week visitation in July 1994, he disappeared without . a trace. 'The grandparents went to the bank, drew . $5,000 out of a home equity line and stopped for breakfast at a local . restaurant,' Muntz said. That was the last time they were seen in the town. Detectives followed his grandparents' bank account, tracked down family members as far away as . Washington State and monitored a cabin in Michigan that the grandparents . owned, but there was no sign of little Richard. The . break in the case came in September 2012, when the boy's step-father, . Richard Harter, came to Indiana State Police with the missing child's . social security card - asking if they could run the numbers again, he told the Star Tribune. Long way from home: Landers was found 680 miles from the trailer where he disappeared . The search turned up a man with the same number and date of birth living in Minnesota. Police then found that a driver's license photo for the man appeared to resemble Landers. When local Minnesota police tracked down the man, he admitted that he was Landers. His grandparents were living in another small Minnesota town eight miles north of Long Prairie. After the abduction in the 1990s, arrest warrants were issued for both grandparents, charging . them with interference with custody, a Class B Misdemeanor. In 1999, the . charges were boosted to a Class C Felony, but in 2008, with neither the . child nor the grandparents being located, the charges were dropped. And now, despite tearing Landers away . from his biological parents 18 years ago, the grandparents have not . been charged, Galaviz said. However, authorities in . Minnesota are still investigating the case, and it will eventually be . passed on to the County Attorney's office. Police said they did not . know whether Landers was planning a reunion with his biological mother, and . he has been unable to travel to their home so far. 'To get this dropped in his lap at . age 24, after all these years, God knows that it's something he'll have . work out for himself,' Galaviz said.","Richard Landers taken from Indiana home by paternal grandparents in 1994 .

Barack Obama today nominated Chuck Hagel as Pentagon chief, daring Republicans to block a decorated Vietnam veteran who 'bears the scars and the shrapnel of battles he fought in our name'. The nomination will trigger a fresh battle - that over his nomination in the United States Senate, where a number of Democrats are openly sceptical about the former Republican senator following his comments about 'the Jewish lobby' and opposition to 'an openly, aggressively gay' nominee as ambassador to Luxembourg. Obama's choice of the former two-term senator for Nebraska, revealed by congressional Democratic aides on Sunday, is likely to set up a gruelling confirmation fight in the Senate over whether Hagel supports key U.S. ally Israel after he previously called for negotiations with the Palestinian terrorist organisation Hamas.

So we need to get moving quickly on this.' He said: 'Chuck Hagel is the leader that our troops deserve. He is an American patriot. He enlisted in the Army and volunteered for Vietnam. As a young private and then a sergeant, he served with honor alongside his own brother.Â Obama highlighted Hagel's Vietnam service, telling American troops: 'Just like Sergeant Hagel was always there for his own brother, Secretary Hagel will always be there for you.'Â He added: 'Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction.' 'When Chuck was hit by shrapnel, his brother saved him. When his brother was injured by a mine, Chuck risked his life to pull him to safety. To this day, Chuck bears the scars and the shrapnel from the battles he fought in our name.' Hagel, 66, has been lambasted for comments he made questioning the effectiveness of sanctions on Iran . for its nuclear program. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told CNN the choice would make Hagel 'the most antagonistic secretary of defence toward the state of Israel in our nation's history'. 'Not only has he said you should . directly negotiate with Iran, sanctions won't work, that Israel should . directly negotiate with the Hamas organization - a terrorist group that . lobs thousands of rockets into Israel - he also was one of 12 senators . who refused to sign a letter to the European Union that Hezbollah should . be designated as a terrorist organization.'

Susan Rice, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. who was Obama's . first pick to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. Rice withdrew her name from . consideration after drawing heavy fire from Republicans for remarks she . made in the aftermath of a September 11 attack on the U.S. mission in . Benghazi, Libya. 'It is a strange signal for the White . House to send that they are willing to fight for Hagel but not Rice,' a . Senate Democratic aide said on Sunday, Politico reported. 'Democrats are not currently unified . behind Hagel, and it will take some real work by the administration to . get them there, if it's even possible. 'The administration floated Hagel's . name, then neglected to defend him effectively when his critics started . taking shots,' the aide said. 'I think there will be a lot of tough . questions for Sen. Hagel,' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, . R-Ky., added to NBC, 'but he will be treated fairly by Republicans in . the Senate. I think he'll be subjected to the same kind of oversight . hearings that any nominee for such an important position would expect.' Friends: Obama, pictured with Hagel in Amman, Jordan in 2008, called the former senator 'a patriot' Working together: Hagel, left, and Obama, right, listen as the now-disgraced General David Petraeus reviews operations in Iraq to a congressional delegation visiting Baghdad in July 2008 . McConnell added his 'views with regard to Israel, for example, and Iran and all the other positions that he's taken over the years will be very much a matter of discussion in the confirmation process.' Hagel has also offended gay rights groups on the left after he called then-President Bill Clinton's nominee for U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg James Hormel as 'openly, aggressively gay' in 1998. He later apologized for the remark which he called 'insensitive'. Last month Obama offered strong . support for Hagel as a possible replacement for Defense Secretary Leon . Panetta, who had said he wanted to leave early in the second term. 'I've served with Chuck Hagel,' Obama told NBC's 'Meet the Press' on December 30. 'I know . him. He is a patriot. He is somebody who has done extraordinary work . both in the United States Senate, somebody who served this country with . valor in Vietnam.' And Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, from North Dakota, also defended the selection of 'a tremendous patriot and statesman' who 'served incredibly in Vietnam'. 'He . hasn't had a chance to speak for himself. And so why all the . prejudging?' she said on 'This Week'. 'In America, you give everybody a . chance to speak for themselves and then we'll decide.' Ducking out: The nomination comes after the Obama administration backed down from a tough battle for Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, to step in as secretary of state . Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin added that Hagel is recipient of two Purple Hearts from wounds he sustained in Vietnam and worked on the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence committees. 'Yes, he is a serious candidate if the president chooses to name him,' Durbin said. If all Senate Democrats come together and support Hagel, it will be easier for him to win confirmation. Democrats now hold a 55-to-45 advantage over Republicans following the November election. If they did unite, the White House would need just five Republican votes to confirm Hagel. It would be rare for Republicans to reject the president's choice for defense secretary, especially one who is a Republican, just a month after voters voted him in for a second term, Politico reported.","Republican senators voice opposition to nomination of former colleague .

British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least Â£20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK under a new immigration clampdown. The planned changes mean lower-paid Britons would be forced to emigrate if they wanted to live with a loved one from overseas. And if the foreign-born spouse had children, their British partner would have to earn Â£30,000 or more, depending on how many children they had. Clampdown: British citizens who marry foreigners will have to earn at least Â£20,000 a year if they want to set up their family home in the UK. Home Secretary Theresa May is pictured talking about the new policy on The Andrew Marr Show today . They will also have to pass a strict new 'combined attachment test' to prove they share a genuine loyalty to Britain, not another country, and they will remain on probation for five years instead of the current two. The proposals, to be announced by Home Secretary Theresa May, are expected to cut immigration, currently standing at 250,000 a year, by 25,000. They are designed primarily to combat claims that some foreigners are marrying Britons to take advantage of the UK's generous welfare system. Speaking on The Andrew Marr Show today, Mrs May said: 'I think it is important that if . people are bringing people into the UK to create a family here in the UK . that we say that you should be able to support yourselves and not be . reliant on the state.' Tory MPs last night welcomed the move but Labour spokesman Chris Bryant said: 'These new measures have more to do with Theresa May's abject failure to live up to her promise to cut immigration than fairness.' He claimed the idea was 'poorly thought out', adding: 'It seems very unfair that a poor British man or woman can fall in love with someone from America or Thailand and be prevented from getting married and making a home here, while a rich person can.' Labour MP Chris Bryant called the plans 'poorly thought-out' He said a better way to deal with the . problem would be to insist that Britons who marry foreigners and settle . here provide a bond worth 'a substantial sum'. If the immigrant went on . to claim benefits, the money would be deducted from the bond. And immigration campaigners are expected to denounce the measures, claiming the new curbs would effectively give low-earning Britons who fall in love with foreigners the choice of indefinite 'exile' â orÂ  breaking up their family if they want to stay in the UK. The Home Secretary also issued a . warning to judges today  that their powers to block the deportation of foreign . criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed. Mrs May said she would be seeking the . backing of Parliament for new guidelines for the courts spelling out . how the courts should apply the European Convention on Human Rights in . such cases. In particular, she said she would be . making clear that the right to a family life enshrined in Article 8 of . the convention - used by some foreign criminals to appeal against . removal from the country - was not absolute. She complained the judges were not taking account of the wider public interest in the way the convention enabled them to. And she warned that if they ignored the will of Parliament, she would bring in new legislation to ensure that it was enforced. 'This is not an absolute right. So in . the interests of the economy or of controlling migration or of public . order - those sort of issues - the state has a right to qualify this . right to a family life,' she said. 'What I am going to do is actually . set out the rules that say this is what Parliament, this is what the . public believe is how you balance the public interest against the . individual's interest. 'We are going to ask Parliament to vote on this to say very clearly what constitutes the right to a family life. 'I would expect that judges will look . at what Parliament will say and that they will take into account what . Parliament has said. If they don't then we will have to look at other . measures and that could include primary legislation.' Firm: The Home Secretary also issued a warning to judges today that their powers to block the deportation of foreign criminals on human rights grounds must be curbed . Mrs May said that the Home Office was . also looking at contingency arrangements in case the the eurozone . crisis triggered a flood of immigrants into Britain. 'So far we are not seeing any trends . in any increased movements, despite obviously significant problems . already economically in a number of eurozone countries,' she said. 'But I think that it is right that, as . a Government, across the board we look at the contingency arrangements . that might be needed.' Behind bars: In April, Rev Brian Shipsides, pictured, was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed Â£30,000 in proceeds . A senior Government source said last night: 'The welfare system has abused for years under Labour by people who marry Britons and within a short period are living off benefits. 'There is little we can do to stop them claiming benefits but we can implement better controls on people who come here to marry in the first place. We are confident these moves will command widespread support from the public. 'Labour's lamentable record on immigration is one of the main reasons they lost the election. We are going to put the system right.' Ms May said earlier this year that it was obvious that British citizens and those settled here should be able to marry or enter into a civil partnership with whomever they choose. But she added: 'If they want to establish their family life in the UK, rather than overseas, then their spouse or partner must have a genuine attachment to the UK, be able to speak English, and integrate into our society, and they must not be a burden on the taxpayer. 'Families should be able to manage their own lives. If a British citizen or a person settled here cannot support their foreign spouse or partner they cannot expect the taxpayer to do it for them.' The Joint Council for the Welfare of . Immigrants says an extension of the probationary period for foreign . spouses could trap more women in violent marriages because of the fear . of being deported if they complain. Mr . Bryant added: 'At a time when our national finances are hard-stretched . it is only fair that anyone wanting to bring someone new to this country . should be able to prove that they will not be a burden on the State. 'But I worry that the Government will not achieve what it hopes with this . measure, and that they have rejected options that could provide better . protection for the taxpayer and be fairer too. 'In today's climate, someone on Â£20,000 today could all too easily be earning nothing tomorrow. 'So simply relying on income as a measure may lead to the taxpayer still being exposed.' In April, a vicar was jailed for helping to carry out nearly 250 sham marriages in which he pocketed Â£30,000 in proceeds. Jailed: The Rev Brian Shipsides, 56, was jailed for four and a half years for arranging bogus ceremonies for African nationals to marry European citizens so they could stay in Britain.

Nothing captures the zeitgeist of the 1960s more suitably than the Italian-made Lambretta scooter. This 1969 calendar from the classic manufacturer captures the bikes that came to be seen as fashion accessories over modes of transport. Furthering the sixties vibe, models pose over the bikes, dressed in bikinis and floral prints, exhibiting the feminine confidence borne from the period's sexual revolution. Zeitgeist: A calendar for manufacturer Lambretta, who began producing the scooters in 1947 . Far from innocent: The calendar included references to Ferdenando Innocenti, Lambretta's founder . Lambretta, and its main Italian rival Vespa, produced bikes that were both easy to use and accessible, and were pounced upon by younger generations as their primary form of transport. Scooters were most synonymous with the mod subculture that boomed in London between the 1950s and 60s. An Italian scooter was often the must-have accessory, along with a sharp, tailored suit and a love of ska and soul, for any would-be mod. But more important than the scooter's functionality, was its standing as a fashion symbol. Youths soon began to customise the bikes, painting on personal logos and designs, and adding on features such as racks, mirrors and lights. Stylish: The bikes became hugely popular in the 1950s and 1960s, as they were pounced upon by youths as a cheap and stylish method of transport . Mod: The bikes also became synonymous with the UK's mod movement . Quadrophenia, the classic album by mod high kings The Who, featured a Vespa scooter on its front cover. The album was later turned into to a film in 1979, loosely based on the album, starring Phil Daniels as lead character Jimmy. Again, the symbolic scooter took pride of place in the film's plot, with Jimmy riding a Lambretta Li 150 Series 3. Takeover: In 1972, state-run Indian company Scooters India Ltd. bought the entire company and moved operations to the country . Despite riding a wave of popularity in the 1960s, Lambretta's fortunes were to prove short-lived. In 1972, state-run Indian company Scooters India Ltd. bought the entire company and moved operations to the country. Production there continued, peaking at in 1980-1981, when 35,000 scooters were built. But despite their decreasing presence in everyday western life, the Lambretta scooter is still cherished by sixties obsessives, with collectors and scooter clubs around the world.

When it comes to the male of the species, an inch makes all the difference. Two New Jersey men are suing Subway, claiming the world's biggest fast-food chain has been shorting them by selling so-called footlong sandwiches that are closer to 11 inches rather than 12. The pair - John Farley, of Evesham and Charles Noah Pendrack, of Ocean City - want compensatory damages and a change in Subway's practices. Scroll down for video . Just short: Two men are suing because their Subway sandwich came up short, like the other pictured . The suit, filed Tuesday in Superior Court in Mount Holly, may be the first aimed at the sandwich shops after an embarrassment went viral last week when someone posted a photo of a footlong and a ruler on the company's Facebook page to show that the sandwich was not as long as advertised. At the time, the company issued a statement saying that the sandwich lengths can vary a bit when franchises do not bake to the exact corporate standards. But Stephen DeNittis, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, says that's no excuse and the missing bite is worth about 45 cents per sandwich. He is seeking class-action status and is also preparing to file a similar suit in Pennsylvania state court in Philadelphia. He said he's had sandwiches from 17 shops measured - and every one came up short. 'The case is about holding companies to deliver what they've promised,' he said. Even though the alleged short of a half-inch or so of bread is relatively small, it adds up, he said. Subway has 38,000 stores around the world, nearly all owned by franchisees and its $5 footlong specials have been a mainstay of the company's ads for five years. Subway's previous adverts, like this popular 'Hula' dance, have suggested that a footlong sandwich will measure one foot in length . How long? This Subway promotion in 2008 showed a range of characters measuring out one foot with their hands . DeNittis said both Farley and Pendrack came to him after reading last week about the short sandwiches. The Milford, Conn.-based firm should either make sure its sandwiches measure a full foot or stop advertising them as such, he said. He points to how McDonald's quarter-pounders are advertised as being that weight before they are cooked. Subway said it couldn't comment on pending or ongoing legal action but the company responded to international criticism that their footlong sandwiches only appear to be 11 inches long on Saturday. But their reply didn't win them any new fans, as they claimed that the word footlong is a 'registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub' and 'not intended to be a measurement of length.' A man in Australia started uproar on January 15 when he posted a photo on the company's Facebook page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches. Countless lookalike pictures appeared all over the internet and more than 100,000 people 'liked' or commented on the original, which had the caption 'Subway pls respond.' Economic Sense: During the recession Subway began advertising $5 footlongs . The world's largest fast food chain . did so on Friday with a comment on the original query, posted by Matt . Corby from Perth, Australia. The . statement began: 'Looking at the photo doing the rounds showing a . slightly undersized sub, this bread is not baked to our standards.' Then . Subway went on the offensive, claiming that a footlong sub wasn't . necessarily meant to be exactly a foot long in the first place. 'With . regards to the size of the bread and calling it a footlong, ""SUBWAY . FOOTLONG"" is a registered trademark as a descriptive name for the sub . sold in SubwayÂ® Restaurants and not intended to be a measurement of . length.' 'The length . of the bread baked in the restaurant cannot be assured each and every . time as the proofing process may vary slightly each time in the . restaurant.' Subway have since removed the statement but, as Buzzfeed pointed out, this was at odds with previous Subway advertising. Furor: A man in Australia started uproar on January 15 when he posted a photo on the company's Facebook page of one of its footlong subs next to a tape measure showing the sandwich as just 11 inches . Likes: More than 100,000 people 'liked' or commented on the original, which had the caption 'Subway pls respond' The . company has suggested in past promotional material that the footlong . sub will measure a foot in length, such as a popular 2008 'Hula' advert . (see below). The Subway . photo â and the backlash â illustrates a challenge companies face with . the growth of social media sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Before, . someone in a far flung local in Australia would not be able to cause . such a stir. But the power of social media means that negative posts . about a company can spread from around the world in seconds. 'People . look for the gap between what companies say and what they give, and . when they find the gap â be it a mile or an inch â they can now raise a . flag and say, 'Hey look at this,' I caught you,' said Allen Adamson, . managing director of branding firm Landor Associates in New York. Subway has always offered footlong sandwiches since it opened in 1965. A customer can order any sandwich as a footlong. The . chain introduced a $5 footlong promotion in 2008 as the U.S. fell into . the recession, and has continued offering the popular option throughout . the recovery. Viral: Countless lookalike pictures appeared all over the internet within hours . Response: Subway finally responded on Saturday to the debacle . An attempt to contact someone with . the same name and country as the person who posted the photo of the . footlong sandwich on Subway's Facebook page was not returned on . Thursday. But comments by other Facebook users about the photo ran the gamut from outrage to indifference to amusement. One . commenter urged people to 'chill out.' Another one said she was . switching to Quiznos. And one man posted a photo of his foot in a sock . next to a Subway sandwich to show it was shorter than a 'foot.' 'I've never seen so many people in an uproar over an inch. Wow,' read one Facebook post. 'Let's all head to McDonald's and weigh a Quarter Pounder,' suggested another poster. The Subway footlong photo is just the latest in a string of public relations headaches that were caused by a negative photo or event about a company going viral. Last year, a Burger King employee tweeted a picture of someone standing in sneakers on two tubs of uncovered lettuce. Domino's Pizza employees posted a video on YouTube of workers defacing a pizza in 2009. And a KitchenAid employee last year made a disparaging remark about President Obama using the official KitchenAid Twitter account.","John Farley and Charles Noah Pendrack of New Jersey are suing for compensatory damages in the Superior Court in Mount Holly .

"By . Christopher Wilson . PUBLISHED: . 20:10 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:25 EST, 23 January 2013 . A drunken brawl with his equerry. A married mistress, secret hotel assignations, an illegitimate child â surely our brand-new hero Prince Harry isnât up to his old tricks again already? Thankfully not. But details emerged this week of another Prince Harry â the Queenâs uncle, not her grandson â which shed light on the pressures of life as a royal soldier and which demonstrate that, in the House of Windsor, change does not come quickly. Extraordinarily, itâs the sale of a small pair of gilt cufflinks which have brought to light just how our Prince Harry has, by comparison with his namesake, comported himself with rather more decorum than we might previously have given him credit for. Flying prince: The Duke of Gloucester Prince Henry got into a fight with his loyal equerry after being told to choose a wife against his wishes . After all, we havenât heard of him sharing the bed of a married woman with his elder brother. Or creating a love-nest outside the back door of Buckingham Palace. Or splashing out the equivalent of Â£1âmillion to pay for a love-child. Prince Harry, Duke of Gloucester, third son of George V, did all of that and more, and got away with it. Yet it has taken an auction in a Salisbury saleroom for the comparisons to come out. Lot number 1384 in Woolley and Wallisâs sale today is a handsome pair of monogrammedÂ  cufflinks â the sort of desirable trinket royalty used to hand out to friends and devoted courtiers. The cufflinks owe their presence in the saleroom thanks to their connection to a hitherto undisclosed punch-up between the prince and his equerry at Hillsborough Castle in County Down in the summer of 1934. In front of their appalled host, the Duke of Abercorn, the two men, dressed in white tie and tails, waded into each other and had to be pulled apart by a beefy aide-de-camp. Drink, inevitably, had been taken. The mists of time, alas, conceal the exact words exchanged between the two old friends. But the demands of trying to be both a royal prince and a soldier â the very thing young Prince Harry was trying to explain about his own life this week â had a lot to do with it. Like his young relation, old Harry was . an ambitious officer in a cavalry regiment, trying to make his way in a . profession which respected royalty but also put it to the test. Then, . as now, the conflict of royal duty versus commitment to his . brothers-in-arms made for hard choices. At . 34, old Harryâs greatest wish was to command his regiment. But public . duties kept getting in the way, and in the summer of 1934 he was in . Northern Ireland undertaking a diary of engagements which would make . modern-day royals blanch. Namesake: Prince Harry, pictured at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, shares his love of the Army with his great uncle the Duke of Gloucester . There had been five days of pressing the flesh, listening to boring speeches, rebuffing the attentions of Ulster matrons. In addition, Harry had learned that a three-month tour of Australasia handed to brother George was being passed over to him â because George was âexhaustedâ from a tour of South Africa. It meant his chances of promotion within the 10th Hussars were pushed back by at least a year. At Hillsborough Castle the anger and frustration finally boiled over: the prince and his devoted equerry, a Cambridge-educated Canadian called Howard Kerr, came to blows and had to be pulled apart. The root of it all was Harryâs infatuation with a married woman, Mrs Beryl Markham. Some years earlier heâd travelled to Kenya with his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales â later Edward VIII â on a safari which morphed into a babes ânâ booze-fest that would put the present-day Harryâs Vegas larks in the shade. The royal brothers shared the bed (thankfully on different evenings) of Mrs Markham, daughter of a Happy Valley racehorse trainer and unusually a woman whoâd made a name for herself as a pilot. Striking rather than beautiful, she had a voracious appetite for men. But while the Prince of Wales had the sense to move on, Harry could not: he made her his long-time mistress. Though her life was centred on Kenya, he paid for a permanent suite at the Grosvenor Hotel, a five-minute walk from the back gates of Buckingham Palace, so that he could simply move in with her. Some time later, it emerged that she was pregnant. âPeople naturally assumed, with the Duke always in and out of her suite, even going to the nursing home the day the child was born, that it was his,â wrote her friend Ginger Birkbeck. Beryl, of course, had a husband â and his family were incandescent that sheâd blackened the family name by giving birth to a royal bastard. Queen Mary, pictured at the Royal Military College, Sanhurst, with a young Prince Henry, had to shell out the equivalent of Â£1million on a child rumoured to have been fathered by the Duke of Gloucester . There was an angry showdown at the Palace between Berylâs husband and Harryâs mother Queen Mary after the head of Berylâs family â baronet Sir Charles Markham â threatened to reveal the contents of letters sent by the prince. âOld Queen Mary opened her purse-strings,â observed a family friend, and a sum equivalent to Â£1âmillion today was settled on Beryl for the upbringing of her son. She was paid the interest until her death in 1986, never once revealing that the child had not been fathered by Harry, a fact the scheming Mrs Markham knew all along. But Harry was reckless, and rather proud of himself for having â so he thought â fathered a son. Queen Mary, however, was outraged. She soon sent her son a short-list of European princesses and ordered him to take his pick. On top of that, Harry had just been informed his brother Georgie was âtoo tiredâ to go to Australia. âThis hit him twice over,â wrote an old friend. âHarry was being asked to be a substitute for his effete brother when all he wanted to do was get back to soldiering. He had high hopes of commanding the regiment, and didnât want to jeopardise that by spending months away from home. And Beryl was due back in England and he was aching to see her.â Thus, with Harry in militant mood, Howard Kerr probably went too far that day at Hillsborough Castle in 1934 when he suggested life would be so much easier if the prince just got himself a wife â and that there was an ideal girl to hand. She was the daughter of aÂ  Scottish grandee, the Duke of Buccleuch. Maybe Lady Alice Montagu-Douglas-Scott was, at 34, a little long in the tooth but the Buccleuchs were the biggest landowners in Europe and, in Border country, held more sway than the Royal Family. Harry didnât like the idea. Heâd met the girl. Heâd met her sisters, too, all four of them, and there wasnât anything to choose between them. He was in no hurry to cast off his bachelor status â he saw himself as a bit of a ladiesâ man. Wasnât the mother of his son, Beryl . Markham, about to fly back to London from Kenya and take up residence in . their old suite at the Grosvenor Hotel? Maybe this was the moment when . Kerr told old Harry to wake up and smell the coffee. And as a . consequence his master took a swing at him. Despite his infatuation with Mrs Beryl Markham, who also shared the bed of his elder brother Edward VIII, Prince Henry married Princess Alice in 1935, pictured . And the confrontation seems to have spurred Harry to face up to his responsibilities. On his return from the hated Australian tour months later in 1935, Harry went to stay with his friend Teddy Brook atÂ  Kinmount Castle in the Borders. There, by design, was Lady Alice. âThat was when we became engaged,â she recalled, rather glumly. âThere was no formal declaration on his part. I think he just muttered it as an aside during one of our walks. He certainly didnât shower me with flowers because that was not his way.â Not like heâd showered Beryl Markham with champagne andÂ  jewels, thatâs for sure. Harry had been cornered â by circumstance, by his overbearing parents, by the whole ruddy royal apparatus. The marriage was a success â it lasted 38 years until his death in 1974 â but it might be concluded that Harry cared less about life after that. Could it be that in his dotage, he still looked back on that bout of fisticuffs as a turning-point? Certainly, he regarded the clash with Howard Kerr as regrettable, for the aide-de-camp who pulled them apart was sent the cufflinks as a mark of gratitude. Then, as an afterthought, he was also made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order, a considerable honour. Harry got a gong as well. He was made a Knight of St Patrick, the Irish equivalent of the Garter, for those few hectic days in Ulster. It sat prettily on his heavily-bemedalled chest, for the Duke in his dotage took consolation in a glass of wine and wearing impressive uniforms. Let us hope that on his return from Afghanistan, Harry Wales might look at his great-great-uncleâs adventures, and draw valuable lessons about the responsibilities that come with being a Prince of the realm.","Details have emerged this week of a punch-up between royal soldier Prince Henry, the Queen's uncle, and his loyal equerry over a married woman .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:20 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:01 EST, 24 January 2013 . Thomas Ashcroft, 35, was accused by a judge of 'sheer premeditated wickedness' for putting innocent lives at risks by targeting NHS hospitals . A homeless drug addict who pleaded guilty to starting fires at hospitals and a hotel so he could steal to buy drugs has been jailed for eight years. Thomas Ashcroft, 35, was accused by a judge of 'sheer premeditated wickedness' for putting innocent lives at risks by targeting NHS hospitals. He set the fires to cause a distraction before rifling through tills to help fund his Â£250-a-day crack cocaine and heroin addition. He admitted arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered and burglary at the Kent and Canterbury Hospital and the Hilton Hotel in Sheffield on August 30 and July 15. Ashcroft - who has appeared in court 65 times for 150 offences - also pleaded guilty to committing the same crimes at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent on August 29. He asked for eight further matters to be taken into consideration relating to arsons and burglaries at other hospitals, hotels and a visitor attraction across Britain. Jailing Ashcroft at Canterbury Crown Court today, Judge James OâMahony said he will serve eight years behind bars and be subject to an extended licence for four years. The . judge said that 'mercifully' no-one was killed in the incidents but he added that . 'things could easily have gone wrong' and there was 'real danger' to . people in the premises he targeted, including cancer patients. Prosecutor Martin Yale said Ashcroftâs reign began when he was released from prison last summer after being sentenced to 12 months for burglary. On July 14, just weeks after his release, he burgled Rotherham District General Hospital in South Yorkshire. The following day, he set fire to a quilt in a housekeeping storage room at the Hilton Hotel in Sheffield, triggering the automatic sprinkler system, which flooded the area. As water cascaded through the ceiling and guests were evacuated, Ashcroft stole Â£132 from a till behind the bar. It cost more than Â£1,200 to restore the sprinkler system and guests who had their stay interrupted had to be compensated, resulting in a total loss to the hotel of more than Â£3,000. Days later, on July 20, Ashcroftâs probation officer issued a recall notice after he failed to abide by the conditions of his release. But the following day, he targeted the Midland Hotel in Manchester, torching a cleanerâs trolley, which resulted in another evacuation. With the coast clear, he dipped his hand in a till in the beauty parlour before escaping through fire doors - but was captured on CCTV, which later helped identify him. Ashcroftâs campaign was interrupted when he was arrested for shoplifting in Blackburn, Lancashire, on July 26 and returned to custody before being released just under four weeks later. He then travelled south to the Sussex coast, and on August 26 set fire to a quilt at the Royal Albion Hotel in Brighton, prompting its evacuation. He went on to steal Â£75 from a till, Mr Yale said. The following day, Ashcroft visited the Sealife Centre visitor attraction in Brighton where another fire was set and he stole Â£50 from a till. Later the same day, he set fire to clothes at Brightonâs Dome and, following the evacuation, stole Â£82 from the cafe. Ashcroft (pictured left and right on hospital CCTV) set the fires to cause a distraction before rifling through tills to help fund his Â£250-a-day crack cocaine and heroin addition . Also that day, Mr Yale said Ashcroft travelled to the Hilton Hotel at Gatwick Airport where a quilt was set alight but nothing was stolen. However, hundreds of pounds of damage was caused. The following day, August 28, Ashcroft torched cotton balls in a cupboard at Crawley Hospital in West Sussex, forcing its evacuation, and took more than Â£200 from the cafe till. A day later, another hospital was targeted - the Medway Maritime in Gillingham, Kent, which has more than 600 beds and at the time had more than 1,500 staff on duty. Mr Yale said a housekeeping store cupboard was set alight. Some patients and staff were evacuated, and the cost of the damage was said to have run to up to Â£15,000. Then on August 30, Ashcroft targeted a third hospital - the Kent and Canterbury, when a fire was suspected to have been set among clothes in the chaplainâs office. Five out of six wards were occupied by dozens of patients and staff at the time. Later, staff noticed that around Â£25 had been stolen from the restaurant. However, the cost to the fire brigade was more than Â£2,000. With the situation 'spiralling out of control', Ashcroft surrendered himself by telephoning police in Ramsgate the following day, saying he believed he had been recalled to prison. One of the arresting officers recognised him from a picture circulated by a senior officer relating to the arsons and burglaries, and he was arrested. While under caution, he asked: 'What about the others?' Mr Yale said: 'Ashcroft said that he committed the crimes to fund his drug addiction which cost about Â£250 a day. Among the places targeted by Ashcroft was the Hilton Hotel at Gatwick Airport where a quilt was set alight but nothing was stolen. However, hundreds of pounds of damage was caused . Ashcroft set alight a housekeeping store cupboard at the Medway Maritime in Gillingham, Kent. The cost of the damage was said to have run to up to Â£15,000 . He said that he travelled around by train and set the fires close to smoke detectors so that they would be detected quickly. 'Ashcroft said he had no home and had either been sleeping rough or stayed with friends. Mr Yale told the court: 'In relation to the offences at the hospitals, Ashcroft said he just wanted the money and didnât think about the consequences.' Defence counsel Peter Forbes told the court that Ashcroft did not suffer from any mental illness but had a 'fundamental personality disorder'. 'What seems to be behind this, and is his only real explanation, is this defendantâs entrenched drug addiction,' said Mr Forbes. Judge OâMahony said it was hard to 'understand the evil' of putting lives at risk for relatively small sums of cash, amounting to just under Â£25 in one incident. In mitigation, Mr Forbes said Ashcroft targeted premises where there were smoke detectors and sprinklers present, and that he did not use petrol to accelerate the flames. Mr Forbes went on: 'This man plainly has been wracked by drug addiction for many years. He has taken heroin and crack cocaine since 18 or 19, and they have plainly been a dominant force in his life.' His descent into drugs and crime followed the death of both his parents when he was young, leading him to be raised in care. Mr Forbes added: 'To his credit, he handed himself in and he realised that the situation was spiralling out of control.' Judge OâMahony told Ashcroft: 'You are a man seriously addicted to heroin and crack cocaine. You have a huge number of previous convictions over the years, many of them for burglary. 'The real gravity of what you did was this: in order to steal some trifling amounts of money because you wanted drugs, you set fire to three hospitals, having taken great care to get into the premises and identify them, work out where to set fire, cause evacuations, and thus enabling yourself to steal. 'You gave no thought or understanding to other people in there. Itâs argued... that the fires were started in places where there were sprinklers and fire alarms.' He went on: 'It must have frightened vulnerable and sick people, not to mention, of course, the staff. It also caused huge losses of money to honest taxpayers to what is a national institution - the NHS.' Judge OâMahony said Ashcroftâs actions were 'selfish, dangerous and wicked' and that an 'eyebrow-raising aspect' of one case was that he stole just under Â£25 yet caused tens of thousands of pounds of damage. Ashcroft torched cotton balls in a cupboard at Crawley Hospital in West Sussex, forcing its evacuation, and took more than Â£200 from the cafe till . He said: 'In cold-blooded calculation you started fires with devastating results, not from any obsession with fire or pyromania but because you wanted drugs.' Ashcroft was deemed to be a 'dangerous' man at high risk of re-offending based on reckless, premeditated behaviour, the judge told the court. Detective Inspector Lee Whitehead, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said after the sentencing: 'Ashcroft put the lives of hundreds of people in danger to steal money to finance his drug habit. 'His actions were not only criminal, but entirely selfish and it has cost thousands of pounds to rectify the damage he has caused. 'To force cancer patients to abandon their treatment is nothing short of sickening and Ashcroft should be ashamed for causing stress and anxiety to those who are fighting serious illness. 'It is pure testament to the staff at the various establishments targeted and the prompt reactions of the fire service that nobody was hurt, seriously injured or killed.' Kent Fire and Rescue Serviceâs director of service delivery, Steve Griffiths, said: 'Any deliberate act of fire-setting is dangerous and KFRS hopes the jail sentence given today will deter others from this potentially deadly act. 'While these were small fires, there is no doubt that the quick response and actions of our crew prevented them from turning into a major incident.âOur investigators worked closely with Kent Police and the link was soon established, leading us to implement extra precautions at these sites. 'Hospitals are, by their very nature, inherently safe buildings with robust fire precautions built in. We have an excellent, long-standing relationship with healthcare partners and we thank their staff and the public for being so vigilant during that period.'","Thomas Ashcroft, 35, was accused by a judge of 'sheer premeditated wickedness' for putting innocent lives at risks .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:10 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:13 EST, 23 January 2013 . A paroled killer who chained mentally disabled adults in squalid basement dungeons forcing some into prostitution all for their disability checks has been charged with federal hate crimes and murder according to prosecutors. Linda Weston, 52, accused of locking six disabled adults and four children like 'zoo animals' in Philadelphia over a 10-year-period was additionally indicted on Wednesday with federal charges including kidnapping and forced human labor. Weston, the accused ringleader of the . violent scheme, is the first person to be charged under a 2009 federal . hate crimes statute that increases punishments for criminals who target . the mentally disabled, authorities said. Prosecutors say they may now seek the . death penalty after the deaths of two of her alleged victims through . prolonged abuse and neglect. New charges: Convicted 1981 killer Linda Ann Weston, seen most recently left, has now been charged with committing hate crimes, murder in aid of racketeering, kidnapping and forced human labor . Dungeon: It was in this former boiler room in October of 2011 that police discovered four mentally disabled adults chained to the walls and one to the center heater . Abuse: The rescued victims described their shocking abuse living a life in squalor while a few were additionally forced into prostitution . 'Shocking does not begin to describe the . criminal allegations in this case, where victims were tied up and . confined like zoo animals and treated like property akin to slaves,' U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger said. The case came to light in October 2011 after a landlord discovered four malnourished victims locked in the 13-by-7 foot pitch-black room in the basement of a Philadelphia apartment building. One of them was chained to a boiler. Authorities soon began untangling a complicated web of relationships among victims and their alleged captors in an investigation that spanned several states. Weston has been jailed since then and pleaded not guilty to related state charges. Her lawyer, George Yacoubian, said on . Wednesday that federal prosecutors had 'over-reached for effect' with . the new charges and that Weston maintains her innocence. The . 150-page grand jury indictment describes Weston as the ringleader of a . 'family' that included her daughter and three men who prosecutors say . helped control and subjugate the victims. Survivors: Three of the four victims spoke out after the horrifying ordeal last October . Secret horrors: Authorities show the stairs leading down into the Philadelphia basement where Weston allegedly kept her prisoners . Tragic find: An officer rests at the bottom of the basement's stairs where the building's landlord discovered the victims hiding scared under sheets . Living conditions: A man stands on what appears to have been a bed in the tiny room, showing its cramped size . Weston used 'cunning, trickery, force and coercion' to get mentally disabled people to designate her as their caretaker, allowing her to illegally collect about $212,000 in Social Security payments over 10 years, Memeger said. In all, authorities allege six disabled adults and four children were held captive in 'subhuman' conditions in basements, attics and closets at various times between 2001 and 2011. The victims were often drugged, deprived of food and medical care, and forced to use buckets for bathrooms, officials said. The victims' diminished mental capacity, coupled with the fact that Weston continually moved the family to elude law enforcement, meant that 'escape for these individuals seemed impossible,' Memeger said. Weston forced two female victims into . prostitution, including her niece, to earn more money for the family . when they lived in Texas and Florida, authorities said. Two . other women died while living with Weston, leading to murder charges . that make her eligible for the death penalty. Memeger said prosecutors . are weighing whether to pursue it. Maxine . Lee, a disabled Philadelphia woman, died of meningitis and starvation . while living with Weston in Virginia in 2008, authorities said. Others: Thomas Gregory, 47, (left) and Eddie Wright, 49, (right) are . also accused of stealing the victims' Social Security checks . Family: Beatrice Weston's cousin Jean McIntosh allegedly taunted her through the cupboard door she was locked in . Another woman identified in court papers as D.S. died in Philadelphia in 2005 after prosecutors said Weston fed her drug-laced food while keeping her captive in a laundry room. Weston staged the death to look like an overdose, authorities said. Weston already has served time for the starvation death of a man she locked in her Philadelphia apartment nearly three decades ago. Others charged in the indictment unsealed Wednesday are Weston's daughter, Jean McIntosh, 33, of Philadelphia; Gregory Thomas Sr., 49, of Philadelphia; Eddie Wright, 52, of Killeen, Texas; and Nicklaus Woodard, 26, of West Palm Beach, Fla. McIntosh, Thomas and Wright had already been named as co-defendants in the state case against Weston. Jury selection for that trial was scheduled to start Monday, but the Philadelphia district attorney's office said it will withdraw all charges in light of the federal indictment. Woodard is a new defendant in the case who Memeger said was arrested in Florida on Wednesday morning. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer. In August Weston's 20-year-old niece who was beaten and held captive in a cupboard for a decade allegedly by Weston filed suit against the city of Philadelphia for failing to prevent the horrifying ordeal. Beatrice Weston claims the city failed to properly train its care workers, resulting in her being placed in her aunt's custody. Weston was allegedly beaten with a baseball bat, forced to consume her own urine, held in a tiny closet and prostituted in the 10 years she was in the custody of Weston. Beatrice Weston's complaint says the city of Philadelphia failed to release information about the aunt's criminal history in 2002, after her mother said she could not care for her. Captive: Beatrice Weston is seen in a Philadelphia hospital after rescued from the Philadelphia house where she was allegedly locked inside of a cupboard by her aunt, Linda Ann Weston . Workers failed to carry out home investigations or arrange for health evaluations of Beatrice, according to the lawsuit, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. It also names two other defendants, Nefertiti Savoy, a former social worker with the Department of Human Services, and Richard Ames, an attorney who recommended Weston be given to her aunt. 'Beatrice Weston was forcibly prostituted by Linda Ann Weston and was regularly beaten, starved, and denied medical and dental care, as well as schooling,' the lawsuit states. 'During these 10 years, the City of Philadelphia received numerous complaints that Linda Ann Weston was holding children captive in her basement.' The suit seeks damages for her anguish, payment for her medical and therapy expenses, and compensation for loss of past and future earnings, the Inquirer reported. 'Jurors are going to have to fix a value on every day, every month, every year that she was imprisoned,' her attorney Shanin Specter said. 'There's no amount of money that's fair.' She added that her cousin taunted her, saying through the door: 'Don't you wish that you was out of that closet taking a hot shower like me?' When she was found, police noted she had pellet gun wounds and burn marks, suggesting she was scolded with a hot spoon. 'She is in very, very poor condition,' Philadelphia Police Lieutenant Ray Evers said at the time. 'She has lost a lot of weight. She has newer injuries, definitely some older injuries, a lot of scarring.'","Linda Weston, 52, is federally charged with hate crimes, murder in aid of racketeering, kidnapping and forced human labor .

The teenager apparently fell from a bridge over the M9 near Stirling and police have found no evidence of foul play. Mystery: It is thought Anna Johnson, 15, who was a student at Morrison's Academy in Perthshire, may have fallen from a bridge over the M9 motorway . Yesterday Morrisonâs Academy, the .

Mystery: Russell Matthews reappeared after vanishing and being declared a missing person more than three months ago . Tragic details have emerged over the Coast Guard who suddenly reappeared after going missing for more than three months. Petty Officer Russell Matthews, who worked as a rescue swimmer for the U.S. military branch, mysteriously disappeared last October; following an intensive three-day search, officials presumed the twice-married father of two was dead. The 36-year-old officer went missing around the one-year anniversary of his wifeâs suicide; in 2009, she had sustained significant brain damage from a biking accident. His second wife reported him missing on October 9, 2012. Officers said that Matthews, a 15-year veteran of the Coast Guard, was distraught at the time of his disappearance, leaving his car parked at Kaena Point in Oahu. The only other traces of the officer rescue workers found were a pair of slippers, and his hat floating in the water. It is still unclear where the 36-year-old officer has been during the past three months. Matthews was incoherent when he showed up Sunday night at the home of his second wife; the couple live on the North Shore. Scroll down for video . Without a trace: Matthews' car was left at the remote Kaena Point in Oahu three months ago . Happy family: Matthews pictured with his first wife, Clara, and their two young children . Tragedy: Clara and her children were involved in a head-on bicycling accident in 2009 and the mother suffered a traumatic brain injury; two years later, she committed suicide . Matthews, who had been transferred to . the Tripler Army Medical Center, is now in military custody at Pearl . Harbor, according to Coast Guard Spokesman Lt. Gene Maestas. He said that the military branch is . currently in the process of discharging Matthews for illegally using . marijuana ahead of his disappearance. The Coast Guard was under . investigation for it before he vanished in October. Lt. Maestas added that Matthews is in . custody because of his unauthorized absence. In addition, the mysterious . circumstances around his disappearance make him a flight risk. Matthews had been married once before and tragically lost his first wife, Clara, in 2011. The mother of his two children . committed suicide in 2011 by shooting herself in the head; Matthews went . missing around the one-year anniversary of her death, according to KITV. Loss: Clara Matthews suffered a traumatic brain injury following the accident and took her life two years later . Authorities . suspect that Matthewsâ first wife pointed the gun at her head in part . because of the traumatic brain injury she suffered two years prior in a . bicycle accident. According to reports at the time, Clara was hit by a car as she was riding her bicycle along the North Shore in Pupukea in March of 2009. Her two children, aged three and five, were riding along in a two-wheel trailer. Clara and her children were seriously injured when a woman veered her sedan into the bike lane and hit the family head-on. Treatment: The petty officer is now being evaluated at Tripler Army Medical Center . The mother was thrown from her bicycle and hit her head on the carâs windshield, while her children were pushed by the car around 80 feet. According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, Matthews was being investigated for marijuana use at the time of his disappearance. Coast . Guard investigators dispatched to see him confirmed his identity after . he called his command from Castle Medical Center in the Honolulu suburb . of Kailua, Maestas said. Matthews' children have been staying with Clara's family members on the mainland in his absence, KITV reports. Under investigation: Matthews, pictured before his disappearance, was under investigation for alleged marijuana use . Police . found the 36-year-old guardsman's car abandoned at Kaena Point, a . remote area of Oahu, when Matthews was reported missing in October. Crews from the Coast Guard, Navy, . state, county lifeguards and Honolulu fire and police departments . together searched more than 10,000 nautical square miles - on land and . at sea - for Matthews. The search was called off on December 13, and Matthews was presumed dead. Honolulu . Police Sgt. Kim Buffett of Crimestoppers said Matthews did not give the . police a statement because he had been in the hospital. Detectives have no . reason to pursue the case as it's not against the law to be missing, she . said. The police case is closed now that Matthews has been found, she added. It's unusual for a Guardsman to go missing for months and then reappear, Lt Maestas said. 'This is not the norm for the Coast Guard. In my 28 year career in the Coast Guard, I have never come across a case like this,' he said. Matthews has been stationed in Hawaii since 2007.

But Niemeyer . shrugged off the criticism. 'If you go to Brasilia you might not like . it, say there's something better, but there's nothing just like it,' he . said in an interview with O Globo newspaper in 2006 at the age of 98.

Living . well past the century mark, Niemeyer's journey mirrored that of his . beloved Brazil, and his restless modernism captured the developing . country's sweeping ambitions. With . hundreds of his buildings dotting the landscape, arguably no other . architect shared as tight a bond with a country as Niemeyer did with . Brazil. Oscar Niemeyer . Soares Filho was born on December 15 1907, in Rio de Janeiro, and earned . his architecture degree at Rio's School of Fine Arts. Working . in Costa's office in 1936, he helped design a Rio education ministry . building that was a classic of functionalist horizontal and vertical . lines. With modernist . giant Le Corbusier, Niemeyer developed the 'brise soleil', a heat . protector that enhanced the building's grid design and became an . architectural standard in the 1960s.

Distinctive: The Palacio Tiradentes, one of the buildings of the Tancredo Neves Administrative City, which Niemeyer designed . Inside the Oscar Niemeyer centre: Niemeyer said he found inspiration in the 'curves we find in mountains, in the waves of the sea, in the body of the woman we love' Beautiful: The sun is seen through The Pantheon of the Fatherland and Freedom in Brasilia. Niemeyer shrugged off criticism of Brasilia, saying 'there's nothing just like it' Niemeyer teamed up again with Le Corbusier in 1947 to design much of the United Nations complex in New York. After months of squabbling with architects - most notably Le Corbusier - Niemeyer came up with the final plan for the complex, including the Secretariat, General Assembly and conference buildings and the Dag Hammarskjold Library. But Niemeyer already was chafing at the limits of form-follows-function architecture. His first solo project was the Pampulha complex of buildings set on an artificial lake in the central Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, now Brazil's third-largest metro area. For the first time, Niemeyer employed the curves and arches that would become his hallmark. In the 1950s, Niemeyer was summoned by President Juscelino Kubitschek to design a new capital on Brazil's empty central high plains. Costa became the project's urban planner. With the slogan of '50 years in five', Mr Kubitschek hoped to prod Brazil into a great leap forward - and inward, away from the coast. Niemeyer rose to the challenge, testing new forms and technical limits for reinforced concrete. His cone-shaped Metropolitan Cathedral is a circle of curved concrete pillars set like tepee poles with glass mosaic in between. 'I didn't want an old-style cathedral - dark, a reminder of sin,' he said in an interview in the 1990s. 'I wanted something happier.' After a 1964 coup plunged Brazil into a 21-year military dictatorship, Niemeyer, a lifelong communist, decided to spend more time in Europe. While living in France in 1965, he designed the headquarters of the French Communist Party. During the dictatorship he also designed the centre of the Mondadori publishing house in Italy, Constantine University in Algeria and other projects in Israel, Lebanon, Germany and Portugal.","Brazilian died from respiratory infection in Rio de Janeiro hospital after months of ill health .

Relatives of a pastor's son accused of killing his parents and three siblings in New Mexico claim the teenager is not a 'monster' but a may have suffered a mental breakdown. Nehemiah Griego, 15, allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his sleeping mother Sara before killing his nine-year-old brother Zephania and two sisters, Jael, five, and Angelina, two. It is claimed he then lay in wait at least four hours for his father, Greg, to return to the family home in a rural area southwest of downtown Albuquerque and then shot him dead late on Saturday night. Police believe the video game-obsessed teen - who had allegedly spent a week plotting the murders - then spent the rest of the day at his local church. But his uncle has claimed the teenager was a doting older brother who could not be responsible for the horrific killing spree. Scroll down for video . This undated photo provided by shows Nehemiah Griego who is charged with killing five family members, including his father, mother, and three youngest siblings in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday . Family murder: The shooting took place inside the Griego home, and Nehemiah waited there for hours after killing his mother and siblings until his father arrived home from work . House of guns: The boy allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his family . In a statement he said: 'We have not been able to comprehend what led to this incredibly sad situation. However, we are deeply concerned about the portrayal in some media of Nehemiah as some kind of a monster. 'It is clear to those of us who know and love him that something went terribly wrong. Whether it was a mental breakdown or some deeper undiagnosed psychological issue, we canât be sure yet. 'What we do know is that none of us, even in our wildest nightmare, could have imagined that he could do something like this. 'He is a troubled young man who made a terrible decision that will haunt him and his family forever. 'Five lives have been senselessly and needlessly ended. Ruining one more without trying to get to the bottom of what really happened and more importantly - why - would be equally tragic.' It comes as police revealed that Griego spent the rest of day after the killings wandering the church grounds while Sunday school teachers were being trained on how to deal with a shooter. The teen then allegedly told a pastor he had found his family dead in his home. Former police officer and Calvary Albuquerque security chief Vince Harrison, who was teaching the Sunday School security class, then took Griego to his house where he discovered the murdered family. Crime scene: Authorities investigate the death of Pastor Gregory Griego and family members at his home on Sunday morning . Filling in the gaps: Sheriff Dan Houston (right) and Lt. Sid Covington (left) said that the teen has been 'very unemotional' throughout his questioning and is currently being held in the local juvenile detention center . Religious: The boy's father, a former pastor, was thought to be working at a local mission at the time that his wife and three children were killed, and only returned home at around 5am when his son then allegedly shot him . He said: 'When I met Nehemiah, I knew something wasn't right. I could feel it, I could see it in his eyes and I could see it in his behavior and his demeanor so the red flags went up and that's when I called the sheriff's department.' Harrison, who had known the Griego family for about 10 years, said he drove the teen back to the family's rural southwest Albuquerque home to meet authorities, interviewing him along the way. 'He went into detail of where they were, where the guns were and he was very matter-of-fact, really cold so I knew something wasn't right,' Harrison said. After finding the bodies, sheriff's officials say, they took the teen to headquarters. During questioning, they say he confessed to shooting his mother and three younger siblings in their beds shortly after 1 am. Investigators said he admitted he was 'frustrated' with his mother, but only seemed to show emotion when he spoke about video games he loved, such as Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto. They say he then waited in a bathroom with a military-style semi-automatic rifle to ambush his father upon his return from an overnight shift at a homeless shelter. He allegedly also told them he had reloaded the family's rifles and taken them with him in the family van with plans to randomly shoot more people. Suspected shooter: Nehemiah Griego, 15, was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood . 'Quiet': Nehemiah was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled . 'That sends chills down my spine,' Harrison said. Harrison said several people spotted Griego at the church but thought nothing of it until his arrest. He said officials then reviewed security video and found the teen had spent much of the day there. He said he doesn't know why Griego decided to come to the church, but that it was like a second home for the boy, who was schooled at his house. 'It was a familiar place to him,' Harrison said. 'I think if he did have in his mindset to do something foolish and start shooting people there also, I think his demeanor was tamed a little bit because he saw people there he knew.' A prayer vigil was held at the church on Wednesday night for victims Greg Griego, 51, his wife, Sarah Griego, 40, and three of their children - a 9-year-old boy, Zephania Griego, and daughters Jael Griego, 5, and Angelina Griego, 2.

Two men have filed a lawsuit against Lance Armstrong and his book publishers, charging that they were duped by the disgraced cyclist's deceptions that were printed in his writings. Rob Stutzman and Jonathan Wheeler, both of California, claim that the pages of Armstrong's best-selling memoirs are nothing but lies after he confessed last week to systematic doping in a landmark interview with Queen of Talk Oprah Winfrey. The class-action complaint was filed in federal court in Sacramento, California on Tuesday, five days after Armstrong ended years of vehement denial and admitted he had cheated his way to a record seven Tour de France titles through the use of banned, performance-enhancing drugs. Scam: The plaintiffs claim they bought Every Second Counts and It's Not About the Bike because they believed in Armstrong and his comeback after a near-fatal bout with testicular cancer . Confession: Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that his seven Tour de France titles were won with the help of performance-enhancing drugs . Mr Stutzman is a public relations executive who served as a deputy chief of staff for former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Mr Wheeler is a chef and amateur cyclist. They said they bought the books 'It's Not About the Bike' and 'Every Second Counts' because they believed in Armstrong and his story of returning without drug assistance to the Tour de France after a nearly fatal bout with testicular cancer. Following Armstrong's doping confession, however, Stutzman and Wheeler said they felt 'duped,' 'cheated' and 'betrayed' by the realization that the books, marketed as inspirational true-life memoirs, were replete with fabrications. Their lawsuit accuses Armstrong and his publishers, Penguin and Random House, of violating consumer protection laws on false advertising and fraud by selling the books as works of non-fiction. Seventh heaven: Armstrong celebrates winning his final Tour de France title in 2005. He was stripped of all seven titles after his history of taking performance-enhancing drugs was revealed . Lawyers for the purported class of Armstrong book buyers say readers are entitled to restitution and possibly statutory and punitive damages for deceptions. They say the publishers should have detected these, even though Armstrong passed drug screenings for various international cycling competitions. A similar lawsuit was filed in 2011 against Greg Mortenson, co-author of the best seller Three Cups of Tea, accusing him of fabricating much of his story about promoting education for impoverished girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. That suit, which alleged fraud and unjust enrichment, was dismissed last year by a federal judge in Montana. The Montana suit was sparked by a critical report by CBS television's '60 Minutes' program challenging the credibility of biographical details in 'Three Cups,' including Mortenson's account of being kidnapped in Pakistan's Waziristan region after trying unsuccessfully to scale the mountain K2. The legal cry of fraud against Mortenson followed the example of readers who won a $2.75million settlement from literary hoaxer James Frey who, like Armstrong, confessed his deception in an interview with Winfrey. Oprah's book club: The legal cry of fraud in books followed the example of readers who won a $2.75million settlement from literary hoaxer James Frey who, like Armstrong, confessed his deception in an interview with Oprah . His settlement marked a rare victory for aggrieved book buyers. One potentially significant advantage held by litigants suing Armstrong is that their was filed under California's exceptionally plaintiff-friendly consumer protections laws. Penguin will be represented in the Armstrong suit by the firm Dorsey & Whitney, which won the Mortenson case for his publisher. The lawyers are sure to raise the same First Amendment and implied-duty defenses in the new case as in the 'Three Cups' dispute. Dorsey partner Jonathan Herman declined to comment on how the publisher will respond to the Armstrong complaint's California-law claims but said, 'As far as we're concerned, this is also a case that should be dismissed.' Shamed: Armstrong admitted to years of doping during the Oprah interview . Also this week, an Australian bookstore made headlines after it announced it would begin moving Armstrong's books into the fiction section. 'All non-fiction Lance Armstrong titles, including Lance Armstrong: Images Of A Champion, The Lance Armstrong Performance Program and Lance Armstrong: World's Greatest Champion, will soon be moved to the fiction section,' says a sign in Sydney's Manly library. Wendy Ford, Manly Librarian Wendy Ford told the Herald Sun the sign was put up 'as a bit of a joke' by a university student who works weekends at the library. 'This person just works a few hours on the weekend and he didn't have any authority to make a statement on behalf of the library,' she said. This sign was on display at Manley Library in Sydney, Australia following the Lance Armstrong revelations on the Oprah Winfrey Show at the end of last week .","Lawsuit charges that two Armstrong memoirs are both tarnished by his admitted use of performance-enhancing drugs .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 09:58 EST, 16 February 2012 . Iranian patrol boats and aircraft shadowed a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group as it travelled through the Strait of Hormuz yesterday. The passage ended a Gulf mission that displayed Western naval power amid heightened tensions with Tehran, which has threatened to choke off vital oil shipping lanes. Officers aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln said there were no incidents with Iranian forces and described the surveillance as routine measures by Tehran near the strategic strait, which is jointly controlled by Iran and Oman. Surveillance: The USS Abraham Lincoln, pictured on Monday with American fighter jets in the air, was shadowed by Iranian patrol boats and aircraft as it travelled down the Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday . End of mission: The passage displayed Western naval power amid heightened tensions with Tehran, which has threatened to choke off the vital oil shipping lane . Although U.S. warships have passed through the strait for decades, the trip comes during an escalating showdown between Iran and the West over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. The last time an American carrier left the Gulf - the USS John C Stennis in late December - Iran's army chief warned the U.S. it should never return. The Abraham Lincoln was the centrepiece of a flotilla that entered the Gulf last month along with British and French warships in a display of Western unity against Iranian threats. There was no immediate comment by Iran about the Abraham Lincoln's departure. Iran's Revolutionary Guard has said it plans its own naval exercises near the strait, the route for a fifth of the world's oil supply, but Iran's military has made no attempts to disrupt oil tanker traffic. Two American warships, one in front and one in the rear, escorted the Abraham Lincoln on its midday journey through the strait and into the Arabian Sea after nearly three weeks in the Gulf, an area which is frequently visited by U.S. warships and includes the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet in Bahrain. The small but important strait is only about 30miles across at its narrowest point. The Lincoln was the centerpiece of a flotilla that entered the Gulf last month along with British and French warships in a display of Western unity against Iranian threats .

Gunners in red jerseys manned the 50-caliber machine guns as the ships moved out of the Gulf. An Iranian patrol boat pulled nearby. Later, just after the Abraham Lincoln rounded the 'knuckle' - the nub of Oman jutting out at the southern end of the strait - an Iranian patrol plane buzzed overhead. Another patrol boat was waiting further down the coast. Besides Iran's regular patrol boats, the Revolutionary Guard operates a large number of small, fast-attack boats. Some are armed with only a machine gun, while others also carry anti-ship missiles. They can be difficult to spot because they resemble the swift-moving smuggling boats that ply the strait. Rear Admiral Troy Shoemaker, commander . of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Force said none of those fast . boats appeared on Tuesday, likely deterred by the rough seas. He . predicted before the transit that the Iranians would likely keep a . close eye on the Lincoln throughout its passage, including with . ground-based radars, and wasn't surprised by the attention from Iranian . forces.

The department store has sold unpasteurised milk from vending machines at its flagship London store since 2011. However, the Food Standards Agency said it is looking at prosecuting the store along with its supplier, Hook & Sons organic farm in East Sussex.

'Raw' milk has historically been associated with the spread of tuberculosis and food poisoning bugs like salmonella. Sales of the milk are outlawed in Scotland, with farmers allowed to sell the milk direct to the public at farm gates and markets across the rest of the UK. Shops can also sell cheese made from the milk. But the FSA said Selfridges and the farmer, Stephen Hook, of Longleys Farm, Hailsham, broke the rules by selling the milk in vending machines. Court date: Farmer Stephen Hook, pictured here with wife Claire, is also being prosecuted by the FSA for supplying the milk to Selfridges . The watchdog said: âThe FSA has . confirmed its intention to prosecute Selfridges and the farmer who . supplied the company with raw drinking cow milk for sale, Stephen Hook, . for breaches of food hygiene regulations. âThe . decision follows a detailed investigation, after vending machines . dispensing raw cow milk were installed at Selfridges, in 2011.â Selfridges said its original decision to sell the milk was driven by a desire to offer more choice to customers. The farm company, Hook & Sons, sell their raw milk across the country via the internet, through Londonâs Borough Market and two milk rounds in Sussex. It insists the milk is pure, hygienic, safe and better for people than the pasteurised product. The firm said: âHerds are milked in a hygienic environment, using advanced milking equipment that is kept sterile. We pay fantastic attention to hygiene to ensure the strict bacteria tests conducted on the milk by the FSA are easily met. âIn this way all the benefits of the good bacteria in the milk are kept, without having any of the problems associated with bad.â Stephen Hook said: âIt is regrettable that the FSA has decided to bring this test case against a small family farm, which we believe has in every respect complied with the strict regulations of the 2006 Act governing sales of unpasteurised milk in England.' The company removed its machine from Selfridges last year following a complaint from the FSA. However, Mr Hook said: âWe have always maintained that the sale of raw milk through vending machines that are the property of the dairy producer and are maintained and stocked by him, is entirely within the spirit of the law. We are therefore determined to fight this prosecution.â The FSA is consulting on whether there should be changes to the rules restricting sales of raw milk, which could bring an outright ban.","Selfridges in Oxford Street, London, began selling untreated milk in 2011 .

Lawsuit: Zia Ziprin, 51, who formerly owned the Lower East Side footwear boutique Girls Love Shoes and her daughter Aishling Labat, 23, say a peeping Tom filmed them near-naked in a change room . A Manhattan mother and daughter are suing H&M, claiming a peeping Tom filmed them as they tried on lingerie in one of the clothing giant's flimsy dressing rooms. Zia Ziprin, 51, who formerly owned the Lower East Side footwear boutique Girls Love Shoes and her daughter Aishling Labat, 23, said the incident took place while they were shopping at H&M's Fifth Avenue store near the Flatiron in January 2010. The women claim they were 'in a state of undress within the dressing room stall' on the second floor when the unidentified man in an adjoining stall pulled out a 'camera or video camera' and filmed them, according to the lawsuit, filed in Manhattan Supreme Court. Labat noticed the man as she was changing into the underwear, her attorney, Ross Rothenberg, told The New York Post. 'She saw there was something above the dressing room. She thought it was a security camera, but when she reached up there was nothing there,' Rothenberg said. 'She started screaming and he ran from the second story down to the first' and escaped. 'Their assumption is that somewhere on the Internet is videos of both of them' changing into the negligee, Rothenberg said. He said, however, the women haven't yet been able to track down the footage. Both Ziprin and Labat 'pleaded with H&M's security and store personnel to stop (the man) from leaving the store ...with the compromising video and photographs,' the suit alleges. It says Ziprin 'begged for help from security and/or store personnel, who ignored her request.' Crime scene: The women say the invasion of privacy took place while they were shopping at the H&M store, pictured, on Fifth Avenue near the Flatiron in January 2010 . Rothenberg told The Post that police obtained security footage of the suspect and investigated the incident but never caught him. The women say they have suffered 'embarrassment, humiliation, fear, panic, torment' and want unspecified damages to make up for it. The suit claims the store's flimsy, unisex dressing rooms allow easy access to eavesdroppers and would-be perverts. An H&M spokesman told The Post that the company hasn't seen the suit but said its policy was to refuse comment on such matters anyway.","Zia Ziprin, 51, who formerly owned the Lower East Side footwear boutique Girls Love Shoes, and her daughter Aishling Labat, 23, filed the lawsuit in the Manhattan Supreme Court .

Honour: Campaign medals, similar to those given to Mr Baleiwai, which were presented to Prince Harry and fellow members of the Household Cavalry Regiment for service in Afghanistan (file picture) In the letter he wrote: 'My service to Queen and country have been dishonoured and I have been betrayed.' Mr Baleiwai has earned campaign medals for tours of duty in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq. According to The Times, he added: 'Throughout this period we have tried to be proactive, graceful and dignified. 'We have not even received an apology from this Government and they continue to pass the buck ... I therefore feel I can no longer accept my medals.' Mr Baleiwai's six month fight for British citizenship began in June last year when he quit the Army. A fight with a fellow soldier had led to an internal punishment and a criminal record which meant that his application for UK citizenship was refused. The soldier of 12 years was shocked that his application was rejected and he and his wife Kim, 31, thought a mistake had been made. Facing ruin: Notice has been served on the Baleiwai family home after his costly six month fight to stay in the UK . The pair never knew that the fight, which was dealt with by a commanding officer in the Army and not a law court, had led to a criminal conviction. He had only not challenged the ruling at the time because he wanted to get on with his career, despite insisting that he was acting in self defence. Mr Baleiwai, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia, Northern Ireland and alongside Prince Harry at Combermere Barracks in Windsor, decided to appeal the conviction last summer and it was quashed in November and citizenship was granted a month later. But the family had lived off savings during Mr Baleiwai's fight to stay in the UK and have been left desolate by the battle. Although he has since managed to find a job, notice has been served on the family home. Under law, all Commonwealth soldiers who have served in the military for at least five years can apply to the UK Border Agency for British citizenship.","Bale Baleiwai served in the Army for 12 years .

Changes: Supercop Bill Bratton, pictured running LA police, says he would love to run the Met as Downing Street is changing rules to allow foreigners to run British forces . American supercop Bill Bratton has revealed that he wants to be the first foreigner to run the Metropolitan Police. Mr Bratton, who tackled gang crime and reformed policing in New York and Los Angeles, was courted by David Cameron to run Scotland Yard in 2011, but was blocked from applying because of concerns about appointing a foreigner to a post with national security responsibilities. However, Home Secretary Theresa May intends to change the law to allow foreign candidates to apply for top policing jobs in Britain. That will pave the way for a renewed interest in Mr Bratton, 65, who said that leading the Met is âthe only jobâ that interests him in the UK. The move will unsettle Bernard Hogan-Howe, Met commissioner since September 2011, who has faced criticism over his handling of the âplebgateâ affair involving former chief whip Andrew Mitchell. Mr Bratton, who was consulted by Mr Cameron over tackling gangs after the summer riots in 2011, was credited with halving the murder rate in New YorkÂ  and cutting violent crime in Los Angeles. He advocates a zero- tolerance approach to policing. He said running the Met was a unique and internationally important post. âThere are three Western police agencies that have great significance in international policing â London, New York and Los Angeles,â he said. âIâve had the privilege of leading the two police departments in the US that have that international impact and that is something that is part of my interest in the Met.â A consultation period on Mrs Mayâs proposed police recruitment reforms will begin next week. The proposals will also suggest allowing talented recruits to join police forces at inspector and superintendent level instead of having to work their way up from the rank of constable. Fear: The London riots, which spread across the UK, shocked the nation and Bill Bratton's track-record in LA and New York is seen an ideal way to prevent a repeat . Friends: Met chief Bernard Hogan-Howe listens as Bill Bratton speaks in London after the 2011 riots, sharing his expertise on crushing gangs . Bill Bratton was credited with cutting crime in both New York and Los Angeles - including halving the Big Apple's murder rate and violent crime in the City of Angels. The 'supercop' is the only person to ever serve as chief executive of LAPD and NYPD and his international reputation was established when he re-engineered police departments in the 1990s. He advocated a 'zero tolerance' approach to policing and believed all offences - however small - should be investigated. Mr Bratton stood by the 'broken windows' philosophy which argues minor criminal damage impacts on morale in an area which can lead to an increase in crime. Explaining it he said: 'Broken Windows is the theory first put forward by two academics in the . early Eighties. By cracking down on minor quality-of-life crimes â such . as graffiti or breaking windows â police can reduce serious crime as . well. 'In a country that loves gardening (Britain), you fully appreciate the idea if you . donât weed a garden, that garden is going to be destroyed â the weeds . are going to overrun it.' From 1996 he worked in the private sector and formed his own private consulting company. He is a U.S. Army Vietnam veteran and began his policing career in 1970 with the Boston Police Department rising to Superintendent of Police in just 10 years. Mr Bratton was police chief in Boston, New York and Los . Angeles and won acclaim for his zero-tolerance policy to beating crime. The Prime Minister wanted him to replace Sir Paul . Stephenson but instead brought in as an adviser on gangs after riots tore through Britain's major cities in the summer of 2011. At the heart of Bratton's policing tactics are the use of injunctions, which restrict the movements of those accused . of being in gangs or involved in organised crime. He . also uses the 'broken windows' theory - where he demands every crime . should be investigated, however small, as he believes it will also . reduce more serious crimes too. In using injunctions he widened their use so, for example, criminals could not congregate at certain times of day or in certain . areas and could not carry mobile phones if it was proved they are being . used to further criminal activity. Gang injunctions are brought under civil law, as opposed to criminal . law, allowing police to use a lower burden of proof to get one. Much of his theory was adopted to create ASBOs in Britain, which did not go as far as his tactics and not enforced as strictly. They were then scrapped last year as they were considered too weak. In a piece for the Mail during the riots Mr Bratton wrote: 'I know about gangs. I understand the way they operate, the fear they . generate and the urgent need for the Government to tackle them head on. 'In more than 30 years as the chief of police in three of Americaâs most . troubled cities, New York, Los Angeles and Boston, I have learned . lessons and come up with initiatives, many of which work and some of . which may be applied to your situation.' Theresa May will next week open the door to foreign stars like Bratton, after she was the person who blocked his appointment around 18 months ago. Ms May was said to have had no problem with Mr Bratton personally, but was uncomfortable with the idea of ending the tradition of British citizens heading British police forces. However, there has been a sea-change . Top officers from Canada, Australia and New Zealand will also be invited to take over forces across England and Wales. Ministers also want direct entry into the police at superintendent level for âexceptionalâ people from the forces, the security services, industry and the professions. Currently, all police must enter at constable rank, but Mrs May hopes that allowing new recruits to skip the compulsory two years on the beat will attract talent. Up to 80 of the brightest graduates will be recruited at inspectors level and groomed to become chief constables. But Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendentsâ Association, said: âWe donât accept the premise that there is a shortage of talent in the police service.â","David Cameron wanted Bill Bratton for London in 2011 but was stopped .

A brave boxer has fought against the odds to become a top martial artist - despite being born with part of one arm missing. Nick Newell, 26, was born with his left arm only reaching just past the elbow after a congenital amputation caused part of the limb to become detached in the womb. But he hasn't let his disability prevent him from living his dream of being a professional fighter after he won the title of XFC lightweight world championship. Champion fighter: Nick Newell has become a professional martial artist despite being born with part of his left arm missing . Fighting to fight: Nick Newell now wants to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championships but the company president has refused to let him enter . And Newell, from Milford, Connecticut, now hopes to take his career to the next level by entering the Ultimate Fighting Championship - the largest mixed martial arts promotion company in the world which hosts all top-ranked fighters in the sport. He told Eyewitness News: 'I think that whether you're missing a limb or you're not missing a limb, you should always be confident in yourself. 'Growing up, I was always looked at a little different. I've been like this my whole life and I don't know any other way.' Newell joined the wrestling team at Jonathan Law High School in Milford where he became captain and an all-state wrestler. He then went on to become captain of his wrestling team at college. Newell then began his career as a mixed martial artist four years ago and has built up a reputation as a talented fighter. But that hasn't stopped UFC President Dana White throwing cold water on the idea of Newell fighting for his company. Taking it to the next level: Nick Newell says he will continue to pursue the right to compete in the UFC . Determined: Nick Newell competed in wrestling throughout school and college before going on to start a career as a martial arts fighter . When asked about the possibility, he responded: 'Never, no. 'It's hard to fight here with two arms. It's tough. There's guys that we bring in that are considered top guys on The Ultimate Fighter that don't ever really pan out and make it. 'Will the state of Nevada let him fight? Will the state of California let him fight? Would some of these bigger athletic commissions let him fight? Maybe he can get away with that in some of these other states. 'I don't know, fighting with one arm is just craziness to me.' But Newell is determined to make it to the top of his profession. He told MMA Fighting: '[The UFC] is where you can test yourself against the best guys in the world. 'I want to see where I stand among the world's elite fighters and I feel like I've earned my shot. Anyone else with my track record would be getting looked at.' He insisted that he's 'not going anywhere' and just wanted a fair shot. He told Eyewitness News: 'I'm far from invincible but I've proven that I'm more than capable.

Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o had conversations with hoaxer Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, who was posing as the footballer's fake online girlfriend Lennay Kekua. The footballer had intimate conversations with Tuiasosopo, which were said to have cemented the relationship despite the pair never meeting. Lawyer Milton Grimes said the footballer 'thought it was a female he was talking with'. He added: 'It was Ronaiah as Lennay.' Scroll down for video . Duped: Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. A lawyer claims the footballer had phone conversations with a hoaxer pretending to be his girlfriend . Tuiasosopo is thought to have invented Lennay based on stolen pictures of Diane OâMeara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo. Mr Grimes added: 'This wasnât a prank to make fun. It was establishing a communication with someone. 'It was a person with a troubled existence trying to reach out and communicate and have a relationship.' According to reports, Tuiasosopo's CV includes vocal and dramatic training, while he was president of his high school drama club and performs with a Christian band. Mr Grimes insisted that former high school football star Tuiasosopo, 22, was not trying to hurt or humiliate Teâo. The Notre Dame footballer was pictured running football drills at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida. Te'o says he has been the victim of an online hoax after claiming to have an online girlfriend who later turned out to be a fake. Posing: Lawyer Milton Grimes said the linebacker thought he was talking to fictitious online girlfriend Lennay Kekua, who was posing as Ronaiah Tuiasosopo . He was interviewed by Katie Couric yesterday, telling her that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist. But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax. Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that the girlfriend, called Lennay Kekua, had died of cancer. 'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said. He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.' Breaking down: Manti Te'oÂ  appears to have cried during the interview which will air in full on Thursday . One-on-one: The interview took place on Tuesday, but will not be aired in full until Thursday . A segment of the interview with Te'o and his parents was broadcast on Good Morning America on Wednesday. The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he only learned of the hoax when he received a phone call in December from a woman saying she was Kekua. 'Now I get a phone call on December . 6, saying that she's alive and then I'm going be put on national TV two . days later. And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would . you do?' Te'o said. But reports suggested that he discussed the girlfriend in a Web interview on December 8 . and again in a newspaper interview published December 10. Supportive: Te'o's parents Brian and Ottilla Te'o were also featured during the interview . Te'o's . father defended his son when Couric pointed out that many people don't . believe the football star, suspecting he used the situation for personal . gain. 'People can . speculate about what they think he is. I've known him 21 years of his . life. And he's not a liar. He's a kid,' Brian Te'o said with tears in . his eyes. Unmasked: Diane O'Meara told NBC's Today show that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua . On Tuesday, the woman whose photo was used as the 'face' of the Twitter account of Te'o's supposed girlfriend says the man allegedly behind the hoax confessed and apologized to her. Diane O'Meara told NBC's Today show that Ronaiah Tuiasosopo used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua. Pictures that Miss O'Meara had posted on Facebook and Instagram were used in the elaborate hoax, which she says is a case of identity theft. She added: 'It's very bizarre and it's a very twisted and confusing scenario.' 'In the past five years, [Tuiasosopo has] literally been stalking my Facebook and stealing my photos.' While Tuiasosopo has since called her . and expressed regret over the situation she was thrown into, Miss . O'Meara says there's little he can do to make it better. 'Ronaiah . has called and I know he has confessed but he has also apologized. But I . don't think thereâs anything he can say to me that would fix this.' The New York Daily News reports . that Manti Te'o apparently also found the receipt for . 36-long-stem white roses that he sent to the girl's supposed funeral, . and he hopes that that proves he was not in on the scam. 'My . dearest Lennay, although our time together was brief, I feel like Iâve . known you all of my life. Till we meet again. I love you, Manti,' he . wrote in the note that 1-800-FLOWERS attached to the bouquet. Fake and original: The picture used by the . hoaxers as the face of Lennay Kekua, left, was taken from this original . photograph of Diane O'Meara, 23, a marketing executive living in Los . Angeles . Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua with Diane's pictures has been exposed as completely false . The highly-anticipated interview will technically be the second time that Te'o has spoken publicly since the scandal broke, but it will be the first time that he does so on television. The standout football player gave an off-camera interview with ESPN on Friday night that reportedly lasted for more than two-and-a-half hours. He insists he was the victim of the hoax, not a participant. He . admitted it was 'crazy' that he had a purely online relationship with a . girl but denied he was part of the con to gain publicity for his . burgeoning football career at the college. Facing the truth: Manti Te'o, who has had just one interview since the news broke that his girlfriend was a hoax, will sit down with Katie Couric in a show airing Thursday . 'No. Never,' Te'o said in an interview Friday night with ESPN's Jeremy Schaap, 'I wasn't faking it. I wasn't part of this.' The Heisman Trophy runner-up said he had an online romance with a woman he never met and in September was informed that the woman died from leukemia.

Sisters to the end: Jean, left, died at the age of 98 on Thursday, a day before her sister and fellow nun Elaine, right. The nuns kept up their sibling bond meeting up for a bedtime chat every night . They will be remembered in a single funeral mass tomorrow. Fellow sisters at Saint Louise House today recalled how their differences as much as their close relationship defined them. 'They were remarkable women, very different in their own ways, but also very close,' Sister Joanne Donovan, the head of Saint Louise House told the Times Union of Albany. The sisters were both born in Chicago but were raised in New York as their family moved. All five siblings who entered religious life stayed close - vacationing together in a small cottage beside the Daughters of Charity property. Religious: The Wheeler family were devout Roman Catholics living in the Bronx. Five of the seven sisters became nuns - all working in the New York area . Reminiscing: Sister Joanne Donovan, left, Sister Irene Brassard, center, and Sister Mary Walter Boyle remembered the two Wheeler sisters who died in their nunnery last week . 'They did everything together and if you met one Wheeler sister, you knew all the Wheeler sisters,' Donovan added. The sisters weren't roommates at Saint Louise House but were inseparable beyond that. They used to collect sweet treats to share before bedtime at 8pm, precious moments when they shared their sisterly bond. Jean liked milk chocolate and Elaine preferred dark chocolate. Sister Irene Brassard, who is Donovan's assistant, told the newspaper: 'They were big talkers, real chatterers,' They were the last two of the Wheeler girls still alive and were both proud of the teaching work they carried out across New York. Sister Elaine taught biology at Cardinal McCloskey High School in Albany from 1957 to 1978. Former pupils remembered her for her kindness, according to the Times Union report. She would secretly buy new clothing and shoes for poorer students. Sister Jean taught at St John's Alternative Elementary School and St. John's in Brooklyn. In recent years Sister Jean grew frailer, losing an eye in a car accident and becoming increasing deaf. Her younger sister continued to support her - sneaking cookies into her room at night. After Sister Jean's death, the latest stash was discovered hidden in her room meant for her sister who had died the day before.","Sister Jean Marie and Sister Elaine, members of the same nunnery and siblings died a day apart last week .

But when Dick and Lil Dickens, both in their 80s, pulled up outside what they thought was a jumble sale at a warehouse in March, Cambridgeshire, they got more than they bargained for. They had stumbled across the closing stages of an alleged illegal rave where more than 1,000 people had been dancing the night away. There were plenty of party-goers still inside the building and one of them seized the opportunity to get a picture of the couple with other apparent clubbers. Dick and Lil Dickens (pictured centre) stumbled into an all-night rave after mistakenly thinking it was a New Year's Day sale . The couple pulled into the warehouse car park after seeing other vehicles there, believing it was a jumble sale of some kind . Mr Dickens, of Turves, said: 'We had been out shopping and we saw all these cars outside. There was no music or anything like that. The cars were parked all over the place. We thought it was a sale. 'I don't think we were the only ones as there were several people wandering over to see what was going on. 'We had a look in and that was it. When we realised that it wasn't a sale we left. We're in our 80s so we don't want to get mixed up in anything like that. Paul Allen, 27, who took the picture, said the couple seemed 'a bit surprised' to see all the people in the warehouse but ended up 'having as good time as anybody else.' Mr Allen said: 'When they came in we thought they were going to have a bit of a moan but they were alright with us. 'They seemed like a decent little couple.' An estimated Â£50,000 worth of damage was allegedly caused to the warehouse, which belongs to 63-year-old businessman John Finn as a result of the all-night party.

A transvestite without a medical license has been accused of practicing plastic surgery out of a motel room, where he injected silicone into patients' buttocks and closed the wounds with Krazy Glue. Calvin E. Butler, also known as Tamieka Butler, allegedly worked from a room at the El Patio Motel in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he charged patients as much as $400 a visit. At least two of his 'clients' - a man and a woman - have since been hospitalized with severe infections, and one even needed sections of his buttocks removed following the treatment. One of the alleged victims told sheriff's deputies in December that she visited Butler at the motel four times between September and October and paid $200 each time, NBC Miami reported. Accused: Calvin E. Butler, pictured left in his 2012 mugshot, allegedly illegally injected silicone into patients' buttocks. He has undergone quite the transformation since this police mugshot taken in 2001, right . After she took off her clothes, Butler used a felt-tip pen to mark crosses on areas of her buttocks that he believed 'needed fullness', she told authorities. He then injected a clear substance - . which he told her was 'sterile silicone' - into her buttocks using a . syringe and after wiping away any fluid, applied Krazy Glue to the . incisions, she said. Butler allegedly once told her he . bought the silicone from a nurse at Florida Medical Center and, on . another occasion, said he bought it from a woman named 'Debra' who . carried out the same work. After the final visit, the woman . began feeling pain at the injection sites, and Butler told her to take . warm baths and massage the areas. 'Scheme': Butler, pictured left in 2001 and right in 2002, allegedly injected patients with silicone in a motel room and closed up the wounds with Krazy Glue, charging hundreds of dollars each time . Yet the woman began to experience . fevers and swollen lymph nodes and in mid-November, she began suffering . from open and oozing wounds on her buttocks. She went to hospital and received . antibiotics, but the pain soon returned. She returned to hospital, where . she was treated for Lymphadenitis, a swelling of the lymph nodes due to . a bacterial infection. Five weeks later she had still not recovered and was suffering from chronic pain and a chronic cough, and is now disfigured, the affidavit noted. Another victim told police that he . too was admitted to hospital after allegedly receiving the injections . from Butler, and even needed areas of his buttocks removed. Transformation: These mug shots show Butler in 2007, left, and 2008, right. He has also been arrested for solicitation of prostitution, solicitation to commit prostitution and resisting an officer . From his bed at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, the man told deputies he met Butler several years ago and began getting the injections on a weekly basis from June until October last year. Butler charged him $100 as they were friends, but he told the man he would charge strippers $400. In October, the man began developing sores where the injections had been administered and Butler told him to 'toughen up' and gave him oral antibiotics, according to the affidavit. But in November he was admitted to hospital with an infection, and doctors tested the wounds and found they contained MRSA and other infections and that he needed areas removed. Butler was allegedly angry that the man sought medical attention and visited him in hospital wearing a large wig, jewellery and a fur coat. Scene: Butler allegedly rented a room at El Patio Motel in Key West to carry out the illegal procedures . When the man asked what he was doing there, Butler answered: 'You need to remember who the b**** in charge is', according to the affidavit. Butler has a criminal history dating back to 2001, including solicitation of prostitution, solicitation to commit prostitution, driving with a suspended license and resisting an officer. He is being held on $15,000 bond. The incident is the latest in a string involving illegal buttock injections in South Florida . Last month, a couple in Hialeah was arrested for allegedly performing a bitched procedure, and in 2011, Oneal Ron Morris from Miami Gardens was arrested for allegedly injecting patients with cement, Fix-a-Flat and other substances in their buttocks.","Calvin E.

Mrs Hobkinson said that on the night of September 29 last year her husband told her he was ready to die. 'Tom said he was going to do it,' she told the inquest. 'He was watching a DVD of our son Ben's wedding. 'He told me to go to bed and to take one of his sleeping pills. We said our goodbyes. 'As I left the room he told me not to . forget the heating instructions for the flat were in the bottom drawer â . that was typical of him.' She said she left her husband sitting in his wheelchair next to the living room table at around 10.45pm. At around 3am she woke up and found . him dead with a typed suicide note, signed and dated, which read: 'I . have committed euthanasia by my own hand and without any assistance.' He . went on to say that if he was found alive he did not want to be . resuscitated. A post-mortem examination revealed he had overdosed on the drug he had bought. Mrs Hobkinson added: 'I was hoping it wasn't going to work. But on the other hand it was what he wanted.' Detective Constable David Palmer told . the inquest that examination of Mr Hobkinson's laptop showed emails . between himself and a Mexican contact who is thought to have supplied . the medication he used to kill himself. When coroner Dr Emma Carlyon asked if . there had been any third party involvement, assistance or pressure . exerted on Mr Hobkinson to kill himself, the officer replied: . 'Absolutely none whatsoever.' Dr Carlyon recorded a verdict that Mr Hobkinson had killed himself. After the inquest Mrs Hobkinson said: . 'Tom loved life and even though the disease was getting worse and worse . he was happy right up until the end. We all love him very much and miss . him.' For confidential support call the .

The city of Chicago claims to be dealing with a feathery problem by deporting scores of pigeons to Indiana. Social worker Steffeny Smith told CBS Chicago how she witnessed two men netting a group of around 70 birds from her office window last Friday. The catchers told Smith they were taking the pigeons to a farm in Indiana, a claim which has been confirmed by a local politician. But no further details are forthcoming. Chicago social worker Steffeny Smith was disturbed by what she witnessed from her office window. Two men trapped 70 pigeons in a large net and then told her they were taking them to Indiana . Smith was shocked and disturbed by what she saw in the Uptown neighborhood of the city, as the trapped birds were clearly in distress. The woman told CBS: 'I threw the window open because I was really triggered by it, it was just so horrifying. 'You could hear the pigeons crying. They were like smashed into the ground,' Smith added. But when she went down to question the men she was surprised by their answer. 'He said they're carrying them off to Indiana,' Smith explains. 'You've got to be kidding me. You really are telling me that I'm supposed to believe that? Like, really?,' she explained with large degree of skepticism. Pigeons have long been a nuisance to the residents of Chicago . Chicago Alderman James Cappleman verified the claim that the pigeons were being relocated. 'An Indiana farmer contacted us and offered to capture and take pigeons to his farm. He wanted them alive,' said the statement from his office . Despite Smith's disbelief, the pigeon 'relocation' was backed up by a local politician. James Cappleman, Aldermann for Chicago's 46th ward, has already expressed his wish to remove some of the birds from the city's streets. In May 2012, he was assaulted by a local resident known as 'Pigeon Lady' when he tried to sweep away the breadcrumbs she had left for the birds. In December he proposed fines of up to $1,000 for persistent pigeon feeders in the area. And this week Aldermann took responsibility for the physical capture and removal of the birds to the neighboring state. 'An Indiana farmer contacted us and offered to capture and take pigeons to his farm,' Cappleman spokeswoman Tressa Feher said. 'He wanted them alive.' Other than the fact that the farmer in question had visited Chicago four times, this is all Aldermann's office were prepared to say. Smith was shocked by the episode. 'It was so bizarre and so disturbing, it couldnât even compute to me,' she told CBS. But there's very little in the way of legal pigeon protection. The state of Illinois classifies pigeons as a nuisance. As such, the birds are not protected by any laws, so these 'removals' may continue for some time.

A terrifying sea monster with five inch knife-edged teeth that roamed prehistoric Nevada almost 250 million years ago has been unveiled by scientists. The giant predator was about 28 feet long (8.6 metres) in length and is the first top predator in marine food chains that would have fed on prey similar to its own size. Its fossil described online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences was dug out of rocks dating back 244 million years at a time when the Nevada desert where it was found was covered by a warm ocean. Named Thalattoarchon saurophagis - meaning 'lizard-eating sovereign of the sea' - the sea creature had five inch teeth and was at the top of the food chain . Named Thalattoarchon saurophagis - meaning 'lizard-eating sovereign of the sea' - it's an early representative of the ichthyosaurs. These were a group of marine reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs and roamed the oceans for 160 million years. During the middle Triassic Period, ichthyosaurs evolved from as yet unidentified land reptiles that moved back into the water, in a development parallel to that of the ancestors of modern-day dolphins and whales. They were particularly abundant in the Jurassic Period, until they were replaced as the top aquatic predators by another reptilian order named plesiosaurs in the Cretaceous Period. Thalattoarchon had a massive skull and jaws armed with large teeth with cutting edges used to seize and slice through other marine reptiles in the Triassic seas. Because it was a meta-predator - capable of feeding on animals with bodies similar in size to its own - Thalattoarchon was comparable to modern orca whales. A jaw full of five-inch, knife-edged teeth let this newly unearthed ichthyosaur tear into prey. The species swam in what is now Nevada. Tooth crown of Thalattoarchon as seen in the field. The shape of the crown with its two cutting edges indicates that this ichthyosaur was a meat eater, not a fish eater. Remarkably only eight million years prior to the appearance of Thalattoarchon, a severe extinction at the end of the Permian period killed as many as 80 to 96 percent of species in the Earth's oceans. The rise of a predator such as Thalattoarchon documents the fast recovery and evolution of a modern ecosystem structure after the extinction. Dr Nadia Frobisch, of the Humboldt Museum in Berlin, said: 'Everyday we learn more about the biodiversity of our planet including living and fossil species and their ecosystems. 'The new find characterises the establishment of a new and more advanced level of ecosystem structure. 'Findings like Thalattoarchon help us to understand the dynamics of our evolving planet and ultimately the impact humans have on today's environment.' This is what the jaws of Thalattoarchon looked like when they were discovered by Field Museum preparator Jim Holstein on July 24, 1998. Paleontologist Nadia FrÃ¶bisch preparing a plaster jacket for the fossil of the new ichthyosaur in the field in Nevada . The ichthyosaur was recovered from what is today a remote mountain range in central Nevada. Most of the animal was preserved including the skull except the front of the snout, parts of the fins and the complete vertebral column up to the tip of the tail. Supported by a grant from the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research and . Exploration, the team of paleontologists took three weeks to unearth the ichthyosaur in 2010 and prepare it for its transport by helicopter and truck out of the field. Study co-author Dr Olivier Rieppel, of The Field Museum in Chicago, said: 'This discovery is a good example of how we study the past in order to illuminate the future.'

"By . Daniel Miller . PUBLISHED: . 08:48 EST, 24 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:19 EST, 24 January 2013 . Russian military recruits are to be checked for certain types of tattoo which authorities believe could reveal signs of homosexuality under new technical guidelines issued from the Kremlin. Conscripts and contract soldiers should be given a thorough physical examination looking for tattoos in intimate places, the Defense Ministry's central administration recommends. The guidelines, which are based on a military psychology textbook from 2005, specify that special attention should be paid to tattoos near the face, sexual organs and buttocks, which could reveal possible sexual deviations. Tattoo checks: Recruits joining the Russian military are to be examined for any intimate tattoos which could reveal homosexuality under new guidelines issued by the Kremlin . Checkups: Recruits show doctors their tongues, during a medical examination in the Siberian city of Kemerovo . The text reads: 'The reason for getting tattoos could indicate a low cultural or educational level. 'If an influence by external factors is determined, for example, persuasion or direct coercion, this indicates the malleability of the young man, his disposition to submit to another's will.' The guide also outlines a range of warning signs for potential mental instability which include early sexual experience and 'uncontrolled sexual behavior'. Kremlin: Many within the Russian government are against the promotion of homosexuality and western values . Officers are advised to chat with conscripts about their sexual experience and conduct. The physical examination should take place after the recruit has been quizzed about family, everyday life, success in school and attitudes toward alcohol. The guide offers advice on various issues, from how to spot an 'opinion-shaper' and 'natural-born leader' within the ranks to what role religious and ethnic aspects will have inside the barracks. However many officers have already rejected the guidelines claiming they would be impractical to implement. One unnamed battalion chief assistant told Russia's Izvestia newspaper: 'I just physically can't so confidentially hold a discussion with each new recruit. The commanders do that anyway. 'What will they do, examine their genitals for any tattoos? And how will they ask about someone's first sexual experience? 'Hey, when did you have your first woman, rookie? Answer directly, no beating around the bush!'"" While the Russian military holds traditional views on sexuality, a UN report from 2007 stated homosexuality and male prostitution is common within the army. The UN International Panel for Struggle against Sexual Exploitation found that some soldiers voluntarily offer their services while others are forced into prostitution. The battalion chief assistant added: 'I had one gay contract soldier who joined just to find more partners for himself. For people like that, of course, there's no place in the army.' The move is the latest in a series of proposed clampdowns on homosexuality including new legislation which aims to promote traditional values. Under the terms of a bill that comes up for a first vote later this month, a public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal 'homosexual propaganda' and bring a fine of up to Â£10,000 . The legislation being pushed by the Kremlin and the Russian Orthodox Church would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as  âpropaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, . bisexuality and transgenderism.â It also includes a ban on holding public . events that promote gay rights. Controversial: Officers detain gay right activists during a protest in December in Moscow. A bill banning 'homosexual propaganda' comes up for the first of three votes this month . The bill is part of an effort to promote traditional Russian values as opposed to Western liberalism, which the Kremlin and church see as corrupting Russian youth and contributing to a wave of protest against President Vladimir Putin's rule, Fox News reported. Other laws that the Kremlin says are intended to protect young Russians have been adopted in recent months, including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed âextremistâ or unfit for young audiences. Denis Volkov, a sociologist with the Levada Center, an independent pollster, says the anti-gay bill fits the âgeneral logicâ of a government intent on limiting various rights. But in this case, the move has been met mostly with either indifference or open enthusiasm by average Russians. Protest: Russian police officers detain a gay rights activist during an attempt to hold a gay pride parade in Moscow in May 2012 . Levada polls conducted last year . show that almost two thirds of Russians find homosexuality âmorally . unacceptable and worth condemning.â About half are against gay rallies and . same-sex marriage; almost a third think homosexuality is the result of . âa sickness or a psychological trauma,â the Levada surveys show. Russia's widespread hostility to homosexuality is shared by the political and religious elite. Lawmakers have accused homosexuals of . decreasing Russia's already low birth rates and said they should be . barred from government jobs, undergo forced medical treatment or be . exiled. Orthodox activists criticised U.S. company PepsiCo for using a âgayâ rainbow on cartons of its dairy products. A man dressed in a bridal gown screams out of a police vehicle after he was detained . In a gay rights protest in December, Pavel Samburov, founder of gay-rights group the Rainbow Association, was pelted with eggs by militant activists with the Orthodox Church seconds after he and his boyfriend kissed. He was arrested by police, fined Â£10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre. The Orthodox activists were also rounded up, but were released much earlier. Those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from âhomosexual propagandaâ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically. The bill reads: âThis propaganda goes through the mass media and public events that propagate homosexuality as normal behavior'. Russian cities started adopting anti-gay laws in 2006. Only one person has been prosecuted so far under a law specifically targeted at homosexuals: Nikolai Alexeyev, a gay rights campaigner, was fined the equivalent of Â£100 after a one-man protest last summer in St. Petersburg. In November, a St. Petersburg court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trade Union of Russian Citizens, a small group of Orthodox conservatives and Putin loyalists, against pop star Madonna. The group sought Â£6.7million in damages for what it says was âpropaganda of perversionâ when Madonna spoke up for gay rights during a show three months earlier. Russian special police forces arrest a homosexual activist. Homosexuals are subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia . The federal bill's expected adoption . comes 20 years after a Stalinist-era law punishing homosexuality with up . to five years in prison was removed from Russia's penal code as part of . the democratic reforms that followed the Soviet Union's collapse. Most . of the other former Soviet republics also decriminalised homosexuality, . and attitudes toward gays have become a litmus test of democratic . freedoms. While gay pride parades are held in the three former Soviet Baltic states, all today members of the European Union, same-sex love remains a crime in authoritarian Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. In Russia, homosexuals have been subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia. There are no reliable estimates of how many gay men and women live in Russia, and only a few big cities such as Moscow and St. Petersburg have gay nightclubs and gyms. Even there, homosexuals do not feel secure.","Conscripts and contract soldiers to be given a thorough examination .

The file seen by The Times claims the accused then divided up the belongings of the 23-year old and her male friend and tried to destroy evidence by cleaning the bus and hiding their own clothes. Today's opening arguments by the prosecution lawyers took place within a courtroom closed to the public and media, in a special fast-track court set up just weeks ago to handle sexual assault cases. The accused facing a maximum sentence of death by hanging if convicted. A Delhi police van, believed to be carrying the five accused of the gang rape and murder of a student, leaves the Delhi Saket court today. Prosecutors presented charges of murder, rape, kidnap, and destruction of evidence . Indian Delhi police personnel are pictured outside Saket district court complex in New Delhi today as a fast-track court heard legal arguments against the five accused . An activist removes the mask of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh after police asked her to leave as she tried to stage a protest outside the Saket district court complex where the trial is being hosted . At least two of the men accused of . the rape and murder are expected to plead not guilty to all charges . against them. A sixth suspect says he is a juvenile and is expected to . be tried in a juvenile court. Police were on alert outside the . sprawling court complex in south New Delhi as the suspects arrived with . their faces covered by woolen caps. Inside the court, about 30 policemen . blocked access to the room where the trial was to be held, while scores . of journalists and curious onlookers crowded the hallway. The . suspects were whisked into the courtroom by a phalanx of armed . policemen for the start of the trial and two hours later, after proceedings were over, they were driven away by the police . Details of the day's proceedings were not available. The courtroom was closed to the public and the media even though defence lawyers had argued that since the victim is dead, the proceedings should be opened. There was also a gag order on the lawyers to not reveal what happened inside the court. The police's file on the attack contains details of the operation mounted by Delhi police to catch the attackers and the alleged attempts by the accused to destroy evidence. The documents reveal how police tracked down the bus on which the attack took place after detectives spotted it on an airport hotel's CCTV, speeding away from where the victim and her male friend were dumped. Testimonies from two rickshaw drivers allege that the attackers burned the victims' clothes in a bonfire lit close to where the bus was parked. Indian women hold up knives that were distributed by the Shiv Sena party, in Mumbai, India, yesterday. The knife distribution was organised to raise awareness of the need to protect and empower women . A government panel yesterday criticised the 'apathy' of police and officials and recommended . India strictly enforce sexual assault laws, commit to speedy . rape trials and change antiquated penal code to protect women . The police papers say that despite the attackers' efforts . to clean the bus, substantial blood stains remained and further DNA . evidence was obtained when detectives found bundled clothing worn by the . men on the night of the attack, along with clumps of the victim's hair. An alleged confession by bus driver Ram Singh, 33, recovered from the police's file on the case, states that his brother Mukesh Singh, 28, was given one mobile phone while gym instructor Vinay Sharma, 20, was handed another, along with the male victim's shoes. Akshay Kumar Singh, 28, took the student's rings, 18-year-old Pawan Gupta took a watch and 1,000 rupees (Â£12),Â and a juvenile was said to have taken a bank card and a small amount of cash. The . bus driver, Ram Singh, tried fleeing his slum when . detectives caught up him but later confessed and gave police five . other names, including that of his younger brother, according to the police documents, . His alleged confession includes how the men split the victims' mobile phones, money, jewellery, bank card and even the male victim's Hush Puppies shoes. Mobile phone records are said to place the attackers on the route taken by the bus during the attack. An alleged confession by the juvenile suspect states that the men pretended to be fellow passengers to lure the couple onto the bus before the bus doors were locked and each of the men 'took it in turn to do the wrong act.' An iron rod was used first to beat the male victim and then used on the student to inflict massive internal injures of which she died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. They were both then dumped naked on the side of the road. The trial will be conducted in a . closed court room after Judge Yogesh Khanna denied a defence motion to . make the proceedings public. After the fast-track court hearing, M.L. Sharma, a defence lawyer for Mukesh Singh, one of the accused, said he . had withdrawn from the case. V.K. Anand, who represents Mukesh's brother . Ram Singh, will now defend both brothers. The two lawyers had been . arguing over who was Mukesh Singh's real lawyer. Accused: Ravidas camp, the slum where four of the six accused by police in the Delhi gang rape case, are reported to live . Sharma said he left the case to save his client from being tortured to . fire him. He has long maintained that the other defence lawyers were . planted by the police to ensure guilty verdicts. The hearing will resume Monday to allow for tomorrow's public holiday in India. A magistrate separately rejected a petition by Subramanian Swamy, a prominent politician, that no leniency be shown toward the accused who claims to be a juvenile because of the brutal nature of the crime, said Jagdish Shetty, an aide to Swamy. Documents presented by prosecution last week to the Juvenile Justice Board indicated that the defendant was a juvenile at the time of the attack, which would make him ineligible for the death penalty. Magistrate Geetanjali Goel is expected to rule on the suspect's age on Jan.28. The suspect would face three years in a reform facility if convicted as a juvenile. The trial began a day after a government panel criticised the 'apathy' of police and officials and recommended India strictly enforce sexual assault laws, commit to holding speedy rape trials and change the antiquated penal code to protect women. The panel appointed to recommend suggestions to overhaul the criminal justice system's handling of violence against women, received a staggering 80,000 suggestions from women's and rights groups and thousands of ordinary citizens. Among the panel's suggestions were a ban on a traumatic vaginal exam of rape victims and an end to political interference in sex crime cases. It has also suggested the appointment of more judges to help speed up India's sluggish judicial process and clear millions of pending cases.

Instead, he purrs down the street in a top-of-the-range Jaguar sports car, or his sporty BMW X5 or the latest addition to the family fleet: a Porsche Cayenne. To his neighbours in well-heeled Hampstead, North London, the 36-year-old comic and his cars have become a familiar sight. They have witnessed the transformation from scruffy chancer to showbusiness royalty. For, six years ago, he was on the brink of bankruptcy with debts of Â£30,000. He was living in a one-bedroom flat with his wife Kitty and their newborn son. Money was so tight they used an old microwave oven (found in salvage) as a dining table. Today, home is a Â£3.5âmillion property and his watch is a Â£10,000 Breitling. Yet for all that, his is still a discreet kind of wealth. Not for him the âlook at meâ behaviour of his friend, TV presenter Jonathan Ross. McIntyre favours the subtle yet expensive styles of Prada over more ostentatious designers. Even the cars, in their own way, are an example of financial prudence. As a child, he always wanted a Ferrari, but despite easily being able to afford one, he has yet buy one. Indeed, eschewing the normal starâs perk of a chauffeur, he drives himself (the logic being that since he has invested so much money in his cars, he should get maximum value out of them). When not away on tour â which obliges him to live in hotels for much of the year â he spends time quietly with his family. Rather than dining at posh West End restaurants, his favourite haunt is his local CafÃ© Rouge. His only noticeable extravagances are bouquets of flowers for his wife. Even his decision to use celebrity personal trainer Matt Roberts â David Cameron is also a client â was pragmatism rather than indulgence. McIntyreâs father died at 53 from a heart attack, and having inherited a tendency to put on weight, Michael believes he owes it to his children (Lucas, seven, and Oscar, four) to look after his health. This is a man who still keeps a spreadsheet in which all household expenditure is logged â incoming and outgoing funds balanced to make sure he will never again be on Skid Row. Big business: Michael McIntyre's latest tour brought in Â£21million making him the world's most successful stand up comic . Back from the brink: Six years ago Michael McIntyre was in Â£30,000 of debt and close to bankruptcy . Still, the revenue generated by his success has to go somewhere, and the mortgage on his glorious home â all six bedrooms and three bathrooms of it â was paid off in full within a year. His company, Buddywaldo, files only abbreviated records to Companies House (wags might suggest his accounts could be a little late this year because the book-keepers are still counting the money), but documents for 2011 show profits of Â£1.1âmillion, with Â£1.6âmillion cash in the bank. These figures donât take into consideration a bumper 18 months, with that record-breaking tour, proceeds from his autobiography (for which he was reportedly paid a Â£2âmillion advance) and a lucrative contract with the BBC. Clearly, McIntyre works hard for his money, and that Â£21âmillion has not all gone into his bank account. It was undoubtedly a gross figure and doesnât take into account fees for venues, rehearsal costs, the travel and all the wages of all the people who work on the show. Such tours are very expensive to stage. After years of being on the breadline, he is haunted by the fear that the good times could end tomorrow. This awareness stems from a privileged childhood followed by those tough years in his 20s. The son of a Canadian comedy producer and one of Kenny Everettâs dancers, he grew up in a large home in Hampstead, not far from where he lives now, and was sent to Merchant Taylorsâ private school in Middlesex. Much loved: After years on the breadline, the hard-working comedian is haunted by the fear that the good times could all end tomorrow . But when his parents split up and his father hit hard times, he was sent to a state school and the house was sold. Thankfully, the young Michael was sheltered from economic reality by his wealthy and indulgent â yet highly eccentric â Hungarian grandmother. He went to Edinburgh University to read sciences, but dropped out to pursue a career in comedy. Unfortunately, his grandmother didnât approve of his choice of girlfriend and cut off his supply of funds. Undeterred, he went on to marry Kitty, despite failing to make it in stand-up. They borrowed Â£10,000 for a honeymoon in the Maldives, but he was barely able to half-fill the upstairs room in a pub. Earning a pittance, he must have regretted his previous profligacy. Forget dreams of a Ferrari. The couple shared a beaten-up old Mini before downgrading to the Austin Metro Princess (top speed 72mph). Staring into the abyss, McIntyre set up the spreadsheet he still uses â logging every penny earned and spent, and set about hauling the family out of debt. No stone was left unturned. He trawled supermarkets for bargains, comparing the cost of baked beans. Most importantly, he finally applied himself seriously to his career, which began to pick up. He switched agents to one of the biggest in the business â Addison Cresswell, who looks after Jonathan Ross and Jack Dee â who got him out of the clubs and on TV and, in particular, the Royal Variety Performance. Pragmatic: Michael McIntyre has moved to the same agent as friend Jonathan Ross, left, and enlisted the services of fitness guru Matt Roberts, right to stave off weight gain . Since then, he has worked tirelessly. His income is supplemented by a steady stream of lucrative corporate engagements (he can easily command Â£30,000 for trotting out an hour of material). His is very much a one-man show. He never hires writers, preferring to compile his own act, and using his wife as a guinea pig for jokes. Indeed, his family is a rich source of comic material, and he likes to tell tales of his wifeâs love of expensive handbags. Showman: Michael McIntyre was a judge on Britain's Got Talent alongside Amanda Holden, centre, and David Hasselhoff, right . One routine involves a story about her buying a Â£500 clutch bag. McIntyre jokes: âFor Â£500 I can hire a human being to walk alongside you holding your lipstick, your keys and your phone!â The gags, though, belie a deep financial caution. Friends say he is genuinely appalled by the price of designer handbags, and that no one in his family other than his adored wife would be allowed to get away with such profligacy. Nevertheless, one aberration was the new four-wheel-drive Porsche. Perhaps such indulgences can be forgiven in a man who, for all his wealth, retains a self-effacing and modest nature. For example, a photographer who took a picture of McIntyre in the street recently was met with a broad smile, a trademark giggle and the comic saying: âI feel like Madonna, having the paparazzi chasing me.â But that nagging fear of failure means even though he has the millionaire lifestyle, he cannot slow down. He admits to having what he calls âcatastrophic thinkingâ â an incurable fear of âeverything going wrongâ. This keeps him touring, despite those weeks away from his family while on the road. In a recent interview, he publicly apologised to his sons âfor leaving them so muchâ, while in the next breath admitting: âI canât retire.â He has no ambitions to go into acting, but identifies Billy Connolly, 70, as his role model because of the longevity of the Scottish comedianâs career. Who knows, perhaps when Michael McIntyre reaches 70 himself, he might feel sufficiently confident of financial solvency to buy that long-lusted-after Ferrari. Perhaps.","Michael McIntyre's last tour made him the world's most successful comic .

But it seems blondes do indeed have more fun. So much more, in fact, that their careers are now suffering. Britain's leading facial mapping team . has revealed just how important looks are when it comes to success in . the workplace, and it seems having fair hair doesn't actually fare all . that well. Blondes have too much fun: Fair-haired ladies such as Holly Willoughby, left, and Mollie King, right, are less likely to succeed at work, according to the new study . Brunette success: Women with straight dark hair like Kim Kardashian, left, and Pippa Middleton, right, are destined for more success in the workplace, according to new research . The research team, led by the UK's leading facial mapping expert Dr Chris Solomon, was tasked with analysing the facial features we associate with success and leadership in the workplace, and the results found that those with straight dark hair are considered most likely to succeed. Respondents ranked faces in terms of perceived business acumen and leadership qualities, taking into account a range of facial features such as the shape, size and position of the head, eyes, lips and overall symmetry. The findings revealed that the shape . of the male jaw line is a key metric when it comes to perceived . leadership qualities; indeed we associate 'hyper' leaders with having a . very strong jaw line. Conversely, faces which get narrower . towards the jaw line were perceived as weaker and less credible. Face for success: The research found that David Cameron, left, and Nick Clegg, right, have a perfect face for success . Interestingly, Steve Jobs and Peter Jones were cited as business leaders who fit the leader profile, and David Cameron and Nick Clegg most closely match the 'leadership at work' prototypes. Future leadership hopeful and current Major of London Boris Johnson scored lower for his down-turned eyes and fleshy jawline. For Boris, however, the face for success is not . too far out of reach. Based on average UK plastic surgery prices, the . London Mayor would need to spend Â£11,847 on plastic surgery to fit the . hyper-leader model. Ed Milliband, meanwhile, may want to consider removing the dark rings under his eyes which are associated with unsuccessful people in the workplace. But Ed's facial-altering work might be a little more costly: experts estimate that he would have to part . with Â£13,869, which would include rhinoplasty surgery (nose shaping), a . chin implant, eye lid bag removal surgery and a brow lift to improve his . physical hyper-leader qualities. Work needed: It seems that Ed Milliband, left, and Boris Johnson, right, need some extra work done if they want to progress in their political career . Steve North, General Manager of TV channel Dave who commissioned the research, said: 'We all know that first impressions count but this is the first time that a study has actually delved into the facial traits that help us make those decisions. 'The results are fascinating and make for depressing reading for the likes of Ed Milliband and Boris Johnson who may want to consider a little cosmetic work before their next election campaigns.â The study was carried out to celebrate the start of the second series of Suits, on Dave, Thursdays 9pm .","Certain facial traits are associated with success and leadership .

Early this morning Williams posted a picture of her hugely swollen right ankle on Twitter - an injury she picked up in her first round match - aggravated in her three-set loss to Sloane Stephens. Angry: A frustrated Serena Williams crashed out of the Australian Open yesterday, right. She complained of injuries after the match and posted a picture of a very swollen right ankle on Twitter this morning, left . What a racket: Serena Williams created a scene breaking her racket as she lost the Australian Open quarter-final to Sloane Stephens. It emerged she was badly injured . The tennis ace also went on to suffer a back injury in the match against the upcoming 19-year-old fellow American. So when she was caught on a court-side microphone muttering the contest had been 'the worst two weeks' and she was ultimately fined $1,500 for smashing her racket - it was more than a world-champion sized tantrum. Last night the star tweeted her fans with the image of the nasty injury simply entitled: 'Ouch!' She was outplayed by the 19-year-old in the quarter-finals losing 6-3, 5-7, 4-6. 'I've had a tough two weeks between the ankle ... and my back, which started hurting,' she said after the game. 'A lot of stuff.'

'I'm almost relieved that it's over,' she added. 'I've been thrown a lot of (curve) balls these two weeks.' And it appears she wasn't making up her misery just to save face following her first loss since August 17.

However, unlike her opponents, Stephens, who now moves up to 17 in the WTA rankings is feeling good - even in spite of her loss. 'I'm obviously coming out of the Australian summer with amazing momentum, knowing I can pretty much hang in there with anybody and even beat some of the best players,'' she said.

Sepp Blatter has said England will stay in the shadow of Europe's elite unless influx of foreign players is brought under control . England will stay in the shadow of Europe's elite unless the influx of foreign players to the Premier League is brought under control, the FIFA president has said. Sepp Blatter is adamant the national team will fail to develop if managers keep looking abroad for players. He believes England are significantly in the shadow of Spain, Italy and Germany - and so will therefore never win a World Cup unless the buying of players from overseas is limited. He is however impressed with how the Barclays Premier League has been marketed and sold around the world. Mr . Blatter was speaking during a wide-ranging interview with Special . Report on Sky Sports News, in which he tackled subjects including . racism, future World Cups and the possibility of being succeeded by . Michel Platini. He said: âI . donât think the Premier League is too global (but) you have too many . foreigners and not (enough) English players, so your national team is . not yet at the level of these national teams. âIf you look to Spain, Italy and . Germany, you realise 80 per cent or even more of the players of the . national team play in their own league.â Mr Blatter, who confirmed that goalline . technology will be trialled during this summerâs Confederations Cup, . called for clubs whose fans racially abuse players to be docked points. âA more radical solution would be deduction of points,â said Mr Blatter. âDeduction would have a better impact. To have a match played without spectators is a warning. You can never solve a problem by running away.' The England team pictured during the Euros in 2012 . England's striker Wayne Rooney, England's midfielder Steven Gerrard and England's defender John Terry as they lost 4-1 against Germany in the 2010 World Cup . England was once one of the most fancied teams when entering into the World cup but betting odds this time round suggest otherwise. Betfair odds for England winning the cup in 2014 are 25:1 - relatively poor compared to previous years. The national team appears to have been on the decline for a while now, with most of the so-called 'Golden Generation' having retired from international football. England will take a new generation of players to the Brazil World Cup in 2014 and it is thought the team would do well to reach the Quarter Finals. In 1990 England did well, making it to the Semi Final but being eliminated on penalties against West Germany. But in 1994 the team did not even qualify. In 1998 the team were eliminated on penalties against Argentina in the first Knockout Round. They did better in 2001, where they made it to the Quarter Final but lost 2-1 again Brazil. Again in 2006 they made it to the Quarter Final but were eliminated on penalties against Portugal. 2010 saw an embarrassing 4-1 defeat against Germany in the Second Round. The team have so far had a shaky start in Group H, showing the road to Rio is set to be an uphill struggle. England drew with the Ukraine in September and drew again with Poland in October. They still have to play San Marino, Montenegro and Moldova and only group winners progress to the finals. The eight best runners-up from the nine Europe groups - according to all their matches except for games against the sixth-placed team in their group - play off for the four remaining spots.","Sepp Blatter claimed England will stay in the shadow of Europe's elite .

A California woman has turned to activism nearly a decade after she was held against her will in the world's most unforgiving industry by the two people who should have been shielding her from danger. Minh Dang, 28, says she was just 10 years old when she was taken to a brothel for the first time by her parents, who would then leave her there for days - and sometimes weeks. She says the pattern of mistreatment began when she was as young as three years old as she was subjected to physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her father. Victimized: Minh Dang says she was just 10 years old when she was taken to a brothel for the first time by her parents, who would then leave her there for days - and sometimes weeks . The woman claimed that her parents worked together, collecting money while their daughter worked as a child prostitute. Ms Dang told NBC Bay Area: 'They actually recruited people, so my mom placed ads in Vietnamese newspapers and magazines.' 'My dad took me to these businesses, they were cafes, and they were fronts for brothels. He would take me to brothels and leave me there for weeks on end, and brothels sell children for sex so that was my job while I was there.' While her parents pimped her out by . night, she excelled as a student by day, earning high marks and . excelling on the soccer team in Los Altos, California - keeping her dark . side a secret. Dark secret: While her parents pimped her out by night, she excelled as a student by day, earning high marks and excelling on the soccer team in Los Altos, California . Her gym teacher, Bonny Ellegood, told NBC Bay Area: 'She went above and beyond in everything she did,' Ms Ellegood said. Ms Dang added: 'My choir and orchestra teacher in . middle school thought something was up, but I donât think could have . guessed this was up because I was a straight-A student, I wasnât your . typical delinquent kid.' After high school, the hold her parents had on her life continued even as she attended college at Berkley - but it wasn't long before she escaped from their grasp. Ms Dang told the station: 'The first two years I was going to college but was still enslaved. I was still being sold by my parents. Then they paid my final bill for college, and thatâs when I cut all ties with them, that I would contact the police if they contacted me again, and then that was it.' Hostage: Ms Dang was sent to brothels when she was 10, but the pattern of abuse began when she was as young as three years old . NBC Bay Area was able to track down Ms Dang's mother at her nail salon in Mountain View. While she refused to appear on camera, she rejected her daughters claims, saying that she never sold her daughter into the sex trade. Today, Ms Dang works alongside Jada Pinkett-Smith - an outspoken advocate against sex trafficking - and the actress' non-profit Don't Sell Bodies. Reuters reported earlier this month the age range for girls sold into sex slavery has become younger and younger because of the global economic crisis, and may have become worse due to the poor economy. About 21 million people - or three out of 1,000 people globally - are in forced labor, meaning they have been coerced or deceived into jobs which they cannot leave, figures released by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) this year showed. Allies: Ms Dang now works alongside actress Jada Pinkett Smith, seen testifying before a congressional committee on human trafficking . The ILO said about 4.5 million of these, mainly women and girls, were victims of sexual exploitation and overall the human trafficking trade was estimated to be worth $32billion a year. Ruchira Gupta, founder of Indian charity Apne Aap Women Worldwide, said: 'We are seeing the number rise in these 10 red light districts while the age of the girls is falling.' Gupta added that the average age of female prostitutes in India was between nine and 13. 'We need to invest more in girls and women so that there are options other than prostitution, organ trade, or [becoming] child soldiers.' While the ILO figures suggested modern-day slavery has risen to a record level, the data came with the caveat that it was hard to estimate numbers as victims were often scared to come forward and there was a lack of records in most countries. Rising poverty was blamed for driving more women into the sex industry against their will. David Batstone, president and co-founder of anti-trafficking organization Not For Sale, said the global financial crisis as well as political instability created vulnerable communities at risk of exploitation.

While she may not consider herself a fashionista yet, she is certainly doing a good job of brushing up on her knowledge from the front row of many prestigious shows. 'I really like Stella McCartney, obviously. She did such a great job at the Olympics and she's been very helpful for finding things when I've had events, she has always helped me out. 'I went to Stella's Paris show last season; that was pretty exciting,' she said. And it seems that Stella isn't her only fashionable friend. 'I'm . a big fan of Paul Smith and he's a big cycling fan.

As pretty as a flower: Victoria looked stunning in her shoot today but says she prefers brogues and 'manly' buttoned up shirts . With her grueling Olympic training and . Strictly sessions long behind her, she is using her time to catch up on . some much-needed retail therapy, which she describes as 'a whole new world'. While we were most accustomed to seeing . her in tight Lycra or glitzy Strictly dresses, Victoria considers her . signature style to be a little more mainstream and practical, counting . her favourite high street shops as Whistles and Zara.

Glitz and glam: She loved wearing the glitzy dresses on the Strictly dance floor but maintains that brogues and shirts are more her signature style . Talking about her personal style she said: 'I don't know if . it sounds quite masculine and androgynous but I do like brogues and . buttoned up shirts - that's the kind of thing I like and I feel very comfortable . dressed like that. 'I'd like to wear lots of girly things but I never feel like it's me so I probably dress a little bit more practically.' She did have a chance to embrace her inner girly side on the dance floor in Strictly Come Dancing, and while she may have been the seventh contestant to leave the show and fast became notorious for her tearful outbursts, she maintains that she loved her time on the show. 'It was a wonderful experience and I really . enjoyed it. I . loved wearing the glitzy dresses. It was really nice to wear something that is so far from . what you'd normally wear. But you wouldn't go out on a Saturday night dressed like . that! 'It was really fun to dress up. I loved dressing up as a kid, my . nanny used to make me skirts and sparkly stuff so how could you not . enjoy that?' And with many of her fellow Olympians . such as Jessica Ennis and Louis Smith voicing their dreams of launching a . fashion line, Victoria has had a very similar brainwave. 'I . would love to start a fashion line. I would really like to start with . women's cyclewear because I think there's not a lot of stuff out there . to choose from in terms of functional sports wear.' For now, Victoria's latest project is launching the Royal Ascot 2013 campaign 'The Colour and the Glory'. Sporting . a hat by Philip Treacy and dress by designer, Emilia Wickstead - . Victoria braved the cold elements in a stunning photo shoot that . celebrates classic British style and fashion. Her trim body is the result of her new found hobby: running. 'I started running, I've never been . allowed to run before because it's banned. With cycling you don't . run in case of damaging tendons or getting injured. 'I run with my dogs . and I'm really enjoying it. I know it sounds really sad but the freedom of . being able to do it is just so enjoyable,' she said. Big spender: Her favourite high street stores are Whistles and Zara and when she has a splurge, she loves Paul Smith . Front row: She is a regular front row attendee and loved her time in Paris at Stella McCartney's spring/summer 13 show . Speaking about being a part of Royal Ascot, she said: 'I was absolutely thrilled to be asked to take part in the shoot today, and I am a big fan of Emilia Wickstead and Philip Treacy. 'I have always loved Royal Ascot and have been several times, itâs one of the most exciting events of the summer social season and I was lucky enough to be asked to present the trophy for The Britannia Stakes a few years ago.

Its idyllic landscape of rolling fields and poplar-lined hills have proved irresistible to the great, the good and the very rich. But in recent months the gentle vistas of Tuscany have become home to a savage predator - packs of marauding wolves which are growing increasingly brazen. Politicians in Chianti-country have warned that attacks are now reaching 'crisis levels' and have called on the government to take action. There are growing fears that the wolves could attack humans. Antonio Gambetta Vianna, a local councillor, has called for a task force to be sent in to tackle the packs. 'The last three attacks have occurred in broad daylight and near . homes and farming buildings,' he said. 'This shows that the wolves no longer . afraid of anything.' European wolves are growing in numbers as illegal hunting by farmers has become less common . Any attacks on humans are likely to put people off visiting the area, he added. The wolves have been driven down from the Appennine mountains because of the unusually cold weather. Packs have struck livestock in the . regionâs picturesque hills and vales once a week for the last two . months, with the feral animals seemingly fearless in approaching . livestock and farm buildings, . Some strikes have occurred in broad . daylight in areas around Sienna, Lucca and the Val d'Orcia incidating wolves have lost their innate fear of man. Tuscany is home to a large number of British expats and receives an estimated 40million tourists every year. It has also attracted a number of famous faces as a holiday destination including Sting, Mick Jagger, Queen Beatrix of Holland, the Duchess of York and most famously Tony Blair. The former Prime Minister was given the nickname 'Tuscan Tony' after his frequent visits to the region. Maurizio Forriero of Lucca Forestry . Commission said: âNumbers of wolves have been on the rise spontaneously, . without any help from humans. âIn the past when it was in competition with man there was a lot of illegal hunting but this has decreased. But when its cold and there is a lot of snow it is hard for them to find food so they come down from the mountains.' Rolling hills: The stunning landscape of Tuscany lures millions of tourists every year . A number of famous faces are known to have enjoyed stays in Tuscany, which is home to a large number of British expats, including singer Sting and former Prime Minister Tony Blair . As . this monthâs heavy snowfall has driven their usual prey including wild . boar and hares down into the lowlands the wolves have followed. The . latest strike, in Garfagnana near Lucca over the weekend left the . unmistakeable footprints of four feral predators in the snow. The shepherd had witnessed the slaughter from a distance but decided it was too dangerous to intervene. Alberto . Focacci, of the Italian Farmers Confederation in Lucca, said that . wolves had never before ventured so low into the valleys in this part of . Tuscany. He added: âThe seriousness of the situation should not be . underestimatedâ In the past, wolves have been known to savage shepherds that get between the predator and the flock. Wolves were reintroduced to Tuscany from the mountains of the Abruzzo in the 1990s, using EU funding. They have since been growing in numbers, as illegal hunting by farmers has become less common and there are now an estimated 230 in Tuscany . Wolf attacks are responsible for 1000 sheep, cattle and horses killed last year, according to official figures.","Attacks in areas popular with British holidaymakers including Sienna, Lucca and the Val d'Orcia .

Mark Dyer, 49, was wearing just a rolled up T-shirt and no trousers when he was spotted by a mother pushing her daughter along in a pushchair at a roundabout. He shocked passersby as he travelled near the castle but was spared jailed today despite his exhibitionism after claiming in his defence he saw it as a way of 'expressing himself'. Mark Dyer drove around Royal Windsor, pictured, naked from the waist down and a mother and child saw him and were distressed by the incident . Dyer, who had three previous convictions for similar offences, looked shame-faced as he appeared in the dock before Judge Angela Morris. Prosecutor Tetteh Turkson told the judge sitting at Reading Crown Crown Court that on December 7, Dyer was convicted by a jury of indecent exposure. Balding Dyer was not wearing trousers - only a rolled up T-shirt - when he exposed himself as he drove along Datchet Road in Windsor, Berkshire, on April 4 last year. Neil Ross, defending, said his client was 'mortified' by his actions. 'He has a son, who lives with him. He (the defendant) is supporting him after his son lost his job,' he said. 'He is mortified by what has happened. He saw it as a way of expressing himself.' The barrister said Dyer had written a letter to the victim about the incident. However, it was unclear if he had apologised for his behaviour or if she had actually received it through the legal channels. Judge Morris told the hearing: 'This is perfectly legitimate in society but it depends how it is exposed and where it is exposed. Prosecutor Tetteh Turkson told the judge sitting at Reading Crown Crown Court, pictured, that on December 7, Dyer was convicted by a jury of indecent exposure . 'This is the fourth time you have been convicted of a like offence. 'You have to take the repercussions of your actions and understand about the effect this behaviour will have on other people. 'This was in public and caused alarm and distress,' she said. However, Judge Morris decided not to send the father-of-one to prison. 'If any incident of this type happens in the future I have no doubt that the sentencing court will take a different view,' she told Dyer. 'If you repeat this you will go to prison.' Judge Morris handed Dyer a four-month custodial sentence, which she suspended for 18 months. Dyer will serve a supervision requirement order for 18 months and take part in a Thames Valley Police sex offenders' programme on a one-to-one basis with a specially trained officer. He will also have to sign onto the Sex Offenders' Register and pay Â£1,000 pounds towards court costs. He was given 12 months to pay the amount. Dressed in a smart black suit, blue shirt and tie, Dyer of The Chantrys, Farnham, Surrey, quickly left court after learning his fate without making any comment.","Mark Dyer, 49, was wearing no trousers when a mother and child saw him ."

But Alice Pyne's final dream came true after her parents made a 'terrifying' late-night decision to fly her abroad. Alice flew to Canada to go whale watching and tick off her last bucket list wish. Dream come true: Alice, right, who is dying of cancer, is pictured with her mother Vicky and younger sister Milly . Holiday snaps: Alice made a pilgrimage to Vancouver and went out on a boat to see the whales . The 16-year-old, who has a white blood cell cancer called Hodgkins lymphoma, made a pilgrimage to Vancouver and stood on the brow of a boat surrounded by orcas and humpbacks. She said the trip was 'the best holiday ever'. Her parents, Vicky and Simon Pyne, took on the 11-hour flight abroad - after a sleepless night of worry - to allow Alice to complete her list of achievements. Mrs Pyne said their consultant advised them not to travel abroad, but added: 'If you are to go, go quickly.' Brave: Alice with Nicole Mackay who convinced her parents to take her to Canada despite the cost and impossibility of insurance. It was Alice's dream to see whales. She is pictured right with sister Milly . Nature: After 45 minutes on the water Alice and her family were surrounded by 25 orca and humpback whales . 'We thought it was too risky, it was too far,' added Mrs Pyne.

The following day they met Nicole and her father Bill MacKay, who run MacKay Whale Watching. Alice's family stepped on to a boat and, after 45 minutes on the water, they were surrounded by 25 orca and humpback whales. Alice said: 'They were huge. I couldn't believe I was there. This was something I've always wanted to do. I wanted to see them in the wild and I loved the way they moved in the water.' They spent five hours on the water, allowing Alice, of Ulverston, Cumbria, time to watch the whales rolling and playing around their vessel, as well as watching sea lions and dolphins. She said: 'When I made my bucket list I never expected it to be published to the whole world - so I didn't expect to tick off the last item - I didn't even expect to get the majority of my wishes fulfilled. 'Words can't really explain it but I'm so happy it is done. 'There was a point where I was on the back of the boat and a whale came up two metres away from me. It was about 25 foot long and just amazing. 'I always said you should take a few risks and there is no part of me that thinks this was a bit of a risk. What was the worst that could happen? More people should feel the same way.' She told fans on her blog: 'I don't think about it all too much as they didn't think I'd be here 18 months ago and I could waste the life I've got just thinking about it all.' Her mother added: 'A year ago we weren't brave enough to make the trip - we wouldn't have dreamed of it - but we knew it was now or never and we might have lived a long life of regret after Alice is gone if we didn't grab the opportunity.' Inspiring: Alice pictured with her beloved dog Mable last year. She encouraged people to take risks in life . Popular: Alice has thousands of fans since she started her blog and keeps it updated with her challenges . She was recognised by fans of her blog at Manchester Airport, in a cafe at Telegraph Cove where they were taken on a millionaire's yacht and invited on a helicopter ride across the rivers and waterfalls. Alice's bucket list, which went viral online and has now been viewed by around four million people, led to her meeting Prime Minister David Cameron in July, last year, to discuss how to help people suffering cancer. She has campaigned tirelessly to raise awareness of the need for more bone marrow donors. She has now battled her condition for five years and set up the charity Alice's Escapes, this year, to provide holidays for seriously ill children.",Alice Pyne flew to Canada to go whale watching against doctor's advice .

Older people are increasingly turning to e-readers and tablets to indulge their love of literature, according to research . They may be developing their own shades of grey. But Britainâs older generations are far from technophobic when it comes to reading. Nearly one in three over-55s now owns anÂ  e-reader, research reveals. Mums, dads, grannies and grandads are increasingly demonstrating that while technology is widely regarded as the domain of the young, in fact digital books are replacing or supplementing traditional ones in the homes of savvy seniors. Many are discovering thereâs nothing quite like settling down in front of a nice warm Kindle Fire, or putting their feet up with an iPad. According to research by Mintel consumer analysts, 29 per cent of those aged 55 and above now own a digital book reader, compared with just 22 per cent of the younger generation. Older women embracing the digital age are particularly fond of the devices, with 31 per cent owning one. That may also have something to do with 50 Shades Of Grey, the publishing phenomenon which began life as an e-book. The findings fly in the face of assumptions that only youngsters can conquer the complexities of technological wizardry, or that oldies would never abandon proper books. Paul Davies, of Mintel, said: âOver-55s are the keenest readers across all formats of books (paperback, hardback and digital) â bar audiobooks. âThe popularity of e-readers in this age group is related to the fact that the digital book is designed specifically to cater for an activity in which they are the keenest participants.â Or, to put it another way, e-readers probably appeal to granny because she can enlarge the text, and will never lose her place in a book again. But donât get the idea that the older generation is fearlessly spearheading a silver surfer revolution. One in four admits to needing a youngster to teach them how to use new technology. Kindle technology has evolved dramatically since its launch in 2007 . And owning a smartphone? That, apparently, is a whole new chapter. âThe majority continue to have no immediate need for one,â Mr Davies said. Amazon launched the first successful e-reader, the Kindle, in November 2007. It used a low power âe-inkâ display that had no visibility problems in sunlight. The technology has since evolved and many tablets, such as the Kindle Fire, combine an e-reader with the ability to play music and films and browse the internet.","Nearly one in three over-55s own an iPad, Kindle Fire or similar .

Down through the generations, there has always been a special place for the gals from one particular family tree. First there was grandmama, supremely elegant in an off-the-shoulder dress and full-length pearl necklace. Then came mother, hand in loving hand with the man she was betrothed to marry. Auntie Georgina would make an appearance a little while afterwards. A sophisticated 'girl in pearls'... Miss Eliza Lawson, from Gloucestershire, has continued a long family tradition by being the cover girl of Country Life magazine . ... who also likes to kiss the girls and hug her beau, as seen on Facebook . Eliza exchanges a kiss with another girl in a photo unlikely to grace the pages of Country Life . The 21-year-old pulls silly faces with a male friend on her social networking site page . A kiss for Prince Charles, the cardboard cut-out variety . So perhaps there was a certain inevitability that one day, just like her forebears and relatives, 21-year-old Miss Eliza Lawson would also grace the most famous single page in publishing â the frontispiece of Country Life magazine. How perfect she looks, blue eyes sparkling brightly, furry collar against the autumn chill, sunlight bathing a flawless complexion. But peek behind the affectionately named âGirls in Pearlsâ slot of the 115-year-old magazine, and â golly gosh â how times have changed. Left: Eliza's grandmother, Pamela Rowcliffe, later Lady Newall, began the family tradition back in 1956. The Hon Miranda Newall and fiance Timothy Lawson - Eliza's parents - in a Country Life from 1985 . For despite the magazineâs boast that . its frontispiece has become âa matchless pictorial social historyâ, an . equally celebrated social chronicle â Facebook â tells a rather . different story through Elizaâs own page. And itâs more than just the pearls that have moved with the times. It shows her hugging her boyfriend... looking a little perky with a drink or cigarette in her hand... having fun on holiday... and clearly enjoying college life with her companions â both male and female. In other words, a thoroughly modern portrait of a 21st century gal. In the current edition of Country Life, Eliza admits to feeling âa certain amount of pressureâ to appear as a girl in pearls, albeit only with pearl earrings, but also calls it âa real honourâ. Eliza's aunt, Miss Georgina Lee, posed for the magazine in 1998 . In 1985 her mother, the Hon Miranda Jane Newall, was pictured beside her fiance Timothy Lawson, later to become Elizaâs father, on their engagement that November. Thirteen years later her aunt, Georgina Lee, would grace the page too. But it was Elizaâs grandmother, then Miss Pamela Elizabeth Rowcliffe, who started the tradition in 1956 on her engagement to Captain the Hon Francis Storer Eaton Newall, later Baron Newall, son of the former Marshal of the RAF. An ex-Tory backbencher and Eton and Sandhurst educated chairman of the Greyhound Racing Board, Lord Newall was the brains behind Tops, the Turfed Out Peers Society, with a vision for a blue-blooded âthink-tankâ of hereditary peers expelled from the Lords. Eliza, from Fairford, Gloucestershire, studied for an executive PA diploma at Oxford Media and Business School. In an article accompanying her Frontispiece debut, the magazine explains: âAs the status of Country Life woman changed, we began to divulge more about their lives: their ages, schools, universities, engagements and careers...â Still a little less, perhaps, than Eliza divulges on her publicly accessible Facebook page. We learn that she is âin a relationshipâ, and can see a picture of the lucky chap, a young beau called Tom. Her âlikesâ include an Oxford nightclub. Meanwhile in Country Life, Lady Newall says: âItâs really lovely that generations of the same family, years apart, can appear on the same page, marking similar stages in their lives.â Quite so.

The scan showed two little boys facing seemingly impossible odds â conjoined twins given virtually no hope of life. Doctors told Angie Benhaffaf that even if one survived, the other could die soon after. In her bleakest, darkest moments, she struggled to overcome the thought that she would have to bury her babies. Two little fighters: Now aged three, Hassan (left) and Hussein love to whizz around on their toy cars . Now, after a remarkable operation to separate them, her âlittle fightersâ as she calls them have become... well... inseparable. Three years on, the bond between Hassan and Hussein is so strong they still hold hands when they sleep, just as they did when they were attached. Even when they sit together, they usually adopt the same left and right positions that once enjoined them as one from chest to pelvis. These days though, they are two distinct individuals. And, as their mother will tell you, two little handfuls of trouble. The twins are constantly whizzing around on their toy cars, scrambling up the stairs or tumbling around on the floor with their big sisters. Conjoined: Hassan, left, and Hassan before they were separated in February 2010 . Meanwhile both are making giant strides in their battle to walk with the aid of newly-fitted prosthetic legs, plus specially designed frames on wheels. âThereâs obviously a bit of competitiveness between them and theyâre pretty fearless,â said Angie, 38. âItâs lovely to see.â One of each boyâs legs is prosthetic, and Angie said the way the twins were joined meant they âshared just about everythingâ â including their liver and the pericardium sac membrane surrounding their hearts. But despite the risks, surgeons were able to separate them without life-threatening consequences. The boysâ gift of life was made possible by the brilliance of medical teams at Londonâs University College Hospital, where they were born, and at nearby Great Ormond Street Hospital, where the 14-hour operation to separate them was performed when they were six months old. An ITV documentary filmed Angie kissing each of her conjoined babies goodbye and telling them she loved them before she tearfully handed them over to the surgical team. Thanks to that operation, the twins recently celebrated their third birthday (with two cakes, not one). But when Angie and her Algerian-born husband Azzedine gathered with their daughters around the Christmas tree, Angie performed a solemn and deeply emotional task. Big sisters: The twin boys are adored by Iman, aged five (left), and eight-year-old Malika . Parents: Azzedine and Angie Benhaffaf said the boys are their 'little miracles' Two weeks before the boys were born in December 2009, she bought two small teddy bear ornaments and had âHassan and Hussein, 2009â inscribed on them. Weeping, she told me: âThe doctors had warned us it was highly unlikely they would survive the birth. In my heart, I realised there was a possibility we would be burying them at Christmas. âI thought if they do die, Iâd put the ornaments on the tree every year. That way, weâd still haveÂ  them with us in memory. âItâs really painful but every year, thatâs what I have done, just to remember how many times we nearly lost them both. âNow I look at the two of them, and see how happy they are, and feel so very grateful just to have them. We see them as our little miracles. When we are all together in this house, thatâs all that really matters.â The boysâ sisters Malika, eight, and Iman, five, both adore their little brothers and barely seem to notice their disability. Azzedine, 40, gave up his job as a chef to care for the family at home in County Cork in the Republic of Ireland, and is looking forward to walking the boys to school when they start in September. Experts have said they have an unusually high IQ. But more surgery looms in the coming new year, and Angie says: âThey still have a lot of hurdles ahead of them. But theyâve brought magic into our home, and something special into our lives.â","Hassan and Hussein Benhaffaf were given virtually no hope of life .

Their coats are so soft it is like stroking silk. By the time they've grown up, however, things will have changed dramatically for this landmark litter of Bergamasco puppies. For soon, they will look just like mum and dad. And that means spending the rest of their lives like a pile of raggedy old mop-heads sewn together on legs. Which, it transpires, is precisely what nature intended. Landmark: Chris Walker's dog Ella gave birth to a litter of 13 Bergamasco puppies - a record . 'Bob Marley': Bergamasco puppy Winston, left, and its siblings all have silky soft fur now, but when they are fully grown their fur will resemble dreadlocks just like this adult Bergamasco, right . The rare breed was originally used to safeguard sheep in the Italian Alps. That coat might bear an uncanny resemblance to the one Rolling Stone Brian Jones famously sported in the 1960s, but up there in the mountains, it just as essential a part of the dog's wardrobe as a fleece is to a lamb. Not only does it keep Bergamascos warm and dry, it camouflages them against the terrain. Unique: Puppy Marshmallow, left, will soon develop the dreadlocks, seen right, that protect Bergamascos - originally used to safeguard sheep in the Italian Alps - against predators like snakes . Rare: The litter of Bergamasco pups are seen at feeding time . The unique dreadlocks â far more Bob Marley than Bob Martin - are matted so tightly they also protect against predators such as snakes, which struggle to penetrate the six-inch long felts. Okay, so it makes them look a little like living compost heaps, or a character out of the Muppets. But the lucky 13 born two months ago to the splendidly named:Â  Ella av Villrosebakken of Calshair (that's her in the black outfit) are ambassadors for an important new generation of the breed. There were estimated to be only around 30 dogs in the UK, and no guarantee that they would endure in this country. Even with less stringent 'pet passport' restrictions on bringing dogs into Britain, it can still take years to import one. Record: Bergamascos like Itchy (front) and Joel love children and are highly protective towards them . Snug: Two of the sleepy puppies stretch and yawn in a basket . Baker's dozen: Chris Walker gives puppy Isabel a peck - Ms Walker's dog Ella increased the UK population of Bergamascos by almost 50 per cent with her litter of 13 . There is currently a three to four year waiting list of hopefuls waiting to pay around Â£1,000 a pup, and some have already given up. Then along came Ella's remarkable baker's dozen â the first UK litter for at least six years. It was a record breaking achievement that increased the population by nearly 50 per cent at a stroke. 'When we looked at the scan of Ella we could tell there were five in the womb, maybe six,' said proud owner Mrs Chris Walker. 'When she gave birth, the first puppy was breeched. After that, they just kept on coming. No-one ever expected 13. I feel very honoured.' Plans to mate Chris's other bitch, Biaga, were thwarted by medical difficulties, so she now acts as auntie to the pups. Instead, the 13 were the product of a mating between Ella and the magnificent Jude, owned by breeder and Bergamasco expert Reyna Knight. At present they have the run of a large, oak-beamed conservatory at Chris's barn-conversion home on the edge of Plymouth, Devon, which she shares with the dogs and her surgeon husband Alasdair. On the prowl: There is a waiting list of between three and four years for a Bergamasco like Elizabeth . Playful: Homes are gradually being found for the 13 adorable puppies . Distinctive: Sunshine, who has light brown fur with black patches, plays in the garden . When we arrive the puppies are sleeping. Not for long though. Several seem to find my leather boots irresistible to eat (although not as attractive as photographer Lucy Ray'sÂ  ponytail, which seldom has fewer than two puppies chewing it as she gets down to their level with a camera). Trying to line up 13 puppies proves to be as easy as balancing 13 rugby balls end-up on a slope. Every time you think you've got one in place, it tumbles off somewhere else. The one Chris calls Cheeky delights in living up to her name. Marshmallow, also known as Adolf (he has one undescended testicle) likes to eat cameras. Itchy (he scratches) has gone behind a screen for a poo. Several hours later, as the pups get sleepy, photographing them becomes marginally easier, although it's still nothing short of chaos. Meanwhile mum and auntie are doing flying carpet impersonations in a field as they bound off for a walk. Soon, however, peace will descend once again in the Walker household. Adult: Plans to mate Ms Walker's other bitch, Biaga, were thwarted by medical difficulties, so the dreadlocked dog now acts as 'auntie' to the pups . Shaggy: Impressive adult Bergamasco Biaga jumps for a ball, displaying its dreadlocks to full effect . The puppies are gradually being found homes. One will go a trainee minister in Scotland; he plans to take the dog with him on pastoral visits to his flock. Another is heading for a family with an autistic son. Bergamascos love children and are highly protective towards them. A third is earmarked for a woman who loves dogs but is allergic to them. She discovered she is completely immune to the Bergamasco's unique coat after spending the day with Biaga, Ella and her litter. And the next generation of Bermascos? That's clearly going to be another chapter in what could, with luck, be a long running shaggy dog story.","Until this litter there were only 30 Bergamasco dogs in Britain .

Answer: Pretty much anywhere you damn well like, actually. Unless, of course, you fancy descending upon the otherwise untroubled environs of rural England in search of tasty morsels such as cats, poodles, gardeners...

Booking Compass House for the week ending Saturday March 23 costs Â£889. A few hours after they close the doors and prepare it for the next arrivals, however, the price rises instantly to a Â£2,899. The huge rise applies all through the Easter school holidays before jumping again to a staggering Â£4,499 for the peak weeks of July and August. Only out-of-season periods see rates fall â to a special-offer Â£670, if you happen to have booked it for a week beginning from today.

"By . Paul Harris . PUBLISHED: . 13:33 EST, 4 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:30 EST, 4 January 2013 . Daphne Oxenford, former BBC presenter for Listen With Mother, has died at the age of 93. The presenter and actress became the voice behind 15 minutes of magic for a generation of children during the 1950s and 60s. They sat eagerly around the wireless to hear her familiar opening words: 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.' Listen with me: Daphne Oxenford on Listen With Mother on BBC radio which shot her to fame . Iconic: Daphne Oxenford, actress and presenter was the voice for BBC radio show Listen With Mother . Daphne Oxenford - a perfect balance between no-nonsense matron and kindly aunt - went on to enthral around a million juvenile listeners every weekday, simply by telling a story or introducing a song. So perhaps the greatest compliment to the lifelong actress and voiceover queen was that scores of adults, who recognised her at various stages during a long and varied career, were delighted to tell her: 'I grew up with you!' Yesterday the BBC announced that the voice had finally fallen silent. Daphne died peacefully at the age of 93, her family said. To anyone who didn't grow up in the 1950s and 60s it is difficult to explain how such a basic formula captivated huge swathes of the nation for 15 minutes after lunch, slotted in before mum finished the washing up and sat down to Woman's Hour at 2pm. But television was still in its infancy - and a narrated tale of animals, cars or some fantastical adventure was entertainment enough for all those comfortably-seated youngsters. It didn't last, of course. Life of acting: Ms Oxenford on 1990s television series 'Land of Hope and Gloria' The show, which Daphne presented for . two decades from its first broadcast in 1950, was eventually shunted . into an obscure slot with a different format and presenters, and . inevitably fell victim to TV. A petition signed by high profile fans such as John Cleese, Harry . Secombe, Glenda Jackson and Alan Ayckbourn failed to save it from the . chop when it went out with a whimper, and a tiny audience of fewer than . 40,000, in 1982. Few may . have realised, however, that Daphne enthusiastically embraced the . future. The acting school graduate and former wartime ENSA entertainer . appeared in early episodes of Coronation Street (as spinster Esther . Hayes); and later in The Sweeney, Man About The House and Heartbeat. Voice of a generation: Ms Oxenford, pictured in 1999, was an iconic voice for children growing up in the 1950s and 60s . She played village shop-owner Mrs Patterson in the 1970s sitcom To The Manor Born, and was one of the voices behind Granada TV's irreverent weekly press review, What The Papers Say. Bizarrely, perhaps, she forged a long partnership with comedian Les Dawson, appearing on various shows as his comic foil. Her last role was in 2008, playing an elderly Dame Agatha Christie alongside David Tennant in a DVD episode of Dr Who. Daphne's husband David Marshall, whom she married in 1951, died nine years ago and her twilight years were spent in a retirement home for actors in Northwood, Middlesex. She is survived by two daughters, Kate and Sophie - and by two grandsons who may yet come to tell their own children how great granny's voice became friend to a generation.","Presenter of legendary show died at the grand old age of 93 .

The number of children being admitted to hospital to be treated for asthma attacks has dropped sharply since the smoking ban came into effect. Experts believe the law may have made smokers more aware of the dangers of second-hand smoke at home. This is despite the fact that the legislation only applies to work and public spaces. Exposure: Experts believe exposing children to less second-hand smoke could reduce asthma attacks . Researchers at Imperial College . London found NHS hospital admissions for children under 14 for asthma . attacks fell by 12.3 per cent in England in the year after July 2007, . when the ban came in. In the two subsequent years, admissions were 3.4 per cent lower. The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that the total . fall in the three years to July 2010 was equivalent to 6,802 hospital . admissions. The drop was found in both boys and girls, in homes across all social classes and in both cities and rural areas. Admissions for severe child asthma attacks had previously been rising . from 2002 by 2.2 per cent a year, peaking at 26,969 admissions in the . year before the ban. Asthma affects approximately one in every 11 children in the country. In other research, experts have found that hospital admissions for . childhood asthma fell after legislation banning smoking in public spaces . was introduced in Scotland and North America, before the law in . England. Dr Christopher Millett, of Imperial Collegeâs School of Public Health, . said: âPrevious studies have suggested the smoke-free law led more . people to abstain from smoking voluntarily at home and in cars. âWe think exposing children to less second-hand smoke in these settings probably played an important role.â Immediately following the ban, experts found a 10 per cent fall in heart attacks in England and it was suggested that older people who never smoked benefited the most. It's hard to recall now, but smoking was banned in bars and cafes less than six years ago . Previous studies have shown hospital admissions for childhood asthma fell after smoke-free legislation was introduced in Scotland and North America. Emily Humphreys, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at Asthma UK, said: 'Itâs great to see growing evidence of the positive impact of smoke-free legislation. 'This is something we campaigned for, so it is particularly encouraging that there has been a fall in childrenâs hospital admissions for asthma since its introduction. 'We have long known that smoking and second hand smoke are harmful - they not only trigger asthma attacks which put children in hospital but can even cause them to develop the condition. 'Weâve seen the benefits of reducing second-hand smoke exposure; now we need to do more to prevent children and young people from taking up smoking by introducing plain packaging for tobacco.â Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: 'This research is another indication that the smoking ban was a great step towards helping protect childrenâs health, as well as making many smokers think more about the harmful effects it has on them. 'Many people think of the ban as just being about smoking in pubs, but this research shows that, with all public places being covered, children have been notable beneficiaries of the legislation. 'Second-hand smoke is still an on-going danger for children, however, and research published since the smoking ban has shown that there are still 300,000 GP visits every year from children as a result of passive smoking. 'As a society we must keep moving forward in ensuring that we protect our children from passive smoking. 'The next logical step would be to see a ban on smoking in cars when children are present, as the concentration of smoke caused by smoking within the small enclosed space of a car can be significantly greater than we used to see in pubs before the smoking ban.'","Hospital admissions for child asthma attacks fell by 12.3% in first year after 2007 smoking ban in England .

Survivors of the Costa Concordia disaster returned to the scene of the shipwreck to mark the one-year anniversary, defying a request from the cruise company that they stay away. In the days before the Sunday ceremony, owners Costa Crociere sent a letter to all passengers who survived the capsizing, and asked them not to travel to the Italian island of Giglio for âlogistical reasonsâ. Undeterred, some of the 3,200 surviving passengers, and relatives of the 32 who lost their lives, were taken by boat close to the wreck. Anniversary: Silence is observed during a Catholic mass to commemorate the Costa Concordia disaster near the shipwreck on the island of Giglio, located off the coast of Tuscany, on Sunday night . They watched as a crane lowered part of a rock that was removed from the hull of the 950 ft long ship into the water. The rock has been carved into a memorial and adorned with a plaque. A Catholic Mass was held in memory of the tragedy after which the islanders, passengers and relatives gathered observed a minute's silence at 9.45 - the time of the ship's collision with the rocks off the coast of Giglio. âAfter a year we are still traumatised,â said Violet Morreau, a survivor from France, who was in the restaurant area with 10 family members the ship hit the rocks before keeling over on its side off the Tuscan island. âNo one told us what to do. We were scared of dying, like the people who did lose their lives, because of somebody else's recklessness,â Morreau said. âI remember the shock, we weren't able to understand what was happening,â said Anna di Pavia, who was on the cruise with her husband and 1-year-old son. In honour: The participants joined in a torchlight procession on Giglio Island close to the wreckage, and placed the torched to light up the commemorative plaque with the names of those who died in the disaster . Close by: The Costa Concordia can be seen in the background as lanterns are lit and sent up in the sky to honour the lives lost . Never forget: The vigil was held near the shipwreck and also saw the unveiling of a commemorative plaque on part of one of the rocks removed from the hull of the ship . âWe are here to thank the inhabitants . of Giglio, but we are also here to seek answers that never seem to . arrive. How could something like this have happened?â she said. Taking . part in the anniversary commemoration was Captain Gregorio De Falco of . the Italian coast guard, who became something of a hero to survivors . after his recorded conversations with Schettino during the evacuation . were made public. In them, . Capt De Falco excoriated Schettino for having abandoned the ship before . all passengers were off and ordered him to return. Capt . De Falco said he wanted to go to Giglio to âembrace the victims, and . the relatives of the victims.â He added that he has shied from media . attention since the disaster out of respect for the victims. âI'm not a hero,â he told reporters in Giglio on Sunday. âI just did my job.â For them: Islanders, relatives and survivors all gathered at Molo Rosso on the island of Giglio to attend the mass and hold a minute's silence at 9.45pm the moment the accident took place .

Indian waiter Russel Rebello was one . of the two victims whose bodies were never recovered. Kevin Rebello, his . brother, spent weeks on Giglio in the aftermath of the disaster . awaiting word of the fate of his sibling and said he could not sleep . ahead of Sunday's anniversary. âI . have been constantly thinking it is going to be again the same agony, . even tonight, because it is going to be the same exact moment when all . this happened,â he said on Sunday. âSo my heart is beating a bit faster I . guess.â The letter asking . people not to travel to Giglio for the ceremony, sent by Costa Crociere, . sparked fury among survivors last week. Anne .

Costa Crociere has asked survivors to . appreciate its position, stating in the letter that they are 'certain . that you will understand the impossibility â for logistical reasons â of . welcoming you all onto the island that day, and the desire for privacy . expressed by the families of the victims at such a difficult moment.â It adds that the company âsincerely shares the pain and sadnessâ of those who were caught up in the disaster. Ms Decre has accused the company of . trying to funnel survivors towards one of several parallel ceremonies . that will be taking place around the world. 'They tried to buy our silence by offering us â¬125 (Â£102) to go to Paris. 'The islanders understand us. We want to come also so we can thank them for what they did that night.â Loss of life: The Costa Concordia went capsized on January 13 2012 with 4,252 passengers and crew on board, 32 lives could not be saved .

U.S. firm Titan Salvage said on Saturday the ship would be removed . by September at the latest. The . 114,500-tonne liner will be pulled upright by cranes, helped by tanks . attached to its sides filled with air, and the ship will be towed to an . Italian port and broken up. The . vessel's owner Costa Cruises, a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp, now . expects the removal to cost Â£248 million, more than its original Â£186 . million estimate. A total of 3,229 passengers and 1,023 crew were on board the Costa Concordia when it sank. Whilst 30 bodies have been recovered, two people are still missing, presumed dead. Accused: Captain Francesco Schettino . Captain Francesco Schettino became known as Captain Coward and âthe most unpopular man in Italyâ after he abandoned Costa Concordia after it ran aground with hundreds of passengers still on board. The transcript of the conversation between him and Captain Gregorio De Falco show that despite Cpt. De Falco demanding that he âvada a bordo, cazzo!â - âget the f*** back on boardâ - he refused. Half-an-hour before the accident, the 52-year-old was seen dining with 25-year-old Domnica Cemortan, a Moldovian cruise rep on the ship, reported by several other crewmembers to have been his mistress. A suitcase containing her belongings, including her underwear, was later recovered by divers from the Captainâs cabin. At an inquest into the tragedy, Ms Cemortan admitted that she was in love with the captain and that she was on the bridge when the ship struck the reef, but that she was not Schettinoâs lover. Captain Schettino was doing a âsail by saluteâ and has defended his navigation, saying he was âfamiliar with the seabedâ and that he hit the rocks, known as Le Scole, because they were not on his navigation charts. Mr Schettino faces accusations of is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. He has admitted to making mistakes, but says he should not be the only one blamed. Prosecutors say he caused the accident by sailing the vessel too close to shore, but Mr Schettino argues he managed to prevent a worse disaster by steering into shallow waters after the impact to help the rescue operation. Investigations . have concluded and prosecutors plan to submit a request by the end of . January to indict the captain and up to eight others. A judge will then . decide if there is enough evidence for trial. Chief Prosecutor Francesco Verusio said in December Mr Schettino faces up to 20 years in jail. Shortly before a pre-trial hearing held in October, Mr Schettino attempted to sue for wrongful dismissal.","Survivors commemorate one-year mark of disaster which claimed 32 lives .

A father died during his son's stag night after downing a deadly cocktail of cider spiked with spirits. Lorry driver Nigel Hamer, 46, was celebrating with his son Sean, 27, and his rugby teammates when he collapsed outside the hotel where they had been drinking. Mr Hamer had been drinking all night when he was handed the dangerous cocktail of cider and spirits in a pint glass, an inquest heard. Stag night: Nigel Hamer, top left, had been drinking at a stag party for his son Sean, pictured centre wearing a yellow tshirt. Mr Hamer later collapsed outside the pub after drinking a cocktail of cider and shots in a pint glass . After collapsing, party-goers called for an ambulance but paramedics were unable to revive the father-of-three. Sean proceeded with his wedding eight days later - the day after his father's funeral. Tributes: Flowers left outside the Castle Hotel, Pontardawe, South Wales, in memory of Nigel Hamer who collapsed after drinking in the hotel . The inquest heard how Mr Hamer, described as a 'hard working man', was not used to heavy drinking because of his job driving lorries across Europe. Mr Hamer, of Swansea, South Wales, died from acute pneumonia as a result of alcohol intoxication from the stag night. A post-mortem examination revealed he was just over three times over the legal drink-drive limit. Tests found 261 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit for driving is 80 milligrammes. Swansea coroner Philip Rogers said: 'Mr Hamer's average intake was 14 units per week, entirely consistent with his job as a lorry driver. 'He was a hard working man who went all across the country and Europe. 'On this particular occasion he had consumed a larger than normal amount of alcohol and sadly this has been the unexpected outcome.' Alison Finall, consultant pathologist, said: ""The fatal range for alcohol is usually between 300 and 500 milligrammes. 'He is short of that but it is very high. It would have caused a significant affect on his brain.' Mr Hamer had joined Sean and his teammates from the village rugby team in Trebanos, near Swansea. Scene: Mr Hamer had been drinking with his son Sean and his rugby teammates in the hotel . They were drinking in the Castle Hotel in Pontardawe, where Sean and his bride-to-be Nicola James, 24, left a touching letter following the incident headed 'You will never walk alone'. Speaking of his decision to get married following the funeral, Sean said: 'I never imagined I'd be having to plan my father's funeral the day before my wedding. 'I had a long chat with dad just two days before it happened. I told him that I loved him. No one can take that away from me.' Trebanos Rugby Football Club Secretary Justin Jones said: 'This has come as an absolutely devastating blow to Sean. It's just tragic.' Mr Hamer had two other teenage children: Stacey, 19, and Jamie, 15. The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure.","Nigel Hamer collapsed outside Castle Hotel in Pontardawe near Swansea .

Scientists warn that catches of mackerel should be slashed to almost half the levels of 2011. It has now been removed from the Marine Conservation Societyâs âfish to eatâ list, and instead should only be consumed occasionally, joining the likes of monkfish and plaice. After campaigning for the wider use of mackerel as part of his Fish Fight series, celebrity chef Fearnley-Whittingstall says he will end his campaign to see the nation eating it regularly - including trying to convince fish and chip shops to sell mackerel in a bap or and will himself be using the fish more sparingly. Last year, sales of smoked mackerel leapt by 20 per cent compared to 2011 at middle-class favourite Waitrose. Conservationists now fear stocks may be at risk after Iceland and the Faroe Islands dramatically increased their quotas in recent years. In 2011, 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north-east Atlantic, but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes. Over-fished: Mackerel has become a firm favourite after a string of endorsements from celebrity chefs, including 'real food' champion Fearnley-Whittingstall . Fishing grounds: Mackerel may seem plentiful in places, but it is fast disappearing from our shores . Reacting . to the announcement that mackerel is at risk, Fearnley-Whittingstall . said: âWhen we started the mac bap campaign two years ago, mackerel was . certified as sustainable and part of a well-managed fishery. âUnfortunately . things have changed, and politics and greed are getting in the way of . common sense. If the countries involved could agree sensible catch . limits this could still be a certified sustainable fishery. âWe . hope that these so called mackerel wars can be laid to rest as soon as . possible, so we can all go back to eating mackerel again with a clear . conscience.â In demand: In 2011, 930,000 tonnes of mackerel were fished from the north-east Atlantic, but scientists claim the maximum that should be caught is 542,000 tonnes . He promised to only use . handline-caught mackerel, which is considered the most sustainable, in . his River Cottage restaurants and cooking school. Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc . described the plight of mackerel as âhorribleâ adding that its decline . is âclearly is an example of the failure of politicsâ. Bernadette . Clarke, fisheries officer at the Marine Conservation Society (MCS), . said good alternatives to mackerel - worth Â£205 million to the British . fishing industry in 2011 - are herring and sardine. âIceland and the Faroe Islands have unilaterally decided to take a larger share than before. As a result, there is a real potential for overfishing,â she said. Mackerel may well be a victim of its own success following campaigns to encourage people to switch to the fish. âPeople are more aware that eating fish can boost their health, and particularly oily types like mackerel,â said Miss Clarke. âAnd Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and the mackerel bap has certainly contributed to its popularity.â A Defra spokesperson said: 'The continued sustainability of mackerel is vitally important and is increasingly threatened by the actions of the Faroe Islands and Iceland. 'We are extremely concerned that an agreement on fishing rights has not yet been reached. 'That is why the UK continues to seek a new agreement that is fair to all.' Other fish taken off the âfish to eatâ list is gurnard and pollock - a white fish once championed as a sustainable alternative to cod. Both species have increased in popularity, while there is a lack of data on population levels and concerns about how stocks are being managed. Saddened: Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc said the plight of mackerel is 'horrible' adding its decline is 'clearly is an example of the failure of politics' Gurnard, which has been historically . caught accidentally as âbycatchâ, has become fashionable in restaurants . in recent years, with its sustainable virtues praised by celebrity . chefs. But with increased . consumption and up to 50 per cent of the catch discarded by fishermen, . scientists fear it could soon be at risk. To . add to the confusion, despite concerns over cod and haddock stocks, . they are on the âfish to eatâ list if they come from areas where numbers . are sustainable. âIt is . difficult for the consumer because a lot of the supermarket labeling is . inadequate for them to make a properly informed choice. The advice is to . check where the fish comes from if possible,â said the MSC. The latest version of the âfish to eat' list shows that herring stocks, coley and Dover sole from the English Channel are all good to eat with a clear conscience. Whiting from the Celtic Sea also appears on the list for the first time, while a number of other popular wild fish are given the green light to appear on the dinner plate, including lemon sole. And farmed species are on the list, including organic Arctic charr, sturgeon caviar from closed fish farming systems, mussels, tiger prawns, Atlantic halibut and salmon and rainbow trout.","Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall will no longer champion the oily fish .

The family of Junior Seau has sued the NFL, claiming the linebacker's suicide last year was the result of brain disease sparked by violent hits he sustained during his football career. The wrongful death lawsuit, filed Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Diego, blames the league for its 'acts or omissions' that hid the dangers of repetitive blows to the head. It says Seau developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) from those hits, and accuses the NFL of deliberately ignoring and concealing evidence of the risks associated with traumatic brain injuries. Fierce: Junior Seau is known as one of the toughest competitors to play football . Diagnosis: Seau's family has sued the NFL - two weeks after a study found his brain had abnormalities consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) Seau died at age 43 of a self-inflicted gunshot in May. He was diagnosed with CTE, based on posthumous tests, earlier this month. An Associated Press review in November found that more than 3,800 players have sued the NFL over head injuries in at least 175 cases as the concussion issue has gained attention in recent years. More than 100 of the concussion lawsuits have been brought together before U.S. District Judge Anita B. Brody in Philadelphia. 'Our attorneys will review it and respond to the claims appropriately through the court,' the NFL said in a statement Wednesday. Helmet manufacturer Riddell Inc., also is being sued by the Seaus, who say Riddell was 'negligent in their design, testing, assembly, manufacture, marketing, and engineering of the helmets' used by NFL players. The suit says the helmets were unreasonably dangerous and unsafe. Sportsman: Seau played in the NFL for 20 seasons . with three teams: The San Diego Chargers, left, Miami Dolphins, right, . and New England Patriots . Degeneration: Another recent study of CTE shows a comparison between normal brain tissue, left, compared with that of an NFL player, center, and a 70-year-old former boxer, right . Dominating: Seau, right, was one of the most feared linebackers in football . Seau was one of the best linebackers during his 20 seasons in the NFL. He retired in 2009. 'We . were saddened to learn that Junior, a loving father and teammate, . suffered from CTE,' the family said in a statement released to the AP. 'While Junior always expected to have aches and pains from his playing days, none of us ever fathomed that he would suffer a debilitating brain disease that would cause him to leave us too soon. 'We know this lawsuit will not bring back Junior. But it will send a message that the NFL needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations.' Plaintiffs are listed as Gina Seau, Junior's ex-wife; Junior's children Tyler, Sydney, Jake and Hunter, and Bette Hoffman, trustee of Seau's estate. Triumph: Seau came out of retirement to play . with the Patriots in search of a Super Bowl ring and was with the team . when they lost to the New York Giants in 2008 . Honoured: Seau was awarded a volunteer service award by President George W. Bush in 2005 . The lawsuit accuses the league of glorifying the violence in pro football, and creating the impression that delivering big hits 'is a badge of courage which does not seriously threaten one's health.' It singles out NFL Films and some of its videos for promoting the brutality of the game. 'In 1993's 'NFL Rocks,' Junior Seau . offered his opinion on the measure of a punishing hit: 'If I can feel . some dizziness, I know that guy is feeling double [that],' the suit . says. Height: 6' 3"" Weight: 248 pounds . Games played: 268 . Drafted: 1990 (First round, fifth overall) Sacks: 56.5 . Interceptions: 18 . Total yards: 238 . Tackles: 1,524 . Pro bowl appearances: 12 . The NFL consistently has denied allegations similar to those in the lawsuit. 'The . NFL, both directly and in partnership with the NIH, Centers for Disease . Control and other leading organizations, is committed to supporting a . wide range of independent medical and scientific research that will both . address CTE and promote the long-term health and safety of athletes at . all levels,' the league told the AP after it was revealed Seau had CTE. The lawsuit claims money was behind the NFL's actions. 'The . NFL knew or suspected that any rule changes that sought to recognize . that link (to brain disease) and the health risk to NFL players would . impose an economic cost that would significantly and adversely change . the profit margins enjoyed by the NFL and its teams,' the Seaus said in . the suit. The National Institutes of Health, . based in Bethesda, Maryland, studied three unidentified brains, one of . which was Seau's, and said the findings on Seau were similar to . autopsies of people 'with exposure to repetitive head injuries.' 'It . was important to us to get to the bottom of this, the truth,' Gina Seau . told the AP then. 'And now that it has been conclusively determined . from every expert that he had obviously had CTE, we just hope it is . taken more seriously. Children: Seau left behind four kids. Pictured clockwise from top are Jake, 16, Tyler, 22, Hunter, 11, and Sydney, 18 . 'You can't deny it exists, and . it is hard to deny there is a link between head trauma and CTE. There's . such strong evidence correlating head trauma and collisions and CTE.' In the final years of his life, Seau went through wild behavior swings, according to Gina and his 23-year-old son, Tyler. There also were signs of irrationality, forgetfulness, insomnia and depression. 'He . emotionally detached himself and would kind of 'go away' for a little . bit,' Tyler Seau said.

Cyberslacking civil servants are spending thousands of hours browsing shopping, social networking and sports websites at the office. Whitehall officials found time last year to log on to Facebook, Twitter and Sky Sports millions of times, official figures have revealed. At the Department for Work and Pensions, which is leading the crackdown on âskiversâ by capping benefits and running work programmes for the jobless, Google was the most popular website visited with nearly 700million page views, and Facebook was in fifth place with nearly 82milllion views. Twitter was in tenth place with 48million. The rest of the top ten was filled with sites related to their work, but the officials, paid by the taxpayer, clocked up 19,267,228 visits to Amazon, the 28th most popular site, over 16million to mail-order site Littlewoods in 31st place and 9.5million to used car website Autotrader - which was in 55th place.

At Mr Picklesâ department, which is much smaller than the DWP, the top visited site was BBC News, with Facebook in sixth place with nearly 2.5million hits and YouTube at number 13 with 932,958. However, a spokesman said it was part of civil servants work to âengage with the publicâ on these sites. Tory MP Priti Patel, a member of the .

Two-for-one deals on cheap booze in supermarkets and off-licences face the axe under plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol announced today. The Government plans to impose a minimum price of 45p per unit, slapping an extra 70p on the price of some bottles of wine and an additional Â£1.30 on a two-litre bottle of cider, in a bid to stamp out binge-drinking. David Cameron wants to end loss-leader discounting, whereby supermarkets sell alcohol at a loss to entice shoppers into their stores. Increase: The Government plans to ban multi-buy deals in a bid to stamp out binge-drinking (file picture) Industry experts say the increase represents an overnight increase in the price of drinks equal to the inflationary increase in costs over the last five years or more. One industry source said a 45p minimum unit price would seeÂ  52 per cent of prices in supermarkets, off-licences and convenience stores rise overnight, including seven out of ten bottles of vodka, six out of ten bottles of vodka and 38 per cent of bottles of wine. Pubs will get more powers to stop serving . alcohol to people who are already drunk, while town hall chiefs will be . able to further restrict opening and closing hours, control the density . of licensed premises and charge a late-night levy to support policing. Some Tory MPs have claimed the policy will have little impact on binge-drinking. But Home Office Minister Damian Green insisted action was needed to curb ultra-cheap booze. 'Too many of us have seen city centres on a Friday and Saturday night often become a vision of hell. A lot of this is fuelled by very cheap, very strong alcohol,' he told BBC Radio 4âs Today programme. 'The point of having a minimum unit price rather than, say, increasing taxation, is that you can target ... the shops that do deliberately sell very strong drink very cheaply. 'It is just a fact of economics and indeed of life that if you put the price of a particular product up, demand for it goes down.' Home Secretary Theresa MayÂ  will use a written statement to Parliament to launch a ten-week public consultation today. But the Home Office will also pledge to protect responsible drinkers, so supermarkets will continue to be able to offer meal deals that include alcohol, and bulk wine-sellers such as Majestic. The consultation will include plans for a review of licensing rules so that they include a âhealth-related objectiveâ for the first time. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told Sky News: 'Weâre not seeing this as a revenue-raising measure and weâll be publishing what we think the impact will be on revenue. We all enjoy a tipple, but what we are trying to do is deal with the excesses.' The shake-up will seek to address the ludicrous imbalance whereby in some instances beer is cheaper than mineral water. In some shops, it is possible to buy a can of lager for 20p and a two-litre bottle of cider for Â£1.69. Mr . Cameron has demanded the changes to stamp out binge-drinking in the . face of opposition from senior Cabinet ministers such as Communities . Secretary Eric Pickles and Education Secretary Michael Gove, who believe . the change will alienate voters who are struggling to make ends meet . and simply want a quiet drink. Tory . MP Philip Davies accused ministers of moving towards a 'nanny state' and claimed a minimum price on a unit of alcohol 'wonât make a blind bit . of difference'. 'Basically . what weâre saying here is we want to basically target poorer people; we . want poorer people to pay more for their alcohol whilst richer people . can continue paying the same amount for their alcohol. And Iâm afraid to . me thatâs completely unacceptable.' The minimum price of 45p per unit has been set 5p lower than in Scotland, where there is a 50p minimum. Consultation: Home Secretary Theresa May will launch a ten-week public consultation today . Legal advice from the European Union says the plans are illegal under EU law, as imports would be hit by price hikes, particularly French brandy and Irish cider. But sources close to Mr Cameron say he is determined to press ahead to call time on a binge-drinking culture which has seen town centres become no-go areas. Just under half of all violent crimes involve alcohol, and the effects of binge-drinking are estimated to cost taxpayers Â£21billion a year. Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of GPs, backed the minimum alcohol price. 'We are not killjoys but something has to be done and we have been saying this for three decades. 'Either you restrict sales or you increase prices or you do both, but in the end alcohol is contributory to an enormous amount of not just healthcare costs, but social costs, costs of violence, road traffic accidents and at the very least those little puddles of vomit that one walks past increasingly now,' she told the BBC. The Alcohol Health Alliance UK, made up of 32 medical and counselling organisations, said a minimum alcohol price could reduce tens of thousands crimes in England every year. But chairman Professor Sir Ian Gilmore said the minimum unit price should be 50p rather than 45p. Drinks companies warned the higher price would not have the effect the Prime Minister claims. Miles Beale, of the Wine and Spirits Trade Association, called the decision âbreathtakingâ, adding: âThe Government is ploughing on regardless of evidence, public opinion, taxpayersâ money and probably the law.â Labour home affairs spokesman Diana Johnson said: âThe Government needs to make sure it does not just create a cash windfall for the supermarkets, instead ofÂ  lowering prices of other goods or supporting better prevention and treatment of alcohol abuse to cut crime further and save lives.â Westminister Council backed a minimum alcohol price, but called for more action to tackle the 'tsunami of cheap alcohol washing through our streets. Councillor Tony Devenish said: 'It is important we keepÂ  nudging people . towards a more responsible attitude towards alcohol rather than relying . on state controls. Public health canât be controlled by the cash . register alone; the Government needs to keep funding front line services . which deal with the end results of binge drinking. 'Cleaning up the consequences of the tsunami of cheap alcohol washing through our streets will need more than ending the âbuy one get one freeâ culture.'","Government wants to impose minimum price of 45p per unit to stamp out binge-drinking .

Some 70 per cent said they would cut down on their coffee intake by simply buying less, while 56 per cent said they would buy smaller drinks.

A 64-year-old car dealer nicknamed 'Yoda' by workmates and subjected to jibes from colleagues about his age has won an unfair dismissal case. Workers at Evans Halshaw in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, changed Michael Nolan's car numberplate from OAB to OAP and asked when his 65th birthday - and expected retirement - was, an employment tribunal heard. Mr Nolan was service team leader at the dealership and claimed that bosses wanted to replace him with a younger employee when he retired. Strikes back: Michael Nolan, who was nicknamed Yoda after the Star Wars character, pictured right . The tribunal was told that principal dealer David Heeley frequently reminded Mr Nolan of his age and once introduced him as 'my 104-year-old service team leader'. He told Mr Nolan that he had checked personnel records to find out when his 65th birthday was and asked him to swap jobs with Paul Brooks, a younger member of staff being groomed to replace Mr Nolan in his higher paid role. Mr Nolan was dubbed 'Yoda' by staff after the Star Wars character - which the Nottingham tribunal explained was 'a small, wizened character who is several hundred years old'. He stayed put in his job - but when a round of redundancies came up he was given the axe in February last year, after being put into a 'pool of one'. He won his claim of unfair dismissal on the grounds of age discrimination. The tribunal was told how Mr Heeley had 'a tendency to express himself in a way which suggests that he does not consider carefully when and how it is appropriate to make references to the protected characteristics of employees and others in the workplace'. Employer: Mr Nolan was employed at the Evans Halshaw dealership in Worksop, Nottinghamshire . The tribunal said in its ruling: 'The respondent tolerated the playing of work related pranks and the use of age-related nicknames in its workplace. 'For example, on one occasion an employee of the respondent changed the letters of the claimant's number plate from OAB to OAP, although the tribunal accepts that the claimant found this to be humorous rather than offensive. 'Further, a number of the respondent's employees referred to the claimant as ""Yoda"", a small, wizened character in Star Wars who is several hundred years old.' Mr Heeley denied describing Mr Nolan as his '104-year-old service team leader', but the tribunal found that it was the type of remark he might make. He was disciplined for an offensive email in July 2011 telling staff not to move cars from one dealership to another without a deposit being left, and the tribunal found it was evidence of his managerial style, which he also applied to Mr Nolan's age. The tribunal said in its ruling: 'Mr . Heeley commented that he could see no problem with age-related banter . ""if everyone is getting on"". 'He went on to say that such banter was not the same as ""discrimination about the colour of someone's skin"". 'Whilst . it is obviously the case that it is not necessary for employees to . avoid all light-hearted references to the protected characteristics of . other employees, the way in which Mr Heeley expressed himself left the . tribunal to find that he did not regard age-related banter as being . something which some employees might find offensive.' It . ruled that because Mr Nolan had been made redundant while no . consideration was given to making Mr Brooks redundant instead he had . been discriminated against.","Michael Nolan was subjected to taunts about his age by colleagues .

Experts claim increased publicity for the SNPâs campaign to leave the UK has meant more people are now fearful of what independence might mean. Better off in: The Scottish Social Attitudes survey revealed only 23 per cent of people want Scotland to be independent, the lowest level since the Scottish Parliament was established in 1999 . Just 23 per cent of people want Scotland to leave the UK, the annual Scottish Social Attitudes survey for 2012 revealed. It . shows a dramatic drop from 2011 when 32 per cent supported . independence. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed now say they are . âquiteâ or âveryâ worried about independence, up from 46 per cent in . 2011. Mr Salmond has secured a deal with David Cameron to stage a referendum on independence in autumn 2014. Rachel . Ormston, director of ScotCen Social Research, an independent . not-for-profit group which produced the survey, said: âThe 'yes' campaign still needs to convince a much wider section of the public that . independence will bring real benefits, especially for Scotland's . economy.â The survey will be a major blow to Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who last year struck a deal with David Cameron to hold a referendum on independence in autumn 2014 . Scots will be denied a vote on membership of the EU if they choose independence, it emerged last night. Alex Salmond will refuse voters a say on whether they want to leave the EU if he wins the referendum on Scottish independence. The First Minister has ruled out an in-out referendum or a vote on the terms of any deal that Scotland strikes before joining the EU as a separate country. Prime Minister David Cameron has offered an in-out referendum by 2017 after renegotiating a new deal with Brussels, but Scots will only be able to take part if there is a No vote in the independence poll. Mr Salmond will ask Scots to vote for independence â which he says would include joining the EU â without knowing the terms of membership. That means Scotland could be saddled with a raw deal over the EU budget and border controls or be forced to commit to the euro. However, the survey also revealed many Scots are confused about the powers that the Holyrood parliament has, and want it to be responsible for most of Scotland's domestic affairs. More than half want Holyrood to set taxes while almost two-thirds said it should set welfare benefits. Just 6 per cent would want to return all decision-making powers to London. If independence is achieved, 42 per cent think Scotland would have a stronger voice in the world - down from 51 per cent in 2011. Those who think it would make no difference changed from 27 per cent to 32 per cent. On the economy, about a third think it will be better while the same number disagree. About one in five would be confident about Scotland's future, compared with 31 per cent in 2011. Elections expert Professor John Curtice from the University of Strathclyde who worked on the survey, said: âDuring the course of the last 12 months the independence debate moved firmly to the top of the Scottish political agenda. âYet the proponents of independence have apparently struggled to capitalise on the resulting opportunity to persuade Scots of the merits of their case. âInstead, more voters appear to have become concerned about the prospect of leaving the UK.â Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said Mr Salmond was 'failing spectacularly' to persuade people of the merits of separation . Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: âThis survey shows Alex Salmond is failing spectacularly to sell his dream of separation to the people of Scotland, who are growing increasingly sceptical about the concept.â A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: âWe have already set out our vision for the country we would like Scotland to be - a country that earns its wealth and shares it more fairly; a country where every child has the chance to grow up and fulfil their potential. âDuring this year the Scottish Government will outline the compelling case for independence, leading to a white paper in the autumn that will set out the Government's proposals for how that independent Scotland will look.â The researchers interviewed a sample of 1,229 adults face-to-face between July and November 2012.","Scottish Social Attitudes reveals decline in backing for independence .

Grandmother Patricia Barden (pictured here in an old image), 77, who died after falling into a cesspit in her garden . A grandmother who drowned after falling into a 14ft cesspit in her garden desperately tried to raise the alarm by throwing out her shoes, an inquest has heard. Tragic Patricia Barden, 77, died after a rusty manhole cover in her garden collapsed underneath her. She tumbled into the foul-smelling pool and her shoes were later found next to the manhole entrance. Police believe she may have thrown them out of the hole to attract attention, an inquest has heard. The brickwork and concrete surrounding the cesspit had become damaged to the point where it could barely support the weight of the metal cover, it was said. An inspection of the pit found it was around a third-full of fluid and had not been cleaned for ten years, Bury St Edmunds coroner's court heard . The inquest was told drain inspector Colin Stiff, who examined the cesspit after the death in July last year, said it was a 'death trap'. Recording a verdict of accidental death by drowning, Dr Dan Sharpeston, assistant deputy coroner for Suffolk, said: 'The metal cover and brickwork was in a poor state, which Mr Stiff described as a death trap. 'Mrs Barden fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out. Tragically, she drowned.' The inquest heard the family of the widower, who had lived in Milden, Suffolk, for 26 years, became concerned after they could not contact her. Suffolk Police were first called to the address at 1am on July 2 to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble. Mrs Barden's step-granddaughter, Charlotte Rush, 30, had driven up from Kent and let them in to check the house and gardens. The fire service removed Mrs Barden's body on July 3 and she was pronounced dead by a paramedic. A post-mortem examination stated the cause of death was drowning. Detective Inspector David Giles, from Suffolk Police, told the inquest: 'An officer noticed an open manhole and, with the use of a torchlight, saw what was believed to be a body in the bottom of the pit, in the water. Suffolk Police were first called to the house at 1am on July 2 last year to find all the doors locked and no sign of any trouble . 'We concluded that somehow she had fallen in. The access to the cesspit was heavily corroded. I think at some point she stood on the cover and it has given way as there is no strength there. 'If you had gone in there, you wouldn't have been able to get out without any assistance. We will never know exactly the day that she fell or how long she was in there.' 'Mrs Barden fell into the cesspit and we have heard there was no feasible way of getting out. Tragically, she drowned' - Dr Dan Sharpeston, assistant deputy coroner for Suffolk . Reading the evidence of Mrs Barden's step-granddaughter, Charlotte Rush, Dr Sharpeston said Mrs Barden was an 'active person who drove to local towns and had a nice life'. He said: 'As part of her morning routine, she would get up at 7.30am and have a walk round the garden or sit and have a cup of tea outside.' Mrs Barden had lived alone since 1994 when her husband Charles, known as Mick, died. Tributes were paid to the widow, described as a 'pillar of the community' by villagers. Friends of Mrs Barden said she had held numerous fundraisers for St Peter's Church in the village at her home including coffee mornings, bazaars and other activities. They said she was an 'articulate' and 'well-presented' person who valued her privacy.","Patricia Barden fell into a 14ft garden cesspit after manhole gave way .

Britain will lead a new global clampdown on âaggressiveâ tax avoiders, David Cameron vowed today. The Prime Minister said customers were fed up with big firms who do not pay their way, . In an apparent swipe at Starbucks which failed to pay corporation tax in the UK for three years, he told world leaders and business bosses at the World Economic Forum in Davos to: âWake up and smell the coffee.â Scroll down for video . David Cameron used a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos to reveal the G8 would target tax avoiders who refuse to pay their way . Mr Cameron said he would use the UK's G8 presidency in 2013 to take on âcowboyâ firms who avoid tax, driving up bills for those who play by the rules and harming public services. The government has been under pressure to take action after a public backlash against firms including Starbucks, Amazon and Google who report multi-million pound revenues in the UK but pay little or no tax. Mr Cameron said: âAfter years of abuse, people across the planet are calling for more action and most importantly, there is gathering political will to actually do something about it. He said the G8 â consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the UK and the US â would âdrive a more serious debate on tax evasion and avoidance. Mr Cameron told business leaders that tax avoidance harmed public services and pushed up bills for those who pay their way . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg questioned the need for the PM to travel to Davos, claiming it was 'debatable' that anything is achieved. But challenging the audience of some of . the worldâs biggest companies, Mr Cameron warned: âThere's nothing wrong . with sensible tax planning, and there are some things governments want . people to do that reduce tax bills, such as investing in pensions, . start-up businesses or charities. âBut some forms of avoidance have . become so aggressive that I think it is right to say these raise ethical . issues and it's time to call for more responsibility and for . governments to act accordingly.â Mr Cameron later met Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Davos, to discuss his plans for the UK presidency of the G8 . David Cameron was today was branded 'Europe's Scaredy-cat' in an editorial by the German news magazine Spiegel over his plans for an EU referendum. In an online piece published today, it was claimed the PMâs pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 was driven by âfearâ. âFear of his party, fear of voters, and fear of the EU itself, which he neither fully understands nor has ever really been interested in,â it said.It claims his long-awaited speech on Europe was âboringâ and was âan attempt to shake off a troublesome issue by postponing it to a later dateâ. âHe wants Europe to be a free trade zone with beach access. He missed an opportunity on Wednesday to haul Britain back to the centre of Europe. âApart from vague demands like competitiveness, flexibility and fairness, he has no idea how the EU should develop. âHis thinking on Europe is indecisive and chained to the present. 'What Europe witnessed on Wednesday was a speech delivered by a politician prone to knee-jerk reactions who lacks values or a vision. He lacks gravity. Cameron floats above Europe like an astronaut.â The PM defended the idea of Tories forcing firms to pay more tax. âI'm a low-tax Conservative, but I'm not a companies-should-pay-no-tax Conservative. Individuals and businesses must pay their fair share,â he said. âAny businesses who think that they can carry on dodging that fair share or that they can keep on selling to the UK and setting up ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad to squeeze their tax bill right down - well, they need to wake up and smell the coffee because the public who buy from them have had enough.â Poor business practices not only deprive the public sector of the revenue it needs to fund essential services, but also harm responsible firms, he said. âWhen one company doesn't pay the taxes they owe, then other companies end up paying more,"" said Mr Cameron. âWhen some cowboys play the system, all businesses suffer the fall-out to their reputation. âThat's why it's not just those in the NGOs who have been lobbying my Government on these issues, it's those in the high-rises of the City of London - bankers, lawyers, senior figures in finance. âThey've told us to pursue this agenda hard, and that's what we're going to do.â Barbara Stocking, Oxfam Chief Executive, said: 'There can be no moral justification for companies wriggling out of paying their fair share to society.' But Miles Dean, founder of Milestone International Tax Partners, said: 'Unless there is a uniform tax regime with a uniform tax rate and uniform accounting policy globally, David Cameron is banging his head against a brick wall.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said global efforts to tackle avoidance need to be matched by 'tougher action' domestically. 'The tens of billions of pounds raised would be a fairer and more effective way to tackle budget deficits than endless self-defeating austerity,' she added. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: 'The majority of businesses pay the right amount of tax, and for the small minority which do not, times are getting tougher, and rightly so. 'The CBI does not condone highly abusive avoidance schemes which serve no commercial purpose other than the minimisation of tax, even if they are legal. 'In some cases the tax system is lagging behind commercial reality, particularly around the taxation of the digital economy and transfer pricing. As the Prime Minister highlights, the UK needs to work together with other countries, including the G8, to change the rules where appropriate, so that they are fit for the global business age.'","Prime Minister uses speech at World Economic Forum to promise to take on 'cowboy' companies .
