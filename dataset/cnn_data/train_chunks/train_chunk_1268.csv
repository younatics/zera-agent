"It's a royal tradition that began in 1912 but while the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla have all attended, the younger generation of royals are yet to appear at a Royal Variety Performance. Now all that is set to change after Kensington Palace announced that the guestlist for next week's show includes the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Performing on the night are Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dame Shirley Bassey and Bette Midler, with comedy coming from Russell Kane and Jack Whitehall. Attending: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend this year's Royal Variety Performance . On the bill: Award-winning signer Ed Sheeran and comedian Jack Whitehall are both in the line-up . Also on the programme are Demi Lovato, Britain’s Got Talent winners Collabro, the cast of multi-award winning musical Miss Saigon, critically acclaimed tenor Alfie Boe and Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s Inala. The event, which will take place at the London Palladium, will be hosted by comedian Michael McIntyre. Traditionally, the Queen has taken it in turns with the Prince of Wales to attend the show and it had been expected to be the Queen’s turn this year. But instead, William and Kate will take their seats in what royal watchers say is a further sign of the monarch's esteem for her grandson and his wife. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke and Duchess are delighted to attend the forthcoming Royal Variety Performance. Form: Ellie Goulding last performed for royalty when she sang at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games . Comic: The enormously popular comedian Michael McIntyre will be acting as compère on the night . Last visit: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh last attended the Royal Variety Performance in 2012 . 'Members of the Royal Family will continue to support the gala evenings. As with any other invitation, attendance by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.' The Queen, who has a busy November schedule that includes regular audiences and investitures, will continue to take part in other big public events, including this weekend's Remembrance Sunday commemorations. Last year saw the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall take their seats in the royal box with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh doing the honours in 2012, although the Princess Royal did the job in 2011. The Royal Variety Performance is held in aid of the Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, of which the Queen is patron. Hello possums! Charles and Camilla found themselves sitting with Dame Edna Everage at last year's show . Tradition: The Royal Variety Performance began in 1912. The Queen is seen here at the show in 1985 . Spectacular: The finale of last year's Royal Variety Performance, as enjoyed by Prince Charles and Camilla . Begun in 1912, the first show was held in front of King George V and Queen Mary at the Palace Theatre in London. In July 1919, a second royal show was performed, again in front of the royal couple, and was billed as a post-war celebration of peace. It became an annual event at the suggestion of George V in 1921, when the King decreed that 'the monarch, or a representative of the monarch, would attend an annual performance in aid of Brinsworth House and the Variety Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, once a year thereafter'. The show will be screened on ITV in December.","William and Kate are attending in place of the Queen and Prince Philip .

"It was an art exhibition that no one had expected to see. But when a blaze struck a £10million London townhouse, these paintings were rescued by quick-thinking firemen – then left propped up against railings on the pavement. Last night the art world was divided over the worth of the haul, saved from a five-storey property in Wimpole Street, Marylebone, in the early hours of yesterday. Scroll down for video . Antiques roadshow: Art experts were divided last night over the worth of the rescued paintings . Real thing: Thames scene by John Atkinson Grimshaw, Britain’s ‘master of moonlight’ oil paintings . Copy? The left painting may be from the school of Victorian era artist Eugene Boudin . The paintings resemble the work of Victorian era artists John Atkinson Grimshaw, Eugene Boudin and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. But others suggested they were merely copies. An expert on the work of Grimshaw – Britain’s ‘master of moonlight’ oil paintings – suggested two of the canvases could be worth as much as £600,000 if they were proved to be originals dating back to 1880. Lionised by Victorian society for his delicate studies of twilit landscapes, the Yorkshireman has become one of the Victorian era’s most sought-after artists, with his signature landscapes of rain-washed streets in London and views of northern cities commanding prices of £300,000 to £500,000. Jane Sellars, curator of the Mercer Gallery in Harrogate, which has housed the largest collection of his works to be shown since 1979, said one of the paintings resembled one of his series of Thames nightfall pictures, and another appeared to be one of his scenes of Piccadilly. Scores of firefighters saved nine people from a burning mansion in London in the early hours of yesterday . Some 70 firefighters were battling the blaze in the early hours and attempted to control the flames from above . Taken away: Crews removed valuable items and paintings from the house after they had controlled the flames . She said: ‘Clearly these paintings belong to a serious collector of Victorian art. ‘One is almost certainly a Grimshaw, one of his harbour scenes, maybe Nightfall On The Thames. Grimshaw painted similar views in Glasgow, Liverpool, Hull, Scarborough, Whitby, London. ‘A second picture could be a Grimshaw, again maybe a London scene.’ She said the two paintings, which could fetch between £250,000 and £300,000 each, were examples of the largest size canvases that he produced for his most dedicated collectors. Also rescued from the flames was a seaside landscape resembling a ‘Beach Scene’ by Frenchman Eugene Boudin, whose work has sold for in excess of a £1million. Another salon picture carried out by firemen showing a woman with bare shoulders is said to be from the ‘school of French painter William-Adolphe Bouguereau’. Firefighters battled to control the fire throughout the morning, retrieving paintings and valuable items . The fire spread through four floors of the five-storey mansion in Marylebone as crews tried to contain it . More than nine hours later firefighters were still at the badly damaged site damping down after the fire . However, Britain’s leading art critic Brian Sewell was sceptical about the provenance of the paintings. ‘These pictures are in terrible frames and look like duds to me, bad production copies of European pictures acquired by the owners of the house,’ he said. ‘I would have said they are worth a few hundred pounds at the most.’ Neighbours said firemen had told them they removed the paintings because the property ‘looked like an art gallery’. Once the nine occupants of the building had been rescued, the firemen carefully carried out an array of paintings which were left to rest on the railings outside while they continued to damp down the flames. One resident said she had been woken by a loud bang at 2am and opened her curtains to see smoke and the glow of the blaze. She said: ‘The embers were falling on to the patio and I was stomping them out. Scores of firefighters worked to evacuated all residents of the mansion in Marylebone in central London . Nine people were evacuated after the fire - three were assessed for smoke inhalation, but none were injured . Crews used an aerial ladder platform to try and control the blaze as it ripped through the roof of the property . ‘The house is quite extravagant. I don’t think the owner is a permanent resident. I think it is a second home. The people who were there might have been staff.’ Yesterday a London Fire Brigade spokesman said it was routine to salvage artwork and items of value when there was no obvious risk to the building and the occupants had been evacuated. The blaze, which started at around 1.30am, was tackled by more than 70 firemen and ten fire engines. Three people were checked for smoke inhalation, London Ambulance Service said, but no one was injured. The fire affecting four of the five storeys and the roof was finally brought under control shortly before 6am. Last night the residents of the townhouse, which is owned by an investment company in the British Virgin Islands, were not available for comment. The cause of the fire is unknown, but police believe it is not suspicious.","Around 70 firefighters called to blaze at Marylebone mansion yesterday .

"When the United States stood on the brink of nuclear Armageddon during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, President John F Kennedy sent his wife and children away to stay at the family's summer farm in Virginia. But he pulled his 19-year-old mistress close, summoning her from her college while he stared down the Soviet Union. Later, Jackie Kennedy revealed in recently-released interviews that she had begged her husband to keep her, Caroline and John Jr. close, but instead he turned to Mimi Alford, the young press intern with whom he conducted an 18-month affair. Miss Alford revealed this shocking story about the president's behaviour along with the sordid details of what she says was her 'tender, funny, loving' relationship with JFK. And despite the shame that she felt for some of the acts she performed and keeping her secret for half a century, she says she would do it all over again. Scroll down for video . Broken lips: Mimi Alford kept her secret affair with the former U.S. president safe for years before deciding to write a tell-all book about their time together . In an interview with NBC's Rock Center after the release of her explosive new memoir, 'Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath,' Miss Alford said the president directed her to perform a sex act on his 50-year-old special assistant, Dave Powers, while he watched. The next summer, she claims, he told her to do the same to his baby brother, Teddy Kennedy. But this time, Miss Alford -- ashamed of what she did with Mr Powers -- refused. The retired New York church administrator says the night before the Cuban Missile Crisis ended, Kennedy sent a limo to Wheaton College, where she was studying. It picked her up and took her to a hotel near the White House in Washington. 'God knows I didn't belong there,' Miss Alford said. But it was surreal and exciting. She never saw the president that night. It was a waiting game, as she so often played with Kennedy. At the White House swimming pool, JFK asked Mimi (pictured): 'Mind if I join you?' She described him as 'remarkably fit - flat stomach, toned arms - for a 45-year-old man. After sliding into the pool, he floated up to me' In addition to stories of her sex life with the president, she also revealed tender moments she shared with him. 'He had a collection of little yellow rubber ducks and they were in the bathtub and rubber ducks sort of became part of the game,' she said in the interview. 'We had races with rubber ducks in the bathtub.' Far from being repulsed by his advances, the former church worker also admitted that she found him ‘unbelievably handsome’. Extracts from her memoir have detailed how she was shocked when on her fifth day as a White House press aide he led her away from co-workers who were having cocktails down the hall to his wife’s bedroom where they had sex for the first time. Aged 19 at the time, she writes that ‘short of screaming’ there was nothing she could do to get Mr Kennedy off her. Taken: Mimi claims that President Kennedy, seen here with his wife Jacqueline, took the young intern to his wife's room in the White House where she lost her virginity to him . But in an interview with NBC, Miss Alford said that she actually meant ‘overpowered in the sense that he was the president.' Speaking to Today she said: ‘He was this unbelievably handsome man who was 45-years-old. ‘Not . overpowered physically as in somebody grabbed me and made me do . something that I wasn't really willing to do, because I really think I . was willing to do it.' Miss Alford added that the first time she met the President the day before at the White House pool, during which time he eyed her up, felt perfectly normal too. She said: ‘It really didn’t feel unnatural because everybody was friendly because everybody went back to work afterwards.’ 'Even in our most intimate moments, I called him Mr President. To do otherwise would have seemed inappropriate' Comfortable: Miss Alford says that her exclusive meetings with the president and his most-trusted staff members felt natural because of how friendly and seemingly open they were . Miss Alford was first ‘outed’ in 2003 in a biography of Mr Kennedy but she has kept quiet until now. Asked why she now decided to write her memoirs, she said: ‘Most mornings I thought: ‘I don’t want to get up and write this book’. ‘Then I thought: ‘Why keep a secret? Why keep silent about something? You do something because you think it’s keeping you safe, but in fact it’s deadly.' In the book, ‘Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath,' Miss Alford writes how she went from being a debutante from a prominent New Jersey family to a White House press aide - and into the president’s bed. Handsome: She called him unbelievably handsome helping advance her enthusiasm as a White House press aide to a usual member of his entourage and then, a partner in his bed . Her lurid claims include allegations that he once made her inhale a sex drug at a debauched party at Bing Crosby’s desert ranch. 'The president asked me if I wanted to try the drug, which stimulated the heart but also purportedly enhanced sex. 'I . said no, but he just went ahead and popped the capsule and held it . under my nose. He didn’t try it himself. This was a new sensation, and . it frightened me. I panicked and ran crying from the room,' she writes in her autobiography. On another occasion he coerced her into performing a sex act on an aide while he looked on. When she thought she was pregnant that same aide arranged for her to see an abortion doctor, even though abortion was illegal at the time. Encounters: She found the president unbelievably handsome, in her words, and was both happy and comfortable when she met staff for a swim in the White House pool and he showed up, giving her a look up and down . It turned out to be a false alarm. Miss Alford, now a 69-year-old grandmother living in New York, also writes in her autobiography that through their affair she never called Mr Kennedy by his first name ‘Jack’ and always called him ‘Mr President,' even when they were in bed together. Miss Alford, who ironically went to the . same Miss Porter's school as JFK's wife Jackie, described Kennedy as . 'playful', the sex as 'varied and fun' and said he could be 'seductive . and playful'. She said they . spent a lot of time 'taking baths' and that if they spent the night . together, she would wear his own soft-blue cotton nightshirts. But . she also revealed complications in the relationship, saying they never . kissed, and that she was often subjected to a 'waiting game' where she . was told to stay in her hotel until he called for her. Personal stories: Mr Kennedy reached out to Miss Alford following the death of his infant son Patrick Bouvier Kennedy with his wife Jacqueline (pictured), whom he shared received letters of remorse with . 'Best friends': Dave Powers, pictured with JFK . in 1963, and alone in the Cabinet Room in 1962. The new book claims the . former President 'dared' Miss Alford to perform sex acts on Mr Powers while . he watched . In a different direction for their affairs, Miss Alford also writes of the president asking her to . 'take care' of his friend, staff member Dave Powers, who 'looked a little tense' in his description while . they were swimming in the White House pool. Published: Miss Alford's new book, Once Upon a Secret: My Affair with President John F. Kennedy and Its Aftermath, provides a never-before told story of life in the White House with the president as his mistress . 'It . was a dare, but I knew exactly what he meant. This was a challenge to . give Dave Powers oral sex. I don’t think the president thought I’d do . it, but I’m ashamed to say that I did... The president silently . watched,' she wrote. During the October 1962 Cuban Missile . Crisis, where the U.S. and USSR had a nuclear stand-off, he reportedly . told her that: 'I’d rather my children red than dead.' In another, more personal moment when her lover reached out to her following the death of his infant son . Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, she wrote of their time together seated on a White House balcony while he quietly wept. She wrote: 'I had never seen real . grief in my relatively short life. He invited me upstairs, and we sat . outside on the balcony in the soft summer evening air. There was a stack . of condolence letters on the floor next to his chair, and he picked . each one up and read it aloud to me... Occasionally, tears rolling down . his cheeks, he would write something on one of the letters, probably . notes for a reply. But mostly he just read them and cried. I did, too.' Miss Alford . said she saw President Kennedy for the final time at The Carlyle hotel . in Manhattan on November 15, 1963, just a week before his assassination . in Dallas. At this point she was due to be married to her college sweetheart, Tony Fahnestock. 'He . took me in his arms for a long embrace and said, 'I wish you were . coming with me to Texas.' And then he added, 'I'll call you when I get . back.' I was overcome with sudden sadness. 'Remember, Mr President, I’m . getting married.' ''I know that,' he said, and shrugged. 'But I’ll call you anyway.'' Watch the video here: .

"Detectives searching the former home of a convicted murderer in connection with the death of a woman have found a 'number of items of interest'. More than 40 forensic officers were continuing to scour the former home of the taxi driver, Christopher Halliwell, in connection with the disappearance and death of Becky Godden. Halliwell told police he killed 20-year-old Miss Godden - and led officers to her shallow grave - but his confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge because he had not been cautioned. The 55-year-old is currently serving life in jail for the abduction and brutal murder of Sian O'Callaghan who vanished after leaving a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in March 2011 aged 22. Christopher Halliwell (left) told police he had killed Becky Godden (right) but his confession was ruled inadmissible by a judge. He is currently serving life for the murder of another woman . A detective in charge of the latest probe said: 'We can confirm that a number of items of interest were found at the house and have been sent for analysis by experts.' After Halliwell took officers to where he buried Miss O'Callaghan in Oxfordshire, Halliwell asked then Detective Supertintendent Steve Fulcher for a cigarette in return for showing police 'another one.' He the took police to a field in Eastleach, Gloucestershire, where Miss Godden's body was found. Despite his confession, Halliwell did not go on trial for her murder because police had not respected arrest guidelines. Miss Godden, a drug-addicted prostitute, was last seen alive by a police officer in Swindon on December 27, 2002. She had not been reported missing to the police because her family believed she was living in Bristol working through her problems. Detective Chief Inspector Sean Memory, who is leading the investigation, said: 'Activity at the house in Ashbury Avenue continues today with over 40 staff members working on the investigation. 'Yesterday blood dogs from South Wales Police scoured the property and forensically-trained crime scene investigators commenced a finger-tip search. 'We can confirm that a number of items of interest were found at the house and have been sent for analysis by experts.' Halliwell killed Sian O'Callaghan, who vanished after leaving a nightclub in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 2011 . A forensic tent was put up outside Halliwell's former semi-detached house in Swindon yesterday and a police officer stood outside while searches were taking place. The house belonged to Halliwell before he was convicted of Miss O'Callaghan's murder, by which time he had moved down the street. The current owners of the house have been forced to move out while police searches take place and have no connection to the investigation. As part of the investigation flooring has been removed and a wall and loft spaced searched. The search is expected to take around a week. Police are also distributing renewed appeal posters in the local area and Mr Memory is urging anyone who saw Miss Godden over Christmas 2002 and into the new year to get in touch. 'Detectives have been speaking to residents in the area and gathering information regarding Becky's disappearance, this work will also continue throughout today along with the poster campaign,' Mr Memory said. 'People have come forward with helpful information who have not contacted us previously as they didn't think it would be relevant. 'I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is to let us know any information you have, as the smallest detail may be the key to justice for Becky and her family. 'We know that Becky was last seen on December 27 2002 and we need people to come forward with any information about where she was in early 2003. Did you see Becky over the new year period? 'I would like to reiterate our thanks to the occupants of the house, who have no involvement in this investigation, and the local community for their assistance and co-operation. 'I anticipate that the road closure at Ashbury Avenue will remain in place until the end of the week.' Det Supt Fulcher, who was suspended over his mishandling of the original case, resigned from Wiltshire Police in May this year after he was investigated by the police watchdog and found guilty of gross misconduct. Halliwell has also been linked with the disappearances of at least three other young women across the West Country, but has never been charged. The house's current occupants have been moved out during the search and are not linked to the probe . Police have now set up a forensic tent outside Halliwell's former home in Swindon in relation to the an investigation into Miss Godden's disappearance . Miss Godden's mother, Karen Edwards, has previously criticised the force's suspension of Det Supt Fulcher, who she credits as a 'hero' for finding out what had happened to her missing daughter. The latest searches come after police teams scouring an area alongside a pond earlier this year found boots thought to have belong to Miss O'Callaghan, along with the remains of a shotgun and up to 600 other items that could be linked to crime. Officers discovered the pile of items under a layer of mud, as well as a chunky knit cardigan. The major effort at the rural spot, near the quiet village of Ramsbury, Wiltshire, was stepped up after the discovery on May 15 of a boot, which police suspect belonged to Miss O'Callaghan. As officers held a press briefing near the pond on May 16 to announce their finding, a second boot was found. Further searches revealed the remains of a shotgun. Detectives suggested at the time that the items found at the site may be the key to solving other murders. Miss Godden's mother, Karen Edwards (left), had always hoped her daughter (right), would come home .","Police searching home of killer Christopher Halliwell find 'items of interest'

"He'd followed his son every step of the way and at his moment of victory in the U.S. Open on Father's Day Rory McIlroy turned to his beaming father Gerry and embraced him. 'Happy Father's Day, dad - this one's for you,' he added after he was presented with the prize at the course in Maryland. It was a poignant moment and tribute to his father who had made so many sacrifices to help his son achieve his dream. For four years, his father worked 100 hours a week, cleaning toilets and showers — one of the three jobs he held — while wife Rosie clocked on for the night shift at a factory. In stunning the world of golf with his eight-shot victory, the 22-year-old star from Northern Ireland became the youngest U.S. Open  champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and his win follows countryman Graeme McDowell’s victory a year ago. Happy Father's Day: McIlroy celebrates his eight-stroke victory with his dad, Gerry, on the 18th green . Teamwork: The sheer joy and pride on his father's face is plain to see at Rory's moment of victory . 'Tastes good!!! wrote McIlroy when he posted this picture of himself drinking from the trophy on Twitter . McIlroy led the tournament from the first day, breaking records – many of them belonging to Woods – as easily as he broke par. Close . friend McDowell passed the  trophy to McIlroy with fulsome words of . praise. He said: ‘It’s just phenomenal – you run out of superlatives to . describe what he has done this week. He’s decimated a field. I’ve been . waiting for this to happen. He’s that good, there’s no doubt about it. ‘I first heard about him when he shot 61 at my home course in Portrush. 'You hear rumours about people and good players come and go, but this kid was something a bit special.’ McIlroy’s masterclass was reminiscent . of his boyhood idol Woods’s domination of the 2000 U.S. Open when he . won by a record 15 shots at Pebble Beach. McDowell added: ‘He’s potentially the next Tiger Woods – he’s that good. It’s great to see him fulfilling his potential.’ What a feeling: McIlroy celebrates with the U.S. Open trophy after the first major win of his career . That winning feeling: McIlroy takes a celebratory hug from close friend Graeme McDowell after sinking the winning putt . Eyes on the prize: McIlroy plays fron the fairway on the 11th at Congressional during the final day of his record breaking round . The new Tiger?: McIlroy's stunning round has been compared to Tiger Woods's career-defining U.S. Open triumph in 2000, aged 24 . The victory marked an incredible transformation for McIlroy, who just two months ago had capitulated at the U.S. Masters in front of his army of loyal fans. At Augusta in April, McIlroy had surrendered a four-stroke lead on the final day with a disastrous round of 80. But the Masters meltdown is now a distant memory for McIlroy, who carded a masterful 16 under par - shooting 268 over four rounds - smashing the previous course record held by just four players including Jack Niclaus and Tiger Woods. After raising his arms in triumph on the 18th hole, the young star immediately paid a touching tribute to his father Gerry. Leading the field: The Belfast star dominated the U.S. Open from the early stages of . the tournament and eventually smashed the overall scoring record . Watch and learn: Y.E. Yang of Korea, who finished third, watches as Rory McIlroy tees off on the second hole . McIlroy said: 'I could have holed a couple more putts today. 'Happy . Father's Day dad, this one's for you. But I have to mention my mum as . well, who's back home watching. I can't thank them enough. 'As . Graeme [McDowell] said last year there will be a few pints of the black . stuff going down tonight. I know my friends will be out partying and I . can't wait to get back and join them. 'But . the whole week has been incredible. I know how good Tiger was at Pebble . in 2000 and I went out today to try and emulate him in some way. 'Augusta . was a valuable experience. I knew what I needed to do today to win. I . put a few new things into practice and it paid off.' McIlroy, 22, came to prominence in Northern Ireland at an early age. Local boy done good: Members of Holywood golf club, Northern Ireland, cheer McIlroy's progress on the triumphant final day . Distant memory: The record-breaking triumph for McIlroy made up for his heartbreaking collapse in April's U.S. Masters . In July 2005, shortly after turning 16, he went round Royal Portrush on the region's dramatic North Coast in a course record. He became European amateur champion the following year - it qualified him for The Open - and reached number one on the world amateur rankings. The sportsman, from Holywood, Co Down, has won as a professional in the Dubai Desert Classic and the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina. He was third at the US Open last year and third in the last two US PGA Championships.

"US Special Forces soldiers injured on the battlefield could soon be put into 'hibernation' until they can be moved to safety, it has been revealed. The US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) is providing $550,000 to fund a radical new drug being developed by Australian scientists. It can put people into a 'survival window' low enough to reduce blood loss, but high enough to prevent brain injury. The US Special Operations Command plans to use the drug to put injured soldiers into a 'survival window' low enough to reduce blood loss, but high enough to prevent brain injury. The JCU team is developing a two-stage treatment. The first shot will rescue the casualty during the first few minutes of severe haemorrhage and head trauma. The second shot is designed to stabilise them for longer periods ahead of evacuation. Experts say the drug therapy they're working on may be the first big advance in treating battlefield casualties since the Vietnam War. Professor Geoffrey Dobson and Research Associate Hayley Letson from James Cook University's Division of Tropical Health and Medicine have spend seven years developing the technique. The treatment targets what battlefield surgeons call the 'platinum ten minutes' after a soldier is wounded . He said the better known 'golden hour' is a meaningless concept in far-forward military environments. 'During the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, more than 87 percent of all deaths among allied soldiers occurred in the first 30 minutes, before they could get to a hospital. 'Nearly a quarter of these, almost a thousand people, were classified as having potentially survivable wounds. Time was the killer,' he said. 'The problem is, after a soldier suffers catastrophic blood loss and brain injury, what is a good treatment for the body is not good for the brain and vice versa,' said Dr Dobson. 'If you aim for too high a blood pressure, the casualty will bleed to death, and if you aim too low the brain will be irreversibly damaged. 'It's a double-edged sword. 'But if we can dial in the right blood pressure it will be a world first and has the potential to save many lives on the battlefield.' The JCU team is developing a two-stage treatment. The treatment targets what battlefield surgeons call the 'platinum ten minutes' after a soldier is wounded, and aims to keep them alive until they can be evacuated via helicopter. The first shot will rescue the casualty during the first few minutes of severe haemorrhage and head trauma. The second shot is designed to stabilise them for longer periods ahead of evacuation. 'The fluid can be administered quickly into the blood or bone marrow and it also reduces inflammation, coagulopathy (the bloods inability to clot) and whole body energy consumption,' Dr Dobson said. Dr Dobson said SOCOM became involved because of the progress the JCU team had made over seven years developing the process. 'SOCOM chooses projects that can be rapidly advanced into the field. We will also start talks on the regulatory process – including clinical trials leading to FDA approvals – within a year.' Dobson says the benefits won't be limited to US SEALs and commandos, but will automatically flow through to other western Special Forces units because of the close contact and co-operation between the organisations. The treatment could also be used to save lives away from the battlefield. Because the extreme environments in which Special Forces soldiers operate share many similarities with tropical, rural and remote environments, the JCU work has relevance to pre-hospital medicine and aeromedical transport in many regions around the world.","US Special Forces working with James Cook University in Australia .

The then 23-year-old's mother now faces deportation for trying to cover up his crime . The then 23-year-old was jailed for life in 2012 after being described as a 'mummy's boy' in court. His mother and British national father, Leigh Turner, were jailed for 27 months after lying to police about the incident and destroying a confession note their son had written. They were released in 2013 after serving half their sentence and have been living in the home where Miss Longley was killed since. Anita Turner, an Indonesian national, now faces deportation a year after being released. Under British law, the Home Secretary has a duty to deport any non-European foreign national sentenced to 12 months or more in prison. Anita Turner now faces being deported to Indonesia for telling police Emily died in her sleep. She and husband Leigh (right) were jailed for 27 months for trying to conceal their son's crime . The teenager's family said her killer's parents had shown no compassion throughout her murder trial . Emily was in her boyfriend's bedroom when he throttled her to death. Eventually police were called to the scene, where his parents told officers she died in her sleep or may have choked on a tight necklace . The 53-year-old is likely to claim the right to a family life under the European Convention of Human Rights in a bid to stay in the country. Mark and Caroline Longley said they were made to feel as though it was their fault their daughter had been killed . Her hearing will take place next month. Today Mark Longley said that his daughter's killer's family had shown no compassion towards them since the teenager was murdered. 'It’s just another added consequence of what her son did. If he hadn’t murdered Emily all the subsequent things wouldn’t have happened either. 'If she gets deported, well they brought it on themselves really. 'They perverted the course of justice so she’s suffering the consequences now. 'They were the ones whose house Emily died in so I expected some compassion at the trial but there was nothing from them. 'Anita Turner made us feel like it was our fault her son killed our daughter, so I don’t have any compassion for her at all.' British-born Emily moved to New Zealand with her family when she was nine. The aspiring model returned to the UK as a teenager to study, which is when she met Turner. Throughout her murder trial it was claimed the jeweller's son was a 'mummy's boy' who sometimes carried as much as £1,000 in cash. It was suggested he had threatened Emily before her death, and CCTV footage purporting to show him banging her head on a table in a nightclub emerged.","Anita Turner tried to cover up her son's murder of 17-year-old in 2011 .

"They say that necessity is the mother of all invention and need is never greater than at a time of war. So that may account for the unconventional method being used by these Syrian rebels to aim mortar shells. Members of the 'Ansar Dimachk' Brigade, which operates under the Free Syrian Army, were snapped on September 15 using the tablet computer to help fire a homemade mortar towards a battlefront in Jobar, a suburb of Damascus. Scroll down for video . Precise: using an accelerometer application, these rebels are ready to guide shells onto Assad's troops . Twitter speculation suggests that the soldiers might be using a spirit level application to determine the angle of fire, a key measurement which affects how far the shell will travel. In June, more tech-savvy troops from the same area were also filmed using maps on an iPad to aim weapons at Assad's forces. In the video soldiers can be seen setting up a mortar before turning on the Apple tablet in order to guide the ordinance to its chosen target.

It is not the first time during the Middle East's Arab Spring that improvisation has been required in order to win battles. In June 2011, during the siege of Misrata, Libyan rebels fighting the forces of Colonel Gaddafi set up workshops in order to manufacture homemade weapons including armoured vehicles, machine guns, and missile batteries. Molotov cocktails, made by inserting a flaming rag into a bottle of petrol or another flammable liquid, were also used during the fighting. Pieces of broken mirror were also placed on corners allowing rebels to watch for Gaddafi's snipers without being shot.

In Syria Bashar al-Assad has said his country will hand over chemical weapons to the UN to be destroyed after a Russian peace plan was agreed by US Secretary of State John Kerry. The agreement will put an end to American threats of military intervention for the time being. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has also said that leaders may need to be forced rather than urged to the negotiating table to hold a peace conference over Syria's future. Lavrov blames rebel leadership as being the main opposition to talks, though it is unclear how he would force them to attend. After talks in Paris on Monday, French President Francois Hollande's office said the three Western permanent members on the Security Council - the United States, Britain and France - agreed to seek a strong resolution that sets binding deadlines for the removal of Syria's chemical weapons.","Rebels in Jobar have been pictured using an iPad to aim shells .

"France branded the British as ‘hypocrites’ yesterday over David Cameron’s demands that Paris abandon its £1billion warship sale to Russia. The Prime Minister says it would be ‘unthinkable’ for French president Francois Hollande to go ahead with the supply of two helicopter carriers to Moscow. European leaders have been under intense pressure to impose tough sanctions on Russian – or risk repeating the mistakes of Nazi appeasers in the 1930s. But Mr Hollande has vowed to press on with the deal, with an ally warning Mr Cameron that he should ‘start by cleaning up his own back yard’. Scroll down for video . French President Francois Hollande has vowed to press ahead with selling warships to Russia, despite criticism from David Cameron . Mr Cameron is pushing for tougher sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his 'cronies' in attempt to force Moscow to reign in separatists in eastern Ukraine . Tribute to the victims: Barack Obama visits the Dutch Embassy in Washington to sign a book of condolence . Asked on Monday whether France should pull out, Mr Cameron said: ‘Frankly in this country it would be unthinkable to fulfil an order like the one outstanding that the French have. ‘But we need to put the pressure on with all our partners to say that we cannot go on doing business as usual with a country when it is behaving in this way.’ In response, Jean-Christophe Cambadelis, head of Hollande’s ruling Socialist Party, said: ‘Hollande is not backing down. He is delivering the first (ship) despite the fact he is being asked not to. ‘This is a false debate led by hypocrites. When you see how many (Russian) oligarchs have sought refuge in London, David Cameron should start by cleaning up his own back yard.’ Tougher sanctions have been proposed in an . attempt to force Mr Putin to rein in the separatists in eastern . Ukraine. After an emergency summit in Brussels, Mr Cameron hailed an . agreement in principle to widen measures against Mr Putin’s ‘cronies’ and to consider targeting Russia’s defence sector. But Lithuania’s . president reflected growing anger in former Soviet countries at the . failure of EU leaders to move decisively following the downing of flight . MH17. ‘If European states keep on acting so indecisively, this is a . direct invitation for the aggressor to be more aggressive and go . further,’ said Dalia Grybauskaite, condemning France for pressing ahead . with the Mistral sale. New British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (right) speaks to Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski at a Foreign Affairs Council meeting at the EU Council headquarters in Brussels . Russian President Vladimir Putin last year teased David Cameron about the influx of wealthy foreigners into London. Britain was dismissed as 'a small island’ by his spokesman, who claimed nobody pays attention to it – except of course the Russian ‘oligarchs who have bought Chelsea’. That does not mean that every wealthy Russian in London now faces the prospect of sanctions. But it does raise questions about the UK government's willingness to accept their millions into the Treasury's coffers. ‘In the 1930s, Nazism wasn’t stopped, and now . aggressive Russian chauvinism isn’t stopped and that resulted in the . attack against a civilian plane.’ Yesterday, the EU threatened . Moscow with broad economic sanctions if it failed to muzzle pro-Russian . separatists fomenting chaos in Ukraine – but stopped short of any . immediate action to punish the Kremlin. Philip Hammond, Britain’s new . Foreign Secretary, had called for an immediate arms embargo, while . Britain and Germany also brandished lists of names of pro-Putin . individuals and firms they want targeted. EU foreign ministers agreed to . draft a new set of names by tomorrow to be added to the 63 individuals . and entities already targeted. The latest move could mean a big increase in asset freezes and travel bans. EU leaders also agreed to prepare further options, including a potential arms embargo and broader sanctions against Russia’s energy and financial sectors. Many of Russia’s billionaire businessmen are said to be ‘horrified’ at the prospect of crippling economic sanctions but are too terrified of Mr Putin to say so openly. There was a suggestion last night that the threat of sanctions is already having an impact on Russian oligarchs. Asked if there was any evidence of assets being moved out of London, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The measures which have been taken with regard to individuals and entities has got a correlation with some of the financial flows we have seen across Europe, including here in London. 'That’s certainly the case.’ Of the Brussels talks, Mr Cameron said: ‘We are making progress. 'Other countries of Europe can now see that this lethal cocktail of allowing weapons and armed personnel to go into eastern Ukraine and support separatists has ended in this appalling tragedy.’ Mr Putin last night declared that Russia would strengthen its military capability to ‘counter Nato activity’ in Eastern Europe.","Prime Minister insists all EU countries must accept impact of sanctions .

"A police force making cuts of £50million is using unqualified detectives to investigate serious crimes because of a 'critical' shortage of staff. A whistleblower said officers had been moved into the Criminal Investigation Department in Brighton, West Sussex - which deals with murders and rapes - without taking compulsory detective exams. Sussex Police has now admitted officers had to be moved into Brighton CID 'temporarily' to keep up the numbers, prompting a warning from the county's Police Commissioner. Shortage: Police in Brighton (pictured) admitted they were facing what they called 'challenging times' The whistleblower reported his concerns to local newspaper the Brighton Argus. There was a 'critical shortage of police officers across the entire Brighton and Hove division,' the anonymous detective said. He added: 'Officers are having to be drafted in from other departments with almost no notice and with many of these officers not even having passed the detectives exam - a national requirement - and with little or no additional training to prepare them for dealing with the serious crimes investigated by CID. 'It is not uncommon to see my . colleagues on the verge of tears because they are under so much pressure . and stress and have more work than they can cope with. Under stress: A whistleblower said many colleagues were close to tears (file photo) 'This is nothing short of scandalous and not only puts the public at increased risk but the officers themselves.' A spokesman for Sussex Police admitted there were officers working in CID without the relevant qualifications but insisted they were all 'experienced investigators.' The spokesman also admitted the department was not operating at a 100 per cent staffing level. Superintendent Steve Whitton, of Sussex Police, said: 'Policing, by its very nature, requires a flexible approach. 'Often this means moving officers, all of whom are trained and competent to investigate crime, into different departments. 'This is why we have recently temporarily moved a number of people into our CID to ensure that we can continue to respond effectively to crimes such as rape and sexual assault. 'We are going through challenging times at the moment and having to make some difficult decisions regarding our resources but, as with all our decision making, the needs of the public always come first.' Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said she would investigate and public safety remains her highest priority. She added: 'Should I find any evidence that officer and staff resilience is affecting police performance I will hold the Chief Constable to account for this on behalf of Sussex residents.' Sussex Police came under fire by . inspectors last year after axing frontline officers in a bid to meet . government-imposed cuts of £50million between 2011 and 2015. Cuts of £50million: Sussex Police's headquarters. The force was criticised by inspectors last year . HM Inspectorate of Constabulary revealed the force was one of just three in the country reducing its number of frontline staff. 'The force is not managing to protect its frontline crime fighting capability as effectively as it should,' the report said. The report acknowledged the challenge was tough because Sussex had lower costs than other forces, but it added: 'There are early indications that the service to the public might be starting to diminish. 'Over the last two years Sussex has reduced crime at a substantially lower rate than most other forces.'","Whistleblower: Some in Brighton CID have not passed detective exams .

"David Cameron is to meet families of the British victims of the Malaysian Airlines flight shot down over Ukraine to discuss their 'tragic loss'. The Prime Minister is expected to invite grieving relatives of the 10 Britons killed in the disaster to a private meeting in Downing Street later this week. It follows warnings that the bereaved have been left ‘totally bewildered’ by their loss, including it taking four days for the bodies of the 298 people killed to start being moved from eastern Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron is to hold a meeting with families of Britons killed when MH17 was shot down over Ukraine . All 298 people on board the plane from the Netherlands to Malaysia were killed, including 10 Britons, and 193 Dutch citizens. Mr Cameron had said the priority was retrieving the bodies of those killed and securing the site for accident investigators. The process has been hampered by masked and armed pro-separatist militiamen, backed by Russia. Finally today a train carrying the bodies of 282 victims arrived in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv after the pro-Russian rebels agreed to release them. Dutch investigators leading a probe into the disaster were waiting to take charge of the bodies. From there, they will be put on planes - including a Dutch C130 Hercules and an Australian C-17 Globemaster - back to the Netherlands, where the doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur took off.

Yesterday Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed he had begun contacting the families of the 37 Australians killed in the MH17 disaster, adding that the families may never come to terms with their loss. 'These are families in very difficult circumstances, numb with grief and only beginning to come to terms with their loss,' he said. 'I don't want to cause anyone any individual grief but I want them to know the Prime Minister is available to them at any time.' Now Mr Cameron is expected to do the same. ‘I certainly am available to have a meeting with their families and talk to them about all the concerns they have,’ Mr Cameron said.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister would meet with any of the families if it would help them to do so. A meeting with some or all of the families could be held before the end of this week. Yesterday Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, urged Mr Cameron to ‘see the relatives of the British victims as quickly as possible, as they must be not only grief stricken but totally bewildered about what is happening’. Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron said: 'Alongside sympathy for the victims, there is anger. 'There is anger that this could happen at all; there is anger that the murder of innocent men, women and children has been compounded by sickening reports of looting of victims’ possessions and interference with the evidence; and there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has instead been fomented by Moscow.'

"Researchers have revealed one of the best preserved fossil sites ever discovered. The fossil site in Jehol biota in the north-eastern region of China has revealed scorched tissue, and 're-crystallized' sections of bone on fossil. Experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried Pompeii, Herculaneum and other cities, entombing people and animals in suspended death poses. Typical entombment poses of some of the Jehol Biota¿s animals - a Psittacosaurus (a) and primitive crow-like birds (b and c). The poses are similar to those displayed by other victims of erupting volcanoes throughout history. An ancient ecosystem known as the Jehol Biota existed in north eastern China about 120 million to 130 million years ago. It consisted of dinosaurs, mammals, early birds, fish, lizards and other creatures, with the red areas highlighted below having thrown up fossils. The animals lived among coniferous forests and lakes, in the shadow of volcanoes. Fossils of these animals are found in the Yixian and Jiufotang rock formations, embedded in layers of volcanic material. The team studied 14 fossils along with the chemistry and mineralogy of the volcanic rock and sediment that formed the animals final resting place. 'What we're talking about in this case is literal charring, like somebody got put in the grill,"" said George Harlow, a mineralogist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, one of the researchers of the study. 'The lower Cretaceous Yixian and Jiufotang formations contain numerous exceptionally well-preserved invertebrate, vertebrate and plant fossils that comprise the Jehol Biota,' the researchers wrote in Nature Communications. 'Freshwater and terrestrial fossils of the biota usually occur together within some horizons and have been interpreted as deposits of mass mortality events. 'The nature of the events and the mechanisms behind the exceptional preservation of the fossils, however, are poorly understood. ' The team believe that a massive volcanic eruption is to blame, when a scorching flood of rocks and ash petrified them. In the left picture, subtly waved, planar-lamination in sediments is seen overlying the skeletons of a Psittacosaurus (a,b) and a Confuciusornis. The right hand image shows closeups of bone with black char marks visible. Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under a deep layer of ash in an eruption of the Vesuvius volcano, which towers over the Bay of Naples in southern Italy, in AD 79. Just after midday on August 24, fragments of ash, pumice, and other volcanic debris began pouring down on Pompeii, quickly covering the city to a depth of more than 9 feet and causing the roofs of many houses to fall in. Fine-grained volcanic ash that encloses the remains probably formed moulds around complete skeletons, resembling the intact, buried corpses at Pompeii. Fresh, hot, dry, acid volcanic ash promoted burning, charring or mummifying of soft tissues, which, as a result, became more resistant to decay and better preserved. The carcasses were then transported into low-lying volcanic lakes, where they remained until humans unearthed them, the team believe. 'After examining and analysing sediments and residual fossils from several key horizons, we postulate that the causal events were mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions. 'Pyroclastic density currents were probably responsible for the major causalities and for transporting the bulk of the terrestrial vertebrates from different habitats, such as lizards, birds, non-avian dinosaurs and mammals, into lacustrine environments for burial. 'Terrestrial vertebrate carcasses transported by and sealed within the pyroclastic flows were clearly preserved as exceptional fossils through this process.' Though famous fish fossils have emerged from the region, only terrestrial fossils — birds, lizards, mammals — showed marks of transport by these volcanic pyroclastic flows, the team say. Fresh, hot, dry, acid volcanic ash promoted burning, charring or mummifying of soft tissues, which, as a result, became more resistant to decay and better preserved. Experts say the site is similar to the effect of the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried Pompeii, Herculaneum and other cities, entombing people and animals in suspended death poses.

"Justice Secretary Chris Grayling apologies to the Commons for the breach in confidentiality . Phone calls between dozens MPs and inmates have been recorded and monitored by prison staff, it emerged today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling issued an apology to the House of Commons after revealing the extraordinary breach, which dates back to 2006. Labour condemned the 'truly shocking' admission, as an independent investigation was launched by the Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick. MPs were told that the National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons across the country, had identified calls dating back to 2006 which had been recorded. It includes calls made by former Labour Justice Secretary Jack Straw and staff working for current Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes. Mr Grayling said he learned of the error last Wednesday, and had come to Parliament 'at the earliest opportunity'. In total, there are 32 MPs 'whose calls or those for their offices appear to have been both recorded and listened to', Mr Grayling admitted. 'For 18 of these MPs it appears the prison did not list the number as confidential and therefore the action was not taken to prevent recording.' He added: 'In a further 15 cases, members appear to have been identified correctly on the system as MPs, but due to a potential failure in the administrative process the required action was not taken by prison staff so the calls were recorded and appear to have been listened to, one member falls under both categories.' Prison rules state that communication between prisoners and MPs must be treated as confidential where the prisoner is a constituent of theirs. Mr Grayling said there is no evidence that information from the phone calls was passed on to anyone else and he did not believe it was part of a concerted attempt to monitor calls. The Justice Secretary stressed it was part of the routine checking process and mistakes may have been made. He told the Commons: 'I have as yet seen no evidence that information was passed on to anyone else, I don't believe this was part of a concerted attempt to monitor, it was simply part of the routine checking of this process to make sure nothing untoward was going on. 'But clearly again, it's something I'll be asking Nick Hardwick to confirm.' Mr Grayling said he believed all recordings have now been destroyed as they are only kept for a limited period. It emerged that a call made by ex-Justice Secretary Jack Straw and one by the office of Lib Dem justice minister Simon Hughes were among those recorded . Since improvements to the system in autumn 2012, only one MP clearly identified on prison lists has had their calls with prisoners recorded and listened to, he added. But there have been a small number of cases where phone calls between prisoners and lawyers were 'accidentally recorded', Mr Grayling said. He added: 'Whilst these have been dealt with individually with the prisoner at the time, I want to be confident that the safeguards for all confidential calls are satisfactory.' Mr Grayling said Mr Hardwick will first report at the end of the month to ensure that safeguards to stop phone calls being recorded or listened to are in place before publishing a full assessment of the facts in early 2015. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the revelations were 'truly shocking' and welcomed the investigation to be led by Mr Hardwick. He pointed out that some of the conversations may have taken place with prisoners who had not yet been convicted of a crime. He told the Commons: 'What you have outlined in your statement is a very serious breach of confidentiality involving MPs and their constituents. 'Many of us in this House will deal with constituents in prison, many of which I remind the House have not been found guilty of any crimes, on a regular basis as part of our duties as good constituency MPs, often our staff speak to prisoners on our behalf as they do with other case work. 'I am sure I am not alone in being shocked in hearing today's news that some of these conversations have been listened into, that some of these conversations have been listened into and recorded.' Liberal Democrat Justice Minister Simon Hughes said: 'This is a serious matter and everybody should be able to contact their MP confidentially, whatever their circumstances. 'The Ministry of Justice has appointed Nick Hardwick, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, to lead an investigation and I expect all officials to provide full and frank disclosures to this inquiry.'","Chris Grayling apologises to the Commons for confidentiality breach .

She wrote: . ‘My mum has nothing to be ashamed about.’ Angel told Daybreak: 'The horse is mine - I got given it by a friend. I pay for it, I pay rent, I pay bills, my mum doesn't pay anything at all. My mum is a very strong lady and she'll get over it (the hassle).’ But at the family’s current home which comprises two terraced houses with a connecting door, her mother said on Tuesday: ‘I will not talk about my horse or my kids.’ She lives with her children  Sophie, 22, .

Deal: Tewkesbury Borough Council bosses have sold a plot of land in Northway Lane, Tewkesbury, for around £210,000. In return, the housing provider is building the six-bed super-house along with 12 other homes . Grand designs: The plans for the family's plush new eco-home which the council has agreed to build . But her local council has arranged for a 1,850sq ft property to be built on a new housing development in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which is due for completion in June. The eco-home features the latest in energy-saving design. Frost also lives with partner Jake, who the neighbours say works as a lorry driver, Sophie’s two-year-old daughter Ashley, and Toby’s son Tyler. The family’s neighbours were outraged on Tuesday by the revelation that Miss Frost has enough cash to keep a horse. One said: ‘It’s disgusting. Owning a horse should be a luxury reserved for people who work and can pay for it themselves. ‘I don’t pay my taxes so some jobless baby machine can have a horse.’ A commentator using the name ‘Charlie76’ wrote on a Gloucestershire news website: ‘What an absolute joke! How can she afford horses? I can barely afford my dog and I work and have kids. Bloody disgraceful!’ The six-bedroom house in Tewkesbury half way through construction for the large family . Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, criticised the decision to build the family a new home. 'It's scandalous that so much time and taxpayers' money is being spent on one custom built mansion,' he said. 'Many people can't afford to buy their own home but have to opt for what their budget allows. 'Benefits are there to help those who need support, not subsidise a lifestyle that most people paying for them could not afford themselves.' Miss Frost’s daughter Angel defended her mother on a local news website. Spacious: The house comes with six bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen/ diner and two bathrooms . Money-saver: The new house will boast an energy efficient design to help keep Heather's energy bills down . Controversial: Councillor Derek Davies said it was a 'great example' of how the council works with housing providers to ensure affordable housing is provided for all our residents' housing needs . Using the name ‘AngelFrost’, she wrote: ‘Heather is my mum, she doesn’t work, but my father did, and he left, so why are you blaming my mother? ‘How could she possibly work with 11 children, you people have no right judging us. My mum has nothing to be ashamed about, the house we are mooving (sic) to in is smaller then the one we live in now, so its far from a mansion. ‘All us kids are as happy as could be, full of joy and full  of life, and as for thinking we are all going to be following in her foot steps (sic) you can think again.’ She said she was proud of her mother and blamed her absent father for failing to support the family. Miss Frost (pictured with one of her sons) first fell pregnant at just 14, to a 23-year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison, and has gone on to have ten more children . What a state: Miss Frost's current home in Gloucestershire is blighted by a bashed-up minibus, car and a skip . Councillor Derek Davies, lead member for built environment at Tewkesbury Borough Council, said: 'We have a duty to provide appropriate accommodation to people who are at risk of homelessness. 'Ms Frost's family has been living in temporary accommodation, consisting of two houses, for a very long time because there have been no other suitable properties available. 'This is an excellent example of the council working in partnership with registered providers, using public land to develop more affordable housing in line with government policy. 'We were able to sell land owned by the borough council to Severn Vale for them to develop 13 affordable homes, including this unit to meet the particular needs of Ms Frost and her family. 'By providing this larger affordable property, the two houses currently occupied by the family will be available for other families in need.'","Heather Frost, 36, lives in two houses which have been knocked together .

"From fashionable teenagers dressed in their finest clothes  to an older woman simply sitting on a bench with her walking stick, this series of photographs capture what people looked like when they ventured out to the mall three decades ago. The photo series called 'Mall Series,' offers a glimpse of the teenagers, staff, and shoppers who were nicknamed 'Mall Rats,' and enjoyed nothing better than spending hours in the shopping centers in the 1980s. They were taken by Massachusetts-based photographer Stephen DiRado in the downtown Worcester Galleria. Girls just wanna have fun: In this image, one girl sports a Mohawk hairstyle while the other shows a jacket with 'drug free youth' on it . His images exposed the sense of freedom that teenagers felt when they were allowed to hang out in the mall far away from their parents and close to their peers. Meanwhile, other images capture sales staff looking less than enthusiastic about flogging goods, like toothpaste and toothbrushes, to passing shoppers. DiRado's images also manage to show teenagers kissing behind a phone booth and a group of guys dressed in their finest clothes just to hang out. The photographer spent over three years painstakingly photographing  the hairstyles, clothes, and demeanor of the characters who roamed around the mall in the now-closed Worcester Galleria. His project begun in 1984, shortly after he got a job teaching at nearby Clark university,. He was given permission to photograph the mall and the people  in it and became such a regular fixture that  when the teenagers became rowdy, security staff would allow him to photograph the scene before they would step in to break up the trouble. For sale: These sales girls look more interested in gossiping than selling the toothbrushes and toothpaste spread out on their table . B-boys: These cool dudes are wearing 1980s Hip Hop fashion and are decked out in sneakers while one guy is wearing leather gloves . But he was asked not to photograph anything obscene, according to Feature Shoot, but still managed to amass a collection of thousands of images featuring characters of all ages. Matriarch: This woman is sitting on a bench with her walking stick and is wearing a fur coat to keep her warm whilst in the mall . Telephone boxes: These phone booths hide a pair of teenagers behind it who have stolen a few moments to be alone . The photographer believes that mall life in the 1970s and 1980s signified a potent shift for American youth culture. He said it was a time when the middle class Baby Boomers and Generation X came of age within the walls of shopping centers like Worcester Galleria. Security guards: The photographer became such a regular fixture in the mall that when the teenagers became rowdy, security staff would allow him to photograph the scene before they would step in to break up the trouble . Closed: This shop appears to be offering phones and other goods and invites customers to 'come in and see' what they've got . Boom box: This dapper guy has brought his boom box to the mall, maybe he hopes his stereo will help him attract the ladies . Day trip: Three women sit behind a disabled man in the Worcester Galleria, all seem to be making a day of it and are dressed in heavy coats . Reading: This woman is reading a newspaper on a bench in the mall, she appears to be reading about what's on offer in Sears . Ultimately, he believes his images also point to the beginning of the end of the 1980s mall scene. In a few short years, the Worcester Galleria would fail, its temporary occupants forced out as times changed. Today, his images provide a flashback of life over 30 years ago. Make-up: This teenager is applying thick lipstick to her lips and is showing off the latest in 1980s fashion along with a frizzy hairstyle . Small shops: This corridor appears to be where smaller boutiques were housed as a salesman shows off a selection of jewellery . Family: This mom and son have taken a break from shopping, but he is already wearing a classic 1980s jacket and bobble hat combination . Chic: This teenager has just finished a bite to eat and is wearing a leather jacket, wide glasses, and a broad belt over her pants .","The photo series called 'Mall Series' were taken by Massachusetts-based photographer Stephen DiRado .

"Stepping down: New UKIP councillor Eric Kitson won a seat in Stourport, Worcestershire less than two weeks ago but will quit over a series of anti-Muslim, anti-Jewish Facebook posts . A UKIP councillor has announced he will probably have to step down after less than two weeks because he posted a series of offensive messages about Jews and Muslims online. Eric Kitson, 59, has admitted 'I don't see how I can possibly carry on' after sharing racist cartoons and messages on Facebook. One included a picture of a nuclear weapon exploding emblazoned with the message: 'Some cancers need to be treated with radiation, Islam is one of them'. He also shared an image of a Muslim being roasted over a pile of burning Korans, as well as several anti-Semitic outbursts linking the Rothschild banking dynasty to Adolf Hitler. In one comment he said in reference to Muslim women: 'Hang um all first then ask questions later.' The councillor from Stourport, Worcestershire, has apologised to residents and party colleagues for his 'stupid' actions. But he denied being racist and claimed he had shared the material to expose the 'unacceptable' views they contained. He said: 'I thought I could handle politics, but I can't - I don't see how I can possibly carry on. 'I'm not a racist, all my friends know me better than that. 'What I wrote was stupid, but it wasn't racist. I am not racist. I'm the only white guy on my local five-a-side football team. 'I wanted to show people this is bad, this is wrong. What I should have done is write something on them about how bad it is but I didn't. 'To say I have been stupid is mild. 'I do not agree with the comments and I have not got a racist bone in my body. I went to school with a lot of young Pakistanis and Indians and I have had wonderful Muslim friends over the years.' Kitson, who joined UKIP a year ago, also apologised to his colleagues. He said: 'What can I say to them? The hardest thing to do is say sorry. Upsetting: Kitson shared this picture originally from a supporters group of Dutch politician Geert Wilders . 'The people who know me - my family, friends, people I work with - have all supported me. 'It has made me ill - I cannot eat and I cannot sleep.' Kitson made a string of posts relating to Muslims and other ethnic groups. In another he called for a referendum to set up an English parliament, Britain's withdrawal from the European Union and the repatriation of 'six million migrants and refugees'. Kitson was elected to Worcestershire County Council less than two weeks ago. He received 1,385 votes to take the Wyre Forest seat on May 2 - beating rivals from the three mainstream political groups. UKIP said it is currently investigating the posts. A spokesman for UKIP said: 'We are aware of the incidents and we launched our investigation earlier this week. 'But until we have come to a full conclusion and we are satisfied our investigation is complete Eric will remain in his post.' West Mercia Police confirmed they have requested more information in relation to the incident.","Worcestershire councillor Eric Kitson, 59, has admitted will have to quit .

"The ice served in six out of ten of Britain’s most popular high street restaurants contains more bacteria than the water found in their toilets, an investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found. Scientific tests have shown that ice from branches of McDonald’s, Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Cafe Rouge and Nando’s all had higher levels of bacteria than samples of water taken from their lavatory bowls. Experts say it could be due to them being cleaned more often than the ice machines. None of the samples found presented an immediate health danger, but four contained such high levels of microbes the restaurants should be considered a ‘hygiene risk’, according to a Government-accredited laboratory. 'Poor hygeine': Ice served in six out of ten of Britain's most popular high street restaurants contains more bacteria than the water found in their toilets. Reporter Ben Ellery pictured in Basigstoke, Hants., with samples from Burger King . The samples from McDonald’s, KFC, Burger King and Nando’s all suggested ‘poor hygiene’ over their ice, the laboratory said. In the cases of Nando’s and Burger King, the levels of bacteria in ice were more than double than that which the scientists said they expect to see in drinking water. For the tests, staff were asked to provide a sample of ice in a sterile bag. A sample of water in the restaurant toilet was also taken by an accredited environmental health practitioner. The samples, obtained from branches of ten chains in Basingstoke, Hampshire, were then couriered in a fridge to Microtech Services Wessex in Bournemouth, Dorset, for testing. NANDO'S More bacteria in ice than toilets. Tests on ice water  at 22C: 2,100 organisms. Toilet water: 1,300 organisms. BURGER KING More bacteria in ice than toilets. Ice bacteria at 37C: 260 organisms. Toilet water: Within drinking water regulations. McDONALD'S More bacteria in ice than toilets. Ice bacteria at 22C: 1,400 organisms. Toilet water at 37C: 260 organisms. KFC More bacteria in ice than toilets. Tests on ice water at 22C: 1,100 organisms. Toilet water: Less than 1. CAFE ROUGE More bacteria in ice than toilets, but not above laboratory’s hygiene guidelines. Toilet water: Less than 1. STARBUCKS More bacteria in ice than toilets but within laboratory hygiene guidelines. PIZZA HUT Bacteria in ice at 22C: 430 organisms. Toilet water exceeded drinking water standards. PIZZA EXPRESS Bacteria in ice insignificant. Toilet water: 3,200 organisms  at 22C, highest in study. GOURMET BURGER KITCHEN Bacteria in ice insignificant. Toilet water: Within bacteria count guidelines. WAGAMAMA Ice bacteria at both temperatures less than 10 organisms. Toilet water at 37C: 160 organisms.All per ML . Experts said the samples from McDonald’s, KFC, and Nando’s showed that contamination was likely to have been caused by ‘environmental issues’, such as a dirty ice machine. The Burger King result suggested the cause was human contamination, likely to be from a staff member failing to wash their hands. The results have prompted some of the chains to review their cleaning procedures, although two companies disputed the findings. Dr Melody Greenwood, a former laboratory director for the Health Protection Agency, said the results show restaurants need to ensure staff are properly trained to handle ice. ‘This is a warning,’ she said. ‘It is easy to forget ice can carry bacteria because they think it is too cold for germs, but that is far from the truth. Nasty bugs such as E.coli can lurk in ice machines. In some cases, such as Nando’s, we found double the amount of bacteria we would expect to find [in drinking water]. This is caused by things such as a failure to clean machines and scoops used by staff.’ The samples were tested for pathogens and their total bacteria counts at 22C and 37C. Higher counts at 37C are often associated with contamination by human or animal contact, such as meat in the kitchen. Raised 22C counts are usually due to environmental organisms and can indicate a failure to clean ice machines. At 22C, Nando’s had the highest bacterial levels. The laboratory’s guidelines recommend no more than 1,000 organisms per ml of liquid. Nando’s had 2,100, McDonald’s 1,400, and KFC 1,100. At 37C, guidelines state that levels exceeding 100 organisms per ml show evidence of poor hygiene. Burger King was the only one to surpass the limit, with 260 organisms. Scientists say there is a satisfactory level of bacteria that can be higher than that found in toilet water. The ice quality at Starbucks and Cafe Rouge fell into this category. A Burger King spokesman said: ‘We are working with the franchisee to investigate the situation.’ A spokesperson for the franchisee that operates the KFC said: ‘We have retrained staff on procedures as a precaution.’ At Cafe Rouge a spokesman said: ‘We take such issues very seriously and have immediately taken actions to review the ice-making process at this restaurant.’ Tested: Ice from branches of McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Cafe Rouge and Nando's all had higher levels of bacteria than samples of water taken from their lavatory bowls . And a McDonald’s spokesman said: ‘The ice tested contained low levels of common bacteria considered acceptable and safe for consumption.’ Starbucks said the ice sample had inadvertently been contaminated by staff when they opened the sterile bag. A spokesman said: ‘CCTV footage confirms that it was contaminated before it was tested.’ A Nando’s spokesman said: ‘We challenge these results and do not accept that they demonstrate any failings.’","McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Starbucks, Cafe Rouge and Nandos tested .

"Fresh, green and innocent-looking, the neatly tied bunches of khat found in markets across the Horn of Africa look far from dangerous. But, as these photographs reveal, that is exactly what they are. Banned in the UK earlier this year, khat, a narcotic green leaf which produces a sense of euphoria in users, is a common sight on the streets of Yemeni capital Sana'a as well as other cities in the region. But with side-effects that include mouth disease, tooth loss and, in some cases, mental illness, the drug takes a terrible toll on addicts, which in some cases, include children as young as six years old. Scroll down for video . Destroyed life: A man who went mad thanks to the effects of khat addiction chained inside his home in the Ethiopian city of Harar . Dangerous: Those who don't go mad are at risk of losing their teeth like this man (right) who now takes a powder form of the drug . Euphoria: According to khat users, the amphetamine-like drug produces a euphoric high followed by a mild depression . 'In the mountainous regions of Yemen, it’s not uncommon to see children of six or seven chewing khat that was given to them by their fathers,' explains Eric Lafforgue, the photographer behind these images. 'The children follow their parents’ lead and end up addicted at an early age.' And the consequences of that addiction can be severe, whether being left penniless and unable to work or falling victim to drug-related mania. For those who do succumb to madness induced by khat, a life chained inside their homes awaits - psychologists and mental health institutions being in short supply in Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia. More still fall victim to gang violence - usually as a result of being unable to pay for their khat, which costs between $0.5 and $20 for a bunch, depending on the quality and freshness of the leaves. Other khat addicts turn out to be a danger to others. 'The stimulant properties of khat are commonly believed to improve efficiency, so it’s common to see laborers chewing while working,' explains Lafforgue. 'Like alcohol': Yemeni users such as this man say that using the drug is their equivalent of drinking alcohol . High: People high on the drug can be spotted courtesy of their enlarged pupils and erratic behaviour . Can't stop: For many, chewing khat takes over their lives - with some starting to chew the drug in childhood . Big business: Khat farming is worth £160m a year in Ethiopia alone, which counts the drug as its fourth largest export . Popular: As well as Somalia, Somaliland, Yemen and Ethiopia, khat is also popular in Kenya and Uganda, where it is known as miraa . 'The same goes goes for taxi and bus drivers but they often cause accidents when they fall asleep at the wheel after the euphoria fades.' But with an estimated 20 million users in the Horn of Africa alone, khat has become a big business - and one that shows no signs of slowing, thanks to the 500,000 farmers across the Horn of Africa and Arabian peninsula turning their land over to the drug. Unlike coffee, khat can be harvested twice a year and requires 30 per cent less water to grow - a key consideration in Yemen, which, according to hydrologists, is in danger of becoming the first country in the world to run out of fresh water. But with so much of the local economy dependent on khat, any change to demand can prove disastrous. Already, says Lafforgue, the effects of the UK ban are beginning to be felt in Ethiopia. 'For thousands of little farmers and traders in Ethiopia, the ban has already had a severe impact,' says Lafforgue. 'Khat was Ethiopia's fourth largest export, bringing in more than £160m in 2013 alone.' Painful: One of the nastiest side effects is tooth decay and mouth cancer, both of which this Somali addict has . Market leader: The 571 gang, which is thought to be led by a woman, is the market leader for khat sales . Attractive: Many Ethiopian women believe that chewing khat makes you more attractive to the opposite sex . Making money: More than 25,000kg of khat is sold each day in Ethiopia's Adaway Market alone . Tradition: In the tiny country of Djibouti, khat is still sold wrapped in traditional banana leaves rather than plastic bags . Busy: A khat market near the town of Harar in Ethiopia. From Harar, the drug is exported to destinations across the Arabian Peninsula . But not everyone is suffering. For the 571 franchise based in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa, business continues much as it always has. The largest supplier in the region, it sells 80 tonnes of khat every single day. 'They even own a plane to carry the khat to Ethiopia or to the refugees camps [in Yemen, Lebanon and Turkey],' explains Lafforgue. 'According to local legend, it is run by a woman who earns many millions of dollars a year from the drug.' But while the mystery woman behind the 571 franchise is benefiting from khat, for the millions of addicts living in the region, the future is considerably less secure. 'Many people are addicted to khat for life,' says Lafforgue. 'It has also had a huge effect on the environment because it is sold in plastic bags which litter the ground everywhere you go in Yemen and Somaliland. 'Outside of Sana'a, there are millions of plastic bags  littered about. The government tried to stop people doing it but nothing ever seems to work. In Yemen, you know you're approaching a town when you start seeing plastic bags everywhere.' Lucrative: There are an estimated 500,000 khat farmers across the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula . Different methods: In Yemen, where the desert heat wilts the fresh khat leaves, the majority of markets take place at night . Cash crop: Colourful plastic sheeting is used to protect a khat field close to the Yemeni town of Ibb . Popular: This variant of khat, known locally as chami, is grown on the Yemen-Saudi border and is widely considered to be the best . Environmental problems: Because khat is sold in plastic bags, suburbs are blighted with piles of discarded carriers .","Khat is a narcotic leaf that induces mild euphoria popular in Somalia, Yemen and Ethiopia  among others .
Drug was reclassified as Class C in the UK and banned in a ruling that came into effect last June .

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott says the process of bringing home the Australian victims of MH17 has started in Ukraine . The first stage in bringing home the 37 Australian citizens and residents who died on MH17 has started with the bodies of 282 victims arriving by train in Ukraine's Kharkiv where they will be prepared to be formally identified. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Operation Bring Them Home would be headed up by former defence chief Angus Houston, who also coordinated Australian search efforts for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. The refrigerated train carrying the dead has arrived in Kharkiv - in Ukraine's east - where Australian and Dutch representatives will prepare them for transport to the Netherlands for the identification process. The transportation and identification process in Ukraine and the Netherlands will involve consular officers, Australian Federal Police experts and air safety investigators. An Australian C-17 Globemaster plane will help transport the 282 victims' bodies to the Dutch city of Eindhoven. Despite Tuesday's progress, Mr Abbott warned there was 'still a long, long way to go'. 'After the crime comes the cover-up,' he told reporters in Canberra on Tuesday. 'What we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale, and obviously that has to stop.' Mr Abbott said he understood the families' frustration at the lengthy process, but it was something that needed to be done. 'I need to caution that this is necessarily a painstaking and methodical process that will take some weeks,' he said. Scroll down for video . Mr Abbott also wrote in the condolence book for the plane crash victims on Tuesday at Parliament House . 'As frustrating as this is, we do have to get it right. 'It would be terrible to compound families’ grief by risking the misidentification of their loved ones.' Mr Abbott also stressed the Australian Government's main objectives were 'to ensure the bodies are returned, the site is secured, the investigation goes forward and justice is done'. Also on Tuesday, Mr Abbott signed a condolence book for the victims on behalf of the nation, writing: 'Twenty-three million Australians share the sadness of those who mourn.' Carriages of death: A train carrying the remains victims of the Malaysia Airlines MH17 disaster arrives in the Ukrainian government-held city of Kharkiv . Journalists follow the train as it arrives in the city of Kharkiv, where the victims will be flown to the Netherlands . Mr Abbott said Operation Bring Them Home would be 'painstaking' but necessary as it would prevent wrong identification . The train arrived in Kharkiv on Tuesday night, carrying the bodies of MH17 victims from the crash site . The bodies will be flown to the Netherlands from Kharkiv to be formally identified by forensic and identification experts . Operation Bring Them Home started just hours after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop helped secure a unanimous vote in the United Nations Security Council to allow 'safe, secure, full and unrestricted access' to the Malaysia Airlines crash site for international investigators in a move to find out who is responsible for the tragedy. 'There must be a ceasefire in the immediate area around the site,' Ms Bishop told the Security Council. 'The victims must be treated with dignity, brought back to their homes and laid to rest.'All parties are required to fully cooperate with these efforts. 'Russia must use its influence over the separatists to ensure this. Russia must also use its influence to bring the conflict in Ukraine to an end.'

Mr Abbott's formal message of condolence to the victims' families on behalf of the nation . Former defence chief Angus Houston has been charged with the job to bring the bodies of Australians home to their families . Retrieving the bodies has been an arduous task, which took five days to secure after pro-Russian rebels finally agreed to release them. They will now be flown to the Netherlands, where the doomed Malaysia Airlines flight took off to Kuala Lumpur. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the first bodies would be flown to Eindhoven - in the south of the country - to begin a torturous identification process he warned could take months. After arriving in Eindhoven, the bodies will be taken to the Kaporaal van Oudheusden military barracks in Hilversum, about 100 kilometres away. 'As soon as a victim is identified first and foremost the family will be informed and no one else. That can take weeks or months,' Mr Rutte said. In the central Dutch city of Utrecht, a team of 150 investigators . has been pulled together to begin the grisly and painstaking task of . trying to identify the victims. They include police officers, military personnel, forensic dentists and other medics, who have been tasked with collecting samples from close relatives around the country to help identify the 193 Dutch victims. Jos van Roo, the team leader of the Dutch National Forensic Investigations Team (known as the LTFO), told the Wall Street Journal: 'We have been collecting DNA samples, hair, fingerprints, information about scars or tattoos or moles.' He said this information would then be handed the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) which will use sophisticated software called Bonaparte to match those samples to the victims. An employee from the Dutch airline company KLM reaches out into a sea of flowers at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam, where the doomed flight MH17 took off on Thursday .

Painstaking: Malaysian experts check debris at the main crash site of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines flight . The NFI said this process was completed in about 30 days during an investigation into a 2010 crash in Libya which . killed 104 people. But with nearly three times as many bodies to examine - and others yet to be found - it suggests this investigation could take many months. Mr . van Roo said the identification process had been so distressing, even for experienced . investigators, that the team is being assessed by a psychologist on a . daily basis. The . investigation has been all the more challenging after rebel militia were . accused of allowing the crash site's desecration and obstructing the . process of recovering the bodies of the 298 victims. In some cases, remains . have been left out for more than two days in sweltering heat and to . compound matters the refrigeration unit on the train carrying them to . Donetsk reportedly broke down. Ukrainian officials said 282 corpses have been found, along with 87 fragments from 16 bodies. But there . are fears some body parts may have been incinerated as aircraft . wreckage exploded, making identification even more difficult. Malaysian . Prime Minister Najib Razak said, in reference to his own citizens, that . following any necessary forensic work, the remains of Malaysian . citizens will then be flown home to Malaysia. The same process is expected to follow for the citizens of other countries. Pro-Russian separatists - who stand accused of bringing down the aircraft, possibly with a missile supplied by Moscow - bowed to a furious clamour for the bodies and black boxes to be handed to investigators five days after the crash. Mr Razak said the boxes were handed over to the Malaysian team in Donetsk at 9pm Ukraine time on Monday. The small handing over ceremony has finally solved the question as to what had happened to the two vital devices. It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data. Forensic experts at the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines Boeying 777, near the village of Grabovo. All flight recorders undergo tests to be able to survive accidents, as well as forceful entry. This includes drop tests, as well as fire and pressure tests. The law requires all flight solid-state recorders can survive these conditions . Tragic: A toy is placed at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove, eastern Ukraine . UK foreign secretary Philip Hammond said all the evidence currently available indicates that the surface-to-air missile which destroyed the MH17 was supplied by Russia . Mr Razak revealed that in recent days the team had been working quietly behind the scenes to establish contact with 'those' - a reference to the rebels - in charge of the MH17 crash site. The contact was finally made - but he made it clear it had not been easy. 'Under difficult and fluid circumstances, we have been discussing the problems that have occupied us all - securing vital evidence from the aircraft, launching an independent investigation and above all recovering the remains of those who lost their lives.' The Prime Minister said that in . another breakthrough an independent international investigation team . would be guaranteed safe access to the crash site. 'I . must stress that although agreement has been reached, there remain a . number of steps required before it is completed,' Mr Razak said. 'There . is work still to be done, work which relies on continued communication . in good faith. [Rebel leader] Mr Borodai and his people have so far . given their co-operation. 'I . ask that all parties continue to work together to ensure that this . agreement is honoured; that the remains of our people are returned, that . the black box is handed over, and that the international team is . granted full access to the site.

"The fourth alleged victim of a Republican businessman told the court today that he hit then raped her twice after taking her to his remote cabin. Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, faces multiple charges of rape, kidnap and sexual abuse of women he lured on dates. The 34-year-old woman was the final witness at Peterson's two-day preliminary hearing in Salt Lake City, Utah to decide whether there is enough evidence for him to stand trial. It was also revealed that she had met with the third alleged victim, who testified yesterday. The women found out that Peterson had made them both watch TV show Big Love - an HBO series about a polygamist with three wives. Scroll down for video . Grim discovery: The body of Gregory Nathan Peterson (above) was found by bail bond agents in an upstairs bedroom at the remote log cabin with a gunshot wound to his head . Final letter: Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, wrote a five-page, suicide note in the minutes before he killed himself in Utah after being accused of raping five women . Political power: Gregory Nathan Peterson (right) with Representative Jason Chaffetz during a Republican rally at his log cabin in Heber, Utah . Similar to the earlier witnesses, the fourth women said she met the Republican campaigner at a Mormon singles event, hosted by the LDS church, in March last year. She agreed to go on a date with him to the movies. However when they got into his truck, she told the court, he said he had a gun and ordered her to stroke his genitals and kiss his neck. When her tooth touched his skin, he slapped her. Peterson then drove the alleged victim to his cabin and played the HBO series before pushing her onto the bed and raping her, while saying: 'Tell me you’d be one of my wives', according to court details from the Salt Lake Tribune. The next day, the woman said Peterson dropped her at her car. She then drove to a friend's house and called the police. An examination showed she suffered vaginal and anal bleeding along with lacerations. Another woman sobbed in court on Tuesday as she told how . she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by Peterson, in a prolonged ordeal she described as 'torture'. Three women faced their alleged attacker in court on Tuesday. The . third woman to take the stand said she had met Peterson on Facebook in . June this year and the pair had messaged each other until he invited her . to a barbecue at his cabin in Heber City on July 1. Fear: Haley Hayes (left) said she met Peterson at a Mormon singles event but had been scared by his behavior. She is not connected with the case in any way . Shackled: The GOP activist is led into court where three of his alleged victims took the stand to face him . After having little contact with the woman at the event at his home, he called her the next day to ask her to a movie. The woman began shaking on the stand . and refused to look at the accused as she said that Peterson, who she . described as a 'monster', first became physical with her in the movie . theater. The . woman, who is originally from Brazil, said Peterson claimed to be a . powerful politician, then threatened to have her deported after he had . checked up on her status and found she was in the U.S. illegally. Peterson, . of Orem, had previously let her know that he kept a gun in the glove . compartment of his car. The GOP activist then drove the woman to his . cabin where he verbally abused her before exposing himself to her and . sexually abusing her. According to the Desert News, she told the court: 'He would flip me over and would change positions like I was an object and he could do whatever he wanted. I was afraid of his aggression and violence.' The businessman refused to let the woman go instead driving her to his mother's house in Lewiston where he forced her to work for free while making threats. She was kept at the home from July 3 to July 5. The victim said that she accompanied Peterson to various places without trying to escape because she felt so threatened and that he had told her he 'could make her disappear'. He finally released her after two days. Peterson sat in court and listened intently to each . woman's testimony, at times becoming animated and at one point . interrupting a prosecutor. Two other women who spoke in court said that they had met Peterson on Mormon dating website LDSsingles.com. Attack: An interior shot of Peterson's cabin where he allegedly carried out the assaults . Remote: Peterson's cabin in Heber, Utah where he allegedly raped women after taking them on dates . One woman arranged a date with Peterson on April 21, explaining that he looked like 'a great catch' in his profile and had come recommended by a Mormon temple. After a lunch date, the woman explained she had to leave, causing Peterson to become enraged, she said in her testimony. He followed her to her car to apologize and then followed her home. Feeling threatened, she allowed him into her home where he took her to the bedroom and began to touch her before exposing himself. Worried that he would become 'too angry', the woman finally managed to get him out of her home, she told the court. The final witness on Tuesday said she had also been attracted to his dating profile and agreed to a movie date with Peterson on December 10. The following day, he came to her home in West Jordan to take her to lunch but immediately carried her into the living room and lay on top of her on the couch, pulling up her skirt to sexually assault her. The woman told the court she repeatedly asked him to stop which he finally did but refused to leave her home until they had lunch. She attended hospital but said she hesitated to come forward with her story because 'he knew where she lived'. Several days later, the woman went to police to say she wanted to press charges. She reportedly waited two months for the West Jordan police department to return her calls but was discouraged by a detective because the case would be her word against Peterson's. West Jordan police department told MailOnline that they would never tell anyone not to press charges related to a sexual assault. A spokesman said that they worked with officers to make sure they were sensitive to victims' feelings. In general, the officer said that cases involving sexual allegations tended to be complicated but that they were sorry that any victim felt they had been discouraged. Wealth: One woman came forward to say she had been sexually assaulted by Peterson last summer but they did not have enough evidence to act . Five women in total have alleged Peterson raped or sexually assaulted them. The GOP stalwart has been . accused of attacks going back to April 2010 when one woman said he took . her to his remote cabin for lunch and insisted they watch a movie. He . then tried to kiss her and when she told him to stop, he exposed his . genitals. The mother managed to escape the lodge in Heber, Utah after showing Peterson that she had a holstered gun. The judge will decide whether he will stand trial on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping based on evidence heard at the two-day hearing. Defense attorney Cara Tangaro said that she would present information at Peterson's hearing 'about the strength, or lack thereof, of this case'. Peterson has been held on $750,000 bail at Salt Lake County jail since July 18. Peterson often used his cabin to hold Republican events which were attended by the GOP elite including Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love. The 37-year-old accountant has been deeply involved in GOP events in Utah. After receiving an MBA at Brigham . Young University, he went on to set up Peterson Wealth Management and . online trading site smartstocks.com. He . used his business connections to organize the Rocky Mountain . Conservatives Convention 2010 at his log cabin in Heber, which is . surrounded by three large reservoirs. High-profile: Mia Love (pictured with Peterson) was one of several Utah politicians to visit the log cabin in Heber. The Congressional candidate is not connected with the case in any way . Accused: Peterson is due to appear in court today in Salt Lake City where it will be decided if he is to be tried on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping . Three more women have also come forward to say that they were abused by Peterson but no charges have been filed although public prosecutors were not ruling it out. GOP members had distanced themselves from Peterson since the allegations emerged. Emails to the Utah Republican Party by MailOnline went unanswered. Shortly after Peterson was charged in July, one female acquaintance, who met the 37-year-old at a Mormon church singles event, said he had aggressively pursued her to go to his cabin. Haley Hayes told KLS: 'He really did corner me for an hour and a half. I know the situation those girls were in and I can't even imagine.' Peterson is due back in court on August 29.","Three women faced alleged attacker Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, in court .

"An 18-year-old black student who was shot to death by an off-duty St Louis police officer was attacked from behind and killed after he had collapsed, an autopsy has revealed. The finding corroborates witness accounts that Vonderrit Myers Jr was running away from the cops when he died, the family's attorney declared. And despite claims that the teenager sparked the conflict by firing at the officer, the Myers family legal team today insisted his DNA was not on the gun recovered from the scene. Killed: Vonderrit Myers Jr (right) died after he was shot to death from behind by a police officer on October 9 . Shot from behind: Dr Cyril Wecht explains where bullet wounds were found on Vonderrit Myers Jr's body . Fatal wound: He was rendered unconscious by the eighth shot which was dealt to the side of his head . Myers was gunned down by an unidentified 32-year-old in Shaw, Missouri, on October 9 - exactly two months after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by a cop less than 10 miles away. Today Dr Cyril Wecht, a private pathologist  employed by the family, said one of the eight bullet wounds would have ruptured the teenager's femur, causing him to collapse. He was shot another five times in his legs, and once in his groin, before he was rendered unconscious by the fatal wound dealt to the side of his head. The St Louis Police Department has maintained that Myers fired three shots at the officer using a gun that was recovered from the scene. However, although Wecht found gunpowder residue on Myers, he said it is not clear whether he had been holding a gun or was simply near the gun. Jerryl Christmas, the family's attorney, said: 'It is clear from the evidence from the autopsy report that this individual was shot from behind as he was trying to run away. There is no indication of any frontal shots.' He added that there was none of Myers' DNA on the gun recovered from the scene. Police have yet to comment on the findings. Earlier this month, police released details of lab tests by the Missouri State Highway Patrol that showed gunshot residue on Myers' hand, waistband and shirt. Police union leaders said the finding dispelled claims by Myers' family that he didn't shoot at the officer. Emotional: His family embraced as they listened to the distressing report of Vonderrit's fatal injuries . Defiant: Jerryl Christmas stated that the findings prove Vonderrit was running away from the cops as he died . Unclear: Wecht said it is not clear whether Myers was holding a gun or simply near a gun at the time. A report by police claims he fired at the officer and there was gunpowder on him but his DNA was not found on the gun . The family has claimed Myers was unarmed, and that the officer mistook a sandwich he was holding for a gun. St. Louis Police Officers' Association business manager Jeff Roorda cited other evidence against Myers during a news conference earlier this month: Social media photos that Roorda said show Myers holding three guns, one of them a 9 mm Smith & Wesson. Roorda said it is likely the gun Myers used to shoot at the officer. Roorda and St. Louis city medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham did not immediately return messages for comment Thursday. The shooting set off a new round of intense protests similar to those in Ferguson after 18-year-old Michael Brown's death. Both Brown and Myers were black. Both officers are white. A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether criminal charges will be filed against Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who shot the unarmed Brown. The St. Louis officer in the Myers shooting has not been named and is on administrative leave while the case is investigated. Nearby: Myers was shot less than 10 miles from where Darren Wilson (left) shot Michael Brown (right) Protests outside Ferguson police station: It comes as demonstrations over the deadly August 9 shooting of Brown, who was also black, by officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson have intensified . 'End racism': Thousands of protesters have stormed the streets of St Louis following the teenagers' deaths . The officer was off duty and doing patrol work for a security job in a neighborhood near the Missouri Botanical Garden in south St. Louis. Although he wasn't on police time, he was wearing his uniform and armed with his department-issued gun, which is common practice in St. Louis. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has said the officer became suspicious when Myers and the men with him started to run. A chase ensued and the officer and Myers got into a physical confrontation. After Myers pulled away, Dotson said, he went up a hill and started shooting at the officer. Ballistic evidence shows Myers fired three shots before his gun jammed, Dotson said. Police said they recovered the gun, which had been reported stolen in September.

"Britain was given the green light to block welfare claims from European ‘benefit tourists’ yesterday following a landmark ruling by EU judges. In a major boost for the Government’s reforms, the European Court of Justice said jobless EU migrants cannot move around the continent living off state handouts – and have no right to move to another country if they cannot support themselves. It ruled against a Romanian single mother who moved to Germany without a job, and made no effort to look for work, but demanded benefits designed for jobseekers. The European Court of Justice ruled that national governments can limit access to jobless benefits . The ruling was widely seen as reinforcing Britain’s efforts to restrict benefit payments to EU migrants and was interpreted as showing that the UK can remove EU migrants if they cannot support themselves and are not looking for work. David Cameron heralded the ruling. ‘This is good news and a step in the right direction,’ he said. ‘The right to go and work in another European country should not be an unqualified right. There should be rules about restricting benefits.’ Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘This is an excellent ruling and supports our view that people coming to the UK who don’t have sufficient resources to support themselves and would become a unreasonable burden should not be able to access national welfare systems. ‘The case underlines that free movement is not an unqualified right and will have a major impact on the way the Commission interprets law in future.’ He said the ruling showed how the EU needed clearer rules to help countries keep control over ‘national welfare systems’. The case revolved around Elisabeta Dano, a 25-year-old Romanian single mother who moved to Germany in November 2010 with her five-year-old son and lived in her sister’s flat in Leipzig. She was capable of working but had never had a job in either Romania or her adopted country – and was not even looking for work. She also had a conviction in Romania for petty theft. While in Germany, Miss Dano received nearly £150 per month in child benefit and around £100 in ‘maintenance’ payments. Neither of these payouts was challenged by the German benefits office and were not considered by the European judges. Twice, the local job centre refused her application for ‘basic provision’ benefits worth around £300 a month to jobseekers. She made a court appeal and the case was referred to Luxembourg. The court rejected Miss Dano’s claim and made clear that her right of residence in the country was dependent on her having ‘sufficient resources’ of her own. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants to block access to the new Universal Credit for migrants . The 25-year-old Romanian mother at the centre of the court case had tried to claim benefits in Germany without properly looking for work. Elisabeto Dano was living in Leipzig with her son when she applied for benefits and her local job centre refused when she failed to take up jobs that were suggested to her. Both the job centre and a Leipzig court said that Dano, who moved from Germany in 2010 to live with her sister, 'had not really been looking for work.' Dano appealed her case all the way to the European Court which today ruled: 'States must have the right to refuse social benefits to unemployed migrants. She did not have sufficient means of support when she moved to Germany,' and therefore could not justify her right to remain. It means she could not bring a case against the authorities based on EU anti-discrimination rules, the judges ruled. It also declared that free movement rights are dependent on migrants not being an ‘unreasonable burden’ on the host country’s social security system. The judges said Miss Dano had not looked for a job and did not have enough money to look after herself. As a result, she could not claim a ‘right of residence’ in Germany and use its welfare system as her ‘means of subsistence’. They declared: ‘A member state must have the possibility of refusing to grant benefits to economically inactive Union citizens who exercise their right to freedom of movement solely in order to obtain another member state’s social assistance although they do not have sufficient resources to claim a right of residence.’ EU migrants who come to Britain are banned from claiming jobseekers’ allowance for the first three months they are here. For the subsequent six months they are allowed to claim, if they can prove they are actively looking for work – although this is to be reduced to three months. After that, they must produce compelling evidence they are going to get work or they can be refused benefits. In January, ministers announced they were banning jobless migrants from claiming housing benefit. Stephen Booth, of the Open Europe think-tank, said: ‘This ruling reinforces many of the changes to the UK rules which the Government has already made. However, it doesn’t change the fact that EU migrants working in the UK on low incomes immediately gain access to in-work welfare such as tax credits and social housing. ‘The UK should therefore continue to seek changes to EU law to ensure that benefits are only paid to those EU citizens which have made a contribution in their new country.’","Landmark ruling paves the way for tighter controls on access to benefits .

"Javier Hernandez will finally have his chance to impress new Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal after joining up with the team's tour of America. The Mexican international reported back for pre-season training later than most of his club team-mates after his country reached the World Cup second round last month. Hernandez's arrival in Los Angeles was announced by the club's official Twitter account on Wednesday ahead of their opening pre-season game against LA Galaxy. Welcome addition: Javier Hernandez has joined up with Manchester Unite'd pre-season tour of America . In action: Hernandez (right) had an extended holiday after playing for Mexico at the World Cup . United face their MLS opponents at the Rose Bowl Stadium on Thursday before heading to Denver, Washington DC and Detroit during their pre-season tour against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. The Red Devils have spent heavily already this summer on Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, and the Old Trafford outfit are expected to splash the cash some more as they look to return to the top of English football - after finishing a disappointing seventh in the league last season. Speaking ahead of Hernandez's arrival, Van Gaal reiterated his intention to give all his squad a chance to prove themselves in the North American tour - including the Mexican. Asked directly at a press conference whether he would keep Chicharito, van Gaal replied: 'I have to see if he performs how I want. 'Now I can only see what he has showed under the guidance of another coach. 'He will arrive and I will meet him, we will train and after that he will perform in a match and then I can say something about that.'

"Sharks who spend too much time in the sun get a tan, researchers have discovered. However, they do not appear to suffer from skin disease, raising hopes that shark skin could hold the key to beating skin cancer. 'As far as I'm aware, sharks appear very robust to skin damage and disease,' said Michael Sweet, a researcher in the School of Biology at Newcastle University's Newcastle Institute for Research on Sustainability. They may look like ferocious predators, but skincare is important to sharks, researchers have found. Australian scientists found the animals have protection in their skin that stops them suffering skin disease, even though they can get a tan. 'I don't know what makes shark skin so special, but it definitely needs to be studied. 'There have been a lot of attempts to induce melanomas in sharks to no affect.' Researchers hope that if they can find the secret of how shark skin protects itself, it could be used to create a 'shark lotion' to protect human skin. Another recent study, undertaken by the California State University Shark Lab, also looked at tanning in sharks. Hammerhead shark pups held in a shallow clear seawater pond at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology darkened after several weeks, where UV levels are 600 times greater than those in their regular habitat of Kaneohe Bay. An opaque filter was placed over the pectoral fins of untanned sharks to cut out UV light, to determine whether the darkening was due to solar radiation. 'Areas of skin from under the opaque filter were untanned, whereas all other skin exposed to direct sunlight was considerably darker, resulting in distinct 'tan lines', the researchers said. This Great White Shark could hold the key to improved skin protection for humans, researchers hope. 'Our experiments demonstrated that the sharks were truly sun-tanning and that the response was, in fact, induced by the increase in solar radiation, particularly UV. 'These sharks increased the melanin content in their skin by 14 percent over 21 days, and up to 28 percent over 215 days.' The researchers said the only other animals known to suntan are mammals.","Australian team found shark skin simply changed from brown to black in the sun .

"Police in Washington have been caught on tape letting their fellow officers off the hook for speeding - because they were running late for a conference. A lengthy recording by a regular driving listening in on the police scanner picks up the cops spotting patrol cars roaring down a 60mph freeway at speeds as high as 86mph - then laughing it off. The conversation took place between ground-based officers and a Washington State Patrol plane running a speed trap on Highway 2 near Wenatchee, around three hours east of Seattle. Scroll down for video . Coming up behind you: Blogger Bill Gillam filmed a police car approaching him from behind then roaring past - around the same time State Patrol officers were chatting about not taking action against speeding police . Double standard: Officers over the radio could be heard laughing off the officers' speeding. One patrol car was going at 86mph on Highway 2 near Wenatchee, Washington . At first the airborne officer spots a white car overtaking traffic but doesn't clock the speed until he works out 'whether we want it or not', the video. The footage, uploaded to YouTube by blogger Bill Gillam, then records a second officer being clocked at 86mph - 26mph over the stated 60mph limit for the stretch. But, rather than take action, the two officers chuckle to one another and describe the car roaring down the highway as a 'pretty good one'. As more and more officers speed by it dawns on the two that they are all headed to a drugs conference in nearby Chelan - which starts at midday. The footage was recorded around 10.30am. The airborne officer, nervous about the speeds, seems to suggest taking action at one point. 'Late for conference': The officers joke over the airways about mentioning the speeding to the officers themselves - but concede it wouldn't make them many friends . On their way: The footage was filmed on Highway 2 outside of Wenatchee, Washington (highlighted). The cops were on their was to Chelan (top right of the map) He tells his colleague: 'I don't know if it matters or not but all the ones I'm not calling the speeds at have been over 80.' But the response bats away the prospect of issuing any tickets - as would happen to normal motorists - and said that the issue could result in 'a little announcement to slow down next time' at the conference. Even though later in the video one motorcyclist's behavior is described as 'unsafe' when he overtakes somebody at 72mph, the officers seem more concerned the prospect of being unpopular than taking any action. When it is suggested that officer in the plane fly to the conference and confront the speeding officers, he jokes: 'I'm sure I'd make lots of friends.' The Washington State Patrol has admitted the video, dated October 8, is legitimate. After the double-standard emerged, the department also said it would void any tickets issued to motorists over the two-day period of the conference, KIRO-TV reported. Spokesman Bob Calkins said: 'Typically we don't stop what we know to be a police vehicle because they could be on their way to an emergency that we don't know about'. The KVI radio station reported that he said: 'We learned about the video and we understand how it would make people fee. If they're not going to an emergency they should obey that the rest of us obey.'","Blogger recorded police cars zooming past and overhead radio chat .

Torquay United mascot Gilbert the Gull is alleged to have sworn at his own fans and challenged them to a fight . One wrote: 'Around five minutes after Grimsby scored their third, Gilbert came over to us and shouted: ""Where’s the drummer?"" Steve Jegat denies swearing at Torquay supporters . 'We all thought he was having a laugh, but then he called us a ""bunch of c****"" and after a few words exchanged he waddled off back to the Family Stand. 'At the end of the game, Gilbert came over again and in front of us on the pitch, he gave the ""come on, then"" body language towards us and wouldn't stop until hiding behind the stewards and again waddling off as we moved towards the exits. 'I (and many others) complained to the stewards about this and I personally spoke to Andrew Candy about this issue and he will be having a word. We have the worst mascot in football.' Another supporter added: 'The mascot was, and no doubt about it, offering fans on to the pitch for a fight. 'What would have happened to the club if 10 or more decided to take up the mascots offer and jumped over the wall and on to the pitch?' The man inside the costume, however, Steve Jegat, insists he did not swear or gesture to fans at the Conference match. 'Basically after Grimsby scored their third goal I went over and said ""where’s the drummer gone?"" and ended up getting a load of abuse. 'The fans on that side had just given up. But I didn’t swear like they were trying to say. 'I went and told the stewards I’m more welcome at the away end. I even had a load of abuse on Gilbert’s Facebook page when I got home.' Torquay  have cleared him to resume his duties at Plainmoor but banned him from the Popside home stand . Torquay United chief executive Andrew Candy confirmed the club were investigating the incident. Jegat, however, has been cleared to continue acting as mascot at Plainmoor but the dad-of-two has been banned from the Popside home stand to avoid further trouble. 'There was an exchange of views between Gilbert and the fans in the Popside,' the chief executive said. 'Gilbert was trying to generate some support and get the fans behind the team but it appears that there was a small altercation with the fans. 'There was no malicious intent in what was said but things were said that, in hindsight, should not have been. 'Gilbert has been spoken to and been told that this should not have happened and that this will not happen in the future.'","Torquay United's Gilbert the Gull spotted arguing with fans during a match .

"A video that was filmed over the summer shows a New York City police officer threatening a teen just moments before knocking him out - and all reportedly over a cigarette. Lawyers for Marcel Hamer of Brooklyn, New York, claim the 17-year-old was walking home from school on June 4 when a plainclothes police officer stopped the boy, believing the cigarette he was smoking was marijuana. It is uncertain what happens immediately after the boy was stopped, but as the video shows, it ends with the officer hitting Hamer so hard as he lays on the ground that the young boy appears to be knocked unconscious. Pleading: Marcel Hamer was threatened and hit by an unknown officer during an incident that happened on June 4 of the year (above) Video: Hamer's friends taped the incident, which shows the officer asking the boy if he wants to get 'f***ed up' before hitting him . Now, his family is saying the young man has suffered from headaches, dizziness, and memory loss since the incident. The video opens with Hamer laying on the ground and pleading with the officer that it was 'just a cigarette,' as the cop screams at the teen, 'Do you wanna get f***ed up?' The officer then goes even further, letting the boy's friends he is fine with them filming the incident, seeming to imply he does not believe he is doing anything wrong. 'Yeah, get it on film,' he tells the high school students. The sound of Hamer being hit is heard soon after and then the boy's entire body goes limp. A second man, who appears to also be an undercover officer, runs over and helps the first cop put cuffs on the seemingly unconscious teen, and at one point reaches into his back pocket as seen in the video, which was released by The Brooklyn Paper. The names of the officers are not known at this time. Brutality: After being struck by the officer, Hamer appears to go limp and seems unconscious . 'If what happened on this video was reversed and Marcel assaulted this officer in the same exact manner, Marcel would be prosecuted, and this officer should be prosecuted for what he did,' said attorney James Ross, who is handling the family’s civil suit. He added that Hamer was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and pleaded guilty to a violation. The NYPD said the incident is under investigation by the department’s Internal Affairs Bureau.","Marcel Hamer of Brooklyn, New York, was walking home from school this past June when an officer stopped him believing he was smoking marijuana .

"A Swiss wildlife park has come up with a slightly bizarre solution to overcrowding - simply eat the animals. The Langenberg Wildlife Park near Zurich admits it does not have sufficient space for all its wild boar and deer, so the surplus exhibits are being served up at the visitors' restaurant. Just metres from where the animals once frolicked in fields and forest land, visitors can enjoy dishes such as braised wild boar,  venison in cognac sauce, boar sausages and wild deer carpaccio. The visitors' restaurant where the menu includes braised wild boar, venison in cognac sauce, boar sausages and wild deer carpaccio - made using animals from the wildlife park . There is no charge to visit the 4.6 square mile park which is located around nine miles south of Zurich and receives roughly half a million visitors each year. It has 16 native animals including bears, elk, lynx, wolves, European bison and an endangered equine species called Przewalski's horse. The park admits killing and serving 49 deer and 10 wild boar since 2012, despite having resettlement projects for other animals. The starter menu offers guests wild deer carpaccio with warm mushroom salad, Arugula, shaved cheese and herb vinaigrette for £17.30 . The main dishes include a Braised Roast wild boar with mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables for £18.30 and the Venison in cognac sauce with Calvados apples and Frühlingsspätzli is priced at £25.80. The Langenberg Wildlife Park near Zurich admits it does not have sufficient space for all its wild boar and deer . The park has admitted killing  49 deer and 10 wild boar to serve up at their visitors' restaurant since 2012 despite having resettlement projects for other animals . The wildlife park's restaurant has spurred an online petition which has resulted in over 100,000 signatures calling for the zoo to end the killing of healthy animals. Visitor reviews on Tripadvisor have condemned the park for eating its animals. One user said: 'Loved the animals but didn't want to eat them thanks. 'We were somewhat perturbed and upset to find that some of the animals from the Zoo are served as food in the restaurant.' Martyn Griffiths from European animal welfare group Eurogroup for Animals said: 'It's bizarre, the whole purpose of a wildlife park is to protect animals, not make them a food item. A comprehensive list of dishes available to visitors to the park, which includes some homegrown ingredients . 'We're disappointed they are taking this approach. 'It doesn't seem sustainable to use these wild animals as food for the restaurant, they should be preserving them not serving them up as food.' The menu does include a 'Meat Declaration' which states that the meat comes exclusively from the park. And the Langenberg park's restaurant gets a special mention on the Zurich tourist board's website for its 'delicious meat specialties'. Zoo spokesman Martin Kilchenmann said that animals were shot because of space restrictions. The Langenberg park's restaurant gets a special mention on the Zurich tourist board's website for its 'delicious meat specialties' - but not all visitors are too thrilled to see the zoo's exhibits on the menu . He said: 'It's not our goal to sell the meat in the restaurant. If the animals have offspring then we have to manage the numbers. 'It's not so easy to control the breeding of deer and boars. We're not trying to make the menu look good.' 'It's hard to sterilize deer and boars and the animals' welfare is our most important goal. We don't want to harm them.

"An actor who once portrayed McGruff the Crime Dog has been sniffed out by a bona fide crime-fighting fido - and sentenced to over 16 years prison because of it. John R. Morales, 41, of Houston, was sentenced on drug and weapons charges this after police found more than 1,000 marijuana plants and 27 weapons, including grenade launchers, at two indoor farms. Morales wore the McGruff costume for the Harris County Sheriff's Association in the late 1990s, playing the famous 'Take a bite out of crime' dog. But he was arrested in 2011 when a proper police dog detected pot plants in Morales' trunk after he was stopped for speeding in Galveston, according to CBS Local. John R. Morales, 41, was sentenced this week to 16 years and three months in federal prison on drug and weapons charges after police found more than 1,000 marijuana plants and 27 weapons, including grenade launchers, at two indoor farms he owned in Houston . Herro: McGruff the Crime Dog was a cartoon bloodhound that was created in the early 1980s for the National Crime Prevention Council . McGruff the Crime Dog throws out the first pitch before the Toronto Blue Jays game against the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington on August 4, 1998 in Arlington, Texas . Authorities say officers found a clipboard with maps to the indoor farms. There were also marijuana seeds in the truck of Morale's Inifinity. A raid produced the arsenal of weapons and a multitude of marijuana. Defense attorney Ken Fesler II says Morales entered the drug trade to help sick relatives. On Monday, the former actor pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. Morales insisted that he was nonviolent, but U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore stated that: 'Everything I read about you makes you seem like a scary person.'

"When travelling abroad, the familiar sight of your favourite fast food menu can be a comforting thing. But beware. Selecting your favourite burger from the board above the counter could leave you at higher risk of suffering a stroke, heart attack or heart failure, depending on where you are. A new study has compared 19 iconic products from global retailers McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Subway, Kelloggs and Nestle, and found salt levels vary dramatically. Experts have criticised the 'chaotic approach' by manufacturers to the levels in various foods, which include a Big Mac, Cornflakes, KFC Twister burger, Bacon Double Cheeseburger and Fitness cereal. Scroll down for video . A Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger bought in Canada contains 2.85g of salt per burger, while one bought in the New Zealand contains much less salt at 1.92g of salt per burger . Their findings reveal that selecting a KFC Fillet Burger in the Middle East, for example, will mean a person devours three times as much salt than if they had eaten the same product in Malaysia. And choosing a Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger in Canada means you are consuming almost 1g more salt than someone eating the same burger in New Zealand. The international study, conducted by World Action on Salt and Health (WASH), highlights these vast disparities in salt content, prompting experts to call for the food giants to reduce their salt levels. The average daily recommended intake for an adult is currently 6g, but is set to reduce to 5g by 2025 on the advice of the World Health Organisation. Professor Graham MacGregor, WASH chairman, and professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, said reducing salt levels in food is 'the most cost-effective measure' known to reduce the number of people suffering a dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. A number of the retailers told MailOnline salt levels in food is a 'complex issue' which is 'influenced by a variety of factors, including culture and individual preferences', that are considered on a product-by-product basis. But while the variation may appear to be the result of different taste preferences, experts at WASH said the theory is disproved by the findings. A spokesman for WASH said: 'Global taste preferences cannot be blamed for the difference in salt content, as no one country consistently has the saltiest foods. 'For example, the USA has the most salty Kellogg's Special K, but the least salty Kellogg's All Bran.' Clare Farrand, international programme lead at WASH, said the study shows food retailers are able to make their products using less salt, but choose not to. A KFC original Fillet Burger in the Middle East contains 3.5g of salt per burger, three times as much as the same product sold in Malaysia, which has 1.05g of salt per burger . 'Manufacturers are clearly able to make products with less salt, but deliberately choose not to, despite salt damaging their customer's health,' she said. 'This study also highlights a lack of consistent nutrition labelling and portion size across the world which is adding to consumer confusion, as people cannot choose the less salty options, even if they want to. 'Consistent front of pack nutrient labelling should be provided on ALL products to allow consumers to make better-informed choices.' She said there has been a positive change over time, with salt levels falling in some products since WASH last conducted the study in 2006. For example, Kellogg's Cornflakes in Denmark and Belgium have seen salt levels reduce from 2.38g per 100g in 2006 to 1.30g in 2014 - a reduction of almost half the salt. A possible explanation is that the product is now being manufactured in the UK, where salt targets have been set, and sold in Europe. The WASH spokesman said: 'The fact that they (salt levels) are acceptable for consumers across Europe further highlights, quite clearly, that reductions in salt contents are not noticed by the population and can easily therefore be achieved across the world.' Another finding of the survey was that salt levels in Subway's Club six-inch sandwich has been cut in all countries included in the study. Kellogg's Cornflakes sold in Venezuela contains 1.90g of salt per 100g compared to the same cereal sold in the UK at 1.25g of salt per 100g - a difference of more salt than a standard packet of ready salted crisps . The biggest reduction was seen in the UK, dropping from 3g of salt to 1.7g per portion - a reduction of 43 per cent. Meanwhile the salt content in a KFC Twister has also fallen in all countries since 2006. In Canada levels have fallen from 3.83g to 2.3g salt per portion - a fall of 1.5g. But researchers said it is 'disappointing' to note some products have not altered the levels of salt across in eight years. Salt levels in Kellogg's All Bran cereal in the US and Australia has remained at 0.65g per 100g and 0.95g respectively. And in Canada a McDonald's Big Mac still contains 2.55g salt per portion. Alarmingly some products have seen salt levels increase since 2006. McDonald's Big Mac in Malaysia, Singapore and Portugal has gone up in the last eight years. In the UK the salt content of the Burger King Bacon Double Cheeseburger has increased on average since WASH's last survey, from 2.2g per portion to 2.64g - a 20 per cent rise despite calls to reduce the population's salt intake. However Ms Farrand said the UK is 'leading the way in salt reduction'. 'The UK has set salt targets for over 80 categories of food, however this survey shows that more still needs to be done,' she said. Nestlé Fitness cereal has 2g of salt per 100g in Russia, while consumers in Chile can eat the same product with less than half the salt at 0.72 of salt per 100g . 'It is also clear that greater focus needs to be put on the out of home food sector. 'Salt should be going down, not up. 'This is a major problem, especially with so many people grabbing food on the go.' Professor  MacGregor, said: 'Reducing salt is the most cost-effective measure that we know to reduce the number of people suffering and dying from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. 'At the World Health Assembly in May 2013 it was unanimously agreed that all countries should reduce their daily salt intake by 30 per cent towards a target of up to 5g per day, by 2025. 'Our study has shown that many global food manufacturers are not doing enough to help achieve this target, which is completely unacceptable. 'Indeed this survey reveals a chaotic approach by these world renowned iconic brands and immediate action is required now. 'Salt should be reduced in all their products to the lowest level in all countries, and further if we are really going to tackle the huge and burdening problem of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure. 'These companies need to take a much greater corporate and ethical responsibility for what they are doing to their customers.' Reducing salt levels in various products across the world is a 'complex issue', the retailers told MailOnline. Reducing salt levels in various products across the world is a 'complex issue', the retailers told MailOnline . A Burger King spokeswoman said the company, which operates in 98 countries, is 'committed to providing menu options' to meet individual nutritional needs. She said they have 'successfully reduced the sodium content in many products around the world'. 'As part of its global menu innovation process, BKC develops standards for its menu items,' she told MailOnline. 'Due to varying local regulations, BKC allows for some flexibility in its menu specifications in certain countries. BKC’s approach ensures that all BURGER KING restaurants have items that meet our stringent food quality standards in each region.' Spencer Swartz, for Nestle, said: 'Salt reduction in food is influenced by a variety of factors, including culture and individual preferences. 'This is why Nestlé takes a product-by-product approach to its food reformulation efforts to cut salt.' He said the company has achieved a double-digit percentage reduction in salt from more than 2,400 Nestle products, including cereals, since 2005, when the sodium reduction policy was introduced. 'The reduction since 2005 represents around 14,500 tonnes of salt and we will be doing more,' he told MailOnline. 'We have set the objective to cut salt in our products by a further 10 per cent by 2016. 'Nestlé also fully supports the WHO target for salt intake of no more than 5g per person, per day by 2025. 'The challenge in all of this is to cut salt in our foods without consumers resorting to salt shakers or choosing saltier foods. This is why awareness raising of this issue and partnership with a variety of stakeholders, including governments, is so important.' A spokeswoman for Kellogg's added: 'Since 1998, Kellogg’s has been engaged in a voluntary effort to reduce the amount of salt contained in our cereals in Europe. 'Worldwide, Kellogg’s is continually seeking ways to improve the nutrition profile of our foods – including lowering salt– without compromising taste or quality. 'These plans vary by geography for many reasons, including raw material supplies, product renovation schedules and cultural and consumer taste preferences.' A spokeswoman for the SUBWAY brand said with more than 42,000 branches across the world, 'exact product formulation differs between countries dependent on specific suppliers'. 'The SUBWAY brand works hard to reduce salt wherever possible, not just in the UK but worldwide.' A McDonald's global spokesman, said: 'While McDonald’s is a global company, we operate as local businesses in a decentralised manner. 'Different countries have different menu choices, ingredient combinations, and portion sizes that depend on, for example, customer taste preferences, local regulations, local restaurant ingredient reporting requirements, supply chain capabilities, and the competitive marketplace. 'McDonald’s is working to reduce sodium in our menu items. 'The timing and reduction amounts vary by country and menu item. Because nutritional values vary around the world, McDonald’s markets have different baselines for measuring sodium content and different opportunities to reduce sodium.' He said they have made progress in Europe, where they have reduced salt in French fries by at least 20 per cent, and levels in Chicken Nuggets by 14 per cent. MailOnline has also contacted McDonalds and KFC for comment.","Study carried out by World Action on Salt and Health (WASH) surveyed products by McDonalds, Burger King, KFC, Subway, Nestle and Kelloggs .

"A Canada woman was roused from her bed Thursday morning by a deep, rumbling sound emanating from the skies all around her British Columbia home and managed to catch the spooky experience on video. Kimberly Wookey of Terrace, British Columbia was deeply rattled by the groaning she says she’s heard before but the origins of which remain a mystery. And not just to her. People all over the world have reported similar sounds, including a 2012 instance that was heard by people across continents, but no one can yet answer who or what is making the creepy sounds. Captivating: Kimberly Wookey's video of a mysterious rumbling from the sky has captivated her small Canada town and viewers across the web . Wookey says in her YouTube comments that she’s heard the sound before but was only this time able to record it. ‘First time was back in June,’ writes Wookey. ‘But it was not quite as intense.’ This time Wookey was ready. ‘I shot out of bed like a bat out of hell,’ she writes. Like a horror flick: The surroundings are like a horror film when paired with the eery sound that other witnesses said seemed to be coming from the ground as much as from the sky . Watch videos of the bizarre sound in Terrace, British Columbia... Wookey’s 7-year-old son was also woken up by the droning sound, which echoed off the mountains that surround Terrace for several minutes. And the Wookey’s weren’t the only people to hear it. People all over Terrace told have recounted the strange experience. Mandi Campbell also heard the sounds. ‘It seemed to be coming from the sky or underground, something so loud though,’ she told CBC News. Debbie Vantikrus heard it, too. Many others like Wookey witnessed the sound. And similar phenomena have occurred worldwide, most notably a 2012 instance where sounds were heard in the sky worldwide . ‘I heard this noise, and at first I thought I might have left a window open and the wind was howling,’ she said. ‘The more I listened to it I thought … no, that’s not wind howling through a window, it must be somebody tuning up some instrument in George Little Park. So, I just dismissed it from my head and thought that’s what it was.’ Then Vantikus arrived to work and heard others describe the spooky sound. Despite all the talk, local authorities and even Canadian science officials still can’t say for sure what happened. Though, that hasn’t stopped them from trying. Something known as ‘the hum’ also has science and those who hear it perplexed. It is a noise that only two per cent of people can hear, but this low droning sound would be enough to drive anyone mad. Sufferers have been able to identify common factors: the humming is only heard indoors, it is a low, rumbling noise, it is louder at night, and is more common in more rural areas. In the UK, the noise has been heard in Leeds, Bristol, and Largs, Scotland, but has been reported as far as Taos, New Mexico, and Bondi Beach in Sydney. A 2003 study by acoustical consultant Geoff Leventhall, from Surrey, shows that one in 50 people who live in a Hum-prone place hear the noise, and that most of these people are aged between 55 and 70. Katie Jacques, from Leeds, told the BBC: ‘It's a kind of torture; sometimes, you just want to scream. ‘It's hard to get off to sleep because I hear this throbbing sound in the background.  You're tossing and turning, and you get more and more agitated about it.’ Those who hear it can experience headaches, nausea, dizziness, nosebleeds and sleep disturbances, and the BBC reported at least one suicide as a result of the noise. However, like the sky groaning, the exact cause of the hum remains a mystery. University of Northern British Columbia Physics Professor Erik Jensen heard the sounds and told CFNR they were unlike anything he’d seen before but had this to say: . ‘First, sounds can travel very large distances when he conditions are right, and travel in surprising directions- sound can refract in the atmosphere and “bounce” along if the conditions are right. Sounds can also be focused so will vary a lot from place to place.’ There is precedent over the last few years for such a mystery. In January 2012, similar sounds were reported all across Canada, in Chicago, New York, and even across the Atlantic in Norway and Spain. A search of YouTube will find a trove of such instances caught on video, some of them more credible than others. An Edmonton woman whose posted her video of the 2012 occurrence later admitted it was a fake. And even Wookey’s video has been dismissed as just a rip-off of a scene from 2011 horror flick Red State.

"Terrorists are trying to use a European court ruling to wipe stories about their trials from Google in a move which amounts to censorship by the back door, Sajid Javid warned today. The Culture Secretary condemned ‘Luxembourg’s unelected judges’ who created the so-called ‘right to be forgotten’ by forcing search engines to remove links to news stories. In a forthright speech to newspaper editors, Mr Javid accused European courts of ‘trying to restrict media freedom’ and took aim at the BBC for competing with news websites like MailOnline. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid warned unaccountable European judges were 'trying to restrict media freedom’, creating a new right to be forgotten which amounted to 'censorship by the back door' Last month it emerged Google has deleted more than 18,000 web links following requests from UK. The 15-year campaign by the Daily Mail for justice in the Stephen Lawrence murder case ‘is what British newspapers are all about’, Mr Javid said. He said the Lawrence family was ‘badly let down’ by a failure to investigate the crime properly and praised the Mail for a campaign that led to the jailing of two men for the killing. ‘The Daily Mail refused to let the Lawrence family stand alone,’ he said. ‘A team of talented journalists and editors did all they could to help bring Stephen’s killers to justice. Not just the famous front page of February 14, 1997 – but the 15 years of investigations, revelations and exposés that followed, keeping the case firmly in the public and political spotlight. ‘Doing so took courage, dedication and no small measure of journalistic skill.’ Requests from Britain included a former clergyman who wanted to remove links to articles about a sex abuse investigation and a doctor who botched a medical procedure. Google said it deleted 35 per cent, or 18,459, of the unwanted links Britons requested be removed. Mr Javid said the scale of the attempts to remove links to news stories was a threat to journalism. ‘Since Luxembourg’s unelected judges created the so-called “right to be forgotten”, Google has been receiving a demand for deletion every 90 seconds,’ he told the Society of Editors conference in Southampton. ‘Each day, a thousand requests pour in from people who, for one reason or another, would prefer their pasts to be kept secret. ‘Criminals are having their convictions airbrushed from history even if they have since committed other, similar crimes. ‘Terrorists have ordered Google to cover up stories about their trials.’ The EU's ‘right to be forgotten’ legislation allows European citizens to request that links to ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant’ information be removed from Google search results . Mr Javid added: ‘The “right to be forgotten” is censorship by the back door. Stories are not being deleted from archives because of the ruling, but if they cannot be found by the search engines they may as well not be there at all.’ Newspaper websites have received notifications from Google that it has deleted links to their articles. Sajid Javid questioned whether the BBC website should be competing with commercial news sites like MailOnline. In his speech, the Culture Secretary pointed to Ofcom figures which show that almost 60 per cent of online news consumers use the BBC website or app, with Sky News trailing behind on just 17 per cent. On mobile devices, BBC News has 14.5 million unique users, compared to just 4.2 million for second-placed Sky News, he said. 'The highest-ranked newspaper, the Mail, is third with 3.4 million,' he said. However, on closer inspection of the figures referenced by Mr Javid, it appears the data refers to mobile readership figures for news on the BBC and on Sky not to BBC News and Sky News. He continued: 'This digital dominance looks set to be cemented as this generation grows up. 'Most adults aged under 24 already head to the internet – rather than TV, radio or print – for their fix of news. 'As with so many of the changes brought about by the internet, it raises a lot of questions. 'Is it healthy for a publicly funded broadcaster to compete with commercial newspapers? 'Should the BBC share its local public service content under a creative commons licence?' MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke has said: ‘It is the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don’t like.’ The European Court of Justice ruled people had a right to ask for ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant, or excessive’ information about them to be dropped from internet searches. The decision – which cannot be appealed against and is binding for all EU states – affects only search results and not lawfully published and true information. But once search engines like Google drop links to such material, it becomes almost impossible to find on the internet. Facebook was the site which had the most links removed, followed by the social network search site Profile Engine and video sharing site YouTube. Google gave anonymised examples of requests it had received. In Britain, they included the former clergyman who asked for two links to articles about a sex abuse investigation while he was still a religious leader to be removed. The search engine refused his request, and said it considered ‘the rights of the individual as well as public interest in the content’ when assessing each request. Google also refused an application from a doctor who wanted more than 50 links to articles about a botched procedure removed. Three pages that contained personal information about the doctor but not about the procedure were removed from search results for his name, but links to reports about the incident were not deleted. Europe's top court ruled that people have the right to have 'inadequate' and 'irrelevant' results about them wiped from the web, which has led to the search engine being bombarded with requests. More than 90,000 removal requests involving more than 328,000 URLs have been made to Google worldwide. The content itself has not been deleted from MailOnline, but Google will not list it in search results. Instead, users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that says: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe’ at the bottom of the page. The latest articles to be removed from MailOnline include: . The European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’. Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.' This relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally. The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’. The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it. If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined. Secretary who kicked passenger in face with stiletto over 'feet on seat' row walks free from court .

"A European project could soon offer anyone with €200,000 (£120,000) the opportunity to soar over 100 km into space. Astrium has announced plans to test its prototype spaceplane at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 metres) over Singapore in May. If successful, a second unpowered drop test from 100,000 feet (30,480 metres) should follow next year, according to officials. Scroll down for video... Astrium has announced plans to test its prototype spaceplane at an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,048 metres) over Singapore in May. If successful, a second unpowered drop test from 100,000 feet (30,480 metres) should follow . For almost a decade Astrium has been working on a vehicle able to carry four passengers up to an altitude of 100km into space. The business jet-sized spaceplane will take off and land conventionally from a standard airport runway using its jet engines, according to a report in Space.com. At an altitude of about 12km, the rocket engine will be ignited and in only 80 seconds the craft will climb to 60km altitude. The rocket propulsion system will then be shut down as the plane’s inertia carries it on to over 100km, enabling passengers to hover weightlessly. For almost a decade Astrium has been working on a vehicle able to carry four passengers up to an altitude of 100km into space. Pictured is an interior view of the spaceplane . Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo aircraft, designed for space tourism, completing its third rocket-powered test in January. The test at Mojave Air and and Space Port in California was meant to simulate a flight into outer-space that will go into effect later this year. Virgin Galactic eventually wants to host commercial space tours. Not only did Virgin Galactic have a successful third test of the aircraft but they reached an altitude of 71,000 feet. The flight prior to this test reached 69,000 feet. Celebrities have already started signing up for the exclusive space tours ready to take off later this year. Katy Perry and Justin Bieber have already signed up. Tickets cost $250,000 (£150,500). Chief executive Richard Branson has promised to take a seat on the ship's first flight. The vehicle would then use a cold gas reaction control system jets to position itself for atmospheric re-entry. After slowing down during descent, the jet engines will be restarted for a normal landing at the airfield. According to the company, the entire trip will last two hours. Operators using the spaceplane could offer safe space flight for a price per passenger of around €200,000 (£120,000). Such a vehicle operating at altitudes between those of conventional aircraft (20km) and those of satellites (200km) could be used for various other applications. The company claims it could be a precursor for rapid ‘point-to-point’ transport vehicles or quick access to space – opening up previously unexplored territory. The model being tested in May is 15 feet (4.6 metres) long and only a quarter of the size of the actual space plane. It will be dropped by a helicopter and remotely controlled for a sea landing east of Singapore in the South China Sea. ‘What we are looking for is to validate the spaceplane itself, and the spaceplane itself is in a gliding mode,’ Christophe Chavagnac, spaceplane programs manager told Space.com. Engineers are currently fitting the avionics and flight control systems to the quarter-scale prototype ahead of the test.The company hasn't given an indication of when the spaceplane will be ready for flight.

"Jailed: Glenn Stacey is back in prison after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months . A prolific shoplifter with more than 350 convictions is back behind bars after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months. Glenn Stacey, who has a long history of stealing low-value items, was given a Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Crasbo) in February, barring him from the centre of Blackpool, Lancashire. But 54-year-old Stacey, who is well-known to local security teams, was spotted last month in Poundland. It was the latest breach of his order - and he was sent to prison for 28 days. Police say the threat of jail does not stop Stacey, but claim the Crasbo means they can at least arrest him before he causes any serious trouble. Lancashire Constabulary's PC Russell Bargh, of the Blackpool Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: ‘It’s how prolific he is that’s the problem. Jail doesn’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard. ‘I have been an officer for 12 years and the number of convictions he has is well above anyone else I’ve ever come across. ‘But the Crasbo gives us a chance to arrest him before he manages to commit a crime. It gives us another string to our bow that helps us prevent crime before it gets too far. ‘The order has not been issued lightly. He is not shoplifting because we are getting to him first.’ Sighting: Stacey was spotted at Poundland (pictured) in Blackpool. It was the latest breach of his order . Famous seafront: Stacey has been barred from the town centre of Blackpool, Lancashire (file picture) Michael Hilliard, security officer at Wilkinson’s in Blackpool, said: ‘He was arrested once in here for breaching his order and since then we’ve not seen him. ‘We had stopped him three or four times this year before that so that has got to be good going. He was in all the time before.’ 'Jail doesn’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard' PC Russell Bargh . But the nature of Stacey’s offences means he is unlikely to face a significant stretch behind bars any time soon. PC Bargh added: ‘If you asked town centre stores, they would probably be relieved at a longer period of time but would it stop him committing offences? Probably not. ‘I don’t think Glenn is a particularly nasty person. He just doesn’t see the consequences and he doesnt fear them. I think any officer you ask in Blackpool Central would say they know Glenn.’","Glenn Stacey, 54, of Blackpool, has a history of stealing low-value items .

"Rent in London is so high that one young professional has worked out it would be cheaper live in Barcelona and fly to work. Social Media manager Sam Cookney, 30, wanted a less expensive way of travelling to his office near Liverpool Street station. What he found was an unlikely solution: it would be more cost effective to relocate to the sun-kissed coast of north east Spain, more than 700 miles away. Cheap alternative: Mr Cookney found the lack of council tax charges and low rent in Barcelona, above, meant it is cheaper to live there and fly to London . Expensive: London's council tax charges make the city more expensive than alternatives in Europe, Mr Cookney found . Mr Cookney said that a combination of cheap rent, travel and the lack of council tax charges in the Spanish city would more than undercut the high prices of travel cards living costs in the English capital. He arrived at the extraordinary solution by doing sums based on property and travel websites. LONDON: . One bed flat, West Hampstead - £1,505 . Council tax - £75 . Zone 1-2 travel card - £116.60 . TOTAL: £1,697  per month. BARCELONA: . Three bed flat, Les Corts, £580 . Council tax - £0 . Ryanair flight, metro - £778 . TOTAL: £1,358 per month . A one-bedroom flat in West Hampstead would cost around £1,505, according to Zoopla. He then added in . council tax at approximately £75 and a zone 1-2 travelcard to get to his . job in the City, which costs £116.80, making a total of £1,697. Mr Cookney said: 'I chose West Hampstead because I know . and like the area, and it doesn’t seem a stretch to suggest that a young . professional may afford to live there' He then compared the prices to Barcelona where a three-bedroom flat, with three balconies, a stone’s throw away . from the metro, in the 'nice and safe' area of Les Corts which costs £580 per month. Mr Cookney added, 'I used to live there, and being a fairly upmarket residential district, it’s a very decent and fair comparison to West Hampstead. 'There are, of course, cheaper flats, but I was trying to compare apples with apples – even in spite of the three bedrooms.' With rent obviously cheaper, Mr Cookney then considered travel. He found that he could fly back and forth from Barcelona to Stansted via Ryanair nearly every day in November for £29 a trip. Jet set: He discovered that a four day commute using Ryanair flights to get into London from Spain would work cut the cost of living by £339 per-month . He added £5 to get to from Barcelona’s el Prat airport and a £14 . return to Liverpool Street, making £19 in total on land travel each day. That’s . fixed commuting costs of £48 a day, 4 days a week, for 4 weeks a month, . which worked out at £778 . Add on rent of £580 a month and the cost of living . in Barcelona and commuting to London comes to £1,358 a month. That’s £339 less than the cost of living in London and commuting from Zone 2. Add that to the fact that he could live in a sunny city by the sea, and Mr Cookney said his findings were 'beyond crazy'. He said: 'I could walk to my desk by 9:30am, with time for a Pret coffee and bacon and cheese croissant en route' 'It's just beyond crazy, and completely unsustainable'. Too much: Mr Cookney was forced into looking for alternatives after he became sick of the sky high rent prices for relatively small accommodation in north and west London . Pricey journey: He based his sums around a commute from West Hampstead to Liverpool Street station, above, and a similar trip from Barcelona . 'I . feel like it's reaching a tipping point. I've been discussing with . friends this week, and several of us have said that we're going to have . to consider leaving London. The sums just don't add up' The only concession he had to make was that he could work from home for one day a week with flights of a weekend being far more pricey. He said: 'I thought at least it would require some poetic licence or dodgy sums . 'But the only assumption I’m making is that I work a four-day week in London, with a day at home (i.e. Barcelona).'","Sam Cookney did the sums after becoming sick of rent prices in London .

"Joe Barlow, from Laindon, Essex, was jailed for five separate offences at Basildon Crown Court, including stealing £8,500 from his grandparents . A 20-year-old fugitive who taunted police on Facebook by posting ‘can’t catch me’ wept in the dock as he was jailed for stealing thousands of pounds from his grandparents and assaulting his mother. Joe Barlow, from Laindon, Essex, was jailed for five separate offences at Basildon Crown Court, including stealing £8,500 from his grandparents’ savings to pay for drugs. He was sent to prison after spending two and a half months on the run from police before his arrest 12 miles from his home in Stondon Massey, Essex. He was jailed for eight months for five separate offences including assaulting his mother in February and breaching a suspended sentence he was handed in March 2012. He was given the suspended sentence after he went to his grandparents’ home and took cash they had been saving to get their windows replaced before fleeing to Cornwall to spend it. Earlier this year, Barlow also admitted assaulting his mother on Valentine’s Day and an offence of criminal damage at Basildon Magistrates’ Court. His case was sent to Basildon Crown Court for sentence on March 26 but he didn’t turn up and the court issued a warrant for his arrest. Essex Police posted his mugshot on its Facebook page on May 3, with an urgent appeal for members of the public to report sightings of him. Hours later Barlow began his online taunts, writing: ‘Can’t catch me’, and said he would not turn himself in until he had a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron. But he was arrested a short time later at a hideout in Stondon Massey, Essex, he was again ordered to attend court. Barlow, who wore a red prison-issue tracksuit for the court appearance, sobbed throughout the hearing as his mother and girlfriend sat in the public gallery. His solicitor, Mark Savage, said his time on the run stemmed from a fear of court and going to prison. He said he committed a number of offences while in a ‘toxic relationship’ with an ex-partner. Joe Barlow taunted police on Facebook by posting 'can't catch me' while on the run after stealing from his grandparents and assaulting his mother. He was arrested two and a half months later at a hideout in Essex . He said: ‘This young man is clearly distressed at being back in front of the court. ‘This is not a man coming to court swaggering with bravado and his mother is here at court to support him.’ The court heard Barlow has a string of previous convictions for battery, destroying property and common assault. Sentencing, Recorder Tim Clark said: ‘You are clearly an unstable young man who has a bad criminal record. ‘You continue to commit criminal offences which are aggravated by the fact the victims are members of your own family. ‘You are fortunate still to have the support of your family. ‘You cannot just not appear at court and put your head in the sand as an act of fear.’ He was jailed for eight months for common assault, criminal damage, breaching a suspended sentence order, committing an offence while subject to a suspended sentence order and failing to appear at court.","Joe Barlow stole £8,500 from grandparents' savings and spent it on drugs .

"From the gargoyles at the gates to the cobwebs in the kitchen one horror-loving couple have blown more than £225,000 building an exact replica of the house from hit 1960s TV series The Munsters. The house is a fully furnished 6,000 sq ft homage to the classic sitcom attracting thousands of TV buffs each year. Sandra Mckee and her husband Charles from Waxahachie, Texas, U.S. decided to create the mansion after a lifelong love for the show. Scroll down for video . Spooky: The outside of Charles and Sandra's house in Texas which has been made to look like the home of The Munsters . Mrs Mckee said: 'I grew up with it and The Munsters was one of the shows you could watch with the family - a real wholesome family show. 'We had restored an old Victorian house before and I just said it would be really cool to create the Munster house. 'I was just joking to begin with but when Chuck said that would be really cool I just ran with it and here we are.' The mansion includes some of the most iconic Munsters features such as Grandpa Munster's dungeon, rotating suit of armour and of course the pet dinosaur under the stairs. Replica: Inside the living room which belongs to Charles and Sandra Mckee which shows the organ that took 10 years to find . Charles dressed as Herman with grandpa and Sandra as Lily inside their Texas home which is a replica of the house in The Munsters . But this house is not just for show - the Mckees live in their creepy surroundings all year round. Mrs Mckee, 56, said she feels like she has to match the show in every sense but it does have its downside. She said: 'I think we do miss out on a lot of comfort areas in the house. 'It would sometimes be nice to go into your bedroom and have a regular room. 'We had a king-size bed but as this didn't match the show we had to downsize it for a smaller one. 'The thing is we have to match the show. When people come in they look for things to catch you out on, things that don't match the show.' The mansion includes some of the most iconic Munsters features such as Grandpa Munster's dungeon, rotating suit of armour and of course pet dinosaur under the stairs . Every piece of furniture in the mansion is specifically chosen for its resemblance to pieces in the show - no matter what the cost. Mr Mckee said: 'Some items in the house have come from the set, been found on auction sites or have kindly been donated by people. 'The most expensive item was Lily's harp which she plays in the show - that cost $25,000. 'I always look for bargains on eBay and after ten years of searching found the organ that Grandpa Munster plays - it only cost $700.' The couple spent £225,000 on the initial build but since then Sandra has lost track of how much she has spent kitting out the house. The Munster-mad Grandma also doesn't see her obsession ending any time soon. Mrs Mckee said: 'I will always be looking for new pieces to add to the house. 'If we had enough money I'd create a whole street with the Addams Family house and the one from Psycho. 'I did the Munster Mansion for my own pleasure and didn't even think that people would care - especially enough to come and visit from other countries.' Meeting her idol: Sandra as Lily with Pat Priest who played Marilyn Munster in the hit 1960s sitcom . Replicas of Herman and Lily Munster which stand in the living room of the creepy-looking house . Thousands of fans descend on the home in Texas which is a replica of the home in the 1960s sitcom The Munsters . Every year around Halloween the couple hold a charity event at the house where people can dress up which raises money for their neighbourhood. Almost 1,000 people attend and the chosen charity this year is the Salvation Army. The house definitely impacts their family life with three children and eight grandchildren who can enjoy it with them. Classic: The Munsters as they appeared in the hit 1960s sitcom . Mrs Mckee said: 'My youngest grandson - now eight - thought for a long time we were the actual Munsters and was a bit scared of the house.' This Halloween the couple have said they will enjoy trick or treating with their grandchildren and also handing out treats to those who are brave enough to venture up their garden path.","The house is a fully furnished homage to the classic 1960s sitcom .

"She made headlines when she became the first female model signed exclusively to pose in menswear and now Casey Legler is to star in a series of photos commissioned by British high street brand, AllSaints. The 6'2"" former Olympic swimmer and photographer stars in the high street brand's new Portraits of a Collection series, which will run exclusively on the AllSaints website. Designed to highlight some of the world's coolest up-and-coming creatives - as well as the AllSaints spring/summer collection of course - the photos also feature British artist Barry Reigate and Sonja Kinski, daughter of German actress Nastassja Kinski. Androgynous: Former Olympic swimmer, Casey Legler, is the world's only female male model . French-born Legler, 35, was signed up by the men's division of New York-based Ford Models last summer. The AllSaints images show Leger on typically androgynous form and staring moodily away from the camera, her hair styled into a trendy quiff. Speaking about the model, AllSaints creative director, Will Beedle, said: 'AllSaints has always been about creativity and will always have an affinity with young  directional creatives.' Although the AllSaints photo series is designed to showcase the brand's latest collection, it is part of an ongoing project which aims to provide up-and-coming creatives with a platform for their work.' Also involved in the series are New York photographer, Bon Duke, 24, and model, Hollie May Saker, 18, plus tattooist, skateboarder and model, Vinnie Woolston, 26. Photographer Casey is building a modelling career and has posed for AllSaints (left) and Time magazine . Legler has been compared with male womenswear model, Andrej Pejic, seen here in a Marc Jacobs campaign . 'We felt it was the right time to . document the collection in a way that celebrated the culture of . creativity that is at the brand's core,' Beedle told Glamour magazine. 'The Portraits will expand beyond the stills with a series of creative projects that lead into design, film and art.' Legler, whose career to date has also included shoots for Time and Muse magazines in the USA, remains sanguine about her unusual life as the world's first female male model. 'As far as I know, there are no other . women exclusively modelling as male models,' she revealed in an . interview with Time magazine. 'That sounds... That's such a weird thing to say! Cause I'm a woman, you know!' 'Is it a stretch for me to get styled . wearing men's clothes?' she continued. 'Anyone can look at me for two . seconds and know that that part is not so complicated.

'I think the part that can feel . complicated sometimes is that I also look really fierce in a dress, and . I've been taught by the best queens how to rock some heels!' Talking about Andrej Pejic, the Bosnian-born, Australian-raised male model who has made a name for himself in the world of womenswear, she said: . 'Andrej is gorgeous. In many ways, I come ushered in by that. 'What I wish is that we all get to be exactly who we are. And sometimes that's complicated,' she explains. 'We have very specific ways in which we identify ourselves as man or woman and I think that sometimes those can be limiting ... 'Seeing me on the men's board ... speaks to the notion of freedom, you know. There's something really bold about that, and that it really is saying look, there is also this other way, and it's really rad.'

"They say pigs can’t fly, well, these pictures show they sure can swim. This family of boars and piglets have set up home in the Bahamas and are rapidly becoming a YouTube sensation thanks to visitors filming themselves taking a dip with the animals. The swine like nothing more than a trot along the beach then a swim in the tropical surf. The domesticated animals which have turned feral are fast becoming a tourist attraction as they give visitors an extremely warm welcome when they arrive by boat. Scroll down for video . Bay of Pigs: These swimming pigs have become a Youtube hit across the world. Visitors film themselves swimming with the animals, who live on a small Caribbean island .

Silver screen: A filmmaker is now making a documentary about the swimming pigs of Big Major Cay and the surrounding islands . Now filmmaker Charles Allan Smith is now shooting a documentary that hopes to uncover how the animals first took to the water. 'When Pigs Swim' will follow the trail from the original swimming pigs. Pig Island, or Big Major Cay as it is officially known, is blessed with a natural water spring and is sheltered by a string of neighbouring islands that protects it from waves caused by tropical storms.

The soupy, lumpy substance is shown in a giant vat as Arpaio dumps various ingredients into it, including flour, olive oil, peas, carrots and the new ingredient: soy. Hayden points out that the carrots have some unknown brown substance mixed in with them. 'What is that?' Hayden asks.

"A couture show traditionally ends with a bridal look, and the most recent collections in Paris this week did not disappoint. Offering an early glimpse of what are likely wedding trends to come, dramatic hooped skirts and decadent feathers took center stage. Jean Paul Gaultier's hooped skirt was so wide that it even fit a cluster of children inside it. The future of wedding gowns?

"They are meant to celebrate Britain's most famous characters in history. But among the instantly-recognisable faces of Royal Mail's 'Great Britons' stamp set is one that may leave you a little lost. John Archer, former Mayor or Battersea, is one of the characters featured in the set - a choice which is likely to leave some stamp collectors a little confused. Pioneer: John Archer, Mayor of Battersea, was the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London . For while his achievements heading up a London borough are indeed admirable, they are not quite as well-known as those of his fellow countrymen. The set of 10 first class stamps, released today,  also includes David Lloyd George, Benjamin Britten and Vivien Leigh. Royal Mail said it aimed to include people in sport, journalism, music, politics and the arts whose anniversaries of birth fall in 2013. A spokesman said that the unconventional choice of Mr Archer recognised the contribution he made to public life as 'the first person of African-Caribbean descent to hold civic office in London'. First class Britons: Others featured on the stamps are photographer Norman Parkinson, actress Vivien Leigh, actor Peter Cushing, David Lloyd George, writer Elizabeth David, composer and pianist Benjamin Britten, archeologist Mary Leakey, footballer Bill Shankly and broadcaster Richard Dimbleby . Inspiration: John Archer was elected into Battersea Borough Council in 1906 . Also part of the set are actress Vivien Leigh, famous for her leading roles in Gone with the Wind, and actor Peter Cushing. From the world of sport, Scottish footballer and manager William 'Bill' Shankly features for his triumph as First Division champions in 1964, 1966 and 1973. Notable figures from the world of politics are also featured with the first and only Welsh Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. One of the UK's best loved classical composers Benjamin Britten is included in the ten, with celebrated portrait and fashion photographer Norman Parkinson bolstering the arts contingent. There is also Richard Dimbleby, the well known journalist, and cookery writer Elizabeth David, who was credited with introducing post-war Britain to 'exotic' Mediterranean cooking. Completing the ten is eminent archaeologist and anthropologist, Mary Leakey, who was credited with forcing scientists to re-think their long held views on human evolution thanks to her significant discoveries. Andrew Hammond, Royal Mail Stamps spokesperson, said: 'We are delighted to be honouring some of the UK's most distinguished figures in history through our latest special stamp collection. 'We hope the stamps will serve as a lasting tribute to their memory and once again encourage people to remember their significant contribution to our Great British way of life.'","Stamp to honour politician and civil rights campaigner John Archer .

"The average homeowner wastes three days a year manually adjusting the slats on their venetian blinds. To solve this problem, a Bulgarian start up has invented Jalousier - a device that clips onto existing blinds and automatically adjusts slats according to changes in weather, temperature, light and even the time of day. The firm claims it can not only save users time, it can also reduce heating and electricity costs by up to 18 per cent with an average saving of $350 (£210) per home. The Jalousier device, pictured, clips onto existing venetian blinds and automatically adjusts the slats according to changes in weather, temperature, light and even the time of day. It is expected to go on sale in October and costs $129 (£77). The firm claims it can save the average home $350 (£210) per year in heating bills . Jalouiser is fitted with sensors that automatically monitor . for changes in light, temperature, weather and time of day. As it gets . dark, the blinds will open to let in more light. If it starts raining, the slats are adjusted to an angle that lets in more light, but one that is also optimised to retain room temperature. Users . can additionally adjust the slats manually, via the app's interface, as . well as control them using hand gestures made when holding the phone. For example, tilting the phone forwards can tilt the slats in the same direction. This means blinds can be adjusted remotely while on holiday, for example, or before a user arrives home.

"A British fireman died protecting his brother as they fought off armed robbers during a holiday in Venezuela. Tom Ossel, 28, was shot in the armpit after four men and three women burst into the hotel where he was staying with Jack, 21. The gang had taken several other . guests hostage before attacking the brothers. As the pair tried to . resist them by throwing furniture, Mr Ossel was fatally injured and bled . to death in just minutes. Tragedy: Thomas Ossel, who was fatally shot, left, pictured with his brother Jack on a Myspace profile . His brother was stabbed and received . treatment at hospital for minor injuries. The gunmen only fled when . their semi-automatic weapon jammed, it was claimed. A friend the . brothers were travelling with, Owen Pearce, 21, was uninjured. Paul Wynne, 30, a close friend of Mr Ossel, said the victim would have put himself in danger to prevent others coming to harm. ‘Tom was very protective of his friends and especially his brother,’ he said. The raid happened a day after the men arrived on the paradise island of Isla Margarita, in the Caribbean Sea. Keen traveller: Mr Ossel describes his love of travel on his MySpace page, which also features images of him on holiday . Peter Eggersdorfer, owner of the . Posada Casa Rosa hotel near Playa el Agua, said he let the gunmen in . when they asked for a room. ‘Next minute one of them . pistol-whipped me over the head and another three women, including one . armed with a knife, rushed in behind them,’ he said. ‘I was bundled into the kitchen and held hostage along with a couple of guests. ‘They started going through the rooms looking to take things and came across the two British brothers who put up resistance. ‘All I could hear was the robbers shouting in Spanish “dollars, dollars” and the sound of punching and slapping.’ He added that five shots were fired and said he had identified two of the attackers from photos shown to him by police. ‘One is apparently a Colombian man who is extremely dangerous and has already committed several murders,’ he said. Well-loved: Tributes poured in for the London firefighter, pictured on his social networking page during a night out . Mr Ossel, a keen traveller who lived in Bedford and worked for London Fire Brigade, died on Monday evening. His father Ben, a self-employed . building contractor, flew out to the island the following day to be with . Jack, who is studying politics, philosophy and economics at London . Metropolitan University. Their mother, Annabelle, 56, a . magazine picture researcher, stayed at the £350,000 five bedroom . semi-detached family home in Cople near Bedford. Tourist hotspot: Mr Ossel was on the popular destination island of Isla Margarita. Here he is pictured on a glacier . Mr Wynne has paid tribute to Mr Ossel, who he said always loved travelling with friends. ‘Tom was one of those people who . could never sit still for more than five minutes. He took me to places I . would never have thought to go.’ Isla de Margarita: London fireman Thomas Ossel, 28, died following a botched robbery attempt . Last night tributes poured in for Mr Ossel, a keen Liverpool fan. London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'We were shocked and . saddened to learn of Tom's untimely death. I know he will be sorely . missed by his fellow firefighters. 'Our thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at this sad and difficult time.' Tourist destination: Isla Margarita, where Thomas Ossel was shot dead by robbers in a guest house . On . a Facebook tribute site one friend Andy Kinkead said: 'I still can't . believe that this has happened. I always imagined Tom growing old on a . beach somewhere. I will never forget the good old days that we all had. You will be missed.' Another . friend, Amy Nicholas, said: 'It's not fair that you had your life cut . short. You can tell by how many people have posted messages on your wall . how popular and well loved you were and how many lives you touched with . your infectious personality.' Jacqueline Baxter, a friend of the . family, said: 'At the moment their father has travelled to Venezuela and . obviously their mum is not able to make a statement. 'The younger son is still out there, so he is still at considerable risk.' Venezuela's popular Isla Margarita attracts 2.5million visitors a year . Mr . Ossel, on his Myspace page, described himself as a keen traveller. He . wrote: 'Love to travel...have been to nearly 40 countries now..would . love to make it 100 one day. 'Love watching and playing football...huge Liverpool fan, but constantly pissed off with them as they are so frustrating. 'Like cooking...always trying new foods...did a cookery course in Thailand so forever making Thai food.' Isla Margarita is one of Venezuela’s most popular tourist destinations. More than 150,000 of its 2.5million tourists last year were northern Europeans. But the country has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Two people are murdered every hour on average . Most of the deaths occur in crowded slums but richer residential areas are far from safe, cars jump red lights on deserted streets and few people are willing to risk walking outside. Travel advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns that street crime in Venezuela is high, and that armed muggings and 'express kidnappings' - opportunistic abductions to extort money from someone - are regular occurrences. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British National on Margarita Island in Venezuela on July 18. 'We are providing consular assistance for the family.'","London firefighter fatally shot by gang at guest house .

"The FBI have announced that there have been positive sightings of $500 million worth of masterpieces stolen from a Boston museum nearly a quarter century ago. The art, including works by Rembrandt, Vermeer and Manet, was stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990 by two men disguised as city police officers. FBI Special Agent Geoff Kelly, the lead investigator, told WFXT-TV the trail for the missing artwork has not grown cold. FBI Special Agent Geoff Kelly, the lead investigator said the trail for the missing artwork has not grown cold. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . He identified three persons of . interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello . Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have . died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the missing work. A . $5 million reward was offered last March, on the 23rd anniversary of . the heist, as part of a broad public campaign the FBI is initiating to . raise awareness about the crime and the artworks in hope of a new break . in the case. Tips poured in, but no arrests were made. The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces .

In progress: Left, Degas' Three Mounted Jockeys, and right, a self-portrait of Rembrandt . Most valuable: Jan Vermeer's The Concert is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . The latest, exhaustive phase in the . inquiry is based on a tip that a caller made to authorities in 2010, . according to Anthony Amore, the Gardner Museum’s head of security and . chief investigator. He . said in 2013 that the tip was so fruitful - leading to the announcement . that investigators know the identities of the thieves and could trace . the art from Boston to Connecticut and Philadelphia - that the FBI has . since rededicated significant resources to investigating the heist. 'I do believe there are people out there who can give us information that will get us to the paintings,” Amore, who has worked closely with federal investigators, told the Globe last year. He added, 'Assistance from the public is essential.' The theft has captivated the public’s imagination in large part because of the boldness with which it was carried out. At a loss: Left, a visitor looks at the empty . frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum in 1990 following the . heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and . Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor  and a space on the wall remains . bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . Landscape: Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . Heist of the century: The thieves also made off with Degas' 'La Sortie du Pelage,' a watercolor and pencil sketch . Black and white: Two Degas sketches from 1884, entitled 'Program for an Artistic Soirée' Monochrome: Degas'  'Cortège aux Environs de Florence' Proud: This bronze eagle-shaped finial from c. 1813 originally sat on the top of the pole support of a silk Napoleonic flag in the Short Gallery; the thieves likely thought it was gold . Two men dressed as Boston police officers conned their way into the museum in the early morning hours of March 18, 1990, telling the two guards on duty that they were responding to a disturbance . They tied the guards up with duct tape, left them in a basement, and made their way through the museum, walking off with 13 artworks, including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, and a Manet. They cut some of . the works of art right out of the frames - the empty frames continue to be hung in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces. The artworks were valued at $500 million, though they are essentially priceless in that they have become so legendary. Anthony Amore, who is the Gardner museum’s chief of security, said last year that anyone could claim the reward, even if they did not have the paintings. ‘We hope that through this media campaign, people will see how earnest we are in our attempts to pay this reward and make our institution whole,’ he said in a statement. The thieves, once publically identified, will be prosecuted by a special FBI department, the Art Crime Team, which is comprised of 14 special agents. The team of agents, along with trial lawyers, investigates art theft, fraud, and lootings in both national and international scope. Last year the FBI has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum .

"Footage has emerged from deep inside the mysterious crater that has suddenly appeared in Siberia. The crater on the Yamal Peninsula - known as the 'end of the world' to locals - was caused by aliens, a meteorite, a stray missile, or an explosive gas cocktail released due to global warming, according to theories last week. Russian scientists recently returned from the first expedition to look inside the giant hole which was previously spotted by helicopter. Scroll down for video . Footage from inside the original crater showed that there is a lake at its base. The two new craters follow the discovery of a larger hole earlier this month around 230ft (70 metres) in diameter. Now the new holes - smaller in diameter but similar in shape - are posing a fresh challenge for Russian scientists . Their footage highlights a darkening around the rim which was earlier seen as evidence of heat possibly from an explosion during the crater's creation. 'They found the crater - around up to 300ft (70 metres) deep - has an icy lake at its bottom, and water is cascading down its eroding permafrost walls,' said The Siberian Times. ‘It is not as wide as aerial estimates which earlier suggested between 164ft and 328ft (50 and 100 metres).’ Andrey Plekhanov, senior researcher at the Russian Scientific Centre of Arctic Research, revealed that satellite mapping imagery is being used to establish when the phenomenon was formed, thought to be in the last year or two. This giant crater measuring around 262ft and found in far northern . Siberia is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures in the . area - not a meteorite . Andrei Plekhanov, a senior researcher at the Scientific Research Center . of the Arctic, who travelled to investigate the crater, said there were no traces of an . explosion . The discovery eliminates the possibility that a meteorite had struck the . region in the Yamal Peninsula - the name of which translates as 'the . end of the world' Mr Plekhanov said the enormous crater appears to be made up of 80 per cent ice which adds to the theory that it was caused by the effects of global warming . The darkening around the inner rim of the crater also indicates 'severe burning' which scorched the crater's edges, researchers said . The darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates 'severe burning' that scorched its edges . One of the more popular theories is that the giant hole was caused by a phenomenon known as a pingo. This is a subsurface accumulation of ice that has been covered by land. When the ice melts it can leave behind a gaping hole that it once filled. The other favoured theory is that the hole was caused by an explosion of methane underground. The . Yamal Peninsula is rich in natural gas, with its resources extensively . tapped by Russia, and a mixture of water, salt and gas could result in . an explosion. The other theory is that it was caused by a meteorite, but most experts have ruled this possibility out as the phenomenon does not resemble normal impact craters. 'The crater has more of an oval than a circular shape, it makes it harder to calculate the exact diameter,' he said. 'As of now our estimates is about 98ft (30 metres). If we try to measure diameter together with soil emission, the so-called parapet, then the diameter is up to 197ft (60 metres). The structure is so fragile that the scientists could not climb deep into the lake and had to send a camera down instead. One theory is that the feature is a ‘pingo,’ reports the Sunday Morning Herald. A pingo is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts. ‘Certainly . from the images I’ve seen it looks like a periglacial feature, perhaps a . collapsed pingo,’ Dr Chris Fogwill of the University of New South Wales . said. ‘This . is obviously a very extreme version of that, and if there’s been any . interaction with the gas in the area, that is a question that could only . be answered by going there.’ Dr Plekhanov added the hole was most likely the result of a 'build-up of excessive pressure' underground, due to the region's changing temperatures. He said . 80 per cent of the crater appeared to be made up of ice and that there . were no traces of an explosion. The discovery eliminates the possibility that a . meteorite had struck the region. 'Could it be linked to the global warming? Well, we have to continue ourresearch to answer this question,' said Dr Plekhanov. 'Two previous summers - years 2012 and 2013 were relatively hot for Yamal, perhaps this has somehow influenced the formation of the crater. Perma frost is seen near the hole in this photo. Some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot, but that no longer seems to be the case . Scientists working at the site measure some of the soil and debris around the crater . Until the expedition took place, shown, scientists had been baffled by the appearance of the giant hole . Thanks to their readings (shown) the team now believes the cause was increasing temperatures . It's not yet known if this event, which scorched the ground nearby (shown), could occur again in the area . Very remote: The crater has appeared in Yamal - a large peninsula jutting into Arctic waters, which is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe . The Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region is area known for its permafrost and pingos . The mysterious hole is in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region, some 20 miles from the Bovanenkovo gas field . The predominant theory so far is that the feature is a 'pingo'. This is a large chunk of ice that is located underground that can create a hole in the ground when it melts . 'But we have to do our tests and research first and then say it more definitively.' After the hole was discovered, there was speculation online about the crater indicating 'the arrival of a UFO craft'. Ruling out extra-terrestrial intervention, Dr Plekhanov said: 'We can say for sure that under the influence of internal processes there was an ejection in the permafrost. 'I want to stress that was not an explosion, but an ejection, so there was no heat released as it happened.' The latest expedition organised by the Yamal authorities included experts from Russia's Centre for the Study of the Arctic, and also the Cryosphere Institute of the Academy of Sciences. They took samples of soil, air and water from the scene and were accompanied by a specialist from Russia's Emergencies Ministry. Anna Kurchatova from the Sub-Arctic . Scientific Research Centre, previously said the crater was formed by a mixture of . water, salt and gas igniting an underground explosion, a result of . global warming. Gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface, and then mixed with salt. Global . warming may have caused an 'alarming' melt in the under-soil ice, . released gas and causing an effect like the popping of a Champagne . bottle cork, Ms Kurchatova suggests. Yamal, a large peninsula jutting into Arctic waters, is Russia's main production area for gas supplied to Europe. Dr Plekhanov said: 'I've never seen anything like this, even though I have been to Yamal many times.' The crater is different from others on Yamal. The experts say the phenomenon maybe a restarting of a process not seen for 8,000 years when the lake-pocked Yamal landscape was formed on what was once a sea. This maybe 'repeating nowadays', he said. 'If this theory is confirmed, we can say that we have witnessed a unique natural process that formed the unusual landscape of Yamal peninsula.'

"Newly married and with a respectable job, he seems like an unlikely anarchist computer hacker. But within months of posing for pictures with his wife at their lavish wedding, Ashley Rhodes helped launch cyber-attacks on global financial institutions causing multi-million-pound losses. He was a member of the shadowy hacking group Anonymous, which ‘caused unprecedented harm’ to Visa, MasterCard and the online payment firm PayPal. Jailed: 'Hactivist' Ashley Rhodes (pictured on his wedding day to wife Shirley) was nicknamed 'NikonElite' Rhodes, 28, also discussed targeting the website of singer Lily Allen because of her stance against music piracy. Eventually, he and the other . self-styled ‘hacktivisits’ decided against such a cyber-attack because . they believed attacking ‘artists’ was against their ideologies. Rhodes, an IT worker, plotted the . attacks at work on his office computer. He continued his cyber-crimes . while at home with his new wife Shirley, who was unaware of his secret. Rhodes met other members of Anonymous on the internet and together they discussed which companies they should target. 'Hactivists': Christopher Weatherhead (left), 22, of Northampton, was given an 18-month sentence and Ashley Rhodes (right), 28, of Camberwell, south London, was jailed for seven months at Southwark Crown Court . Avoided jail: Co-defendant Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, Durham, was deemed to have played a lesser role in the conspiracy, which he also admitted, and given a six-month suspended sentence . Yesterday Rhodes, of Camberwell, South . London, was jailed for seven months after he admitted conspiring to . impair the operation of computers. 'You've tried to bite the Anonymous hand.

His fellow conspirators, whom he had . never met in person until he was charged, appeared next to him in the . dock at Southwark Crown Court. Christopher Weatherhead, 22, of . Northampton, was given an 18-month sentence. Weatherhead, who used the . online pseudonym Nerdo, denied conspiring to impair the operation of . computers, but was convicted. Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, was . given a six-month suspended sentence after admitting the same charge. Both he and Weatherhead have degrees. Jake Birchall, 18, from Chester, also . admitted the charge and will be sentenced next Friday. Hearing: A trial at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) in central London heard that PayPal was attacked repeatedly after it decided not to process payments on behalf of a group involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks . Anonymous . launched their cyber campaign in 2010 as a sign of solidarity towards . WikiLeaks. At the time WikiLeaks, which was founded by Julian Assange, . had begun to publish sensitive state secrets. 'It is intolerable that when an individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s activity they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks such as those that occurred in this case' Judge Peter Testar . The gang targeted PayPal for refusing . to process payments on behalf of Wau Holland Foundation, which was . raising funds for WikiLeaks. The nine-day online attack on PayPal . cost the company £3.5million and delayed payments for gifts during the . Christmas period. It was so effective 104 staff were forced to put aside . their usual tasks to create a defence strategy for PayPal. Afterwards the hackers left a message . which said: ‘You’ve tried to bite the Anonymous hand. You angered the . hive and now you are being stung.’ Star: At one point Gibson suggested the website of singer Lily Allen, now known by her married name Lily Cooper, as a possible target to Rhodes, who agreed with the idea. But the attack never went ahead . The hackers paralysed computer systems by flooding the firms with an ‘intolerable number of online requests and messages’. The financial impact of attacks on . MasterCard and Visa were not revealed to the court. But after targeting . MasterCard, Weatherhead, who played ‘a leading role’ in the conspiracy, . wrote to a fellow hacker: ‘We have probably done some million of pound . of dmg [damage] to mc [MasterCard].’ Anonymous launched Operation Payback when they learnt that Pirate Bay, a pirate music site, was facing legal proceedings. Believing music should be available . for free on the internet, the hackers targeted the websites run by music . industry regulators. They also attacked four websites owned . by the Ministry of Sound music company. Big loss: PayPal was attacked for refusing to process payments on behalf of the Wau Holland Foundation, an organisation involved in raising funds for WikiLeaks. It cost the money transfer website £3.5million . At Weatherhead’s trial, . prosecutor Sandip Patel said the campaign had ‘caused unprecedented . harm’ to the companies whose computer systems they targeted. Yesterday, Judge Peter Testar said their actions were ‘unacceptable’ and involved ‘serious offending’. He added: ‘The world in which we live is such that everybody relies on the internet for everything, especially in commerce. ‘It is intolerable that when an . individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s activity . they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks such as . those that occurred in this case.’ Judge Testar said the attacks . themselves were not particularly sophisticated but the group had gone to . great lengths to protect their identities. He commended the . investigators for ‘breaking down the wall of anonymity’. Masked: Anonymous has hit the headlines in the past for shutting down websites . Anonymous is a notorious group of hackers around the world who claim to have no central authority.

The fog lifted as the sun rose, creating an awe-inspiring glow for those who were up early enough to witness it this morning. But the patchy fog and bright conditions will be blasted away tomorrow as fierce winds and driving rain will blow north from the Atlantic, with the Met Office issuing a flood warning for swathes of the south coast and south-east England. Met Office forecaster Kirk Waite said: 'It has been quite a chilly start to the day today, but the fog will ease away now for a dry and bright afternoon. 'A band of rain and strong winds are expected in the south throughout the night.' A yellow 'be aware' flood warning has been issued for the region, where an inch of rain could fall overnight along the coast. Up to two inches of rain could fall in parts of the West Country, the Met Office said, as Somerset, Devon and Cornwall braces itself for another torrential downpour and winds of up to 50mph. Commuters could be left with a 'messy situation' as they make their way to work tomorrow, with flooding possible because of leaves blocking drains. 'It will be quite a cold and wet day for those parts. It will be quite breezy which will make it feel rather chilly,' the Met Office forecaster said. 'The wind and rain will make it quite unpleasant.

Bad weather wreaked havoc in Lossiemouth, Moray, on Wednesday, when almost 1ft of foamy surface water broke through the harbour wall, after it was beaten down by huge, crashing waves at high tide. The seawater swamped the roads surrounding the harbour, forcing police to stop residents and motorists moving through the area due to the risk of danger. The mayhem was compounded by strong winds of around 40mph, which swept inland from the coast.","Storm-chasing photographer Jamie Russell captured moment lightning struck above a rainbow on the Isle of Wight .

"A 13-year-old boy has committed suicide after enduring years of bullying for being small, his devastated family and friends have revealed. The bullies tormented Johnathon Short-Scaff over his slight stature - he weighed just 89 pounds - and even told him to kill himself the day before his death, his best friend said. On Wednesday, the teenager was found hanged in his bedroom at his family's Scioto County, Ohio home by his older sister. His mother, Trisha Howard Scaff, said her son, who had often tried to hide that he'd been bullied, had been his usual friendly, smiley self just an hour earlier. Loss: Jonathon Short-Scaff, 13, was found dead in his bedroom last week after enduring years of bullying . 'I got home from work that morning, and he rushed out to the van, and even opened up the van door for me,' she told WOWK. 'He said, ""Hey Mom. How was your first day at work?"" Not an hour later is when we found him.' She said that he had been bullied for years over his height and had taken his concerns to the principal of Minford Middle School, where he was a student. But nothing changed, she said. 'People made fun of him for being so little all through school,' says Trisha. 'But last year is when it starting going pretty far.' His best friend, Jordan Fyffe, said Johnathon was picked on for not being able to keep up with sports players at school. He said he witnessed the bullies taunting Johnathon just a day before his death. Devastated: His mother Trisha said he had been smiling and polite just an hour before he took his life . Family: The bullies reportedly targeted Johnathon, pictured with his mother and sisters, for being small . 'When I heard, ""Go kill yourself,"" I turned to Scaff, and asked, ""Did those guys just tell you to go kill yourself?""' Fyffe said. 'He looked at me and teared up, because he knew what was happening. 'I asked, ""Are you alright?"" He said, ""yes. I'm tough. I'll get through this."" I said, ""Yes, you are"".' After football practice, he waited for Johnathon, he told WBNS. 'He came back up with a bunch of bruises and a cut beneath his eye,' Fyffe recounted. 'He started crying and I asked him, ""Are you alright?"" He said, ""'I'll be fine"".' The school district has refused to comment. The Scioto County Sheriff is conducting an investigation on the death, and Jordan and Johnathon’s sister have been questioned about the bullying. An autopsy is also being carried out. Heartbroken: His devastated mother, Trisha Scaff, said that the school had failed to stop the bullies . At a loss: His best friend, Jordan Fyffe, said he had heard bullies telling Johnathon to kill himself a day before his death and that his friend had become emotional - but promised him he'd be okay . 'Bottom line is, this bullying has got to stop, and these schools have got to take it more serious,' his mother said. On Facebook she said she hoped that the bullies would be dealt with appropriately. His parents now plan on moving to another home, his mother said.

"Ladies, the next time the man in your life complains you talk too much, silence him with science. Tell him - at length, of course - it is all because of the Foxp2 protein. It has been claimed previously that women speak about 20,000 words a day - some 13,000 more than the average man. It has been claimed that women speak about 20,000 words a day - 13,000 more than the average man - and scientists say a higher amount of the Foxp2 protein is the reason women are more chatty . But now scientists have found the key to explaining why women are the more talkative sex. A study just published suggests that higher levels of the protein are found in the female brain. US researchers found that those with . more Foxp2, known as the ‘language protein’, in their brains were the . chattier. Among humans that was women, but in rats it was the males. The researchers set out to determine . what might make male rats more vocal than their female cage mates. They . separated four-day-old pups from their mothers and counted the number of . times they cried out. Both male and female pups emitted . hundreds of cries, but the males called out twice as often. As a result, . when the pups were put back in the same cage as their mother, she . fussed over her sons first. Researchers found the so-called 'language protein' that makes women more talkative also causes male rats to be more vocal than their female cage mates . Tests on the parts of the brain known . to be involved in vocal calls showed the male pups to have up to twice . as much Foxp2 protein as the females. The researchers then ramped up its . production in the brains of female pups and reduced it in males. This . led to the female rats crying out more often and their mothers showing . more interest to them. The males in contrast, became less . ‘talkative’, the Journal of Neuroscience reports. Next, the University . of Maryland researchers tested samples from ten boys and girls aged . between three and five. This showed the girls to have 30 per cent more of the Foxp2 protein than the boys, in a brain area key to language in humans. Researcher Margaret McCarthy said: . ‘Based on our observations, we postulate higher levels of Foxp2 in girls . and higher levels of Foxp2 in male rats is an indication that Foxp2 . protein levels are associated with the more communicative sex.’ Studies have shown that the female . love of chit-chat begins at a young age. Girls learn to speak earlier . and more quickly than boys. They produce their first words and sentences . earlier, have larger vocabularies and use a greater variety of sentence . types than boys of the same age. However, Simon Fisher, one of the . Oxford team who first pinpointed the protein, cautioned against drawing . big conclusions from a study of such a small number of children.","Researchers have found women have higher levels of Foxp2 protein .

"They are as industrious as Bob the Builder and possess the same social intelligence as a colony of termites. A crew of self-organising robots created by U.S. scientists can construct towers, castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions. It is hoped the study of the co-operative bots is a small step towards a time when autonomous robots could build real structures on Earth and even on other planets. Scroll down for Video . Sociable: Scientists have created a crew of self-organising robots (pictrued) that can construct towers, castles and pyramids without any supervision or detailed instructions . Termes bots are given an overall idea of what the finished job should look like, before being left to get on with it. All that guides them are signals from infrared and ultrasound sensors and simple 'traffic' rules that determine whether to go or stop. Termes bots require no centralised controller or complex system to talk to each other. The bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on bricks, and sonar for navigation. They follow two sets of rules. One determines how a robot makes its next move and applies to any structure being built. The other consists of 'traffic laws' that correspond to a specific structure. The traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots and material through the structure. Safety checks performed by the bots mean they do not get stranded and work with each other.

Termites have long amazed experts with their ability build. Millions of the insects co-operate to manufacture their mounds, which can stand 8ft tall (pictured) 'The key inspiration . we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really . complicated as a group, without a supervisor and secondly that you can . do it without everybody discussing explicitly what's going on, but just . by modifying the environment,' said U.S. computer scientist Professor . Radhika Nagpal, from Harvard University. Termites have long amazed . experts with their ability build. Millions of the insects co-operate to . manufacture their mounds, which can stand 8ft tall and act as . sophisticated air conditioning systems for nests. Inside each mound . is a complex system of tunnels and shafts and unlike human builders, . termites need no detailed blueprints from which to work, instead relying . on a process called ‘stigmergy’ - a kind of implicit communication. They observe each other interacting with the environment and act accordingly in a way that, scaled up, looks intelligent. The Termes bots employ the same principle. In . contrast to other working robots, such as those in car factories, they . require no centralised controller or complex system of talking to each . other. Each robot has a set of wheels and a single lifting arm with a spring-loaded gripper. The bots use infrared sensors to detect black and white patterns on the bricks, and sonar for navigation. Despite their small size, scientists are highly impressed by what their creations are capable of. In the future, similar autonomous machines could be used to build full scale structures for human use, possibly in dangerous settings where it might be difficult for humans to work .

The traffic laws tell robots at any position which sites . they are allowed to go to next and maintain a constant flow of robots . and material through the structure. 'If they built carelessly, it . would be easy for them to build in a way where they got stuck,' said . team member Dr Justin Werfel, from the Wyss Institute for Biologically . Inspired Engineering in Cambridge, U.S. 'The safety checks involve a . robot looking at the sites immediately around itself, paying attention . to where the bricks already are and where others are supposed to be and . making sure certain conditions in that local area are satisfied.' 'The key inspiration we took from termites is the idea that you can do something really complicated as a group, without a supervisor, and secondly that you can do it without everybody discussing explicitly what's going on, but just by modifying the environment,' said Professor Radhika Nagpal, from Harvard University . One . of the key advantages of the system is that it is not dependent on a . set number of interactive units working together, Dr Werfel explained. 'Individual . robots can break down but the rest can carry on. There's no one . critical element that brings everything down if one fails,’ he said. During the study, the scientists filmed the robots recovering from unexpected changes made to the structures they were building. 'When . many agents get together, whether they're termites, bees or robots, . often some interesting, higher-level behaviour emerges that you wouldn't . predict from looking at the components themselves,' Dr Werfel said.

"After a photograph of  a grizzly bear posed perfectly behind a camera became an online sensation, a video has emerged showing what really happened that day. Wildlife photographer Jim Lawrence had set up his camera close to the Kootenay National Park in British Columbia, Canada, in hopes of snapping some of the varied animal life native to the area. But he wasn't expecting this particular visitor... A photograph of a grizzly bear posing next to a camera in British Columbia, Canada has recently gone viral . Now, new footage has emerged showing exactly what led to that incredible photograph . The bear strolled over to the camera tripod to see what the fuss was all about, before pulling himself up and looking at the buttons and lens. Eventually, he put his paw up and gently tugged on the strap - causing the camera to pivot unexpectedly. The bear quickly scurried away in surprise and headed back down the bank and off of the road. Canadian wildlife photographer Jim Lawrence had set up his tripod in hopes of snapping several bears . But the bear had other plans and instead walked directly to the camera. Jim, thankfully, had another camera ready to record it . 'I set up my camera to get a photo of him across the way, but I should know better than to guess what a bear's going to do,' Lawrence told The Huffington Post Canada in an interview. 'For the longest time, he studied the screen and buttons and with his big, long-nailed paw, gently tugged on the strap.' After the scare, the bear 'shrugged and went back to fishing.' The bear examined the camera for several seconds, before pulling down on the strap - and causing the camera to pivot unexpectedly . The action spooked the bear and he scurried off and back into the forest . Though Lawrence often spends time in the Kootenay National Park area, he admitted that he'd never experienced an event like this before. Nevertheless, he shared his tips for other wildlife photographers with Huffington Post B.C. 'Carry bear spray. Keep a safe distance.

"It might look like a child's toy thrown into the snow, but this is the stunning design for a ski lodge. Czech architecture firm Atelier 8000 has proposed an incredibly unique take on a typical mountain accommodation - and the designs are spectacular. Their Kežmarské Hut, a concept designed for an international competition, is a futuristic, sustainable structure made of aluminum, glass and solar panels. Oh, and did we mention that it's a cube that has been entirely rotated onto one of its corners? The contemporary building is intended to be situated high in the High Tatra Mountains and will be able to function completely off the grid, even at such a high altitude. Designed to merge into the mountainous background, almost as if part of a retreating glacier, the construction amplifies the use of light and shadows - much like that which can be observed on neighbouring rocks. The shape of the hut allows the building to utilise solar energy to the maximum possible extent, with the panels that generate energy facing southwards and eastwards. Perfect for adventurous hikers and travellers, the five-storey building includes extensive ski storage space, two floors of guest rooms, an attic meditation room, a restaurant and a deck. Plus, its orientation provides plenty of intimate corners where visitors can relax and enjoy breathtaking views. In the warmer months, guests will be able to relax on the hotel's patio, which wraps around two of the building's sides.

"Jeremy Hunt described Ukip as unpatriotic . A Tory Cabinet minister yesterday made an outspoken attack on Ukip, describing it as an unpatriotic party which attracts racists. Jeremy Hunt also accused Nigel Farage’s party of being divisive. The Health Secretary’s attack was sparked by what he described as the ‘absolutely disgusting’ comments made by one of the party’s council candidates, who said comedian Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’. The remarks by Mr Hunt, one of David Cameron’s closest colleagues, echo the Prime Minister’s famous description of Ukip as a bunch of ‘fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. Mr Hunt’s attack was also a sign that the political establishment is becoming rattled by Ukip’s success and that the Tories are worried about a bloodbath at the European elections on May 22. It followed the release of a poll which put Ukip in the lead for the first time in the European elections battle. The Eurosceptic party was at 31 per cent in the YouGov poll for The Sunday Times. This was three percentage points higher than Labour and well ahead of the Tories on 19 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent. It indicates that Ukip’s fortunes have not been hampered by its week of gaffes. Last week, builder Andre Lampitt, who starred in a party broadcast, was suspended after tweeting criticism of Islam and Nigerians. Scroll down for videos . Prospective Ukip councillor William Henwood, left, is the latest party member to become mired in controversy. Hit hit the headlines after a tweet he posted about Lenny Henry was branded as racist . It also emerged that a ‘British builder’ featuring in an election poster about cheap foreign labour was actually an Irish actor. And an ordinary voter featured in the Ukip manifesto turned out to be party worker Lizzy Vaid. At the weekend, Lib Dem peer Lord Oakeshott accused Ukip of being the ‘BNP in blazers’ – after an analysis of Ukip’s political posters showed startling similarities withadverts put out by the far-Right BNP. It also emerged that William Henwood, who is standing for Ukip in Enfield, north London, had sent a tweet about Lenny Henry saying: ‘He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites.’ His comments came after Henry said there should be more people from ethnic minorities on TV. Yesterday, Mr Hunt told BBC Radio Five Live: ‘I do think those comments about Lenny Henry were absolutely disgusting and I do think it’s for Nigel Farage to make absolutely clear that that isn’t Ukip’s official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of views seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip.’ Asked whether the tweet was racist, he said: ‘I think it is, and that’s why I would like to hear a very clear denunciation of that from Nigel Farage. I think it is totally unacceptable and [Lenny Henry] is as British as you or I are.’ Jeremy Hunt has called on Nigel Farage to denouce Mr Henwood's comments and make it clear that they will not be tolerated . He added: ‘I think there’s a broader risk for Ukip here, because they position themselves as a patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jack all over their leaflets, but actually I think there is something very un-British about this kind of language, very unpleasant. ‘We are not a divisive country, we want to be a country where we avoid that kind of rhetoric, and I think that’s where there are some real dangers for Ukip.’ Mr Cameron made his ‘closet racist’ comments in 2006 – but since then the Conservatives have been wary of making personal attacks on the Eurosceptic party. Ukip’s deputy chairman, former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, said Mr Henwood’s comments were being investigated by the party. He claimed that ‘every party’ had ‘unknown’ activists who ‘may have said something unpleasant on social media’. Mr Hamilton told the BBC that the party was attracting ‘decent’ former supporters of the BNP who feel ‘swamped’ by immigrants. By RYAN KISIEL . Would-be Ukip councillor  William Henwood said Lenny Henry should emigrate to a ‘black country’ after the  comedian said there should be more ethnic minorities in  creative industries. Defending his Twitter remark, the Ukip candidate later told the BBC: ‘I think if black people come to this country and don’t like mixing with white people why are they here? ‘If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.’ In previous tweets Mr Henwood, 66, has compared Islam to the Nazi Third Reich. He wrote: ‘Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich. Strength through violence against the citizens.’ Mr Henry, 55, is the son of Jamaican immigrants and was born and raised in Dudley, West Midlands. He shot to fame as a comedian and has recently  performed to great critical acclaim in Shakespeare. Earlier this month he said that he wanted the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. Ukip has already launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light. On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, wrote on Twitter: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’In a separate Facebook post in July 2012 he allegedly made a joke against Muslims.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described Ukip as unpatriotic .

"One in ten Americans think 'space aliens' were involved in the disappearance if the Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, it was revealed today. A survey found that nine per cent of the people believe 'space aliens or beings from another dimension were involved'. Investigators are still continuing their search for the missing plane and the 239 people on board, which vanished from radars on March 8. Scroll down for video . The search continues: Flight officer Rayan Gharazeddine on board a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion, searches for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in southern Indian Ocean, Australia . Disappeared: The Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 which vanished almost two months ago without trace . All hands on deck: Crew on board survey ship HMS Echo in the southern Indian Ocean helping in the underwater search for the flight recorder from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . The poll by CNN and ORC International found that while most people in the U.S. believe the search for MH370 should continue, half believe authorities are searching in the wrong place. Findings also showed that the vast majority (79 per cent) believe there are no survivors. Just over half (52 per cent) think we will eventually find out what happened to the flight. However, a further 46 per cent say we will never know. The survey comes as 11 terrorists with links to Al Qaeda were arrested in Kuala Lumpur and Kedah and questioned about being involved in the plane's disappearance. Tragedy: The flight had 227 passengers and 12 crew including Fariq Hamid (left) and pilot Zaharie Ahmad . A Chinese relative of passengers aboard the missing Malaysia Airlines plane, centre, cries as she is escorted by a woman while leaving a hotel room for relatives or friends of passengers aboard the missing airplane in Beijing, China . Mystery: The report confirms authorities' belief that the plane flew either north or south when it vanished . A mid-air explosion: The lack of debris could be explained by it falling into Malaysian jungle . A terrorist attack: Director of CIA has said terrorism could not be ruled out . Power failure: Possibly caused by deliberate cutting of power to communication instruments . Electronic warfare: 20 passengers on board were experts in this technology. Hijacking: Radar data indicates the plane might have made a U-turn. A pilot error: There is a chance of them in all air mysteries, claim experts . Structural failure: Possibly involving damage sustained by an accident in 2012 . Pilot suicide: There were two large jet crashes in the late 1990s caused by this . Aeronautical black hole: Plane is stranded hundreds of miles from current search area . Aged between 22 and 55, the suspects were believed to have comprised students, business professionals and odd-job workers. Terrorism was seen as a possible cause of the disappearance by Americans, with 57 per cent of those surveyed saying terrorists were likely involved, despite no group or organisation yet coming forward to take responsibility. Furthermore, 42 per cent of the U.S. public believes hijackers were involved, while 52 per cent said a mechanical failure was probably involved. Just a quarter said it was very likely that the crew or plane's pilots had something to do with the disappearance. Yesterday, it was revealed the Malaysian tourism minister has said the government will not inject any more money into the state-owned Malaysian Airlines after the MH370 disaster. The ailing national carrier has suffered a slump in bookings and £750 million losses following the disappearance of the flight two months ago and is undergoing 'restructuring'. Headline news: Interest in the plane's disappearance has waned in other countries, but there appears to be an insatiable appetite for the story in the USA . Non-stop coverage: CNN wasn't the only media outlet covering MH370, just the most tenacious one . Mohammad Nazri Abdul Aziz, Minister of Tourism and Culture, said the government will not put 'any more money' into the troubled airline. Malaysia Airlines - which is owned by the government through a holding company - had already suffered $1.3billion losses over the past three years as it faced stiff competition and unprofitable routes, Gulf News reports. Mr Aziz said that the government is now unsure what it can do - but he added: 'To inject new capital is certainly not an option.' It now looks unlikely that the government will sell the national carrier to private investor after the share price dropped both under the restructuring plans and the flight MH370 disaster.

The storm, which has been named Draco by The Weather Channel, is expected to dump about three inches of snow in and around Denver, Colorado, tonight before proceeding east. The system will then gain . steam as it heads along the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles in the late . afternoon to early evening of Christmas Day. From . there, it will head up towards the Great Lakes and move eastward . throughout Wednesday.

That last time more than an inch fell on Christmas Day was 1926. Western California and the Pacific Northwest are due for snow on Christmas Day as well. But if Draco doesn't wreak enough havoc for Christmas, a storm that The Weather Channel has dubbed Euclid will be right behind it, taking a similar path over Colorado toward the East Coast. On the southern edge of the storm . system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the . roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs . in Alabama. More tornadoes may sweep into the Gulf Coast on Christmas Day, from Texas to the Florida panhandle, according to Accuweather.

"Arrest: Ryan McPherson (pictured in court in 2003) was jailed over the TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempt amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives . The two American tourists who fled Thailand after allegedly trying to post body parts to Las Vegas are film-makers who served time in prison for producing a show that paid homeless men to fight each other, it has been revealed. Ryan McPherson, 31, was questioned on Saturday after the gruesome discovery of a baby's head, a foot, 'sheets' of tattooed skin and an adult heart with stab-wounds, by staff at a DHL sorting office in Bangkok. The second suspect was reported to be Daniel Tanner, 33, a co-producer on the controversial television series, Bumfights. The parts - which police believe were stolen from a Bangkok hospital's 'Museum of Death' - were stored in plastic containers filled with formaldehyde, wrapped and addressed to  Las Vegas. 'X-rays showed there were contents similar to human body parts. From our investigation of three parcels we found human body parts in five plastic containers,' Police Lieutenant General Ruangsak Jaritake, assistant to the National Police Commissioner, told reporters. 'The packages were marked 'children's toys' but x-rays showed they were not children's toys.' He said the boxes in fact contained a left foot, skull, face and heart of babies as well as pieces of skin tattooed with Khmer letters and tiger patterns. McPherson and Tanner told police they bought the items at a market and wanted to send them back to friends as a joke. Both men were released without charge, upon which they crossed into Cambodia yesterday, police said. But police have now demanded the two foreigners return 'for further investigation' over breaching customs laws. The controversial film-makers, from California, produced the popular TV series Bumfights, in which homeless men attempt amateur stunts in exchange for money, alcohol, and other incentives. Thai police officers show pictures of tattooed human skin during a press conference in Bangkok . But they were arrested after the first episode, Bumfights Vol. 1 – Cause For Concern, was released on DVD in 2002 and charged with misdemeanor charges of conspiracy to stage an illegal fight and sentenced to 280-hours of community service at a homeless shelter. But when McPherson failed to show up to the work, he was jailed for 180 days. One of the homeless men involved in the video was even paid to have the word 'Bumfights' tattooed on his forehead. In 2006, the filmmakers agreed to stop making Bumfights films and pay three of the homeless men featured  as part of an out of court settlement. The men were attempting to sue the film's producers for emotional and physical damages suffered by appearing in the Bumfights videos. The Nation newspaper said, citing a police source, that he had left for Cambodia but promised to return to Thailand on November 25 to cooperate with police. The second man has not been identified. Policemen show pictures of body parts found in parcels as they address reporters in Bangkok . Police say one of the packages contained an adult 'sheet of skin' with tattoo markings . Police Col. Chumpol Poompuang told reporters that the American claimed he had bought the objects to 'spook' a friend 'for fun'. He told reporters: 'He said he thought the body parts were bizarre and wanted to send them to his friends in the US.' He said the men told police they had bought the infant's head and other organs from a night flea market at Saphan Phut (Memorial Bridge) but were unable to retrace their steps back to the shop. He confirmed the man was questioned for several hours before he was released without charges. Gruesome: DHL staff made the startling discovery when they scanned three packages . One of the American tourists told police the items were purchased at a night market in Bangkok . Police said the two suspects aged 31 and 33, and said they were being 'monitored', but did not say how. Both men fled Thailand on Sunday through a checkpoint in the east of the country, Ruangsak said. He said the heart had stab marks and belonged to an adult while the sheet of skin with tattoo markings also belonged to an adult. 'As soon as we have results, we will contact the FBI,' he said. The three packages were being sent to Las Vegas, including one that a tourist had addressed to himself . Doctors at Bangkok's Siriraj Hospital said that the body parts were taken from the hospital's Medical Museum, nicknamed the Museum of Death, which exhibits preserved human remains, many of them from murder victims. 'We can confirm that they were stolen from Siriraj,' Udom Kachintorn, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, told reporters. He added that the two Americans visited the museum last month. In 2012, Thai police arrested a British citizen of Taiwanese origin after discovering six human foetuses which had been roasted and covered in gold leaf stuffed into travel bags at a hotel room in Bangkok's Chinatown. Thai detectives said they believed the corpses were due to be sent to Taiwan to be used as part of a black magic ritual.","Staff at DHL sorting office in Bangkok made the startling discovery .

"British metal band, The Defiled, has just made history. They are the first-ever band to play a live gig atop a gigantic iceberg - located in the middle of the Greenland Sea. The Defiled performed on top of a floating platform for the Jägermeister Ice Cold Gig – which sees artists put to the test as they perform in unconventional, ice-cold conditions. Scroll down for video . British metal band, The Defiled, played the world's first-ever gig on a floating iceberg . And between the freezing temperatures and fast flowing ice, the rock stars did just that. The small crowd, mostly from the nearby town of Kulusuk, ventured to the ice field to watch this once-in-a-lifetime gig from fishing boats. To reach their iceberg stage, the band first flew to Iceland, before transferring to Kulusuk, Greenland, and then heading by boat to the small island of Tasiilaq, which has a population of just over 2000. It actually took several days of searching to find the 'perfect' berg - one that was large and thick enough to hold the band and all of their equipment. It took days of searching to find the perfect iceberg - it needed to be large and thick enough to hold the band . Locals, who have lived and worked on the icebergs for years, helped the band to shuttle their instruments and sound equipment to the gig stage, and to thank them for their help, the group donated their equipment to the local community hall after the gig. Band member Stitch D said: 'This has to be one of the most insane gigs we've ever played! You see these things on TV documentaries but it's not until you get to see them in real life that you realise just how big and amazing icebergs are. 'Although it was cold, I don't think any of us noticed once we got started. The stage location literally takes your breath away.' To capture the footage, state-of-the-art flying drone cameras were used and controlled by nearby boats . Known for their dark and imposing on-stage outfits - which provided an incredible contrast to the all-white surroundings - The Defiled played a 30 minute set in total, featuring tracks from their latest album Daggers. To capture the footage, Jägermeister and the band utilised state-of-the-art 'octocopter flying drone cameras,' controlled remotely by the boats nearby, which hovered above the iceberg. Tom Carson, Jägermeister music manager, added: 'As far as stage backdrops go, I don’t think you’ll find anything more impressive than this.'","The Defiled played the world's first gig on top of a floating iceberg .

"If swallowing tablets invokes a fear of choking followed by unpleasant gagging and a nasty  taste in the mouth, there is now a little ray of hope. While some people suffer the medical condition dysphagia - usually the result of stroke or conditions including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's - most simply face a mental barrier. But scientists in Germany believe they may have the devised a new foolproof guide to help people take their medication with ease. Dr Walter Haefeli, who led the study at the University of Heidelberg, said he believes it will help people who struggle finish full courses of medication. Scientists believe they may have devised two methods to help people who struggle to take tablets, pictured above are the 'pop bottle' and 'lean forward' methods . He said around 10 per cent of patients who struggle to swallow use it as an excuse not to take their tablets. The study examined 151 adults as they were given 16 differently shaped placebos, totally 283 between them. Researchers looked at both traditional shaped tablets and capsules/ . They found for both types, swallowing the pills with at least 20ml of water - around a tablespoon - was most effective. After taking each pill the participants rated the ease of swallowing. Researchers then asked them to try swallowing the tablets and capsules in specific positions, using techniques they had devised. They discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the 'pop bottle' method. CHALKY TABLETS . The researchers discovered the best way to take chalky tablets is the 'pop bottle' method. This is where the tablet is placed on the tongue, the lips are tightly closed around the opening (of the bottle) and the tablet is swallowed in a swift suction movement. CAPSULES . Here, the 'lean forward' technique' is best, the researchers say. Capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward. Dr Haefeli said choosing which method to use depended on the shape of the medication. 'Capsules, with a density lower than water, will swim in the mouth and so head position matters. 'In contrast, to swallow tablets, which have almost always higher densities than water, it is necessary to focus on flushing the medicines into the pharynx [the cone-shaped passageway leading from the nose and mouth towards the oesophagus and voice-box].' This is where the tablet is placed on the tongue, the lips are tightly closed around the opening (of the bottle) and the tablet is swallowed in a swift suction movement. However for capsules, the 'lean forward' technique' is best, the researchers say. Here, capsules are swallowed in an upright position with the head bent forward. In the study, volunteers were asked to try both methods and rate how easy it was to swallow the pills. The 'pop bottle' technique improved swallowing by 60 per cent, while 88 per cent of those who tried the 'lean forward' method said it was easier. Dr Haefeli told the Guardian: 'Both the techniques we describe were remarkably effective in participants with and without reported difficulties in swallowing pills and should be recommended regularly.' He said choosing which method to use depended on the shape of the medication. 'Capsules, with a density lower than water, will swim in the mouth and so head position matters. 'In contrast, to swallow tablets, which have almost always higher densities than water, it is necessary to focus on flushing the medicines into the pharynx.' This is the cone-shaped passageway leading from the nose and mouth towards the oesophagus and voice-box. Dr Haefeli added that round tablets were found to perform worse. The report stated: 'This study showed for the first time that two targeted techniques to facilitate tablet and capsule intake were remarkably effective and easy to adopt in the general population. 'This included patients with swallowing difficulties, and should therefore be generally recommended.' The study was published in the journal Annals of Family Medicine. Researchers at the University of Heidelberg studied 151 adults taking 16 different placebo pills. The 'pill bottle' method was found best for those taking regular tablets, while the 'lean forward' technique helped those participants trying to swallow capsule pills .","Researchers from the University of Heidelberg devised two techniques .

"Details emerged today of the extraordinary lengths the NYPD is going to as they attempt to make lower Manhattan the safest business district in the world and protect it from a dirty bomb threat. New York City police are stepping up protection against the threat of a radioactive attack on the area as part of a $200million security upgrade. A command centre will monitor 2,000 mobile radiation detectors carried by officers each day around the city, which will send a wireless, real-time alert if there's a reading signalling a dirty bomb threat. View: New York police are stepping up protection against the threat of a radioactive attack as part of a $200million security upgrade. This photo is taken from the top of One World Trade Center looking south . High-security area: The radiation detection system is part of a $200million security initiative in lower Manhattan, which has been inspired by the so-called 'ring of steel' encircling the London business district . The system already is being tested under the watch of federal authorities in hopes it can be perfected and used elsewhere. ‘This is the first and only place you'll see it,’ an NYPD counterterrorism official said.‘It's been tested in the field. It works, and we're hoping to get (the wireless detectors) deployed in a few months.’ A dirty bomb has never been discovered in a U.S. terror plot, but they are a serious threat because they are easy to build and foreign terrorists are known to want to use them against U.S. cities. The radiation detection system is part of a $200million security initiative in lower Manhattan. It has been inspired by the so-called ‘ring of steel’ encircling the London business district in Britain. But this is certainly broader in scope and sophistication. Thwarting the threat: Police officers work in the operations centre of the Lower Manhattan Security Coordination Center on Thursday in New York . It will rely largely on 3,000 closed-circuit security cameras carpeting the roughly 1.7 square miles south of Canal Street, the subway system and parts of midtown Manhattan. So far, about 1,800 cameras are up and running, with the rest expected to come on line by the end of the year. Only 500 cameras were online at this time last year, reported the New York Post. Police began monitoring live feeds in 2008 from the cameras at a high-tech command centre in lower Manhattan - home to Wall Street, the new development at Ground Zero and other important sites. ‘We're talking about some of the most significant targets anywhere in the world,’ Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. Changing landscape: One World Trade Center, left, rises up in the Manhattan skyline in this aerial photo . The NYPD is using a single, high-bandwidth fibre-optic network to connect all its cameras to a central computer system. It's . also pioneering ‘video analytic’ computer software designed to detect . threats, like unattended bags, and retrieve stored images based on . descriptions of terror or other criminal suspects. Security around the World Trade . Center site is a huge concern for New York police, who know terrorists . could try to launch another attack on the new building in an attempt to . insult the Americans. New system: NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly wants lower Manhattan to be the world's safest business district . Officials are desperate to avoid anything close to the tragic attacks of 9/11, when more than 2,000 people died in New York after a terrorist attack organised by Al Qaeda on the Twin Towers. Two months ago fears were raised over the new World Trade Center skyscraper's security after 'confidential' detailed plans of the building were posted online on an official city website. The secure schematics showed ground floor entrances and where the PATH rail tunnels will pass below, as well as mechanical rooms, ventilation shafts, exits, elevators and stairs. But the Port Authority said the documents were 'scrubbed' of sensitive information about One World Trade Center's electrical systems, plumbing, security and fire safety.","Police want to make lower Manhattan safest business district in world .

"Pro-Union demonstrators made 'Nazi salutes' in front of police officers as Scotland's referendum vote began to turn nasty. Hundreds of demonstrators waving Union flags arrived at George Square in Glasgow, which up until recently had been the unofficial headquarters of the pro-independence movement. Glasgow voted in favour of independence in yesterday's historic vote which threatened to split the United Kingdom. Police confirmed that three people have been arrested following the disturbances. Scroll down for video . Demonstrators waving Union flags made 'Nazi salutes' as tensions increased in Glasgow all afternoon as demonstrators marched to George Square . Demonstrators let off flares as Police Scotland launch a major operation to prevent serious disorder in Glasgow following the referendum result .

Police in Glasgow were forced to separate rival independence supporters following a pro-Union rally in George Square. Hundreds of men waving Union flags sang Rule Britannia as police contained them in a 'loose kettle'. An estimated 80 police officers are trying to contain the demonstrators who are singing 'You can stick your independence up your a***'. The men also sang 'If you hate Alex Salmond clap your hands' and 'God Save the Queen'. Many of the protester, who are mostly aged between 20 and 40, appear to be quite intoxicated. One drunken protester boasted that 'Glasgow would burn for voting Yes,' claiming it was now 'payback time'. Police Scotland confirmed that they have been dealing with 'disorder' in the area. Police deployed a human barrier to prevent protesters, who were lighting flares, from marching to other areas around the city .

A large number of the demonstrators attempted to move onto Cochrane Street but were prevented by the heavy police presence. As the situation deteriorated, demonstrators tried to gain access to Queen Street train station which was promptly closed by police. It is understood that some of the demonstrators are members of the far-right Scottish Defence League. Flags and banners associated with Glasgow Rangers were also spotted in the crowd. Earlier, one middle-aged woman wearing a Yes badge attempted to make her way through George Square during the demonstration when she was accosted by a group of men in their 20s. The men spat at the clearly shocked woman and called her 'scum'. Several scuffles broke out as rival groups congregated in George Square which was regarded as the unofficial headquarters of the Yes Campaign . Police began the operation keeping apart rival factions around 4pm this evening when tensions increased requiring officers to intervene in the situation . Police Scotland said they had been forced to form a human barrier to prevent protesters from marching down Buchanan Street and away from George Square . Some protesters also shouted 'scum' at police officers attempting to maintain order. Also witnesses claim they saw glass bottles thrown by demonstrators as tensions in the city escalated. Union supporters and people sporting Yes badges argued over the referendum result and a chorus of Rule Britannia was countered by the Scottish anthem, Flower of Scotland. Roads around the square were closed as police dealt with the incident. A large group of union supporters later gathered in George Square again, this time at the top of the square next to Queen Street Station. They sang Rule Britannia and a flare was let off. Traffic in Glasgow City Centre was brought to a standstill as police were forced to close several entrances to George Square while the protest contined . After several hours of confrontation, protesters began dispersing after 9pm . Police formed a human barrier to block off the route to Buchanan Street and contain people in the square. After 9pm the crowd scattered but smaller groups remained and the line of police officers stayed. Mounted officers also remained at the scene. A spokeswoman for Police Scotland said investigations were under way which could lead to more arrests. She said: 'Three people have been arrested so far in relation to the incident in George Square. Retrospective inquiries will be carried out which may lead to further arrests.' Earlier, Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins asked the public to remain calm following the referendum result. He said: 'It is to everyone’s credit that they remained calm on a day of potentially high emotion and co-operated fully with our Police Officers and also the staff at Polling Places on a day when record numbers turned out to vote.' 'This meant the ballot and count passed off smoothly and there were just a very few isolated incidents across the country involving a small number of alleged offences.' Some pro-Union supporters made 'Nazi salutes' standing directly in front of Police officers attempting to keep rival factions apart . He continued: 'Police Scotland had plans in place to ensure the safety and security of the Referendum and these worked. 'I would also like to thank our Police Officers across the country for the hard work and effort they put in to ensure the day went well.' Mr Higgins confirmed that over the period of the referendum ballot and count there were six arrests across the country mainly for alleged breaches of the peace and assaults. 'As we move forward the public can be assured Police Scotland is committed to keeping people safe. We will respond appropriately and proportionately to any issues which may arise.' Pro and anti-independence supporters met in St George Square after lunch time with the situation rapidly deteriorating as anger and animosity was evident . When the first demonstrators arrived after lunchtime, the atmosphere was quite jovial with none of the later air of menace which developed .

"David Beckham came under fire from anti- gambling campaigners last night after revealing he has signed up with a Las Vegas hotel and casino giant to help promote its property businesses in Asia. The former England football captain will promote properties owned by Las Vegas Sands in Singapore and the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau. He has already made promotional appearances with groups of local schoolchildren at casino resorts. Scroll down for video .

His wife Victoria is said to have another £35million. Last . night Beckham’s spokesman said ‘the central part (of the deal) is a . dining and sports experience along with corporate social responsibility . initiatives.

Rehabilitation. ‘David Beckham could influence a lot of people and he . should be very careful who he associates himself with. We can’t look . lightly on it. ‘He probably doesn’t know about the kinds of . problems that gambling can bring.

"There is something wild about actress Melanie Griffith's upbringing. As this incredible series of photographs shows, while her peers were growing up, fighting with their parents and doing everything else a normal teenager does, the 14-year-old Griffith had an extra influence at home - her enormous, live-in pet lion. Pictured in 1971 lounging by the pool, playfighting, and even in bed together, Melanie and Neil, as the hulking African big cat was known, can be seen sharing a touching bond. Neil came to live with the family in bizarre circumstances, after they adopted him from Anton Lavey, High Priest of the Church of Satan, who was told he could no longer keep him in his small San Francisco apartment. Scroll down for video . Wild child: Melanie Griffith, aged just 14, leaps into the swimming pool in her Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, home as she playfights with her enormous pet lion, Neil . Better than a teddy bear: In the intimate set of photographs, Griffith is seen relaxing in bed with the huge lion . Mom's pet too: Tippi Hedren, muse to the famed director Alfred Hitchcock, also had lots of fun with Neil, as shown in this playful image . In one photograph Griffith looks completely carefree even as Neil grapples her leg with his paws as she jumps into the water at their home in Sherman Oaks, a suburb of Los Angeles. Griffith, the daughter of starlet and Hitchcock muse Tippi Hedren, lived with her mother and her then-husband Noel Marshall, a Hollywood agent. In the series of pictures, first published in LIFE Magazine, Marshall and Hedren are also seen happily co-existing with Neil. In one, the lion tries to get the attention of Marshall by roaring in his face as he sits - entirely nonplussed - at his typewriter. Casual: Neil, whom the family adopted from Church of Satan founder Anton Lavey, is seen above bothering Hedren's then-husband Noel Marshall at work, and enjoying another session by the pool with Griffith . Plush sofa: Hedren uses Neil as an oversized pillow while catching up on the news. Now aged 84, she still keeps lions . Non-plussed: Noel Marshall, a major Hollywood agent, tries to get some work done despite Neil roaring in his face . Grappling: Hedren takes on Neil in a dangerous-looking wrestling match on the floor of their California home . The majestic beast was adopted by the family after they took a trip to Africa and decided to make a movie about lions, Roar, which would take 11 years to complete. Sadly, the movie was a box office flop,and the production was plagued by injuries resulting from working with lions. Griffith herself required 50 stitches at one point after being bit by one of the cats, and cinematographer Jan de Bont had to have his scalp sewn back on after being attacked. In total, despite its $17million price-tag, the film only made $2million at the box office. But the movie stands as a testament to the family's love of lions - which Hedren still keeps at her home on a wildlife reserve in California. Today: Griffith (pictured left in 2014, now aged 57), had the lion in her life thanks in part to Anton Lavey (right), High Priest of the Church of Satan . The lion sleeps tonight: A maid steps over Neil VERY carefully in the family's kitchen while the big cat rests .","Picture set from 1971 shows Griffith relaxing outside with her pet - called Neil - at her home in Los Angeles .

"A breathtaking video has emerged showing a group of base jumpers throwing themselves from the top of a skyscraper and landing perfectly in a nearby rooftop pool. The stunt, recorded by a GoPro camera attached to the second jumper's helmet, was attempted from the top of Malaysia's 1100ft-high Kuala Lumpur Tower. The recording shows base jumpers John Van Horne, Matt Frolich and Andy Lewis walking along the edge of the skyscraper at night with the brightly illuminated city visible below them, before jumping off in succession. Scroll down for video . The first base jumper in the group of three readies himself to jump from the Kuala Lumpur Tower . The camera, attached to the helmet of the second jumper, records his initial fall . The second jumper then prepares himself for his leap. His target, a nearby rooftop pool, is not yet visible . During his descent he positions himself to land in the pool pictured on the roof of the building to the right . As he nears the water, the crowd surrounding the pool lets off a large cheer . He makes a perfect landing in the centre of the hotel pool and then pulls himself from the water . He manages to get out in time to see the third and final jumper land in the water a minute after him . The heartstopping stunt begins when the first man visible on camera leaps from the balcony and is filmed falling towards the city below. It then cuts to footage of the camera-wearing jumper, as he launches himself from the edge of the tower, pulls open his parachute, and begins aligning himself for the approach to the rooftop pool below. As he nears the water, a crowd can be seen gathered around the water in anticipation of his landing. He hits the pool successfully to loud cheers. He then pulls himself out of the water and watches the third base jumper in his group land a minute later. Base jumpers are renowned for their adrenaline seeking urban stunts. In August, a pair of thrill-seeking base jumpers leaped from the 48th floor of a London skyscraper. The video, recorded by cameras attached to the jumpers themselves, showed the two visiting the Attic Bar at Pan Peninsula in Canary Wharf. They pretend they are regular customers and even drink a beer before entering the toilets, attaching their parachutes and leaping from the bar's smoking balcony into the streets below.","Base jumpers perform incredible jump from 1100ft-high Kuala Lumpur tower .

"Space experts are trying to solve the mystery of ‘a UFO fragment’ which crashed close to a village in Siberia. Locals insist the metallic object – which resembles a large rubbish bin – fell from the skies but initial checks by experts have concluded it is neither from a rocket nor a missile. It is now under police guard as interest in the ‘visitor’ intensifies. The 'fragment' does not appear to come from any known missile or space technology. Russian space experts will make an announcement shortly . The six-foot metal object is now under police guard as the Russian space agency prepares to examine it . Weighing 200 kilograms and around two . metres in height, locals fixed it onto a trailer and took across the . snow to the village where local inspectors checked it. ‘The object found is not related to . space technology. A final conclusion can be made after a detailed study . of the object by experts,' said the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Locals insist the metallic object - resembling a large shiny rubbish bin - fell from the skies. The object is six feet long and is at least partially made of titanium steel. It's now under police guard as interest in the 'visitor' intensifies. It was found near a village called Otradnensky some two thousand miles and three time zones east of Moscow. The Russian media immediately claimed ‘fragments of a UFO’ were discovered in the remote forest. Locals had heard strange sounds in the thick woodland in December, it was claimed. But it was only on Sunday that the find was reported to local police who then alerted Moscow. Yuri Bornyakov, head of rescue service department of Kuibyshevski district of Novosibirsk region, said: ‘We measured the radiation level near and inside the object. We found no radiation here.’ The 200-kilo metal fragment was examined for radiation. A theory that it's a remnant from a rocket launch in Kazakhstan also appears to be mistaken . Initial theories that it was part of a space rocket or a satellite form a failed launch in Kazakhstan have been denied. Head of Department for Civil Defence and Emergency Situations of the Kuibyshevski, Valery Vasiliev, said part of the fragment was made of ultra strong titanium. Finder Sergey Bobrov undertook in an official statement that he would keep the UFO safe, but locals reported that  ‘police came during the night and secretly removed it’. A local police spokesman confirmed the object was now under guard by the force on orders from unspecified authorities. ‘You can see inside it, all is open, it's empty, no danger here. We were asked to take and store it. We brought it here. And now we are going to wait until they come to take it if they need it’ said Sergei Sulein.","Six foot metal fragment fell near remote village in Siberia .

"She was once the pet of Malaysian royalty but now the loneliest orangutan in the world pines away her days in a miserable zoo with no companion, no toys, no leafy trees and only a concrete block to sleep on. It is believed Katarina, aged about 12 and about to grow into adulthood, has never seen another orangutan apart from her murdered mother and, says a devoted wildlife activist who is determined to find her a better life, because of her total isolation she thinks she’s the only orangutan in the world. Alone in her squalid surroundings, she doesn’t know how to behave like an orangutan, unable to exhibit natural behaviours usually displayed in a leafy environment shared with other youngsters. Visitors throw junk food at her and have been caught trying to force her to smoke a cigarette. She has no bedding and is forced to sit on cold concrete everyday for at least 12 hours after the zoo is closed. Orangutans were sometimes referred to as the wild men of Borneo by British colonialists, but those days of centuries past were when the jungles were alive with healthy populations of the orange-furred ape. Scroll down for video . Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan peers out through the bars of her night cage in Lipis Zoo, Malaysia. Her concrete sleeping quarters are behind her . Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan, peers out from the bars of her bleak night cage where she has only a concrete floor to sleep on in Lipis Zoo, Malaysia . Today it is estimated that only 50,000 remain in the wild on the Indonesian island of Sumatra and on Borneo, which is shared by Indonesia and Malaysia. Their world is dying around them, as trees come down to make way for oil palm plantations and adult apes and babies are hacked to death by workers protecting the planted trees. For those people, hungry orangutans are pests which must be destroyed. ‘Katarina’s mother was without a doubt murdered because that is the only way you are going to get a baby away from an adult orangutan,’ says 33-year-old Upreshpal Singh, director of the Kuala Lumpur-based Friends of the Orangutans, a man who is totally committed to saving the apes as many other welfare groups in his country sit idly by. Katrina is the forgotten Wild Woman of Borneo, for without Mr Singh’s work it is unlikely that anyone would even know she is in the tiny, decaying zoo, aside from the handful of visitors who call by and - as is often the case - try to throw anything at hand at her including junk food. A campaign is growing to find her a mate and a Facebook group is calling for better conditions. Campaigner Mr Singh says: ‘I only need to look into her eyes and I can see the loneliness there. Where is the spark that I’ve seen in other orangutans? She sits around without a soul nearby because everything has had to be fenced off to try to stop people throwing stuff at her.' Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan who is believed to have never seen another of her species apart from her murdered mother, climbs in her bleak enclosure in Lipis Zoo, Malaysia . Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan, sits forlornly at the top of a bare tree as suburia spreads in Lipis, Malaysia. She does not exhibit normal behaviours because she has never had a mate . Mr Singh drives me across the Malaysian peninsula, a three hour journey to the town of Kuala Lipis, which was a gold mining centre before the British arrived in 1887.The state capital has since dramatically declined and the decaying, tiny zoo  on a hillside overlooking the town attracts few tourists. ‘I’ve got a bit of a reputation for getting places closed down because of cruelty concerns and while I have been shocked at some of the things I’ve seen, I’m really worried about Katarina,’ he says as we step down the hillside towards the cages. ‘She climbs a tree which has no leaves and sits there all day, doing nothing. Then during the hours of darkness she’s locked in a night cage which has nothing but a concrete floor. 'She’s as miserable as sin - I can see that - and I’m determined to get her moved to a place where there are other orang-utans and where she can be happy for the rest of her life.’ What has infuriated Mr Singh is the fact that the government has spent at least £10 million on building an enclosure for two Chinese pandas at the Nagara Zoo, the national animal enclosure, yet not a penny has been spent on upgrading the seriously under-funded Lipis Zoo or doing anything to help the lonely orangutan. ‘While the pandas are receiving daily enrichment, Katarina receives none. She is not going to enjoy a full and healthy life is this torture continues,’ says Mr Singh. Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan plays on a rope, her only plaything, in her enclosure in the Lipis Zoo, Malaysia. She has never had a companion . Suburbia creeps in on the miserable domain of Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan in a tiny zoo in Lipis, Malaysia, after she was kept as a pet by a royal family. She has never had a mate and pines away her days . A wildlife investigator snuck into the zoo at night to check on how Katarina was sleeping and, by torchlight, found her slumped on concrete in a corner. That is how it has been every night for at least 12 hours for the past three years since she was handed to the zoo. ‘I’ve been told on good authority that she was a pet with one of Malaysia’s nine royal families, having come through the illegal wildlife trade. Then, when she got too big to handle, she was passed to the zoo,’ says Mr Singh. We walk past cages with rusty bars staring in at sad animals that include a small leopard cat that was being tormented by three children who were screaming at it and laughing as it tried to hide behind its bleak, concrete home. Katarina’s enclosure is quite large but bare of any leafy trees. She is sitting on top of a barren tree staring down at us. In the valley below her are houses that have swallowed up the forests that once covered this region. The viewing platform into her enclosure is wrapped in wire mesh to try stop people throwing rubbish at her - but they still feed her junk food. There is not a keeper in sight - in fact the only employee to be found is an elderly lady sitting in the ticket booth at the entrance. Katarina, the world's loneliest orangutan, comes from the light into the darkness as she enters her night cage at Lipis Zoo, Malaysia . ‘People still manage to toss junk food at Katarina and it doesn’t stop there - they throw lighted cigarette at her, hoping she’ll put on a show and smoke one.’ Katrina climbs down from her roost and grabs a rope that is stretched across the enclosure and pulls herself along it. She’s putting on a harmless kind of show for us - but then she scuttles off into the darkness of her night cage. This is her life, nothing more - and Mr Singh is determined to change it for the better. He has been pressing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to immediately transfer Katerina to the Matang Wildlife Sanctuary in Sarawak, Borneo, where the Sarawak Forestry Corporation provides excellent care for orang-utans saved from abuse. ‘This is now very urgent. We need to take her away from her misery. She needs a mate. She needs a friend. She has probably not been with her kind since infancy after losing her mother,’ says Mr Singh. ‘Orangutans cannot be left to live alone in captivity. In Katarina’s case it is solitary confinement of the very worst kind.’ Mr Singh’s group Friends of the Orangutans, has started a petition in the hope that animal lovers around the world will join forces to have Katarina moved to the Matang Wildlife Sanctuary. The petition can be seen at: https://www.change.org/p/datuk-seri-g-palanivel-save-katarina-the-orangutan-in-malaysia .","Katarina used to belong to Malaysian royal family but is now dying alone .

"This is the remarkable moment a man paralysed for 10 years walked with the help of a robotic skeleton. Gareth Herridge broke his neck and badly damaged vertebrae in a car crash on in January 2005. He was left with no mobility below his chest and severely restricted arm movement. Now, however, a robotic skeleton has given him  the ability to walk. Hope: Gareth Herridge, who has been paralysed for a decade since a car crash, walks using a robotic skeleton . To celebrate his 32nd birthday, Mr Herridge was able to try on equipment that could change his life for the better. The Rex robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position, allowing the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches. The futuristic bionic 'exo-skeleton' is a prototype made by New Zealand-based company Rex Bionics. The suit can be bought at a cost of £90,000 by individuals or from hospital trusts later this month, with the chance of users being able to have private sessions estimated at a price of £200. The Rex robotic skeleton is a suit that supports the body in an upright position. It allows the paralysed user to walk forward and backwards and shuffle from side to side without the aid of crutches. Rex users move from their chair into Rex, strap themselves in and control their movements using a joystick and control pad. The equipment weighs 38kg (84lb) and is individually made for each user. It is powered by a lightweight, long-life rechargeable battery. It is strapped tightly to the legs and around the waist uses joysticks to control the speed and direction of movement. Because Mr Herridge is quadriplegic, he cannot use other devices that require upper body strength. Speaking about the experience, he said: 'I'm always open to the possibility of new things, so I was happy to be the guinea pig. 'When you're sitting down all the time, it's a refreshing change to be on eye level with people. 'I was a bit unsure about how my legs would take it because I get spasms, but I was surprised how easy it was to use and the movement it gave . 'I've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good.' Mr Herridge, a teaching assistant, featured in a promotional video filmed at the James Cook University Hospital in Teesside. Challenge: Mr Herridge said he he was 'happy to be the guinea pig' and was always 'pen to the possibility of new things'.  'I've used standing frames before to be able to move - and this one felt really good' It is hoped the exoskeleton could offer increased independence to wheelchair users, as well as helping people do jobs that are too restrictive in a wheelchair. Crispin Simon, Chief Executive of Rex Bionics, said: 'While Rex will not offer the same functionality as before, for the right person, it can offer a big increase in their quality of life. 'It lifts them gradually from their wheelchair and when they stand it's emotional. 'One man who had been unable to walk for 20 years brought all his friends when he used Rex for the first time. 'One of them who'd known him for years said he hadn't realised how tall he was.'","Gareth Herridge broke his neck and badly damaged vertebrae in car crash .

"From a dainty Japanese teahouse perched in a grove of cherry trees to an elegant modernist cabin in Belgium, today's treehouses are a world away from the father-fabricated efforts of childhood. No surprise then, that the new breed of treehouse has proven even more popular with adults than with children as Architectural Digest revealed when it unveiled the world's best treehouses. So cool are the new breed of treehouse, they've even merited their own design book: Tree Houses. Fairy Tale Castles in the Air by Phillip Jodido (£44.99, Taschen). Included in both is the Honey Sphere, owned by Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. After being exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the red wood and steel latticed sphere was installed at Krieger's Beverley Hills home, where he apparently uses it to sit back, relax and write music. Spectacular: The steel and cedar wood Honey Sphere now belongs to Doors guitarist Robby Krieger who uses it as a song-writing retreat at his Beverley Hills home .

Another, the Lake Tree House in the town of Araras in Brazil, sits at the edge of a spectacular lake and boasts two floors and a separate children's retreat. Designed by Casa na Árvore, the two-bedroom home was constructed from local timber and built around an Australian eucalyptus tree. Elsewhere, there's the Treehotel near Luleå in Northern Sweden, which boasts not one but seven extraordinary treehouses. The best known is the Mirrorcube, designed by architects Tham & Videgård, and complete with a roof terrace and an interior packed with furniture by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Another super specimen is The Blue Cone, where the scarlet tiled exterior conceals slick Swedish design within. There's even a UFO-inspired design created by architect Bertil Harström which bears a close resemblance to a flying saucer and looks completely unearthly in its pretty forest surroundings. Now you see it... The spectacular Mirrorcube was designed by Swedish architects Tham & Videgård while the stylish interior was kitted out with furniture by Alvar Aalto . Standout: Despite being just 40 miles short of the Arctic Circle, the SandellSandberg designed 'Blue Cone' room at the Treehotel proves style is not in short supply . Hideaway: The Mårten Cyrén and Gustav Cyrén designed Cabin (left) has a double bedroom while the spooky-looking UFO is deceptively spacious and sleeps four . Perhaps the most unearthly of all though is the stunning Teahouse Tetsu at the Kiyoharu Shirakaba Museum in the Japanese city of Hokuto. Perched atop a cypress base in a gorgeous grove of pink-petalled cherry trees, the Terunobu Fujimori-designed teahouse looks as if it sprang direct from the imagination of Hans Christian Andersen and even has a fairytale-style crooked chimney. Also in Japan is the amazing Gajumaru Treehouse Diner, which serves up classic Okinawan fare from its perch at the top of a gnarled old tree overlooking Naha Harbour. Equally extraordinary but with a distinctly tropical feel is the Big Beach House in the Sky which is set in a Tamarind tree on the island of Hainan just off the coast of China. Designed by Treehouses of Hawaii's David Greenberg, the 'shack' shouts Caribbean cool, despite its precarious perch and views of the jade green South China Sea. But you don't have to travel to Scandinavia, China or Japan to get your design fix. Much closer to home is the eco-friendly modernist effort in the town of Hechtel-Eksel in Belgium's Limberg region.

"Michael Schumacher's manager said there is still no clear time-frame for the Formula One star's recovery following a freak ski accident almost a year ago. Sabine Kehm yesterday said it was 'not possible' to say how long it would take for Scumacher to fully recover. She said he faced a 'difficult' and 'long' rehabilitation. Schumacher suffered severe head injuries while skiing with his family in the French Alps on December 29. The accident left him with brain damage and he was in a coma for six months. Michael Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, left, has said there is still no clear time-frame for the Formula One star's recovery following a freak ski accident almost a year ago . He has been recovering at his home in Gland, Switzerland, since June. The Local reports Ms Kehm as saying: 'Michael is making progress appropriate to the severity of his situation, but it will be a difficult and long process.' Ms Kehm said Schumacher's family are grateful for the constant flood of well wishes from fans of the seven-time world champion. She said: 'I can only say again that the family is very happy and touched by the sympathetic messages. 'I believe that positive energy does them good. We appreciate the condolences from around the world.' Last month, a French doctor treating Schumacher said that the 45-year-old was making progress, but will need years to fully recover. Schumacher is said to be paralysed and in a wheelchair. He cannot speak and has memory problems, according to former racing driver Philippe Streiff who has visited him. Schumacher with his wife Corinna Schumacher in Madonna di Campiglio in January 2005 . The Frenchman said: 'He is getting better but everything is relative.' Streiff, 59, was seen visiting Schumacher when the German was in intensive care in Grenoble Hospital, France. Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened. He was skiing with his 14-year-old son on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. Schumacher (left) is a seven-time world champion and is widely regarded as the greatest F1 driver of all time . It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry Prosecutor Patrick Quincy closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. Schumacher (second right) celebrates on the podium after his 2012 Formula One Grand Prix win in Valencia . Corinna Schumacher (left), with brain specialist Gerard Saillant, now cares for her husband in their home . Schumacher suffered brain damage after a freak ski accident in Meribel in the French Alps on December 29 . Schumacher was airlifted from the slopes minutes after the accident to Moutiers Hospital and was then transferred 80 miles west to CHU Grenoble, a larger hospital that specializes in head injuries. He arrived at 12.40pm and had been placed in an artificial coma. He was immediately operated on to relieve pressure on his brain. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. On April 4 Kehm revealed that he was showing 'moments of consciousness and awakening'. He had opened his eyes and had interaction, albeit minimal, with his environment. It was the first piece of positive news for months. Former racing driver Philippe Streiff commented on Schumacher's condition to a French radio station . Ms Kehm has said it was 'very hard' for his loved ones to comprehend how the racing car driver could have been so catastrophically injured in such a 'banal situation'. Schumacher's wife Corinna was a constant presence at his bedside. She and Schumacher met in 1991 on the F1 circuit after she was previously married to racing driver Heinz-Harald Frentzen. With an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half-a-billion pounds, Schumacher's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years. This will include physiotherapists, to massage his atrophying joints, doctors, nutritionists, nurses and neurological experts.","Manager said it was 'not possible' to say when F1 star would fully recover .

"The follicly challenged can now regain a full head of hair in a day thanks to the world's fastest hair transplant. Scott McCrum went baldly into the record books this week - after undergoing the procedure in just 16 hours. Scott followed in the footsteps of football superstar Wayne Rooney and Scots millionaire Duncan Bannatyne to have the Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) treatment. But unlike the celebrities, who underwent the process over a period of up to three days, Scott, 30, had the hair transplanted in one single operation. Scott McCrum undergoing a record breaking 16 hour hair transplant. He spent £12,500 for the op and had 2,684 grafts carried out. The surgery works by removing thousands of individual hair follicles from the back of the head, where hair is usually thicker. The surgeon then uses very small micro blades or fine needles to puncture sites for receiving the grafts. Placing them in a realistic pattern. The healthy hairs are then 're-planted' them into thinning patches. The patient is awake during the procedure, having received a local anaesthetic. After the operation the hair will start to gradually grow and the full results will be seen in eight to 12 months. He spent £12,500 for the op and had the FUE at The Glasgow Clinic for the FUE which involved 2,684 grafts. The . operation was a success and Scott, from Alloway, Ayrshire, who began to . lose his hair in his early 20s, is looking forward to combing the . results. Scott said: 'I’m a pretty confident guy but I found I was beginning to get self-conscious about it. 'It began to go at the front so I used to have expensive hairstyles to try to cover it but then it started going at the crown so I admitted defeat and shaved it off, but I prefer the way I look with hair. 'The operation wasn’t so bad. It hurt a little but I just watched a film and let them get on with it. 'It feels good now and I am looking forward to it growing in and seeing the results. 'I didn’t set out to be the first in Scotland but it feels great that I am, and hopefully this type of surgery will be available to the wider public in the future.' Scott began to research having the surgery earlier this year after becoming fed up of his receding hair line. Scott shows his receding hairline before the operation (left) and after thousands of hair grafts (right) His surgery started at 7.30am and Scott didn’t leave the operating table until 12.30am the following morning. The surgery works by removing individual follicles at random from the back of the head, where hair is usually thicker, and transplanting them into thinning patches. The operation is normally done over two to three days but Scott’s surgeons decided to complete the procedure in just one day, setting a new world record for speed. Scott’s hair will take at least three months to grow in but he said he is delighted with the results so far. Ouch! The doctors were able to reconstruct a natural hairline from grafts taken from the back of the head . The Glasgow Clinic was set up by businessman Fraser Christensen, who launched the business in Scotland after having the operation himself. The operation, which was only available in London and abroad until now, was carried out by Dr Emorane Lupanzula. He said: 'It’s been an extremely successful operation and we’re delighted to be the first to have carried this out in Scotland. 'Our qualified and experience team have really set the bench mark high with this surgery in terms of achievement and results across the hair transplant world. The operation is similar to one undertaken by Wayne Rooney - but over several days. 'Our aim is to change the perception of hair transplantation and educate those seeking a solution. 'In Scotland and across the whole of the UK we need to create an awareness of the FUE procedure. 'It’s a revolutionary technique that is so advanced it has taken hair transplantation to a completely new level. 'Opening a clinic in Glasgow gives UK patients an alternative to travelling abroad for FUE treatment and having to wait on long surgery lists.'","Scott had hair transplant surgery in just 16 hours .

"Although Christopher Columbus is widely credited as the 'discoverer' of America, a new loan form to the first sailor to find North America hints that other expeditions might have found the continent BEFORE 1492. The loan to John Cabot - discovered by historical detective work - makes reference to 'THE new land', hinting that sailors had discovered America BEFORE Cabot or Columbus. Christopher Columbus famously sailed to the Caribbean islands in 1492 - but with a royal patent from Henry VII of . England, John Cabot, a Venetian merchant, sailed from Bristol to North America in 1497. Christopher Columbus famously sailed to the Caribbean islands in 1492 - but with a royal patent from Henry VII of England, John Cabot, a Venetian merchant, sailed from Bristol to North America in 1497 . The ledger entry showing the payment to John Cabot . The new discovery shows that the first . European to set foot in North America since the Viking Leif Ericsson in . the 11th Century was financed by a loan of 50 nobles (£16, 13s, 4d) from . the Bardi banking house. Just like Columbus, the Engish voyages were financed by the great Italian merchant banks of the era, receiving the loan in 1496. John Cabot - also known as Zuan Caboto or Giovanni Chabotte due to his Venetian birth - made two voyages, one in the summer of 1496, one in 1497. On the second journey, he landed in Newfoundland. The entry itself is also curious in . that the reference to ‘the new land’ implies that the money was given so . that Cabot could find a land that was already known about. As . such, it may revive claims that Bristol merchants had discovered North . America at an earlier time. Dr Guidi-Bruscoli is more cautious on this . score, however. ‘While the entry implies that the Bardi believed in a . prior discovery, we can't assume this had occurred. 'It . is likely the Bardi were referring to the mythical 'Island of Brasil', . which Bristol mariners certainly claimed had been found by one of their . number in times past. Whether this story can be equated with an actual . discovery is much more uncertain, however.’ Dr . Jones agrees. ‘It would be wonderful to find that Bristol mariners had . first visited North America before the 1480s – if only because it would . cast new light on the originality of Columbus' venture of 1492. Right . now, however, we can't be sure about that. Although one never knows, . that could change.’ The entry itself is also curious in that the reference to ¿the new land¿ implies that the money was given so that Cabot could find a land that was already known about . A replica of the 15th Century ship, Nina, front, one of three ships that sailed in 1492 with Christopher Columbus . John Cabot - also known as Zuan Caboto or Giovanni Chabotte - made two voyages, one in the summer of 1496, one in 1497 . Although Christopher Columbus is widely credited as the 'discoverer' of America, an English expedition found North America first - with a little help from a Florentine merchant bank . A painting depicting John Cabot at the shores of Labrador - but did other sailors get there first? Dr Evan Jones, who leads the project in . Bristol, describes the new evidence as a ‘fantastic find’. He adds, ‘We . have long known that Italy's great merchant banks were key to the . success of the ventures launched by Portugal and Spain. But it always . seemed that the English ventures were an exception. Now it is clear that . they too were part of network of Italian-financed expeditions to . explore beyond the limits of the known world.’ The . payment of 50 nobles (£16 13s. 4d.) was made so that 'Giovanni . Chabotte' of Venice, as he is styled in the document, could undertake . expeditions 'to go and find the new land'. The . second of these was to result in the European discovery of North . America – Christopher Columbus not having ventured beyond the Caribbean . islands. Dr Guidi-Bruscoli, . who is based at the University of Florence and is also a Fellow at . Queen Mary in London, found the financial records after being contacted . by Jones and his co-researcher, Margaret Condon. For several years they have been attempting to relocate the research findings of a deceased historian, Dr Alwyn Ruddock. She had made some extraordinary finds about Cabot's voyages, but had all her notes destroyed following her death in 2005. One of Ruddock's claims was that Cabot was financed by an Italian bank. She had, however, refused to reveal the source of her information. Following an invitation to visit the deceased historian's house in 2010, Jones and Condon discovered the source – in the form of a sticky label on an old shoe cupboard: 'The Bardi firm of London'. They then contacted Dr Guidi-Bruscoli in Florence, who was able to locate the archive, the financial ledger and the entry concerned. Finding out about the funding of Cabot's voyages is exciting because, while it has long been known that the explorer received political support from the King, the identity and motivations of those who paid for the expeditions has never been known.","Loan of £16 to John Cabot - also known as Giovanni Chabotte - who found North America in 1497 .

"This shocking video has emerged of a Ukrainian motorist dodging artillery blasts by seconds after at least 30 people were killed in a rebel shelling attack. Filmed on dashcam footage and dated January 24, the clip was posted online yesterday and claimed to have been recorded in the southeastern city of Mariupol. And it shows the reality of everyday life in the crisis-hit country. This shocking clip of a motorist narrowly avoiding a blast emerged a day after dozens were killed in Ukraine . Filmed on dashcam footage and dated January 24, the clip purporting to be Mariupol was posted online yesterday . It starts as the car is driving through what appears to be a residential area. Suddenly, terrifying screams are heard and a large blast is seen nearby. Another shell hits the street, which the driver avoids by seconds. But a vehicle in front is hit and disappears into a cloud of smoke. The driver comes to a stop and fragments of debris are seen approaching the windscreen - before the car quickly reverses away. Yesterday, it was reported that at least 30 people were dead - including a 15-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy - and 83 injured after pro-Russian rebels shelled Mariupol a day after the separatists rejected a peace deal signed last year. It shows the reality of everyday life in the crisis-hit country, as a driver avoids a shells by mere seconds . Terrifying screams are heard before a blast is seen nearby before another shell hits the street, directly in front of the car . Indiscriminate rocket fire from long range GRAD Missiles struck a market, two schools, homes and shops according to the regional police force. The rocket fire had come from rebel-held territory, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said, as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to stop supplying arms to the separatists. The Ukrainian president called the blitz a terrorist attack and NATO and the U.S. demanded that Russia stop supporting the rebels. President Petro Poroshenko cut short his visit to Saudi Arabia to call an emergency meeting of his military officials, to coordinate the government's response. Ukrainian officials rushed to defend the strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, beefing up military positions with more equipment and sending in more forces. The separatists' top leader declared that an offensive against Mariupol had begun — then later toned down his threats as the scale of the civilian casualties became clear. Mariupol mayor Yuriy Khotlubei said: 'The area that came under attack was massive. 'The shelling was carried out by militants. This is very clearly Russian aggression that has caused terrible losses for the residents of the eastern part of our city.'

Despite international calls for a ceasefire, the separatists' leader Alexander Zakharchenko has vowed to push on with a new offensive and expel Ukrainian troops from the eastern region entirely. It is thought today's attack was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday. And last weekend, battles intensified over Donetsk airport, which has been reduced to rubble after months of fighting.

"The Walking Dead's midseason finale went out with a bang on Sunday as Beth Greene was shot dead by police officer Dawn Lerner after she stabbed her with a pair of hidden scissors. Greene, played by Emily Kinney, was suddenly killed inside Grady Memorial as a tense prisoner exchange went wrong. And her murder was soon followed by the death of Lerner, played by Christine Woods, who was shot dead in retaliation by Daryl. Scroll down for video . Prisoner exchange: Beth stood her ground on Sunday's midseason finale of The Walking Dead . The episode titled Coda marked the midpoint of the 16-episode fifth season with the final eight episodes airing in 2015. AMC irked some of its West Coast viewers when it updated its Facebook and Twitter feeds immediately after the show aired on the East Coast with a photo of Daryl carrying Beth looking as anguished as King Lear holding lifeless Ophelia. The episode started with Bob Lamson trying to escape on foot and being chased down by Rick in a patrol car. Tense negotiation: Dawn demanded Noah back in exchange for Beth . Spoiler alert: AMC irked some of its West Coast viewers when it posted this image of Daryl carrying a lifeless Beth before the midseason finale aired in their time zone . When Bob would not stop fleeing Rick ran him down with his car and begged Rick to let him come back. 'Shut up,' said Rick after he shot him dead and drove off in the car. Back at the school, Father Gabriel found the remains of Bob Stookey's leg and had to escape from zombies after they broke out of the school. Tough negotiator: Rick Grimes had his gun out while dealing with the prisoner exchange . He came back: Noah agreed to the trade in order to reunite Beth with Rick and his crew . 'Please let me in!' he shouted as he approached the fortified church where Carl, Michonne and baby Judith were hiding out. Using an axe Michonne broke down the barricade to let Gabriel in and the group was forced to flee through the church as they trapped the zombies inside. While planning their next move from the church, Carl, Michonne and Gabriel joined up with Abraham, Glenn and their group. Glenn revealed that Eugene had lied about knowing how to cure the outbreak and Michonne told Maggie that her sister Beth was still alive. Coming together: Abraham and his group teamed up with the church group and they all went to Atlanta . At the hospital Beth and Dawn continued to talk until Officer O'Donnell confronted Dawn about her relationship with Beth and her leadership and they started fighting.

Rick refused and left the hospital as Abraham's group arrived just in time to see Daryl carrying out Beth's body in his arms. Swift response: Daryl immediately shot Dawn in the head after she killed Beth . Maggie broke down and collapsed to the floor as she saw her sister's lifeless body. In the final scene after the credits, Morgan emerged from the woods to find where Gabriel had been standing out in front of the school. He eventually entered the church and sat down at the alter ready for prayer before laughing at the scene around him with zombie corpses lying about. Tragic ending: Daryl carried dead Beth out of the Atlanta hospital . Overcome with emotion: Maggie collapsed at the site of her sister's lifeless body .

"Police are still searching for the motive of Adam Lanza's killing spree, but one working theory is that he was angry that his mother was planning to commit him to a psychiatric facility because he was becoming too difficult for her to handle alone. Given his decision to kill his mother Nancy while she lay sleeping in her bed at their Connecticut home and then drive to his former elementary school to purposefully kill innocent children, there had to be a strong connection in his mind between his anger and the school. Nancy, 52, was thought to volunteer at Sandy Hook Elementary School, and so the theory extends to the fact that Adam felt he loved those children more than she loved him, since she was planning to send him away. Time was running out: Nancy Lanza was searching . for other places to have her son Adam educated and traveled all over the . world to find something suitable . Fox News quotes a neighborhood figure, whose father works as the pastor of an area church, as saying that the 20-year-old shooter found out that his mother was in the legal process of having him committed and was upset. That news, coupled with his jealousy of the time she allegedly spent with a group of kindergarteners at Sandy Hook, is thought to have served as the basis of the killing. A number of factors are still unconfirmed in the theory, and it appears that they may remain as such for some time. Records of conservatorship filings, which Nancy Lanza would have needed to make in order to commit her son since he is over 18-years-old, are sealed by the courts so if any such filings were made they will not be released publicly. 'Adam Lanza believed she cared more for the children than she did for him, and the reason he probably thought this (was the fact that) she was petitioning for conservatorship and wanted to have him committed,' Joshua Flashman told Fox News. House of horrors: It is thought that Nancy was planning a move from their house in Newtown, pictured, for Washington state to find a place for Adam to go to college as she was tired of home schooling the troubled 20-year-old . Struggling: Various family friends have said that she warned that you could never turn your back on Adam while he was in your care, explaining why it may have been taking a toll on her prompting for her to look for options . One of the biggest questions remaining ever since the shooting was reported on Friday was Nancy's connection to the school which was clearly singled out as a target by Adam. The majority of his shooting was limited to the reception, where he forced his way into the building and killed those standing in his way, and then to a single first grade classroom. Those children are thought to be the ones that Nancy grew close with during the last academic year, when they were in kindergarten. Initial reports immediately after the shooting claimed that Nancy was a full time or even substitute teacher at the elementary school, though as the chaos of the day slowed, school officials said that she was not on any records of having worked there in any formal capacity. Targeted: All but one of the students in this first grade class were killed by gunman Adam Lanza, prompting the theory that he chose them because his mother worked with that group as a volunteer . Unanswered questions: It is still unclear what Nancy Lanza's connection was to Sandy Hook Elementary School, though it is confirmed that Adam attended it as a child . That option leaves the possibility open that she volunteered her time with the young children, though school board member Cody McCubbin could not confirm that role when asked by MailOnline. That was echoed by Lillian Bittman, a former school board member who told the Wall Street Journal: ‘No one has heard of her. Teachers don’t know her.’ Though the court records will never back up the claim that Nancy was trying to have her son committed, her actions do lend credence to the idea because she had spent much time over the course of this year traveling to different schools to find a suitable place to send Adam. Former babysitters of Adam's said that she warned that she could never turn her back on the young boy, meaning that when she went to visit prospective schools, Adam was either with her or very aware of the fact that she had gone shopping for his next home. In a Facebook conversation between Nancy and her former sister-in-law Marsha, Nancy revealed that she had wanted to downsize from her $1.4million home in Newtown. 'I am still in the same place but getting to the point where I may want a smaller house. I travel a lot, spend time with friends, work with a couple of charities,' she wrote in one of the messages. As a teenager, Adam Lanza would come in for a haircut about every six weeks without speaking or looking at anyone and always accompanied by his mother, said stylists at a Newtown salon. He stopped coming in a few years ago, and the employees at the salon thought he had moved away, said stylist Bob Skuba. Adam in the chair: Hairstylist Diane Harty said Adam was difficult to deal with . The comments from him and his colleagues were among the first describing how the Lanzas interacted with each other. Investigators have found no letters or diaries that could explain the attack, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history. Cutting Adam Lanza's hair 'was a very long half an hour. It was a very uncomfortable situation,' stylist Diane Harty said. She said that she never heard his voice and that Nancy Lanza also hardly spoke. Another stylist, Jessica Phillips, echoed their descriptions of the Lanzas and added that Nancy Lanza would give her son directions about what to do and where to go. Adam would move only 'when his mother told him to,' Skuba said. 'I would say, ""Adam, come on."" He wouldn't move,' Skuba said. 'And his mother would have to say, ""Adam, come on, he's ready."" It was like I was invisible.' He said Adam also wouldn't move from his chair after his hair was cut until his mother told him to.If a stylist would ask Adam a question, Skuba said, his mother would answer. 'He would just be looking down at the tiles ... the whole time,' Skuba said.Former classmates have previously described Adam Lanza as intelligent but remote, and former high school adviser described him as anxious and shy. Several people who knew his mother have described her as a devoted parent.Divorce paperwork released this week showed that Nancy Lanza had the authority to make all decisions regarding Adam's upbringing. The divorce was finalized in September 2009, when Adam Lanza was 17.                                                                                               ---box by The Associated Press .","Newtown resident raises possibility that Adam Lanza, 20, was angry and may have snapped over mother's possible plans to commit him .

"Final straw: New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert saw red when a mobile phone went off during a New York Philharmonic performance . For many it is just one of the daily afflictions of the digital age. But when a mobile phone went off during a New York Philharmonic performance the conductor saw red, stopping the orchestra in its tracks. Orchestra music director Alan Gilbert was so appalled by the continuing distraction during one of the most poignant parts of the performance that he brought the musicians to a standstill. The phone’s 'marimba' ring-tone went off from a front row seat of New York's Avery Fisher Hall during Tuesday night's performance, according to eyewitnesses. The untimely interruption happened . during the final and most moving bars of Mahler's Ninth symphony, just . 13 bars before the beginning of the last page of the score, blogger . Michael Jo reported. Jo . wrote on his blog thousandfold echo: ‘As Alan Gilbert turned to the . first violins and the sound grew ever more hushed and veiled, the . unmistakable chimes of the iPhone Marimba ringtone resounded loud and . clear’. In full flow: Mr Gilbert conducting the New York Philharmonic. The phone went off in the front row during the final and most moving bars of Mahler's Ninth symphony . In an almost unprecedented measure, an obviously annoyed Mr Gilbert cut the orchestra. The conductor then turned around on the podium to face the offender, the superconductor blog reported. During a pause of several minutes the . music director asked 'Are you finished?' When the culprit didn’t reply . he said: ‘Fine, we'll wait.' Some furious members of the audience called out for punishment: 'Thousand dollar fine, Get out!' and 'Kick him out! we all heard' When the ringing eventually stopped Mr Gilbert asked the man if he had turned off the phone. The man indicated that it wouldn't go off again. Addressing the audience the conductor . said: 'I apologize. Usually, when there's a disturbance like this, it . is best to ignore it, because addressing it is sometimes worse than the . disturbance itself. But this was so egregious that I could not allow . it.' 'We'll start again.'

"Mothers are paying up to four times the recommended price for formula milk after two popular brands sold out in shops last month. Cow & Gate Comfort and Aptamil Comfort are marketed for babies who show signs of colic or constipation. Some infants have become hungry and distressed since the shortage began, leading parents to take desperate measures. Scroll down for video . In demand: Cow & Gate and Aptamil are marketed for babies who show signs of colic or constipation - which means they are seen as rare by desperate parents . Costly: Parents have been willing to pay over the odds to get hold of some of the formula milk on eBay. These three 900g tubs of Aptamil Comfort were going for £82, but still had 12 hours and 30 minutes left . Bidding war: This tub of Cow & Gate Comfort formula milk was going for £63, but bidders still had 35 minutes to increase their offers . On eBay, one lot of three of the 900g tubs – officially priced at £10.99 each – had yesterday attracted 23 bids and was being sold for £100 plus £8 postage. Babies raised on a particular formula are often extremely reluctant to switch to a new product or brand because they reject the taste and consistency. As a result, feeding – which can often already be extremely stressful for parents – may become even more difficult. One mother, Catherine Russell, from Cheshire, said that she had resorted to feeding her 11-month-old daughter Hattie with a replacement formula when she had fallen asleep. The 31-year-old mother of three said: ‘This is an absolute nightmare. Parents had no warning that there was a problem.’ Both Aptamil and Cow & Gate are owned by French firm Danone, who say that the shortage is due to problems in the supply of a crucial ingredient, maize starch, which is used to thicken the milk. Mrs Russell said: ‘My daughter has a slight lactose intolerance, which means I can’t put her on other types of formula. I tried alternative products and brands, but she just refuses to drink milk now. Must have: Babies become used to a certain milk, which has seen mothers go to extreme lengths to get the same formula . ‘I have had to take to feeding her while she is asleep, because that is the only way she will take it. ‘I feel very let down by the company. You can’t bring out these products only for them to suddenly disappear off the shelves, especially when you are dealing with the health of new born babies.’ The shortage has sparked an outcry on parenting websites. On the Netmums website, one mother said that she had called more than 100 outlets in her search for the products. Another wrote: ‘Does anyone know where I can get some dodgy Aptamil Comfort on the black market, I’ll pay good money!!!’ It had been feared that the products would not return on to the shelves until mid-March, but Danone said that it has responded to parents’ demands to bring forward the date to next week. A spokesman said: ‘We very much regret that we are currently experiencing a shortage of these two milks which means parents are experiencing low and patchy availability. ‘We would like to apologise to parents who are using these milks as we are very aware of difficulties they are experiencing. Unfortunately we have experienced a production delay due to the shortage of one key ingredient. ‘Our careline operates 24/7 and as a priority we are helping parents to locate retailers who have these milks in stock. We recommend parents contact their health care professional if they need further advice.’ Danone spokesperson Helen Messenger said the company had been 'let down' by its maize starch supplier. She said: 'We only use pre-approved suppliers, we don't buy our ingredients from the open market because babies have to have the best quality standards. 'Unfortunately on this occasion we were let down by our supplier, however, we have pulled all the stops out and we have made more of that formula and it will be coming back on to shelves next week.' Maize starch, also known as corn starch or cornflour, is used as a thickening agent in liquid-based foods including soups, gravies and sauces. Better times: A healthy-looking crop in an American corn maize field. Last year the industry was hit by the worst drought in decades, leading to a shortage of the crop . But US farmers were last year hit by the worst drought to affect the industry in decades, which has led to shortages of corn. Earlier this month it was reported two dozen ethanol plants had been forced to halt production due to the shortage of the crop. Going into 2012, corn producers had high hopes and record harvests had been predicted, but the weather dried up before planting and the drought meant that even though more acres were planted compared to the previous year, 13 per cent less corn was harvested. Just this week however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it expected a rebound in production and predicted record corn and soybean harvests for 2013, in its official forecast for the year. Parents across the country have been taking to social networking sites throughout the week, desperate to get hold of the popular brands of formula milk, since the shortages came to light. Earlier this week, Andy L was searching for the Aptamil formula when he wrote on Netmums: 'We have been through Yellow Pages and called over 100 places Winsford, Northwich, Crewe, Stafford, Wolverhampton, Cannock, Winchester and Aberdeen. 'Out of those places we found 4 with stock giving us enough milk for 5 weeks, they are now out of stock.' Meanwhile, Rachel E wrote: 'I am in exactly the same position as everyone else. We have had Aptamil Comfort for the last 20 weeks which my little girl is really happy on. Have been forced to try Cow and Gate Comfort but she's not happy as her tummy is making funny noises again, she's windy and doesn't drink her whole bottle again!!! 'Now I can't get either of them anywhere in my local area, we have called every possible store/supermarket/independent chemist absolutely everywhere and no one has any comfort milk. 'It's a nightmare and I can't believe that two huge companies like Aptamil and Cow and Gate have allowed this to happen.' Sam W also took to Netmums yesterday to write: 'GRRR I have been trying to get hold of Cow and Gate Comfort for the last week and we are now down to the last few bottles worth of formula....I cant believe they didn't announce anything!!!' Parents this morning were continuing to panic after being unable to buy any of the formula milk. One Twitter user called Jules wrote: 'I've just checked online and apparently Cow and Gate Comfort milk is unavailable everywhere!!!! What am I supposed to do now?' Meanwhile, Dave James yesterday tweeted: 'URGENT! Can anyone get hold of any Cow and Gate Comfort formula milk? There's a shortage and we know a baby who can't feed on anything else.'","One lot of three 900g tubs being sold for £100 on eBay yesterday .

"Didier Deschamps believes a French training session may have been spied on by a drone that flew over their base in Ribeirao Preto earlier this week. The France coach revealed at a media conference on Saturday that FIFA are investigating the incident, which left players bemused as they trained at Botafogo's Santa Cruz stadium. VIDEO Scroll down for France: Sakho rolls around, Giroud's glum and fan invades pitch . Suspicion: France briefly halted a session to point at a camera-armed, unmanned aircraft . The squad are thought to have briefly halted a session to point at what Deschamps clearly fears was a camera-armed, unmanned aircraft. Deschamps lodged a complaint with FIFA ahead of Sunday's Group E clash against Honduras, with the coach seemingly concerned about the possibility that his tactics had been discovered. 'Apparently, drones are used more and more,' he said. 'It's not up to me, FIFA handle this and have been carrying out an inquiry. We don't want any intrusion into our privacy but it's very hard to fight this these days.' A Honduran reporter defended the integrity of his national team. 'It wasn't us!' he declared. 'No?' replied Deschamps with more than a little suspicion. 'I didn't do anything special anyway that day.' Training day: France prepare for their World Cup opener against Honduras . Even by FIFA's standards that will be a tricky inquiry. One imagines, also, that communications chiefs at the world governing body might have a quiet word with Deschamps, who refused to use headphones provided to listen to questions posed to him in any language other than French. This proved problematic when he was questioned in English about problems with player cliques at previous tournaments, such as the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and Euro 2012. In fairness to the 1998 World Cup-winning captain, he has a decent command of English. But he claimed: 'I haven't understood everything there, I didn't use my earphones. I heard South Africa, and you shouldn't mention South Africa. We are now four years on. This is a different environment. 'Clique is a rather technical word for me. But we have to live life in common. What is important is that we're united with a common objective.'","France halted a session to point at a camera-armed, unmanned aircraft .

Among the weapons handed in were scores of rifles, shotguns and pistols, sawed-off shotguns, a century-old antique weapon, a rifle used for hunting elephants and five fully automatic weapons. Some 90 per cent were in working condition. Many were illegal weapons under state laws; some were so-called community guns stashed around the neighborhood. All those who turned in guns were promised anonymity and no questions asked. 'A lot of people said they don't want . the guns around the house now,' said state Attorney General Jeffrey .

Gun owners received $25 for BB guns, $50 inoperable firearms, $150 for revolvers, semi automatics, shotguns and rifles and $250 for assault weapons. Nearly all of the weapons are to be destroyed. 'The more we unarm ourselves then maybe we can stop some of the violence . that's going on. If we don't have the firearm then we can't use the . firearm,' said James Green, who turned over his firearm. The shooting at a Newtown elementary school on Friday left 26 people dead, including 20 children, ages 6 and 7. The gunman, Adam Lanza, used a Bushmaster AR-15 assault rifle in the killings, and used a handgun to kill himself as police officers closed in. Twice as many firearms were turned in Saturday, the day after, than on Friday, Chiesa noted. 'These guns are coming from people's homes and many times end up as . items of burglary, end up on our streets and in the wrong hands. We . would much rather have custody of these guns now as opposed to at the . scene of a crime after a shooting,' said Chief Scott Thomas, Camden . Police.

"A protester was bundled out of the House of Commons today after throwing a bag full of marbles at MPs from the public gallery. The man stood up, shouted and hurled the objects while David Cameron was responding to questions during Prime Minister's Questions. The marbles hit a £600,000 glass screen which was installed in 2004 to protect MPs from an anthrax attack. Scroll down for video . MPs were shocked this afternoon after seeing a protester bundled out of the public gallery after throwing marbles against a glass window . David Cameron was on his feet when the man launched his attack. The incident is likely to be investigated by the leader of the Commons William Hague (left) Today's incident occurred as Mr Cameron was on his feet answering questions from MPs. Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry tweeted: 'There's a fracas in public gallery #pmqs. Tried to lip read man as he's dragged out. Believe he's shouting 'Answer the b***** questions'.' Tory MP Mark Pritchard added: 'Man taken hurriedly out of Commons public gallery... Public and Members appear all ok.' After the incident the  man responsible said : 'That was not a protest. Last week I heard them say it was us and them, the elite and us.' Jim Murphy, Labour's Shadow International Development Secretary, said there should be a 'thorough inquiry' into how it was allowed to happen. A House of Commons spokesman said there was 'a disturbance in the public gallery during Prime Minister's Questions today'. The spokesman said: 'A man was escorted from the gallery by doorkeepers and is currently in Metropolitan Police custody. 'The incident did not disrupt the business of the House and there were no injuries sustained.' The Metropolitan Police said later that a man had been arrested on suspicion of being equipped to cause criminal damage and of committing an offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act. In 2004 Tony Blair was struck on the back by a condom filled with purple flour thrown by a Fathers for Justice protester . In 2004, condoms full of purple flour were thrown at Tony Blair as he faced MPs in the House of Commons. Mr Blair was speaking during Prime Minister's Questions when one of the projectiles hit his back, prompting an evacuation by MPs. Campaign group Fathers 4 Justice claimed responsibility. Protester Guy Harrison managed to get into the Commons chamber after getting tickets at a charity auction. The millionaire businessman had no previous history of militancy or direct action - but claimed his experiences with the family law courts drove him to protest. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'At approximately 12:30hrs on Wednesday, 22 October, police responded to a disturbance in the public gallery of the House of Commons. 'A man was arrested on suspicion of going equipped to cause criminal damage and Section 5 of the Public Order Act. 'Established security procedures worked effectively and parliamentary business continued unaffected. The man is currently in custody at a central London police station.' But he said nothing should be done which 'jeopardises the public's ability, to come along, to be in the public gallery but importantly meet their members of Parliament in central lobby'. 'I had constituents with me today... touring around in a relatively free way in the Palace of Westminster is a big part and a good part of our democracy.' One witness, James Smith, 17, said that the gallery fell 'dead silent' after a man in a green coat threw a large bag of marbles over the protective screen. He told the Telegraph: 'It was over the NHS thing, Cameron said something and this man was obviously not very happy, so he got up and threw the marbles at the window and proceeded to swear and use foul language - very foul language. 'It was dead silent, everyone was in shock - a bit shocked that this man had got up and thrown some marbles. It was immediately obvious it was marbles, a big bag of them and they went everywhere. 'The guys grabbed him and he wouldn't go. He was saying 'I'm an English gentleman, I have the right to say my bit' and then he got carted off. We were just 'wow' - and then carried on watching.' He added: 'I don't know how he got in because he had a big green coat on so he has obviously hidden it in there. How has he got in with a bag of marbles? I had a full body search, the guy in front of me did, the guy behind me did.' Members of the public were detained in the public gallery while the man was detained by police officers. The glass screen was installed in 2004 after the then-Leader of the Commons Peter Hain warned there was a threat to throw anthrax at MPs from the gallery. Six weeks later the Commons was suspended for 70 minutes after a protester threw an object at Tony Blair from a side gallery, showering the backs of the then Prime Minister with purple powder. The Fathers4Justice group subsequently claimed responsibility.","Man shouted and hurled objects while David Cameron was on his feet .

"The shockingly . disfigured man, whose full-body tumours were lovingly kissed by the . Pope, has been revealed as a 53-year-old Italian suffering from a rare . genetic disease. Vinicio Riva’s entire body has been ravaged by the growths, a symptom of neorofibramatosis, which is not contagious. He is pictured here. Earlier . this month his picture shot round the world, when he was emotionally . embraced by Pope Francis, at one of the pontiff’s weekly audiences in . Rome. Act of kindness: Pope Francis (left) comforted Vinicio Riva, a 52-year-old Italian who had travelled to Rome for a audience in Saint Peter's Square in November . The severely disabled . man, who is shunned in the street, and has induced horror even in his . doctors, has for the first time described the encounter, saying that . being caressed by Francis was like ‘being in Paradise’. He told Italian news magazine Panorama he was left speechless when Pope did not hesitate to touch him. He . said: ‘His hands were so soft. And his smile was so clear and open. But . the thing that struck me most is that there has not been thinking about . whether or not to hug me. I'm not contagious, but he did not know. But . he just did it: he caressed me all over my face, and as he did I felt . only love. He recollected . the meeting of a fortnight ago: 'First I kissed his hand while he, with . the other hand, caressed my head and wounds. Then he drew me to him in a . strong embrace, kissing my face. 'My . head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me. It lasted . just over a minute, but to me it seemed like an eternity.' Mr . Riva was accompanied to the Vatican's St Peter's square by his aunt, . Caterina and his younger sister Morena, who also suffers from a lesser . form of the disease. The . meeting with Francis marked a new beginning for him he said: ‘Later I . turned to my aunt and told her: ""Here I leave my pain""'. Touching moment: The pontiff kissed Mr Riva, who suffers from a rare disease called neurofibromatosis, which is genetic and not contagious . Mr Riva first . needed medical attention at the age of two for the genetic condition, . and has since endured numerous operations on his heart, throat and eyes. But it was the growths, that first appeared at the age of 15, that destroyed his appearance. Now . his entire face and head are covered in growths, Panorama reported. Only his left cheek, warped as if burnt in a fire is free of the painful . growths. His feet are deformed and devastated by the sores, which makes . walking difficult. He lives with his sister in the . council house they share in a suburb of Vicenza, working part-time as . handyman in a retirement home. Their . mother was afflicted by the same condition and eventually died of it. Mr Riva himself was only expected to live until the age of 30. The . severely sick man has been reviled in the street as an ‘Elephant Man’, . with mothers crossing the street to avoid him, but those in his . community have now come to love him. He said: 'Those who I have known for a long time are kind; the others are horrible.’ He . is taken to Lourdes, a popular place of pilgrimage in France, every . year by Catholic group Unitalsi, but it was the first time they had . thought to take him to St Peter’s. Neurofibromatosis has long been associated with the 'Elephant Man,' the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. But evidence now suggests he was suffering from another rare syndrome . The man who met Pope Francis is believed to be suffering from a condition called neurofibromatosis – the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although many people who have the condition inherit it from one of . their parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a . gene mutation before they are born. There are two types of neurofibromatosis and this man is suffering from type one, Dr Anand Saggar, a London-based genetics expert, told MailOnline. Despite their alarming appearance, the growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of cells - are not cancerous or contagious. The condition has long been associated with the ‘Elephant Man,’ the name given to Joseph Carey Merrick, who was severely disfigured. However, in 1986, a new theory emerged that Mr Merrick may actually have had Proteus syndrome, a condition which involves symptoms . such as abnormal growth of the bones, skin and head. The confusion was again compounded in 2001 when it was proposed that he had suffered from a combination of neurofibromatosis type one (NF1) and Proteus syndrome. However, DNA tests on his hair and bones have proven inconclusive. Other symptoms of neurofibromatosis type one include flat, light brown spots on the skin. These harmless marks, also called cafe au lait spots, are common in many people. People who have more than six spots that are bigger than half a centimetre wide should get investigated for NF1. NF1 is a condition someone is born with, although some symptoms develop gradually over many years. The severity of the condition can vary considerably from person to person. People with NH1 are more likely to suffer from learning difficulties and behavioural problems, a type of cancer known as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours, which affect around 10 per cent of people with NF1 over their lifetime, vision problems, high blood pressure and a curved spine.","Vinicio Riva has been ravaged by neorofibramatosis .

"The leader of a violent Memphis-based drug organization that teamed with Mexico's Beltran Leyva cartel to distribute drugs throughout the South was sentenced to nine life sentences in federal prison Thursday. Craig Petties was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Samuel Mays, who said Petties' crimes were the most serious he had ever seen. Petties secretly pleaded guilty in December 2009 to racketeering, money laundering, drug trafficking and ordering the slayings of four men he perceived as snitches or threats to the organization. His plea was not disclosed until February 2011. Petties built a multistate drug ring . that operated from 1995 to 2008. Cocaine and marijuana were shipped from . Mexico to Memphis in semi -trucks, then distributed for sale in . Tennessee, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia and North Carolina. Scroll down for video . In this undated photograph, admitted drug kingpin Craig Petties, then a multi-millionaire, shows off just some of his diamond jewelry paid for through his cocaine trafficking empire . Petties fled to Mexico after his 2002 indictment. He was placed on the U.S. Marshals Service 15 Most-Wanted List and his case was featured on the 'America's Most Wanted' television program before his capture in January 2008. Two of Petties' henchmen, cousins Clinton Lewis and Martin Lewis, were convicted in March 2012 of being enforcers for the organization. They were also sentenced to life in prison. About 70 witnesses testified and 300 pieces of evidence were admitted during their trial, one of the largest federal drug trials ever held in Tennessee. The Lewises are the only two members of the gang to go to trial. About 30 others gang members have pleaded guilty, with some receiving sentences of more than 30 years in prison. During the sentencing hearing, Mays called Petties' crimes reprehensible. In all, Petties received nine life sentences, plus more than 60 years in prison. He is not eligible for parole, though he can appeal the sentences. Latrell Small, 32, (left)  was shot and killed in 2004. Police say Small's killing was in retaliation for the non-fatal shooting of a member of Petties' organization. Mario McNeil, 34, (right) was killed in 2007. Police say Petties saw McNeil as a threat . 'Mr. Petties has committed more serious crimes than anyone I've sentenced,' Mays said. Petties made a brief statement during the sentencing hearing, apologizing to the families of the victims. 'I apologize for the decisions I made in life,' Petties said. The gang began as a group of teens selling drugs in the Riverside neighborhood, according to testimony. As they grew older, they sold more cocaine and marijuana and established stash houses throughout the area. They eventually built contacts with the Beltran Leyva drug organization in Mexico, which provided the cocaine that was shipped to Memphis in semitrailers. Gang members met the trucks at area hotels and picked up the cocaine before breaking it up for distribution. Gang members bought jewelry, multiple homes and vehicles with laundered drug profits, prosecutors said. They stole drugs from each other, organized kidnapping plots, and killed men suspected of being snitches. Mario Stewart, 28, (left) was shot and killed in his garage in 2005 while his young children were in the house. Authorities say Stewart died because he was a federal informant. Marcus Turner, 30, (right) was killed in 2006. Craig Petties allegedly ordered Turner kidnapped because he believed Turner knew where to find a man who had stolen cocaine from the organization. Turner's nude body was found in a ditch . During the Lewises' trial, prosecutor David Pritchard said in his closing arguments that Petties worked directly for Edgar Valdez Villarreal, a Texas-born man known as 'La Barbie.' Valdez is suspected of using extreme violence as he tried to seize control of the Beltran Leyva cartel following the death of gang leader Arturo Beltran Leyva. He was arrested in 2010. After fleeing to Mexico, Petties gave orders to gang members via cellphone. He pleaded guilty to ordering the killings of Mario McNeal, Latrell Small, Mario Stewart and Marcus Turner. Small was slain in August 2004; Stewart in March 2005. Turner was kidnapped and killed in September 2006 and McNeal was slain in March 2007. Turner's mother, Lucy Turner, attended the sentencing hearing. Her son was kidnapped and tortured after some of the organization's drugs went missing. His nude body was found in a ditch in north Mississippi. Lucy Turner told Mays during the hearing that her granddaughter still talks about her father. She said the sentencing helped bring closure to her family. 'He has damaged so many lives,' Turner said, standing just a few feet away from Petties. U.S. Attorney Edward Stanton III said after the hearing that Petties' gang members are believed to have killed more people than the four acknowledged by their leader. In December 2010, Petties pleaded guilty to a separate charge of possessing a weapon while in federal prison in Memphis.","Craig Petties was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Samuel Mays, who said Petties' crimes were the most serious he had ever seen .

"A rare Roman fort and marching camp have been discovered by archaeologists - thanks to the summer heatwave. The outlines of the major Roman fort complex were revealed under parched grassland near Brecon, Mid Wales. Aerial archaeologist Dr Toby Driver said he couldn't believe his eyes when he spotted the huge hidden ancient fort from the air. Revealed: A hidden Roman fort and marching camp have been discovered by archaeologists -thanks to the summer heatwave . Visible: The outlines of the major Roman fort complex were revealed under parched grassland near Brecon, Mid Wales . The summer drought has also revealed scores of Iron Age farms and forts across South Wales which have usually been hidden beneath lush crop fields. Dr Driver, from the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales said the spell of hot weather discoveries include some of the most significance finds for a decade. He said: 'When crop marks show in drought conditions our aerial survey only has a few weeks to record the sites before rain or harvest removes them. 'The Roman fort complex discovery near Brecon is a rare discovery for Wales.' He said it was made following a tip from Dr Jeffrey Davies, who he has been working with on Roman villa excavations near Aberystwyth. Outline: Pictured is a previously unrecorded Roman fort complex in Mid Wales . Dr Driver said: 'Jeffrey Davies noticed an anomaly in Roman coin finds near Brecon, reported under the Portable Antiquities Scheme. 'He had a hunch that the coins, of the Emperor Claudius, could indicate a lost early Roman fort, and passed a grid reference to me the day before a flight into central Wales. 'I couldn't believe my eyes when the pilot and I approached the location and saw fading crop marks of a major Roman fort complex, lost beneath fields and a road for nearly 2,000 years.' Between Caerwent and Chepstow, the aerial survey also pinpointed only the second Roman overnight marching camp in Monmouthshire- which Dr Driver said appears to show a small expeditionary force on manoeuvres in the years around 50 AD. Scores of Iron Age farms and forts were also found during the summer heatwave in Pembrokeshire and the Vale of Glamorgan. Parched: The hot weather have proved useful in this historical instance . West of Caerwent, in South Wales, a 'remarkable' Iron Age settlement was revealed beneath the parched ground. In Pembrokeshire, one of the largest and most complex Iron Age defended farms in Pembrokeshire was found at Conkland Hill, Wiston.Dr Driver added: 'Given the decades of aerial survey in the region around Caerwent, these surprise discoveries show the continuing need for aerial archaeology in Wales.'The crop of summer discoveries follow similarly exciting Bronze Age ones made during last winter's snow.The Royal Commission will now begin cataloguing and mapping the discoveries to make the information more widely available online.","Described as some of the most 'significant finds of the decade'

Despite entering into talks to send athletes to compete in this year's Asian Games in South Korea, a move which is seen as a sign of attempted reconciliation, the North has recently test-fired an unusually large number of missiles, artillery and rockets. South Korean officials have confirmed about 90 such firings by North Korea since February 21. Ten of those have been ballistic-missile launches, according to Seoul's Defence Ministry. Pyongyang's state media said today that Kim had inspected tactical rocket firing drills, in a likely reference to yesterday's reported ballistic launches. Kim was quoted as saying that North Korea should be prepared for 'both words and actions'. One of Kim's commanders points out details of the launch drill. The North has recently test-fired an unusually large number of missiles, artillery and rockets, despite entering into conciliatory talks over the Asian Games . Pyongyang's state media said today that Kim had inspected yesterday's tactical rocket firing drills, and it quoted him as saying that his country needs to be prepared for 'both words and actions' Despite the bellicose rhetoric, outside analysts say the North wants to improve ties with South Korea and the U.S. to help lure foreign investment and aid to revive its stagnant economy. It has asked that the South accept a set of proposals that it said would reduce bilateral tensions, including the cancellation of regular military drills between Seoul and Washington, which are seen as rehearsals for an invasion. South Korea has rejected the North's proposals, saying it must first demonstrate that it is serious about nuclear disarmament if it truly wants peace. But the offer to send athletes - and cheerleaders - to the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea, in October has been seen as a sign of possible reconciliation. North Korea's 'army of beauties' cheer at the Daegu University Games in South Korea in 2003. North Korea has said it will send a cheering squad to the coming Asian Games in rival South Korea that its athletes plan to attend . North Korea boycotted the 1986 Asian Games and the 1988 Summer Olympics, both in Seoul, but attended the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, the 2003 University Games in Daegu and the 2005 Asian Athletics Championships in Incheon. In all three events, the North dispatched cheering squads, mostly comprising of young women - called an 'army of beauties' in South Korea - which often received more attention than the country's athletes. The two Koreas remain divided along the world's most heavily fortified border and officially remain in a state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.","Two Scud-type missiles were launched close to the DMZ yesterday .

"A Milwaukee mother couldn't contain her tears yesterday as she described the horrifying moment her white neighbor allegedly shot dead her son, a black 13-year-old, in front of her eyes after he accused the boy of stealing guns from his house. Patricia Larry testified that John Henry Spooner, 76, warned her son, Darius Simmons, that he'd teach him not to steal before he fired a single shot into the boy's chest, killing him, in May 2012. The shocking account came in the second day of Spooner's trial as jurors watched footage from the elderly man's own surveillance video, which showed him confronting Simmons on the sidewalk outside their houses, pointing a gun at the teen's chest and firing from just a few feet away. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Patricia Larry, Darius Simmons' mother, pictured, pauses to hold back tears as she talks about how she saw her son shot by John Spooner during her testimony Tuesday, July 16, 2013 . The wounded teen flees away from the cameras' view and collapses in the street. According to her testimony, Larry ran after her son and found him on the ground with only a light pulse in his neck. 'Then I pulled his shirt up and I (saw) he had a bullet hole in his chest,' she testified tearfully. 'He took one more breath and that's it.' The video was shown in court as evidence in the trial of Spooner, who's charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Larry, who has sat in the front row of the courtroom since the trial related to her son's death began on Monday, refused to watch the surveillance video. She stared straight ahead with moist eyes. Three jurors watched the video with their hands over their mouths. Support: Patricia Larry, Darius Simmons' mother, right, is comforted after a video of her son being shot by John Henry Spooner was shown in court . In the surveillance footage, Spooner emerges from his house that morning and confronts Simmons. He points a gun at the boy, who quickly moves backward a few steps. Both Spooner and the teen direct their attention toward a porch at Simmons' home, where Simmons' mother is standing. Moments later, Spooner points the gun back at Simmons and fires, hitting him in the chest. As the teen stumbles and runs away, Spooner fires a second shot that misses him. The defense has conceded that Spooner fired the fatal bullet at Simmons as they argued on the sidewalk. Victim: Darius Simmons, pictured, was allegedly shot and killed by John Henry Spooner in May 2012 . But defense attorney Franklyn Gimbel said the two issues for the jury to decide are whether Spooner intended to kill the boy, and whether Spooner was suffering from mental illness that prevented him from knowing right from wrong at the time. Richard Martinez, one of the Milwaukee . police officers who responded after the shooting, testified that Spooner . offered an unsolicited confession upon his arrest. Martinez said he . ordered Spooner at gunpoint to drop his weapon and Spooner bent down and . laid his handgun on the ground. Martinez testified that he was handcuffing Spooner when Spooner said, 'Yeah, I shot him,' referring to the teen. Martinez said Spooner had another bullet in his pocket. Martinez's partner, Michael Urbaniak, testified that he and Martinez placed Spooner in the back of a squad car while they investigated the scene. While being detained, Spooner commented that he had reached his breaking point and that his house had been broken into two days earlier, Urbaniak said. The officer said Spooner claimed he knew the culprits were the kids who lived next door, and that they were part of a family that recently moved next door and had caused nothing but trouble. Other police officers who testified included Lori Borchert, who responded to the burglary report two days earlier. She said two windows on Spooner's home were broken and Spooner told her four shotguns were missing. The day after the burglary, Spooner called Borchert and told her that his surveillance video captured images of the suspects. She said she viewed the video and that it showed two different black teenage males coming from the area of Simmons' home and moving toward Spooner's home. She said she didn't arrest anyone because there wasn't enough probable cause. She said the faces on the video weren't clear, and the teens didn't appear to be holding any of the missing guns. Gimbel, who limited his cross-examinations, told jurors during opening statements he intends to raise questions about whether Spooner actually had the requisite intent to commit homicide. Day two: John Henry Spooner, right, sits in court during his trial Tuesday, July 16, 2013, in Milwaukee . In the dock: Spooner, 76, right, confers with his defense attorney on Monday. He faces charges that he fatally shot a black teen last year whom he suspected of breaking into his Milwaukee home and stealing weapons . 'We will focus on what was Mr. Spooner's intent when he pointed the gun and pulled the trigger,' Gimbel said. Some . have likened the shooting of Simmons as 'vigilantism and rogue police . behavior' and similar to the killing in Florida of Trayvon Martin. In both cases, an older man allegedly killed a black teen because the shooter believed they were suspicious. Spooner shot Simmons last May after accusing the boy of stealing $3,000 worth of guns from his home. Video: Spooner's own surveillance footage shows the man, pictured, shooting the boy int he chest . The teen, who had lived with his . mother next door to Spooner for only a month, was taking out the trash . around 10 a.m. when Spooner accused the boy of the theft and demanded he . return the shotguns. The teenager . was unarmed when he was shot in the street outside their homes. The boy told Spooner he had not stolen the guns and his mother, Patricia Larry, told the elderly man to go back inside. Spooner . then pulled out a handgun and shot Simmons in the chest from only five . feet away, killing the boy. There were at least two witnesses. 'I . condemn in the strongest words possible the murder of Darius Simmons,' Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett said after the shooting. 'To have a boy . who's taking out the garbage at 10 in the morning murdered should shock . the conscience of the state.' If convicted of first-degree intentional homicide, Spooner faces life in prison. At the time, neighbor Toni Johnson said she was watching TV when she heard a commotion outside her door. ‘I . looked out the door and saw the mother kneeling over her boy at the . curb, screaming, 'my son!' and the old guy was standing right over there . by the stop sign with his dog, just waiting,’ Ms. Johnson said. Neighbor Robert Delatorre said Spooner lived alone with his two dogs and often walked around the block. Larry said Spooner told her son he 'wanted his stuff back . and that he wanted his shotguns back.' 'My son, Darius Simmons, was shot and killed in front of me,' Larry said earlier. 'It's affected me, my friends, my work.' Neighbors: Spooner was arrested after waiting for police at the crime scene. He lives in the cream house, right, while Darius Simmons lived in the blue house, left . Feud: Police said here was a history of disagreements between the man and the teenager .

"In the red corner, a high-profile news presenter known for his Left-wing opinions and colourful ties. In the blue, a Yorkshire-based MP very much to the Right of the Tory party. And as Jon Snow became embroiled in a furious shouting match with Philip Davies, the Channel 4 newsroom turned into their unlikely sparring arena. The row – played out in front of 50 journalists – began when ‘playground bully’ Mr Snow confronted Mr Davies, who was on a tour of the studio, about accusations of political bias. Backbench Tory MP Philip Davies was involved in a heated exchange with veteran broadcaster Jon Snow on a tour of Channel 4 News's studios yesterday . They traded insults for ten minutes – with Mr Davies saying Mr Snow was ‘past it’ – before fellow presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy waded in and told their visitor to ‘clear off’. As the dust settled last night, each side blamed the other for the undignified scene. Mr Snow’s colleagues claimed he had acted ‘perfectly reasonably’ after being subjected to a ‘personal attack’ from the politician. According to witnesses, he argued with Mr Davies over accusations the MP had made that he was ‘biased’ to the Left. Mr Davies, a long-serving member of the Commons culture committee, accused the 67-year-old presenter of subjecting him to an unprovoked verbal assault. The MP said he had been visiting ITN – where Channel 4 News is made – to discuss digital media and Google’s ‘right to be forgotten’ policy with its chief executive John Hardie. He was then invited to take a tour of the premises, when he bumped into Mr Snow in the middle of the busy newsroom. Channel 4 news presenters  Krishnan Guru-Murthy (right) and Jon Snow (left) were involved in a row with Mr Davies . Mr Davies said: ‘He launched into a tirade of abuse about something I had said in a select committee about Channel 4 News being Left-wing and biased, and that Jon Snow was a prime example of it. ‘He said, “Just give me one example where I’ve been biased, just one example”. I replied, “I’m on a tour round, I haven’t come for an argument about Channel 4 News. I will happily do that but I haven’t come expecting confrontation”. ‘He went on, “Where are your examples? You can’t give me any examples”. He was like a playground bully in his own playground.’ Yesterday, another source who was at the scene also said Mr Snow had started the exchange. Mr Davies said Tuesday’s row escalated when he suggested the presenter was getting too old for his job. According to one witness, he told Mr Snow: ‘I think it’s time you retired’. Under rules set by watchdog Ofcom, Channel 4 must report the news accurately and with ‘due impartiality’. However, like the BBC, it has been accused of giving prominence to liberal viewpoints, and its presenters have been criticised for aligning themselves too closely with the Left. This summer Jon Snow came under fire after he recorded a YouTube video - filmed in the Channel 4 studios - in which he gave a personal reflection on the conflict in Gaza. Some said he was guilty of bias against Israel after he focused his report exclusively on the children killed in the bombardment. He was also criticised for a tweet in which he said there was an ‘awful danger’ that the shooting down of flight MH17 over Ukraine would ‘provide cover for an intensification of Israel’s ground war in Gaza’. In 2008, a group of Roman Catholic priests accused the channel of being biased towards Islam and taking a ‘trivialising attitude to Catholicism’. In reply, Mr Snow suggested the MP was struggling to hold on to his constituency of Shipley in West Yorkshire. In fact Mr Davies beat his Labour rival by 9,944 votes at the last election, up from his majority of 422 votes in 2005. Mr Davies said: ‘Much to the embarrassment of the ITN people I said, “Look John, pack it in, you’re past it”. And he said, “Well good luck with your 400 majority”. ‘And I said, “That goes to show, you’re out of date and past it”.’ It was at that point Mr Guru-Murthy entered the fray, apparently telling Mr Davies: ‘If you’re going to start getting personal on Jon Snow, I think you should clear off.’ Mr Davies has several times accused Channel 4 of bias. In 2010, he said the broadcaster was so obsessed with diversity that white people were under-represented in its workforce. And during a select committee hearing last year he grilled chief executive David Abraham and chairman Lord Burns about perceived liberal bias in its news output. At the time, he asked: ‘Do you think Jon Snow conceals his political allegiances? Do you? Are you going to sit there with a straight face and say that?’ Lord Burns conceded: ‘I think that Jon would probably fall into the liberal bias category that you described, and if you were in any doubt, you could just follow his Twitter feed on a regular basis.’ A Channel 4 spokesman said: ‘We were pleased to welcome Philip Davies MP to Channel 4 News. Our journalists never shy away from a full and frank discussion, and Jon Snow and Mr Davies had a robust exchange of views.’","Backbencher Philip Davies allegedly launched blistering attack on Mr Snow .

Speaking about her research, Dr Deborah Carr of Rutgers University in the US, said: 'I think it comes down to the fact that when a wife is satisfied with the marriage she tends to do a lot more for her husband, which has a positive effect on his life. 'Men tend to be less vocal about their relationships and their level of marital unhappiness might not be translated to their wives.' Her research, she says, is extensive and important because both men and women's feelings and how they affect others were taken into account. 'For both spouses, being in a better-rated marriage was linked to greater life satisfaction and happiness.' Key to happiness? Researchers believe that when a wife is satisfied with the marriage she tends to do a lot more for her husband, which has a positive effect on his life .

"Fear factor: Panic has spread through a Serbian village amid rumours that notorious vampire Sava Savanovic (pictured) is on the loose . Sales of garlic are booming in western Serbia today after the local council issued a public health warning that a vampire was on the loose. The official announcement came after an old ruined mill said to once have been the home of the country's most famous vampire collapsed. Sava Savanovic was believed to have lived in the shack on the Rogacica river in Zarozje village in the municipality of Bajina Basta. It is said he drank the blood of anybody that came to mill their grain. The watermill was bought by the local . Jagodic family and they were too scared to use it as a mill – but . discovered it was a goldmine when they started advertising for tourists . to come and visit it – always during the day. The . family were worried about carrying out building work on the mill . because they were scared they might disturb the vampire or unleash his . wrath. And now the property has collapsed through lack of repair. But for locals it has sparked rumours that the vampire is now free once again. Local . mayor Miodrag Vujetic admitted: 'People are worried, everybody knows . the legend of this vampire and the thought that he is now homeless and . looking for somewhere else and possibly other victims is terrifying . people. We are all frightened.' He added that it was all very well for . people who didn't live in the area to laugh at their fears but he said . nobody in the region was in any doubt that vampires do exist. He . confirmed that the local council had advised all villagers to put . garlic on their doors and windows to protect them from the vampire as it . was well known they can't stand the smell. 'People are terrified': Savanovic is said to be on the prowl after his home (above), a favourite with tourists, collapsed in the village of Zarozje . Frightening folklore: Savanovic was believed to have lived in the shack (pictured) on the Rogacica river in the village of Zarozje, where it is said he drank the blood of anybody that came to mill their grain . The notion of blood-sucking vampires preying on the flesh of the living goes back thousands of years and was common in many ancient cultures, where tales of these reviled creatures of the dead abounded. Archaeologists recently found 3,000 Czech graves, for example, where bodies had been weighed down with rocks to prevent the dead emerging from their tombs. The advent of Christianity only fuelled the vampire legends, for they were considered the antithesis of Christ — spirits that rose from the dead bodies of evil people. But the term 'vampire' was not popularised until the early 18th century after an influx of vampire superstition from areas such as the Balkans and Eastern Europe. Belief in such legends became so pervasive it caused mass hysteria in some areas and even public executions of people believed to be vampires. Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, above, is considered the seminal vampire novel which provided the basis of modern vampire fiction. He added: 'We have also reminded them to put a Holy cross in every room in the house.' Villagers . who cashed in catering to tourists fascinated by the legend of . Savanovic say they now wish they had left the place well alone. Savanovic features in the 1880 story . Posle Devedeset Godina (After Ninety Years), written by the Serbian . realist writer Milovan Glišić who inspired the 1973 horror film . Leptirica . He also appears in the novel Strah i njegov sluga (Fear and His Servant) written by Mirjana Novaković. Other famous vampire cases in Serbia include those of Peter Plogojowitz and Arnold Paole. Plogojowitz, a peasant, was said to have died at the age of 62 in 1785, but reportedly returned from the grave to ask his son for food. When his son refused, Plogojowitz brutally murdered him. Later, the villagers decided to exhume the son's body to look for signs of vampirism and were shocked to apparently find a fresh corpse with 'new skin and nails'. They said blood could be seen at the mouth. They proceeded to stake the body through the heart causing 'completely fresh' blood to flow through the ears and mouth of the corpse. Finally, the body was burned. In the other case, it was said Paole, a soldier-turned-farmer, was attacked by a vampire and went on to kill a dozen people in the surrounding area in the early 18th Century. Both cases became famous because the Austrian authorities, who at that time controlled Serbia, appeared to confirm that vampires did indeed exist. On alert: The mayor of Bajine Basta advised all villagers to put garlic on their doors and windows to protect them from the vampire as it was well known they can't stand the smell .","Sava Savanovic 'on prowl' after his watermill home in Serbia collapsed .

"Peter Ball, formerly the Bishop of Gloucester and Bishop of Lewes, will be prosecuted for historic offences dating back to 1977 (file photo) A retired Church of  England bishop and friend  of Prince Charles has been charged with a series of  sex offences. Peter Ball, who once described the Prince of Wales as a loyal friend after being given a place to live by him, is due to appear in court next month over sex offences and misconduct charges. The 82-year-old former Bishop of Gloucester, who was previously Bishop of Lewes in East Sussex, will be prosecuted for alleged historic offences dating back to 1977. Ball was enthroned as Bishop of Gloucester in 1992 at a ceremony attended by Prince Charles, and resigned in 1993. Shortly afterwards Charles invited him to live in Manor Lodge in the village of Aller, Somerset, a property owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Ball said at the time: ‘He [Prince Charles] has been wonderfully kind and allowed me to have a Duchy house. The prince is a loyal friend. ‘I have immense admiration for him. He has been through horrific times and is a great person.’ Ball is understood to have moved out of the property after living there for a decade.

"It is a country known for ABBA, meatballs and flat-pack furniture - and Sweden is hoping its latest export will be just as easy to recognise. The Swedish government has launched a national typeface based on 'Scandinavian minimalism' that it hopes will give its posters, signs and websites a cohesive look. Sweden Sans, which designers describe as a 'basic sans serif font with a modern twist', will now replace the various typefaces used by different national agencies. Modern twist: The Swedish government hopes Sweden Sans, pictured above, will give its posters, signs and websites representing Sweden a cohesive look. The idea of a national font could now go global . The aim is to create a single 'visual brand' to be used when representing Sweden internationally. And designers behind the font are now working on similar briefs for other countries. The team at Stockholm design agency Söderhavet, who worked on the government brief, said that they were inspired by the national flag and vintage Swedish signs. Font designer Stefan Hattenbach, who collaborated with the agency on the six-month project, said that Sweden Sans is a 'modern' but edgy typeface. He told the Guardian: 'Aesthetics are very important in Sweden and we have a long tradition of great architecture, furniture and design – so this was the natural next step.' 'It was a big responsibility to be representing our country, but we were really proud to be asked.' Inspiration: The Stockholm-based designers took Sweden's national flag, pictured, as their starting point. A government website said that it is 'a classic and timeless typeface' He added that he wanted people to appreciate the look as a whole and not notice the typeface specifically. And Mr Hattenbach said that the idea of a national font could go global. He said: 'We can't name names as projects are still in their first phases, but we're currently in discussion to do much more nation branding in the future. The font will now be rolled out across all government ministries and agencies. There is a website dedicated to ensure that all aspects of design - from colours to typography - remain consistent across all aspects of published material. According to the website, called Identitytool,  Sweden Sans is 'a classic and timeless typeface that can be used in both digital and analogue formats'. 'Sweden Sans is a long-term choice of typeface; it has an unassuming character and fits well with a broad spectrum of other typefaces.' It then urges visitors to the site to 'always use it when communicating the image of Sweden'. A new font could help make reading easier for dyslexics. 'Dyslexie' has been designed in a way that makes it harder for individual letters to be confused - a common problem experienced by those with dyslexia. Dutch designer Christian Boer, who developed the font, said they often unconsciously switch, rotate and mirror letters in their mind. He told the Guardian: 'Traditional typefaces make this worse, because they base some letter designs on others, inadvertently creating ‘twin letters’ for people with dyslexia.' Mr Boer has weighted his letters more heavily at the bottom and has made subtle distinctions between letters like 'b' 'd' and 'p' - which can often look similar in traditional fonts - to help stop the confusion. Other similar letters are given different heights and their proportions slightly deformed. There is also greater space between Dyslexie letters than those in a traditional font - helping to stop letter crowding that can cause problems for dyslexics. Studies from researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Twente have revealed that 84 per cent of readers could read text in the Dyslexie font faster than a standard typeface, while 77 per cent reported fewer mistakes.","Sweden Sans will be used on all publicity material put out by government .

"A holy relic containing the blood of Pope John Paul II has been stolen from a chapel in Italy. A massive manhunt is underway after the rare ampoule was snatched from a medieval sanctuary dedicated to the late Pope in the Abruzzo mountains. Police are investigating the possibility that a Satanist sect could be involved, as the theft coincided with an important date in the Satanist calendar. Assassination attempt: The ampule contains a piece of blood-soaked cloth that dates back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul II on May 13 1981, in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City . Thieves sawed through iron bars on the . window, officials said, and took the ampule (left) alongside a crucifix. There . was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel (right) Thieves ignored other items and focused on this, giving rise to speculation that it was Satanists . Venerated since medieval times for their healing powers, religious relics still have the power to draw crowds. A selection of artefacts associated with John Paul II is touring Europe, as the Vatican prepares to officially declare the former Pope a saint in April. The ampule containing a piece of blood-soaked cloth, dating back to the 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul, was bestowed on the tiny sanctuary of Pietro della Ienca, on the mountain peak of Gran Sasso, where the pontiff used to take skiing holidays. Thieves sawed through iron bars on the window, officials said, and took the ampule alongside a crucifix. There was no CCTV or alarm in the chapel. Close call: The Pope was shot and critically wounded when Mehmet Ali Agca (his gun is circled) shsot him four times while he was entering the square . Fifty carabinieri and sniffer dogs were yesterday combing the mountain where fascist dictator Mussolini was rescued by SS commandoes after his capture by Allied forces in 1943. President of the village cultural society, Pasquale Corriere, said: ‘It was no doubt stolen to order. The thieves touched nothing but the relic and the crucifix. ‘They did not force the door of the sacristy or open the chest containing donations, which convinces me that [the relic] was the target’. The hope is that the thieves repent and bring it back, he added. Grisly: Other remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation . Religious studies teacher Giovanni Panunzio, of the Osservatorio Antiplagio, a group which supports victims of charlatans, said that the date of the theft represented new birth for Satanists, so, in this phase of the year, ‘blood and crosses are symbolic objects to desecrate’. He added: ‘The market for religious statues for Satanic ects is particularly vibrant right now. Unique sacred objects, even those without any artistic merit, are sold for tens of thousands of euros.’ Police in Abruzzo said they were investigating all leads. The relic was given to the chapel in 2011 by John Paul’s private secretary, Stanislaw Dziwisz. Other grisly remnants of John Paul's tenancy include a bullet-pierced cassock that the former pontiff was wearing at the time of the 1981 assassination attempt, a tuft of hair cut from the Pope's head a few days before his death and some blood-soaked gauze saved from an operation. The mantle, which John Paul II was wearing when he was targeted in St Peter's Square, was secretly hidden by Dziwisz and its existence only revealed after his death in 2005. Religious orders are vying for ampoules of blood, taken by the pope's personal physician and sent to a hospital in Rome during the his dying days in case a blood transfusion was needed. One precious vessel of blood was almost lost in September 2012 when a priest carrying it on a train, near Rome, was distracted and robbed by three bandits. It was found just hours later lying in a field. The relics were a crucial part of the campaign which saw John Paul II made the fastest saint in modern times. The event is to take place in record-breaking time just nine years after his death in 2005. The last obstacle to his canonisation was cleared last year when doctors approved the second of two required miracles. The Vatican maintains that to put a price on a sacred objects is sacrilegious. But Ebay does a roaring trade in JP II relics with 'authentic' vestments worn by the late Pope starting at about $40. In 2007 the Vatican was overrun with nearly 200,000 requests for pieces of John Paul II's cassock after offering them for free on the internet.","Manhunt underway after vial was stolen from chapel in Abruzzo mountains .

"Pope Francis has declared the internet is a ‘gift from God’ because it brings people from different cultures together. In a statement about Catholic Church communications, Pope Francis said the web offers ‘immense possibilities’ for differing points of view to be heard, including those that oppose or question the Catholic religion. Yet added our obsession with online conversations should never be used at the detriment of having face-to-face conversations with neighbours, friends and family. Pope Francis (pictured) made the claims to German altar servers in Rome on Tuesday. He urged the young people not to waste 'too many hours on futile things', including chatting on the internet and smartphones, and watching TV soap operas . Pope Francis, 77, was elected in March last year to lead the world's 1.2 . billion Catholics. He was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina and was one of five children. He was named 2013 Person of the Year by Time magazine - edging out NSA whistleblower and fugitive Edward Snowden into second place. His predecessor Pope Benedict . XVI was the first pontiff to join Twitter. Pope Francis regularly tweets in English to over three million followers, from the handle . @pontifex. Reports claim the Pope previously worked as bouncer when he was a student, and he has expressed a love of dancing. Francis is the first non-European pope since Gregory III, who was elected in 731 and was born in modern-day Syria. In his message on Thursday, Francis said: '[The internet] is something truly good, a gift from God.' He continued that it should be used like 'a balm which relieves pain and a fine wine which gladdens hearts.' Yet warned: 'The desire for digital connectivity can have the effect of isolating us from our neighbors, from those closest to us.' The Pontiff also declared the internet is a powerful tool because it lets people of various religions engage in dialogues about their faiths. He believes it shouldn't be used just to preach the Catholic word, but to discuss the benefits the religion has while accepting other religions may offer alternatives. 'A dialogue means to believe that the 'other' has something . worthwhile to say, and to entertain his or her point of view and . perspective,' explained Pope Francis. 'Engaging in dialogue does not mean . renouncing our own ideas and traditions, but the pretense that they . alone are valid and absolute.' The comments come after Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi declared in September that Jesus was the world's first tweeter because his sermons and messages were 'brief and full of meaning.' The Pontiff, pictured left, also declared the internet is a powerful tool because it lets people of various religions engage in dialogues about their faiths. He has previously been praised for embracing technology, as seen in this image where he posed for a selfie with a group of tourists at the Vatican . Gianfranco Ravasi made the comments while addressing a group of newspaper editors at a conference in Italy. He added that Christ 'used tweets before everyone . else, with elementary phrases made up of fewer than 45 characters such as . 'Love one another'. Cardinal Ravasi stated that the church should be doing all it can to take full advantage of the internet as a way of getting the message of God to the masses. Pope Francis' predecessor Pope Benedict XVI was the first pontiff to join Twitter, and the current Pope Francis tweets in English to over three million followers, from the handle @pontifex.","Pope Francis declared the internet was 'truly good, a gift from God'

"A desperate hunt is underway in Northern California for a tuberculosis patient who has refused treatment and may be contagious, putting those around him at risk. Prosecutors said on Thursday that they have obtained an arrest warrant for Eduardo Rosas Cruz, a 25-year-old transient. In March, he went to the San Joaquin General Hospital's emergency room, complaining of a severe cough. Diagnosed with tuberculosis, medical staff told him to stay in a Stockton motel room, where a health worker would deliver his medication and watch him take it. But officials say he took off. County health officials asked prosecutors to seek the warrant, in part, because Rosas Cruz comes from a part of Mexico known for its drug-resistant strain of tuberculosis. Have you seen this man? Authorities are looking for Eduardo Rosas Cruz, a homeless man who has refused treatment for contagious tuberculosis, putting other people around him at risk . County health officials are searching for . Rosas Cruz, and his name is in a statewide law enforcement system, San . Joaquin County Deputy District Attorney Stephen Taylor said. 'He could be in a homeless shelter. He could be around the corner from the courthouse,' Taylor said. 'We don't know.' Tuberculosis spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The disease most commonly infects a person's lungs. It can cause death if left untreated. Catching tuberculosis requires extended contact with a contagious person, said San Joaquin County's public health officer, Dr. Alvaro Garza, adding that it is unclear if Rosas Cruz is contagious. Rosas Cruz needs a nine-month regime of medicine, which Alvaro said the patient is not near to completing. 'If you stop taking it, it comes roaring back,' Alvaro said. In court papers filed in support of the warrant, public health officials say Rosas Cruz resisted treatment from the start. He also uses crack cocaine and methamphetamine, officials said, adding that he could develop the drug resistant strain if he hasn't already. 'We need help getting him in,' Alvaro said. 'We've not been able to find him in places he's told us he's going to be.' Rosas Cruz initially went to the hospital after feeling shortness of breath for two weeks, had a high fever and had lost considerable weight, in addition to the cough, according to court papers. Taylor, who prosecutors public health cases, said he seeks arrest warrants like this once or twice each year. In mid-2012, officials in San Joaquin County arrested Armando Rodriguez, who refused tuberculosis treatment. Taylor said Rodriguez, age 34 at the time, was released January 7, 2013. By law, health officials can't force a patient to be treated for tuberculosis, but officials can use the courts to isolate him from the public. That is when officials offer treatment. Taylor, who did not know the status of Rosas Cruz's residency, said he is not interested in punishing him through the criminal court system. Rather, Taylor said he is using the courts to protect the public's health. 'We're interested in this guy because he broke the orders of the health officer,' Taylor said. 'It's all that's left on the shelf.'","Eduardo Rosas Cruz was diagnosed with tuberculosis in March .

"Ashley Pearson . The first thing you should know is that . when you are over 35 and trying to conceive, everyone around you will . immediately fall pregnant. Literally, everyone. 'Hey, did you know that Emma’s expecting?' started one late . morning phone call, 'they weren't even trying and it was a total surprise and . at first she wasn't sure how she felt about it but now she's over the moon.' 'Oh!' you swallow hard and try to sound excited, 'that's wonderful.' In my case it felt as though every woman, trying or not trying, . gay or straight, single or married... was pregnant. One friend was . pushing 40, living overseas and exhausted with looking for Mr Right. After some . careful thought she decided to use the services of an anonymous donor. She ordered frozen sperm online - using a tall, dark-haired donor with similar taste in film - and shipped it over. She fell pregnant on the very first . round. The next week I got word that another good friend, 41 years . old, had met a new guy on a business trip, slept with him once and fallen . pregnant. And he had previously had a vasectomy. Another woman I'd worked with had hooked up with . her flatmate after one too many Flaming Sambucas one evening and was now . expecting, while a further married acquaintance was on birth control and yet still . managed to conceive. Tales like . these were everywhere, and while on the one hand they gave me hope, in the main . they only served to make my self-pity - and, yes, self-loathing - worse. Things were made even more difficult because of my job: writing about celebrities. Why was 2012 . was the year half of Hollywood and London got pregnant?  A baby bump became . a de rigueur accessory: Reese Witherspoon, Jessica Simpson, Drew Barrymore, . Gisele Bundchen, Lara Stone, Fearne Cotton, Kristen Bell, Sophie . Dahl, Claire Danes, Kim Kardashian... Even the future queen, the Duchess of Cambridge, had a baby on the way. It felt like they were everywhere, . taunting me with their rounded bellies. Ashley Pearson doesn't understand why as soon as she began trying to conceive, everyone around her fell pregnant . Like some of you reading this, I was an 'older' hopeful mother-to-be. Despite the savage things written about the brigade of selfish, . career-obsessed women who leave it too late, I, like most of my peers, simply . hadn't met the right man when I was in my 20s and bursting with . fertility. It's not that I was putting it off or wasn't looking, or . that I was too fussy and turning down all manner of suitable candidates. Believe me, he just wasn't among them. I did . eventually find him, at the age of 37, and married him at a ripe old 39. We . started trying for a baby immediately, on our honeymoon, and yet here I was, 40 . years old and still nothing was happening. It wasn't very helpful that articles appeared daily in . newspapers and magazines sharply reminding me of the negatives. I call it terrorising the older mum. 'Risks of . miscarriage skyrocket after 40', 'My IVF hell', 'How infertility destroyed my . marriage', 'How my selfish decision to have IVF after 40 lead to my child's . Down Syndrome', 'The day my baby dreams died', they went on and on. I never found one that seemed to say anything . positive... or even hopeful. Not wanting to waste any more time I started seeing doctors . almost immediately to see if anything was wrong. But apparently it wasn't. The Duchess of Cambridge, left, is due to give birth in July, and Fearne Cotton, right, has a baby boy called Rex . There are all kinds of invasive and uncomfortable tests that could be done, and I had them all. Which in some ways made it . even more complicated, because I was left to wonder what was wrong. 'As I . see it, the main problem is your age,' said one rather direct OB. Occasionally, some of the insensitivity I encountered from doctors reeling off . statistics about how dismal my chances of conception were due to my geriatric status - especially at a time when you feel hugely vulnerable -  was shocking. Ashley married at 39 and began trying for a baby immediately . I found private doctors far more sympathetic than NHS ones, perhaps because . you were paying them to be tactful. Things came to a head one night over dinner with a long-time . friend I hadn’t seen in years. She arrived - you guessed it - hugely . pregnant. I knew she'd been trying for years for a baby . and had had several rounds of IVF, and I really was genuinely delighted for . her. I was also literally hanging on her every word. She was . utterly radiant. After hurriedly getting small talk and pleasantries out . of the way, she finally enlightened me: 'Look, the answer for me was this - I . finally found the right clinic with the right protocol for me, which in my case . was London's ARGC.' 'They realised what the other places I'd . been going to failed to see. It was really intensive but I did everything . they said and after eight years of trying we are finally about to meet our little . boy.' We both had tears in our eyes as she proceeded to tell me her amazing . story. As I listened to her I realised two things. The first was not to give up . hope until you're sure you're ready to. The second was that while her solution . certainly might not work for everyone, it worked for her, and I was determined . to find the unique path that would be ours. Ashley Pearson says it's important not to give up hope in your quest to get pregnant until you are ready to do so . I called the fertility clinic . for an initial consult. There was a three month wait for an appointment, so in the . meantime I booked a series of sessions with acupuncture fertility specialist Emma . Cannon. I knew she had some bestselling . books on Amazon, but more importantly, a girlfriend had run into mother-of-two Sophie Dahl in her waiting room... which was enough of an endorsement . for me. Arriving at Emma's Chelsea clinic I felt relaxed . immediately. The whole atmosphere - the . dove grey  walls, the pink striped couch, the smell of scented . candles, the receptionist speaking in hushed soft tones - soothed me. When I met the woman . herself - think glamorous and sophisticated Earth mother - I felt immediately . calm. Dubbed The Baby-Maker for her . success at getting her patients pregnant, Emma combines a wealth of knowledge about Chinese medicine with cutting-edge Western developments. I was literally getting the best of both worlds. After asking questions about my health, my . relationship with my husband and my personal history, she looked me in . the eye and said: 'Based on what you've told me, I have no doubt you will get . pregnant, Ashley, you just have to be patient for the right moment.' 'The first thing you should know is that when you are over 35 and trying to conceive, everyone around you will immediately fall pregnant. Literally, everyone' She then started the acupuncture while I . peppered her with questions. But why was . it taking so long? Had I indeed left it too late? She answered: 'The thing we know is this: women do get pregnant in their . 40s, many with relative ease - what we don't always know is which ones will be . successful. 'My message to . women now is that you need to engage in your fertility in your 20s and 30s if . you want to have children when the timing is right for you. That’s not to say you . need to have your babies young, but you can take steps earlier in life to . preserve health and fertility.' For . example? 'Binge drinking, so prevalent . in our culture, is playing havoc with women's hormones. 'There really is no safe way to protect . yourself fertility-wise if you regularly partake in that, particularly if you want . to wait until later to have your babies.' She added: 'Using condoms is another . example of something you can do right now, as STIs can have a massive impact . on later fertility.' 'I left feeling enlightened and even a bit lighter on my feet. I still had a long way to go, but in my heart I knew my journey was beginning' As I lay back with the tiny needles in, I was riveted. I'd never talked to anyone about this . before. It's perhaps unsurprising . that a recent survey showed most women my age know twice as much about . Brazilian waxing than they do about preserving their fertility. Emma explained how she sees hundreds of women . struggling to conceive, and was moved to write about this topic. Her new book Total Fertility tackles the subject of . what women can do, at whatever stage they’re in, to protect their . fertility. She's dedicated it to her two daughters, in hope they learn . something my generation is perhaps figuring out only now. I left feeling enlightened and even a bit . lighter on my feet. I still had a long . way to go, but in my heart I knew my journey was . beginning.","Ashley Pearson married at 39 and began trying for a baby immediately .

"A shockingly, gruesome new ad campaign has been launched to show the potentially fatal danger of distracted driving. Using the slogan 'U Drive. U Text. U Pay', the $8.5million, government campaign will run across the U.S. from April 7 - 15. It will feature on TV, radio and in digital advertisements. The ad shows a teenage girl at the wheel of a car using her phone and chatting to friends before suddenly a truck appears out of nowhere, smashes into the side of the vehicle and causes catastrophic damage. Scroll down for the ad . The shocking new ad shows just how dangerous distracted driving can be as the two teenage girls are hit by a truck after the driver was texting at the wheel . The National Highway Traffic . Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 3,328 people were killed . and an estimated 421,000 injured in distraction-related crashes in 2012. Three-quarters of young people (71 per cent) have admitted to sending or writing text messages while driving while 78 per cent said they have read a message while driving. According to research, five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting. When traveling at 55mph, that's enough time to cover the length of a football field blindfolded. U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said: 'This campaign puts distracted driving on par with our efforts to fight drunk driving or to encourage seatbelt use.' The new ads, which will run in English and Spanish, aim to bolster distracted driving demonstration programs in California and Delaware of high-visibility police enforcement and fines. The efforts have reduced hand-held phone use over a widespread area. The ad campaign, which features three young friends, will run across the U.S. this month in English and Spanish . The teenage girl looks down at her phone in the ad while driving with two passengers . The car is seen racing towards the stop sign in the short ad campaign . The ad shows three teenage friends chatting and laughing in the car while playing music. As the car reaches a stop sign, the teenage driver looks down at her phone. In the passenger window, a truck can be seen - but the car glides through the Stop sign before a horrifying, fatal collision is shown. Currently, 43 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for drivers of all ages. In 12 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands drivers of all ages are banned from using hand-held cell phones while driving. In 37 states and D.C., cell phone use by novice drivers is not allowed. The two girls are not looking at the danger of a truck which is coming barreling towards them in the hard-hitting new ad .

"Scientists believe they have achieved the ‘holy grail’ of . the green economy by designing a hydrogen production plant that can split water . with sunlight. The University of Colorado at Boulder envisages an array of . mirrors that would focus sunlight onto a central tower several hundred feet . tall. The tower would heat up to around 1,350 °C . - enough to liberate hydrogen from steam with the help of a metal oxide . compound. A concept design of a hydrogen production plant that could fuel a sustainable green economy with sunlight and water. The tower would heat up to around 1,350 degrees Celsius- enough to liberate hydrogen from steam with the help of a metal oxide compound . An array of mirrors focuses sunlight onto a central tower several hundred feet tall. Metal oxide compound in the tower heat up to around 1,350C and release oxygen atoms. This changes its material composition causing the newly formed compound to seek out new oxygen atoms. The addition of steam to the system- which could be produced by boiling water in the reactor with the concentrated sunlight beamed to the tower - cause oxygen from the water molecules to adhere to the surface of the metal oxide. This frees up hydrogen molecules for collection as hydrogen gas. ‘We have designed something here that is very different from . other methods and frankly something that nobody thought was possible before,’ said lead scientist Professor Alan Weimer, from the University of Colorado at . Boulder. ‘Splitting water with sunlight is the Holy Grail of a . sustainable hydrogen economy.’ Hydrogen could be used as a fuel for roadtransport, distributed heat and power generation, and for energy storage. Writing in the journal Science, the researchers explain how . their plant would adopt the same principle as using a magnifying glass to start . a fire. ‘We can concentrate sunlight until it is really hot and use . it to drive these chemical reactions,’ said Dr Christopher Muhich, a member of . the University of Colorado team. ‘While we can easily heat it up to more than 1,350°C, we want to heat it to the lowest temperature possible for . these chemical reactions to still occur. ‘Hotter temperatures can cause rapid thermal expansion and . contraction, potentially causing damage to both the chemical materials and to . the reactors themselves.’ Splitting water with sunlight is described by the U.S. scientists as the Holy Grail of a sustainable hydrogen economy. Hydrogen could be used as a greener alternative to fuel road transport, in distributed heat and power generation, and for energy storage . The quantity of hydrogen produced is entirely dependent on . the amount of metal oxide, a combination of iron, cobalt, aluminium and oxygen, . and steam. A working system would require a number of towers each . surrounded by several acres of mirrors. Commercialisation of such a solar-thermal reactor is only . likely to happen when the economic conditions are right, claims Professor . Weimer. ‘There would have to be a substantial monetary penalty for . putting carbon into the atmosphere, or the price of fossil fuels would have to . go way up,’ he added. Last year, British researchers claimed that they had also . found the ‘holy grail’ of the green economy by producing petrol from air for the . first time. Air Fuel Synthesis in Stockton-on-Tees, Teesside, made . petrol using a small refinery that synthesises the fuel from carbon dioxide and . water vapour. While the company said it used carbon dioxide extracted . directly from the air in their reaction, it is mainly using industrial sources . of the gas until it is able to improve the performance of 'carbon capture.'

"Tensions in Ukraine are continuing to escalate after Russia was accused of sending tanks and armoured vehicles across the border. The allegation by military officials in Kiev came hours after Moscow announced that a second aid convoy would head to the region, raising suspicions that they are supplying arms to the rebels. Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine's National Security Council, said a column of 10 tanks and two armoured vehicles had driven into the south-east of the country near Shcherbak, which has so far escaped the worst of the fighting. A Ukrainian gun fires at pro-Russian rebels in Ilovaysk as tensions continue to rise in the region . Ukrainian soldiers stand at a checkpoint on a road near the city of Dnepropetrovsk, eastern Ukraine. Kiev said its forces clashed with an armoured column that crossed from Russia today . The vehicles were spotted 11 miles from the city of Novoazovsk, which was shelled overnight. The reported incursion could indicate an attempt to advance on Mariupol, a major port on the Azov Sea, an arm of the Black Sea. Moscow unilaterally sent around 200 'aid' lorries across the border on Friday, a move that Ukraine said was an invasion. All of those vehicles have now returned to Russia after delivering goods to the rebel stronghold of Lugansk. But Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced his attenions of a second trip along the same route, suggesting those who had been caught up in the fighting needed vital supplies. As the conflict continues to intensify, hundreds of Ukrainian families have been sent 3,000 miles away to Siberia to begin new lives. More than 600 refugees have already travelled to the city of Irkutsk, close to Lake Baikal, some six time zones east of Ukraine. Trucks from the bitterly disputed aid convoy, which arrived at the border last week, head back to Russia after Ukraine described the action as an invasion.

The alleged movement of a Russian tank column today could create a new front in the sepratist war . Last week Ukraine and its Western allies denounced the arrival of a first huge convoy that crossed the border without Kiev's permission. However Russia claimed it had lost patience with what it called Ukraine's stalling tactics. Even though the white-tarpaulined tractor-trailers returned to Russia without incident on Saturday, the announcement of another convoy could raise new suspicions that the Kremlin is supplying the rebels. Lavrov also said the food, water and other goods delivered to the hard-hit rebel city of Lugansk by the first convoy were being distributed  with the participation of the International Committee of the Red Cross. One of the guards bears the arm band of the Right Sector - who are supporting the Ukrainian government's military campaign against the rebels . Last week Russian soldiers were pictured standing next to a tank in Kamensk-Shakhtinsky near the Ukrainian border. Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh said the build up of ground and air forces has been alarming . He said that soon 'there will no longer be anyone left to help' in Lugansk, where weeks of heavy shelling have cut off power, water and phone service and made food scarce. The Ukrainian government in the past few weeks has been making strong gains, taking back territory from the rebels. It believed the aid convoy was a ploy by Russia to get supplies to the rebels and slow down the government advances. On Sunday, as Ukraine celebrated the anniversary of its 1991 independence from Moscow, President Peter Poroshenko announced the government would be increasing its military spending in a bid to defeat the rebels. In rebel-held Donetsk, captured Ukrainian soldiers were paraded Sunday in the streets, jeered by the crowd and pelted with eggs and tomatoes. Families flee the bloodshed: Ukrainian refugees  are sent to Siberia to begin new life . By WILL STEWART . Refugees from the bloodshed in eastern Ukraine are being sent to Siberia to begin a new life. In an echo of the Second World War, when many were forced to flee to the east of Russia after Hitler attacked their towns and cities, trains are carrying displaced people on a five day journey to new homes. Moscow claims that the West has ignored the scale of the humanitarian crisis, which has led to hundreds of thousands of people pouring out of the provinces of Lugansk and Donetsk, in rebel held Ukraine, as government troops from Kiev seek to regain the territories. A Ukrainian family arrives in Siberia after fleeing the bloodshed in the east of the country . A mother carries her young daughter after a train arrives in Siberia, where families are trying to start new lives . Moving pictures of children and families sent to a new life in Siberia have emerged after trains delivered more than 600 refugees to the city of Irkutsk, close to Lake Baikal, some six time zones east of Ukraine, a distance of almost 3,000 miles . 'The latest groups of refugees to arrive comprises 606 people including 175 children, with 20 below the age of 12 months,' said the Siberian Times . 'All have fled the humanitarian nightmare in eastern Ukraine, to which the Russian government accuses the West of turning a blind eye. 'Many more are expected to arrive in Siberia, as they flee the violence in the territories of Lugansk and Donetsk. 'Two more trains in August will bring 930 Ukrainian citizens to Irkutsk, safe from the bombs and bullets in their native land.' The West blames Moscow for fomenting the unrest on the east by supplying separatists with fighters and arms, a charge rejected by Russia. Hundreds more are expected to arrive in the city of Irkutsk on trains and coaches as they look to escape the violence in Lugansk and Donetsk .

Some refugees say they were given little option but to accept the Siberian offer, only allowed to stay in tented camps near the border for three nights before which they must move on. Many have lost their blitzed homes. Others deem it too dangerous to return to regions where battles between the army and rebels are a daily reality. Before leaving his refugee camp in Rostov region, Alexander, 73, said: 'Can you believe it? Just two days ago I was having breakfast in Lugansk in the apartment in which I was born, and now it no longer exists. 'It's been destroyed, and now, at my age, I have to start my life over in Irkutsk.' Couple Dmitry and Anna fled with their two children from a village close to war-ravaged Lugansk. 'Leaving will allow us to turn the page,' said Anna. 'Our children will be able to go to school normally and grow up without anyone accusing them of being on one side or the other.' Refugees, some of whom also brought pets with them, were given little option but to travel to Siberia. They can only stay in the tents for three nights before they are forced to move on . Dmitry said when he gets his first rouble wages from his new job, he will buy clothes for his family, pots and pans, and a fridge. 'Little by little, we'll build ourselves a new life in Russia better than the one we had in Ukraine,' he said. Local official Valentina Voblikova said: 'Those seeking jobs will consider the vacancies we have in the region.' The United Nations says 730,000 people have left Ukraine since the start of the conflict though not all are refugees. Of these some 168,000 have registered as refugees, according to UNHCR. The refugees will face a dramatic weather change in their new homes. Donetsk has average winter lows of minus 7C while the figure is minus 22C in Irkutsk. Others have been moved to Tyumen in western Siberia, and to Yekaterinburg in the Urals.

"The man who was killed when he attempted to stop the shooting rampage of a couple inside of a Wal-Mart store in Las Vegas, Nevada, is being eulogized Sunday. A service to remember Joseph Wilcox, 31, will take place at 2pm at the Palm Downtown Mortuary and Cemetery, in Las Vegas. It is open to the public. Wilcox was a customer at the Wal-Mart when Jerad and Amanda Miller, a married couple who had just killed two police officers, entered the store on June 8. Jerad Miller was shouting 'the revolution's begun' and announced to the customers to leave. Wilcox, who was carrying a concealed handgun legally, attempted to confront Jerad Miller. That's when he was shot from behind in the ribs by Amanda Miller, whom he did not see as he walked towards her husband. Undated picture of Joseph Wilcox, who is being eulogized on Sunday. Wilcox's actions are being credited as heroic in attempting to stop the shooting rampage of Jerad and Amanda Miller . Storefront of the Wal-Mart where Wilcox lost his life on June 8, 2014 . The Millers had arrived at the Wal-Mart after fleeing from another shootout inside of a nearby CiCi's Pizza that killed police officers Alyn Beck, 42, and Igor Soldo, 32. The officers were inside of the restaurant having lunch when the shooters stormed in. The continuation of the rampage inside of the Wal-Mart ended when officers surrounded the couple inside of the store, where Jerad Miller had built a makeshift fort out of merchandise. He was then shot in the head by his wife, who then turned the gun on herself. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie declared that Wilcox died trying to protect others from the murderous actions of the Millers, whose motives seemed to be rooted in anti-police, anti-government white supremacy. After murdering the officers, the killers left a note stating 'The revolution is beginning', also leaving a swastika and yellow flag depicting a coiled snake stating 'Don't tread on me'. In a Facebook post dated six days before the attack, Jerad Miller went on a rant that stated 'To stop this oppression, I fear, can only be accomplished with bloodshed.' Wilcox was at Wal-Mart that day to return a modem. He had been experiencing Internet problem, which turned out to be a a result of an error by his Internet service provider. According to his family, despite the Las Vegas Police calling his actions 'heroic', Wilcox was a quiet man who did not always carry a gun. At one time, he had attempted to become a police officer.

"Top lawyers have written guidelines for British solicitors on drafting 'sharia-compliant' wills which can deny women an equal share of their inheritance and entirely exclude non-believers, it was revealed today. The Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, has written a guide on Sharia succession rules that will be used in British courts. It will mean that children born outside of marriage and adopted children could also be denied their fair share. The guide states: 'No distinction is made between children of different marriages, but illegitimate and adopted children are not Sharia heirs. New guidance for lawyers on drawing up wills based on Sharia principles have been released by British legal experts. Pictured, the Sharia Council of Britain preside over marital cases at their east London headquarters . 'The male heirs in most cases receive double the amount inherited by a female heir of the same class. Non-Muslims may not inherit at all, and only Muslim marriages are recognised. 'Similarly, a divorced spouse is no longer a Sharia heir, as the entitlement depends on a valid Muslim marriage existing at the date of death.' The Law Society claims the guide is simply to promote 'good practice' and 'support members so they can help clients from all backgrounds' - but the move has been criticised by equality campaigners. Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, an organisation that campaigns for strict separation of the state from religious institutions and equality of religion before the law, says the move is a backwards step that undermines British justice. Equality campaigner Baroness Cox said the Law Society document 'violates everything we stand for' He said: 'The UK has the most comprehensive equality laws in the world, yet the Law Society seems determined to undermine this by giving approval to a system that relegates women, non-Muslim and children born out of wedlock to second class citizenship. 'Instead of running scared at any mention of sharia, politicians of all parties should face these issues square on and insist on the primacy of democratically-determined human rights-compliant law. 'Laws determined by Parliament should prevail over centuries-old theocratic laws. We should have One Law for All, not allowing any law to operate which disadvantages any sections of the community.' Nicholas Fluck, president of the Law Society, said in a statement: 'This practice note provides guidance to solicitors dealing with clients where Sharia succession rules may be relevant. 'This is the first time such advice has been published and we hope it will assist solicitors with Sharia probate matters. 'There is a wide variety of spiritual, religious and cultural beliefs within our population, and the Law Society wants to support its members so they can help clients from all backgrounds. 'We hope this guidance will help solicitors assist their clients and go some way to forming an idea of good practice when it comes to applying Sharia succession rules within the legal profession.' But Baroness Cox, who campaigns against religious discrimination against women, said the guidance was a worrying development. She told the Sunday Telegraph: 'This violates everything we stand for. It would make the Suffragettes turn in their graves.' In the past she has spoken out about the growth of 'Islamic courts' resolving disputes. She said: 'No longer do we have a single legal code in our society. 'Instead, alongside our own law, there is now effectively a parallel quasi-legal system operating within some Muslim communities. 'Sharia law, imported from theocracies like Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, first began to be used here in a strictly limited form, dealing mainly with narrow issues like Islamic financial contracts. 'But as the Muslim population has grown and the pervasive creed of multiculturalism has become ever more powerful, so Sharia law has rapidly grown in influence within some communities. 'There are now estimated to be no fewer than 85 Sharia courts across the country — from London and Manchester to Bradford and Nuneaton. They operate mainly from mosques, settling financial and family disputes according to religious principles.'","The guidelines on wills could mean women are denied an equal inheritance .

"Warning: Former foreign office minister Kim Howells said that the upcoming NATO summit in Britain could be targeted by IS terrorists . Home grown Islamic State terrorists could be plotting a 'spectacular' attack on the upcoming Nato summit in Britain, a former foreign office minister has said. Kim Howells, who served under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, fears jihadists may be planning to attack  Barack Obama, David Cameron and other world leaders when they meet  in Wales on September 4 and 5. Security barriers and fences to stop car bombs have been put up around the Celtic Manor resort where meetings will be held and also in the centre of Cardiff where leaders will spend an evening. Dr Howells warned that there was 'no question' terrorist organisations would be planning an atrocity but admitted there was no 'general intelligence' an attack was imminent. He said: 'It will be a target, there is no question about it, that is why the security measures taken are so intense. 'With a Nato summit there is going to be a raised expectation or raised awareness that there might be an attack - that is why all the special measures have been taken. 'They might try and coordinate something with the Nato summit targeting somewhere there are a lot of infidels, as they see them. 'Like their predecessors Al Qaeda they like mounting spectaculars so I would imagine the work of the security services is pretty intense now.' Dr Howells said an 'added element' of the security risk is that three Cardiff men have fled to Syria to fight with IS, also known as ISIS and ISIL, and are believed to have joined the terrorist organisation. Terror suspects Nasser Muthana, Aseel Muthana and Reyaad Khan have detailed knowledge of the Welsh capital where the world leaders will be attending a lavish dinner. Ring of steel: The perimeter of Celtic Manor in South Wales has been surrounded with fencing to prevent attacks . Major event: The Celtic Manor Resort, outside Newport, south Wales, will host the 2014 NATO Summit in September 4 and 5 . Dr Howells claimed Islamic State could target the summit which is taking place in Newport and Cardiff at the start of September. The former Labour MP for Pontypridd, South Wales, said terrorists may also be planning something similar to the 7/7 bombings in London. Falklands hero Simon Weston, who lives in Cardiff, echoed the warnings. He said: 'We've got these youngsters from Cardiff who have gone to join the Islamic movement. 'That means they would not have been acting on their own at this end. There are others who have similar points of view. 'We run a real risk of something happening.' 'Everyone knows how difficult it is to get to the people they want to affect. 'But we have got to be right 100 per cent of the time. They have only got to be right once.That's the big difficulty for us.' Assistant Chief Constable Chris Armitt - the Merseyside police officer overseeing security at the gathering - warned Isis were a 'very real threat.'","Dr Kim Howells believes home grown terrorists could target world leaders .

"A mother-of-three was unable to recognise her daughters after being placed in a coma as her body fought toxic shock syndrome, caused by a tampon. Joanna Cartwright, from Doncaster in South Yorkshire, thought she was suffering a bout of flu when she fell ill. But three days later, slipping in and out of consciousness, she was rushed to hospital. There doctors told her family she was just hours from death, her internal organs were beginning to fail. Eight layers of her skin had peeled off, her hands had swollen, she had lost 50 per cent of her hair and all her nails had fallen off. Doctors placed the 27-year-old in a medically induced coma as her body battled the bacteria invading her bloodstream. Scroll down for video . Joanna Cartwright, 27, from Doncaster, was placed in a medically induced coma after she was rushed to hospital suffering toxic shock syndrome from a tampon. The condition caused her internal organs to begin shutting down, eight layers of skin to peel off and 50 per cent of her hair to fall out . When she woke eight days later medics explained the TSS, which had been caused by a tampon, had caused Ms Cartwright to suffer meningitis as well. Looking at pictures of her daughters, Lacey, eight, Nicole, seven and three-year-old Scarlett-Rose, Ms Cartwright drew a blank. But the mother-of-three has now overcome her ordeal, re-learning to walk after intense physiotherapy. She said: 'When I woke up from the coma I didn't know what was going on - I couldn't remember anything. 'Someone had put pictures up of my children but I didn't know who they were. 'People were pointing at the girls and asking me to name them, but I didn't know. 'I knew I recognised them but I just couldn't place them. 'I was put in the coma on my 25th birthday so when I woke up I was surrounded by birthday cards. 'A nurse was reading the cards out to me but I didn't know any of the names - I didn't even realise it had been my birthday. 'All I really knew was that I was very poorly, and I thought I was going to die.' Ms Cartwright first fell ill with what she thought was flu. But when she started struggling to breathe and drifted in and out of consciousness, her mother and partner, Steven, 28, rushed her to hospital. They were told by medics the then 24-year-old was just hours from death. When she woke after eight days in a coma, Ms Cartwright was unable to recognise her three daughters Lacey, eight, Nicole, seven and three-year-old Scarlett-Rose, pictured with their mother, left . Toxic shock syndrome is a highly dangerous bacterial infection - but it can be misdiagnosed, because the symptoms are the same as other illnesses and because it is so rare. It occurs when usually harmless Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bacteria, which live on the skin, invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins. Symptoms usually begin with a sudden high fever, with a temperature above 38.9C/102F. Within a few hours a sufferer will develop flu-like symptoms including headache, muscle aches, a sore throat and cough. Nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, feeling faint, dizziness and confusion are also symptoms. A widespread sunburn-like rash can also appear, while the whites of the eyes, lips and tongue can appear more red than usual. After the rash appears, it is common for the skin to begin to shed in large sheets, especially from the hands and soles of the feet. Women . are most at risk of getting toxic shock syndrome during menstruation . and particularly if they are using tampons, have recently given birth, . or are using an internal barrier contraceptive such as a diaphragm. 'The last thing I remember is being in the car racing towards the hospital,' Ms Cartwright said. 'My internal organs were shutting down so I was put on life support, and put into a medically induced coma. 'My hands had swollen, about eight layers of skin peeled of, I lost about 50 per cent of my hair, and all my nails fell off - I must have looked horrendous.' Eight days later, when she woke from her coma, Ms Cartwright's memory was blank. Doctors told her the TSS, which had been caused by a tampon, had caused her to suffer meningitis. She said: 'It's very strange to wake up and not know who you are or where you are. 'I tried to speak but by the time I'd got to the end of a sentence I couldn't remember why I'd started it. 'Even now people will mention things to me - something I've done, or somewhere I went - and I don't know what they're talking about. 'I was so confused and disorientated - I even thought my brother was my boyfriend. 'I ended up discharging myself because I felt so unsure of everything. 'It wasn't until two days later when I called the doctors for a follow up that they told me I had suffered from toxic shock syndrome along with meningococcal septicaemia. Ms Cartwright's memory slowly began to return, and she had to relearn how to walk during intense physiotherapy appointments. Pictured right, her eldest daughters Lacey and Nicole . 'I just couldn't believe it - I hadn't done anything different from what I usually do every other month.' Ms Cartwright's recovery has been a long and slow process. Gradually her memory started to return, but today she still struggles to recall some parts of her past. She said: 'Even now there are big gaps in my memory. 'I don't remember Scarlett's first steps, or a lot of her milestones such as talking and weaning. 'It makes me sad as they are big parts of her life that I now feel like I've missed out on. 'I can look through photo albums and see pictures of holidays that I have no idea even happened. 'It's very weird to think that I've had all these experiences that I can't remember.' She added: 'Getting over everything was very difficult, and it's taken about two years altogether. 'My Dad had to move in with me to look after me as I couldn't look after myself. 'I had to have intense physio as I had to learn to walk again, and it took ages for my hair to grow back. 'It's been a really traumatic experience and I know there are parts of me that will never be the same again. 'But I'm just relieved that I made it through and my girls have still got their mum - I count myself very lucky.'","Joanna Cartwright woke from a coma unable to recognise her family .

"A coroner has cleared an expedition company of neglect over its responsibility to protect an Eton schoolboy who was mauled to death by a polar bear. Horatio Chapple, 17, was on an adventure holiday to the remote Svalbard islands, north of Norway, in August 2011 with the British Schools Exploring Society (BSES) when he was fatally attacked by the ‘aggressive’ animal. Following a week-long inquest into his death, Ian Singleton, assistant coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, today cleared the expedition company of any wrongdoing. Horatio Chapple, 17, was mauled to death by a polar bear on a trip to the Arctic Circle in August 2011. Right, the corpse of the polar bear, which behaved 'unusually and aggressively' because it had severe tooth pain . He told the hearing in Salisbury that although the group were missing items of equipment including parts of the tripwire alert system, BSES had not acted with ‘neglect’. He said: ‘I do not find that neglect is appropriate to be considered, as failure (by BSES) was not total or complete.’ Mr Chapple, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, was sleeping in his tent when the bear went on the rampage, inflicting fatal injuries to his head and upper body on August 5 2011. Four others were hurt before the bear was shot dead at the camp site, where the group - known as Chanzin Fire - had been staying. Also injured during the incident were trip leader Michael 'Spike' Reid, from Plymouth, Devon, Andrew Ruck, from Brighton, Patrick Flinders, from Jersey, and Scott Bennell-Smith, from St Mellion in Cornwall. In his narrative verdict, Mr Singleton said: ‘On the 5th August 2011, Horatio Chapple was in a tent on a snow bridge near to the Von Post Glacier in Svalbard, Norway, as part of an expedition. ‘A polar bear was able to enter the camp shortly before 7.30am undetected as the tripwire alarm system around the perimeter of the camp had failed to activate due to a supporting post more likely than not being knocked over by the bear which caused the cartridge to move or fall out of the mine without it detonating. ‘Horatio emerged from his tent and was in the act of standing up when the bear reared up and slammed down on him with its paws pushing Horatio to the ground where the bear then mauled his head, face and neck causing the injury which lead to his death. The inquest into Mr Chapple's death heard how the polar bear (pictured after it was shot) attacked the camp . The camp site where Horatio Chapple was mauled to death. Witness Matthew Burke said: 'The bear reared up and then slammed itself down on to Horatio' ‘At the time of the attack the polar bear . was 24 years of age, hungry and in pain from bad teeth which more . likely than not made it more aggressive and unpredictable.’ The inquest heard that the tripwire system provided by BSES worked ‘inconsistently’ and had missing parts meaning it had to be set up in triangle shapes rather than the expected larger rectangles. It also heard how group members had modified the triggering mechanism using paper clips. The inquest was told that the group members were expected to be kitted out with pen flares to scare off a bear but there were insufficient available and were only distributed with the group leaders. The hearing was also told that Mr Reid attempted to shoot the bear with the group’s Mauser 98K but his first attempts were unsuccessful because of the safety catch mechanism which ejected the rounds rather than fired them. Mr Reid was praised for managing to shoot the bear after reloading the rifle after he himself had been attacked and seriously injured. In his ruling Mr Singleton said that he believed the modifications made to the tripwire had improved the system. He said: ‘I find it more likely than not the tripwire system was improved following the modifications. ‘I find, having the benefit of hearing from both the leaders and members of the Fire, it’s more likely than not they had been tested successfully.’ He added that a tripwire system was not ‘100% foolproof’ and said he believed the bear had hit one of the posts causing a loss of tension leading to the mines failing to fire. He said: ‘On balance of probabilities I find that the corner post had been knocked down by the polar bear on entering the camp as the remaining two posts were still upright.’ Expedition leader Michael Reid, 31, (left) fought off the polar bear that killed 17-year-old Horatio Chapple (right) Mr Singleton said that the use of a tripwire system instead of a bear watch was compliant with Norwegian law. He also ruled that the distribution of pen flares to the group members could not have helped Mr Chapple as they were not designed for use in close range and would have taken 20 seconds or more to assemble. He also said that they would not have been usable in the circumstances. Mr Singleton ruled that Mr Chapple had received fatal injuries immediately from his contact with the bear and Mr Reid could not have saved his life even if he had managed to fire the rifle on his first attempt. He also ruled that the rifle was probably in the safety catch position when Mr Reid first tried to fire it. The coroner described how a post-mortem examination of the bear found it was and had worn-down teeth which could have led to it being ‘stressed, aggressive and more unpredictable’ than a younger bear. He said: ‘I find that on balance of predictability that the behaviour of the bear was more aggressive and unpredictable than the majority of younger bears that were encountered in Svalbard.’ Mr Singleton adjourned the hearing . last Friday after listening to legal submissions, including from Lizanne . Gumbel QC who was representing the Chapple family. The Etonian schoolboy was described as 'a fine young gentleman with amazing potential' Ms Gumbel, in submissions, told the coroner that Mr Chapple’s parents, Olivia and David, wished him to consider the issue of ‘neglect’ in his conclusion. The couple, as well as Mr Chapple’s grandfather, Field Marshal Sir John Chapple - former Army Chief of the General Staff and president of the BSES - attended all of the week-long inquest. During the inquest, Ms Gumbel criticised BSES for providing ‘unsafe’ equipment, particularly the tripwire system which she said was designed to protect chickens from foxes, not a campsite from a polar bear. She said: ‘The fact that this child Horatio was in a campsite which was not protected was down to the society (BSES). ‘The equipment that was sent out was not the suitable type of equipment in the first place.’ In an independent report into the bear attack by High Court judge Sir David Steel, commissioned by BSES, he criticised the society for its reliance on the tripwire system. He said that a bear watch should be used instead and also called for an overhaul of rifle training. Sir David concluded: ‘In future a bear watch must become the norm for expeditions to Svalbard. There needs to be complete review of available tripwire systems but they should be treated only as a secondary protection device. There needs to be a rigorous upgrade of rifle training.’ Mr Singleton said that he would not be preparing his own list of recommendations as he believed Sir David's suggestions and BSES' implementation of them was sufficient. He said: ‘I do not believe it is necessary for me to make such a report on this occasion.’ Lieutenant General Peter Pearson, from Earlswood, Chepstow, Monmouthshire, who is executive director of the BSES, said the organisation had adopted all of the recommendations made by Sir David in his report. He added that he had accepted that the equipment was unsatisfactory and explained that the BSES was working with a company to build a new system which was being trialled in Greenland. Mr Pearson said: ‘In principle, we have accepted in the future it will be safer if there is a wire and a bear watch.’ ‘This is not a fly-by-night organisation, we tasked a High Court judge to carry out an independent inquiry which was not required, we are absolutely an open book.’","Horatio Chapple, 17, was fatally attacked by the polar bear as he slept in tent .

"A man who wore a T-shirt with offensive comments about the murders of Pc Fiona Bone and Pc Nicola Hughes on it just hours after they died has been sentenced to eight months in prison. Barry Thew, 39, who has a lengthy criminal record, wore a T-shirt with ‘One less pig: Perfect justice’ hand-written on it the same day the two women police officers were gunned down. Thew, of Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, admitted a Section 4A Public Order Offence (displaying writing or other visible representation with intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress) and was sentenced at Minshull Street Crown Court today. Offensive: Thew in the hand-written T-shirt, which reads 'One less pig. Perfect justice'. He was arrested in Radcliffe town centre . Raw: Just hours after the death of the two officers, Thew wore this T-Shirt saying 'Kill a cop for fun.co.uk. Ha, haaa' in the town centre. He will serve eight months in prison . He was jailed for four months and ordered to serve another four months, consecutively, after he . admitted breaching a suspended sentence order imposed for an earlier . offence of cannabis production. The sentence, at Manchester's Minshull Street Crown Court, means he was jailed for a total of eight months. He will likely serve only half of that in custody. At about 2.15pm on Tuesday 18 September, less than three-and-a-half hours after police officers Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone were shot dead, Thew was seen wearing the offensive T-shirt in Radcliffe town centre. He was arrested and taken into custody. Thew, who has 29 sets of previous convictions for 77 offences since 1983, appeared shaken as he was led away from the dock to serve his sentence. Judge Peter Lakin delivered long and damning sentencing remarks. He said the deaths of Pc Bone and Pc Hughes had left their families distraught and caused upset to 'every level' of Greater Manchester Police and to the public as a whole. He said: 'This, on any view, is a shocking case. Your response to the shocking events was to parade around in a T-shirt in the centre of Radcliffe which had on it the most disgusting of slogans. 'In my judgement, it is utterly depressing that you felt able to stoop so low as to behave in that way. 'Your mindless behaviour has added to the pain of everyone touched by the death of these young officers. You have shown no remorse.' Heroic: The coffin of police Constable Fiona Bone is carried into Manchester Cathedral after processing along the city's Deansgate lined with police officers and members of the public . The court heard Thew, from Radcliffe, said 'not bothered' when he was arrested after reports from outraged members of the public. Judge Lakin added: 'It is aggravated by the fact that at the time you were made the subject of a suspended sentence. You are a man with a lengthy antecedent record. 'Whatever thoughts you may have about the police, or whatever personal animosity, gave you no excuse to behave in the way that you did. 'I hope that this sentence gives you time to reflect on the appalling way in which you behaved.' The judge, who viewed photographs of the T-shirt, later ordered that it should be destroyed. Stuart Duke, defending, said Thew had been an in-patient at a mental health unit and was still in prescription of anti-psychotic medicine, but Judge Lakin said his mental health was 'not a contributing factor'. Mr Duke said Thew has a long-standing dispute with Greater Manchester Police over the death of his son three years ago and repeated 'stop and search' procedures. He said: 'The wearing of this T-shirt was not in response to the deaths of the two police officers but it was another case. 'It is an on-going dispute between Mr Thew and Greater Manchester Police. He feels victimised and picked on. 'He did not go home when he heard the news. He was already wearing the T-shirt. He accepts that he is guilty by reason of his plea.' Inspector Bryn Williams, of the . Radcliffe Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: 'While officers on the . ground were just learning of and trying to come to terms with the . devastating news that two colleagues had been murdered, Thew thought . nothing of going out in public with a t-shirt daubed with appalling . hand-written comments on.' Brave: PC Fiona Bone, 32, and PC Nicola Hughes (right), 26, were shot and killed in Hattersley on September 18 . He added: 'Thankfully the overwhelming response from the public - who have inundated us with messages of support and condolence - prove that Thew is the exception and not the rule and our communities were right behind us at our darkest hour. 'To mock or joke about the tragic events of that morning is morally reprehensible and Thew has rightly been convicted and sentenced for his actions. PCs Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, were killed on duty in a gun and grenade attack after they responded to a routine call about reports of a burglary at an address in Abbey Gardens.

"Police arrested a 35-year-old Tennessee woman on charges she falsely claimed to have cancer to raise money. Kristen Hines, of Clarksville, forged signatures of doctors at the Gateway-Vanderbilt Cancer Treatment Center to use as proof of a diagnosis and treatment, according to an arrest warrant. She then posted the forged documents on a Facebook page advertising her needs as a cancer patient. Kristen Hines, seen her in jail photos showing her trying to come off as someone who's undergone cancer treatment, managed to raise more than $200 million by tricking people into thinking she was a survivor . On her Facebook page, Hines had pictures of herself with a shaved head and comments from numerous supporters wanting to donate to her cancer treatments. Hines held a benefit in mid-August at the Warehouse Bar and Grill, the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle reported. She managed to collect more than $200. Another benefit for this month was already in the works but was canceled after Hines' arrest. The Chickin 'n' Pickin Cancer Benefit hosted by the Montgomery County Conservation club was planned for September 27. Hines - also known as Kristen Rhonda Bible - already had a lengthy criminal history, with 21 counts of forgery, two counts of identity theft and one count of theft over $10,000 in early July . Tickets could be purchased in advanced or at the door for the event. Food, drinks and live music were to be offered. Police say they stumbled upon Hines' scam after one of the doctors whose signature was forged on her documents contacted them. The cancer center employees became of aware of the cancer scam after people began calling their office asking to make donations to a Hines account that never existed. The doctor who contacted police confirmed she was never a patient at the center.

"It has long been thought of as an ode to the young daughter of late U.S. president John F. Kennedy. But now, Neil Diamond has revealed the true inspiration behind his 1969 song 'Sweet Caroline'. The 73-year-old star, who rose to fame in the sixties, said the soft rock track was a love song for his then-wife Marcia Murphey - but he needed a three-syllable name for the chorus. Scroll down for videos . Former couple: Neil Diamond has revealed 'Sweet Caroline' was a love song for his then-wife Marcia Murphey - but he needed a three-syllable name for the chorus. Above, the singer is seen with Miss Murphey in 1975 . Singer-songwriter: Diamond (pictured) explained: 'The song was about my wife at the time - her name was Marcia - and I couldn't get a ""Marcia"" rhyme. Sweet Caroline - yes! That was it. And that's what it's been' Speaking to Today, he explained he knew of Caroline Kennedy, then aged 11, at the time, but said: 'I was writing a song in Memphis, Tennessee, for a session. I needed a three-syllable name. 'The song was about my wife at the time - her name was Marcia - and I couldn't get a ""Marcia"" rhyme. Sweet Caroline - yes! That was it. And that's what it's been.' However, Diamond, who has sold over 125 million records globally, did not take back his previous comments that the young Miss Kennedy was at least partly influential toward the song. In 2007, the singer-songwriter revealed he was a struggling musician in the sixties when an 'innocent, wonderful' photo of the president's daughter in a magazine caught his eye. Popular: Diamond, who has sold over 125 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists, released 'Sweet Caroline' in September 1969 as a single. It has since become a staple track . Family: 'Sweet Caroline' has long been thought of as an ode to the young daughter of late U.S. president John F. Kennedy. Above, Kennedy is pictured with his wife Jacqueline, son John and daughter Caroline . Where it began, I can't begin to know it, But then I know it's growing strong, Was in the spring, And spring became a summer, Who'd believe you'd come along . Hands, Touching hands, Reaching out, Touching me, Touching you . Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, I've been inclined, To believe they never would, But now I... ...look at the night, And it don't seem so lonely, We fill it up with only two, And when I hurt, Hurting runs off my shoulders, How can I hurt when holding you? Warm, Touching warm, Reaching out, Touching me, Touching you . Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, I've been inclined, To believe they never would, Oh, no, no . Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, Sweet Caroline, I believe they never could, Sweet Caroline, Good times never seemed so good, Sweet Caroline... 'It was a picture of a little girl dressed to the nines in her riding gear, next to her pony,' he said at the time. 'It was such an innocent, wonderful picture, I immediately felt there was a song in there.' Years later, holed up in a Memphis hotel, Diamond reportedly wrote the words and music to 'Sweet Caroline' in less an hour, before releasing it on September 16, 1969, as a single. It has since become a staple track - particularly at sporting events - and had sold a staggering 1,745,000 digital downloads as of April 2013. In 2007, Diamond, who was born in Brooklyn, New York, performed the song to Miss Kennedy at her 50th birthday celebrations. And last year, he announced that he would donate all royalties since the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013, to One Fund Boston to help those most affected by the attacks. The singer appeared on the TV show to promote his first album release in six years, 'Melody Road', which was launched on October 21 by Capitol Records and is his 32nd studio album to date. 'I was a nervous wreck going into this new album,' Diamond said. 'I had 40 or almost 50 years of songwriting to match up to.'

"Laura Spalding, 27, was left speechless when she spotted 'Will You Marry Me' written in the grass during a 45-minute glider flight at her local airfield. Ian Rawling gave his girlfriend the flying lesson as a birthday treat but had secretly planned to surprise her by popping the question. The 46-year-old had spent several weeks secretly designing and making the letters in his living room using 80 metres of wallpaper and string. Scroll down for video . Ian Rawling proposed to his girlfriend Laura Spalding during a gliding lesson at their local flying centre . Despite her tearful reaction, Laura ran over to Ian after landing the aircraft and said 'yes'. The proposal was captured on film after Ian's friends at The Gliding Centre in Husbands Bosworth, Leics, helped him plan his surprise last Sunday. Yesterday, Laura, a physiotherapist, said: 'On my birthday, Ian took me out in the car and we drove past the gliding club. 'When he turned in I thought that was a great idea for a present as I love action things like that. 'I'd done a sky dive but never had a chance to get in a glider despite the fact I live so close to the centre. 'I went up for what was meant to be a half hour trip and I think I noticed that it seemed to be going on longer, but I just thought that was something to do with it being my birthday. 'Rob the pilot kept radioing in and they said the runway was busy and I just thought nothing of it. 'I thought that he may propose when we went away in a few weeks, but I never expected this. 'When Rob got the call that the runway was clear he flew back but then banked the plane around and I could see something on the ground. Ian popped the question by spelling out the words, 'Laura Will You Marry Me' using giant white letters (right) on the grass of their local flying centre as she flew overhead in a glider . 'When I saw the words 'Will you marry me', I couldn't believe it. I was so shocked I burst into tears and think I swore a lot. 'I couldn't believe he had done something like that, I was in complete and utter shock and I was actually quite emotional. 'When we landed again Ian was waiting and he gave me this beautiful ring. Laura has revealed she burst into tears after spotting the proposal while flying above the flying centre during a gliding lesson . 'Of course I said yes. It was a wonderful day and something I will never forget.' The couple, who have been together for two years after meeting on an online dating website, plan to get married next year. Computer programmer Ian revealed his plan almost turned to disaster when had to pin the letters down with knives and forks after running out of tent pegs. Ian, from Northamptonshire, said: 'I really don't know where I came up with the idea, I guessed that she would think on her birthday was a really obvious place time to do it. 'I knew she liked the idea of gliding so I booked the lesson and spoke to the club about my plans. Ian was pleased when he saw Laura's on the in-flight video recording after admitting she wasn;t an easy woman to surprise . 'They were really helpful, it was even there idea to put the cameras on. 'I then had to make the letters in my living room one at a time. 'On the day Laura went up and the club lent me a guy to help, and we set about putting the letters up. 'But when we were about two thirds done I ran out of tent pegs so we had to find something else to use. 'Eventually we got to the canteen and found knives and forks we could use.

"There are currently 1,400 potentially hazardous asteroids that could pass close to Earth, according to latest data revealed by Nasa. An image mapping the orbits of all the potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) provides a graphic of the crowded cosmic activity. These asteroids are considered hazardous because they are fairly large - at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size. This graphic shows the orbits of all the known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs), numbering over 1,400 as of early 2013. These are the asteroids considered hazardous because they are fairly large (at least 460 feet or 140 meters in size), and because they follow orbits that pass close to the Earth's orbit . They are classified as PHAs because they follow orbits that are considered to pass close to the Earth's, at  or 7.5 million kilometres. However, Nasa claims that being classified as a PHA does not mean that an asteroid will impact the Earth. Scientists there claim that none of the asteroids shown in the image are considered a threat over the next 100 years. The group is planning to continue to track these asteroids so that their orbits can be refined and more precise predictions made of their future close approaches and impact probabilities. The dots represent a snapshot of the population of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs). Positions of a simulated population of PHAs on a typical day are shown in bright orange, and the simulated NEAs are blue. Earth's orbit is green . As part of this effort it is working on the development of an infrared sensor that could improve its asteroid tracking capabilities, dubbed the Near Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) sensor. The NEOCam space mission will also search for the most favourable destinations for future exploration by humans or robotic missions. Asteroids reflect visible light. This means that when searching for near-Earth objects with optical telescopes, the data collected can be deceiving. Depending on how reflective the object is, a small, light-coloured space rock can look the same as a big, dark one. Asteroids do, however, always emit infrared radiation. This image shows the differences between orbits of a typical near-Earth asteroid (blue) and a potentially hazardous asteroid, or PHA (orange). PHAs are a subset of the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). They have the closest orbits to Earth's orbit, coming within 5 million miles . ‘When you observe a space rock with infrared, you are seeing its thermal emissions, which can better define the asteroid's size as well as tell you something about composition,’ said Amy Mainzer, an author on the paper and principal investigator for NASA's NEOWISE and NEOCam missions. Asteroids emit most of their radiation at infrared wavelengths near about 10 microns (0.0004 inches), which humans perceive as heat. There is also relatively less radiation from stars and galaxies at these wavelengths, which simplifies detection of faint moving objects. Once launched, the space-based telescope would be positioned at a location about four times the distance between Earth and the moon. From this lofty perch, NEOCam could observe the comings and goings of near Earth objects, including PHAs, without the impediments such as cloud cover and daylight. The Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) is a mission proposed to NASA to find potentially hazardous asteroids. The mission will use a new sensor, called the NEOCam chip, that has more pixels and better sensitivity than previous generations of infrared sensors .","These asteroids are classified as 'hazardous' because they are at least 140 meters in size and could come within 4.7 million miles of Earth's orbit .

"The independent NHS ombudsman is accused of failing countless families who have complained, such as the parents of Sam Morrish, three, who died due to multiple health service failings . Patients who complain to the NHS watchdog in charge of care are wasting their time, a charity warned today. The Patients Association, a lobby group that aims to improve patients' experience of health care, has declared it has 'no confidence' in the independent NHS ombudsman. Its role is to investigate complaints over unfair treatment and  poor service that individuals have received from the NHS in England. Today, the Patients Association released a report into what it claims were failures by the Parliamentary Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO). It is accused of failing to handle complaints of poor care by families, who they say have been 'let down'. The PHSO, the last resort for those complaining about unfair or poor service from the NHS in England, is undergoing a modernisation scheme. Last month it revealed it had investigated 2,199 cases in 2013/14 - six times more than the previous year. But Patients Association deputy chief executive Jacqueline Coles, writing in the report, said it had 'failed to adapt' to modern demands. As a result, it will no longer be referring callers on the charity's helpline to the watchdog. She said: 'For many years we have advised people who contact our national helpline to go to the PHSO when they have received an unsatisfactory response from their local health service providers.' 'Sadly we can no longer recommend this course of action to patients, as we have no confidence in the PHSO to carry out an independent, fair, open, honest and robust investigation. 'It leaves the victims and families seeking help regarding health concerns cold, alone and frozen out. The PHSO fails them on a regular basis.' The report cites the case of Sam Morrish, who died in 2010 from a treatable condition due to multiple health service failings. The three-year-old died 36 hours after his parents first sought medical help for suspected flu and a chest infection. In that crucial period, they say they experienced a series of shocking blunders from doctors, NHS Direct, an out-of-hours GP service and a hospital. The mistakes were compounded when the grieving couple asked the NHS to investigate the events leading to Sam’s death from septic shock to prevent future tragedies. Two initial investigations failed to identify key problems, and Scott and Susanna Morrish said they were forced to relive ‘the life-shattering death’ of their child to get officials to finally act. In March 2012 the couple complained to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman (PHSO), the highest authority on NHS complaints. But they said officials failed to understand information about the case. The couple said they persevered in a bid to improve the health service for other patients, including their other sons, now aged nine and two. The role of the NHS Ombudsman is to investigate complaints over unfair treatment and poor service that patients have received from the NHS in England . But they later said they felt 'failed' by the complaints process after it took four years for the PHSO to publish its findings. The Patients Association said Sam’s death exposed ‘catastrophic and systemic’ failings in care and in how the NHS handles complaints. Chief executive Katherine Murphy said: Our experience of the PHSO has been painful. 'The family wanted organisations to learn so that this would not happen again, but the ombudsman did not want to interview anyone about what went wrong. 'The PHSO is the body which is supposed to hold the NHS to account and set benchmarks but there seems to be a lack of accountability for its own actions. 'The Patients Association helpline has advised hundreds of people to contact the ombudsman but time and time again people have come back to us saying the PHSO has told them there’s nothing more they can do. 'At this point in time I would not advise anyone who came to our helpline to contact the PHSO, because I have no confidence in it. A senior executive within the PHSO told Mr Morrish and I the methodology used in their investigation into our complaints was not fit for purpose. 'It’s time that this organisation was subjected to greater scrutiny. It costs billions at a time when the NHS is struggling. If that money was invested in frontline staff we would have a very different NHS.' The Patients Association report recommends an overhaul of the ombudsman to improve investigation timescales, contact with patients and a code of practice. A PHSO spokesman told the BBC: 'We have embarked on a radical modernisation drive which includes listening to feedback from users. 'We are delighted that the Patients Association has agreed to help us draw up a service charter, which will be a set of promises to users about what they can expect when they use our service.'","Patients Association has condemned the independent NHS ombudsman .

"September marks 15 years since graduates Larry Page and Sergey Brin set up a small web crawler from a garage in Silicon Valley, which went onto become the world's biggest search engine. The site was originally called BackRub, but was changed in 1997 to Google - a misspelling of the word googol which is a term for the number one followed by one hundred zeros. There is a little confusion around when Google's official birthday is, but reports claim papers to incorporate the company were filed on September 4 1998. The company became incorporated three days later and the domain was registered on September 15. A screenshot from the beta version of Google: September marks the 15th anniversary of when Google was first incorporated by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. The company started from a garage in Silicon Valley in 1998 and is now the world's largest search engine -with more than 13 billion searches a month . Google has teamed up with . Nestle to launch the next version of its Android operating system, called Android 4.4 KitKat. It follows the release of other sweet-themed software names including such . as Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Android Jelly Bean. There had been speculation that the latest version would be named Android Key Lime Pie because each release begins with the letter of the alphabet that follows the previous. To mark the announcement, the KitKat homepage has been redesigned as a parody of Google software releases. The release of Android KitKat will be marked with a competition to win . prizes including 1,000 Google Nexus 7 tablets through more than 50 . million specially-branded KitKat bars. Consumers can take part by buying special packs of KitKat four-finger . and KitKat Chunky multipacks available in Sainsbury's, Morrisons, Asda . and Tesco. Google, however, now officially celebrates the event with a Google Doodle on September 27. It is thought this date was changed as an attempt to gain media coverage several years ago, at a time when Yahoo was gaining ground on Google. The site is now the world's number one search engine and its name has become so synonymous with searching, it is now used as a verb in its . own right. Despite its humble beginnings in a rented garage that belonged to Susan Wojcicki - Brin's now sister-in-law - the company now has more than 70 offices in more than 40 global locations, including London, with their headquarters - known as the Googleplex - in Mountain View, California. Its size and reputation grew rapidly in the first few years, with three billion web documents on Google's index by December 2001. Innovations subsequently launched by Google that have become part of everyday life include Google Maps, Google Streetview and Google Earth, each showing how far the company now spans across the globe. Its Android operating system is also the most popular mobile software in the world and it has teamed up with manufacturers including Asus and LG to launch a number of best-selling devices such as the Nexus 4 smartphone and Nexus 7 tablet. Google also bought Motorola in 2011 and a new Moto X handset is expected towards the end of this year. Looking to the future, Google Glass is one of the internet giant's latest products, aiming to offer voice-activated hands-free connectivity through a wearable device. Plus, Google has designed a range of self-driving cars that use sensors and mapping technology to travel around cities without a driver. Industry experts have praised Google for its success, however, some have questioned how long it can stay at the top. Joseph Lampel, professor of strategy at Cass Business School, City University London, said Google had to continue to innovate to make sure they stay ahead of the curve to survive the next 15 years. Professor Lampel said: 'I am not surprised they have survived this far but if you're asking if they will survive until they are 25 or 30, that's another question.' Google's Android operating system is now the most popular mobile software in the world. A screenshot of an early version, called Android 2.2 Froyo is pictured left. The most recent release, Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, is shown in the right-hand image . He said there was increasing competition from search engines from emerging markets, especially those in Asia, and added: 'Google might not be able to maintain their level of dominance, if the industry opens up to competitors. 'The question also arises of the very function of Google. The search engine business will shift in the next decade into new technology and new devices.' Professor Lampel attributed Google's success to its speed in adding services to their search engine and their push into hardware with products like Google Glass. 'All in all, they have done very well, and they have had an enormous influence, without question,' he said. Colin Cieszynski, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'It's really incredible when you think about whatGoogle has done over this period of time.

'They've taken a lead in the second wave of success of the internet, becoming the premier company. It's like there was a shake-up, and they're the ones who ended up on top. 'Yahoo has struggled along, but lots of others have fallen by the wayside. They have continued to innovate. The question is, how long do you manage to stay on top of everyone else? 'But this anniversary is incredible for them - they're still on top. To dominate for so long is amazing.' Despite the milestone date being reached, Google may not be marking the event until later in the month - having put out last year's Google Doodle to celebrate their 14th anniversary on September 27. A Google spokeswoman would not be drawn on whether users could expect any birthday surprises during September. Last year, a Google Doodle showed a birthday cake with 14 candles, which had slices removed until the name of the search engine emerged. Google traditionally marks its birthday with a Google Doodle such as this one that was unveiled to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Up to 2005, the birthday Doodle was unveiled on September 7 but since that date Google now releases it on September 27 . Google Doodles can also be used to mark major milestones in history, as well as birthdays. This Doodle from August 28 this year marked the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King's famous speech . The first Google Doodle, which is when the Google logo is altered on the site's homepage in celebration of a particular event, was in 1998 to mark the Burning Man festival. In May 2012, Google unveiled its first interactive Google Doodle to celerate the 30th anniversary of the arcade game Pac-Man, in association with Namco. Searchers play Pac-Man within their browser by clicking the 'Insert Coin' button. When players pressed this button a second time, a second player would join the game as Ms. Pac-Man. The game was so popular, Google made it a permanent site after the Doodle had been removed. Later the same year, Google unveiled its first animated Google Doodle to mark John Lennon's 70th birthday with a short clip of his song 'Imagine'. A similar Doodle was launched, using a clip of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' song, to mark Freddie Mercury's 65th birthday in September 2011. The image, tweeted by Idealabs found Bill Gross shows what Google's self-driving car sees as it turns left. Gross claims the cars collect 1GB of data every second.

"Grimsby Town are hoping to become the first club in the country to use a safe-standing area. The Conference side's Blundell Park home has been all-seater since 1995. Grimsby want to install rail seats, similar to those used in Germany and Austria, which can be unlocked or locked for either seating or standing in the Pontoon Stand. All-seater stadiums have been compulsory in the Championship and Premier League since an inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Grimsby's Blundell Park is in line to become the first stadium in England to be granted a safe-standing area . However, standing is permitted in League One, League Two and below. Bristol City displayed a section of rail seats at Ashton Gate last year but they have since been removed because of their ongoing stadium redevelopment. 'This move is in response to the effort the young fans have made to try to improve the atmosphere of late,"" said stadium manager Nick Dale. 'It's also about trying to embrace modern ways of supporting football clubs and we are responding to a fans' survey carried out by the Mariners Trust, which showed there is an overwhelming desire to see us return to some terraced areas.' Bristol City trialled a safe-standing area but they were removed once the stadium began redevelopment . Spokesman for the Mariners Trust, Dave Roberts said: 'It's a really positive move and it shows that the club are listening to the fans. 'Supporters have clearly demonstrated that they want some sort of standing area and if we can do this, then it would be fantastic. 'It is achievable. Behind the scenes, we'll be doing lots of work to try and get local support for the project and we hope we can realise it.'

A GP clinic was yesterday sealed off after the man visited the NHS walk-in centre close to a branch of Asda in Hereford. The spokesman said: 'PHE can confirm it has received a sample for precautionary Ebola testing, involving an individual at Hereford County Hospital with a history of travel to west Africa. A patient suspected of suffering Ebola was taken to hospital after arriving at a GP walk-in clinic near a branch of Asda in Hereford, above. Health officials say he is being tested for the virus 'as a precaution' 'Ebola is considered very unlikely but testing is being done as a precaution. Based on the evidence-based risk assessment protocol, we are confident that all appropriate actions are being taken to ensure there is no risk to public health.' The patient arrived at the hospital yesterday evening, suffering diarrhoea. The spokesman said: 'It is important to remember that, as yet, there has never been a case of Ebola diagnosed in the UK and the infection can only be transmitted through contact with the bodily fluids - such as blood, vomit or faeces - of an infected person. 'We have advised all frontline medical practitioners dealing with patients to be alert to signs and symptoms of Ebola in those returning from affected areas. 'Following such advice we would expect to see an increase in testing. Should there be a positive case in the UK, this information will be made available to the public.' Mother Marie Williams, who was in the clinic when it was closed, said: 'We were in there at the time and although my daughter has a potentially life-threatening condition they refused to give me any info on what had happened.' A spokesman for Primecare, which runs the GP service, said: ' As a precautionary measure and in line with standard infection control guidelines the NHS health care centre in Belmont Road, Hereford has been closed after a patient with a suspected infectious disease was seen. 'The patient was transported to hospital.' A Public Health England spokesman said the man was displaying one of the early symptoms of Ebola . He was taken to Hereford County Hospital, where he is being tested for Ebola, having revealed a history of travel to West Africa . Dairy farmer Samuel Pickard, 65, said: 'I couldn't believe it, its good to know they are taking these things seriously, but I must say it frightened me a lot. 'It just brings the reality of it all a bit closer to home. It is very worrying.' Asda shopper Niall Forbes, 31, added: 'It is unnerving but I hope everybody remains calm and doesn't panic too much. 'I know a lot of people who are staying away from the supermarket all because of this, many are simply fearing the worst just because of this scare.' One patient, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It concerns me but the world is such a small place now. Prime Minister David Cameron this week pledged a further £1.34million to help fund research into fighting the deadly virus . 'They should not be open now really. I understand a mother was in the clinic with her sick child just as it was closing.' Another 75-year-old pensioner who uses the practice frequently, said: 'I was just told it was closed because of an infection. 'It doesn't surprise me. People travel, don't they? But I think it is good the clinic was closed. They dealt with it quite well. 'We now know so we can be careful ourselves now.' The scare came as the first group of NHS volunteers were sent to the worst-affected parts of West Africa yesterday. There, they have begun training at a specialist Ministry of Defence unit. More than 50 volunteers have been put through the comprehensive nine-day training scheme, which aims to fully prepare them for conditions in the field. On Sunday, David Cameron announced plans to invest a further £1.34 million in new research to fight the deadly virus. The Prime Minister pledged the new funds after securing a commitment from leading world powers at the G20 summit in Brisbane, Australia, to 'do what is necessary to ensure the international effort can extinguish the outbreak'. Among the projects which will receive investment is a University of Westminster study developing a portable battery-powered device to test body fluids for the disease, an Oxford University study on predicting the geographical spread of the virus, and anthropological research to establish the best methods of working with local populations in preventing infection. The UK has already committed around £230 million to the fight against Ebola and is taking a lead in healthcare operations in Sierra Leone where the disease has already spread. Schools and health facilities for pregnant women are closing and vital vaccination programmes for children are halting because of the emergency . Ebola has so far killed more than 5,000 people in West Africa - Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea are the countries worst affected by the outbreak, the biggest since the virus was discovered in 1976 .","Patient suffering diarrhoea visited an NHS clinic next to Asda in Hereford .

"Safe standing at football matches will be piloted in Wales if Welsh politicians and fans get their way. Welsh Conservatives leader Andrew RT Davies launched a report in Swansea on Monday backing the introduction of designated standing areas and has called on the UK Government to follow the Welsh Assembly's cross-party support for the proposals. The report comes on the back of a survey of 2,364 fans which showed that 96 per cent back a safe standing pilot to trial modern stadium technology, while 84 per cent believe that safe standing areas would decrease the likelihood of conflict between stewards and fans. The Liberty Stadium could pilot a safe standing scheme if Welsh politicians and supporters get their way . The move could also see Cardiff City trial a safe standing scheme that is backed by 96% of fans . The introduction of safe standing has the backing of the Football Supporters' Federation and the Supporters' Trusts of the four main professional clubs in Wales - Swansea, Cardiff, Newport and Wrexham. 'I see safe standing as a way forward for football,' Davies said. 'I do not see how we continue with the current legislation because the safety concerns have been addressed and ultimately football is not just about watching it on TV. 'It's about getting a great match-day experience and I believe with modern stadia like the Liberty Stadium I believe we can achieve that. 'This report is based on fans' views and there is a body of evidence which shows that the match-day experience can be greatly enhanced with safe standing.' Davies believes Britain needs to follow the example of the continent on safe standing and insists safety would not be compromised. Crumbling terraces were a regular feature of football in the 1980s and 96 Liverpool fans lost their lives at the Hillsborough tragedy in 1989 when supporters were crushed behind fences. In Germany clubs like Schalke, Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Monchengladbach employ standing areas and adapt their grounds to UEFA all-seater requirements by bolting temporary seats to the steps of conventional terraces and removing the crush barriers. Others like Bayer Leverkusen, Bayern Munich and Hamburg use seats in European competition that fold away under aluminium terrace steps for Bundesliga games. 'Look at Germany and other countries in Europe and I believe we can follow the protocols when it comes to safety to create an even better product,' Davies said. In Germany, teams such as Bayern Munich allow safe standing through rail seats which can fold away . The seats fold out for European matches, allowing teams to meet UEFA's all-seater requirements . 'Market research has also shown that when you do have a standing environment then ticket prices will tend to drop but this isn't about cramming people into terraces as it was historically. 'This is about people being in a designated spot in a stadium and making sure people are marshalled correctly.' The move has been backed by the FSF who represent supporters in England and Wales and have held a long-running campaign to re-introduce safe standing areas into domestic football. FSF director of communications Michael Brunskill said: 'When we ask people why do they back safe standing the main reason is atmosphere. 'When you're in church and you want to sing you stand, it's the same with football and you already see that in the Premier League that people will stand in seated areas to sing. 'All we're saying is why don't we design these areas properly to cater for that.' Supporters of Cardiff and Swansea have praised the report and would like to see a pilot scheme introduced in Wales whoever wins the General Election in May. Tim Hartley, chairman of the Cardiff City Supporters' Trust, said the Sky Bet Championship club allowed supporters to stand in one area of the Cardiff City Stadium but there have been high-profile cases in the past, most notably involving Trafford Council and Manchester United, where the local authority have waged campaigns to stop fans standing at matches. 'We are lucky at Cardiff where we have a liberal interpretation of the regulations and fans are allowed to stand in the Canton Stand,' Hartley said. 'The law says you must have all-seater stadia in the top two tiers in England and Wales, the regulations say that persistent standing should not be tolerated. Swansea City supporters could soon be cheering on their team while standing at the Liberty Stadium . 'That's a civil matter and it's up to the club whether they want to take you through the civil court and Cardiff choose not to because they know it's safe.' Swansea director Huw Cooze said: 'We'd like to see standing trialled whether that's lower down the league and filters up to us in the Premier League. 'We've seen it work in Germany and we like what we see.'","Out of 2,364 fans surveyed on standing, 96% back a trial in stadiums .

"China needs to act now on the country's illegal ivory trade to stop elephants becoming extinct, according to one conservationist. Joyce Poole, co-director of Elephant Voices, said the creatures had experienced their worst year in history, with more than 7 per cent killed for their tusks in only a year. She called for China to tackle the country's appetite for ivory to save the remaining 400,000 elephants from extinction, and said the species would be extinct within a decade if poaching continued at the current rate. The loss of the elephant would make a huge difference to the African continent, Joyce Poole said . China accounts for 40 per cent of the world's trade in elephant tusks, with many bound for the country intercepted by customs officials in Hong Kong (file photo) Nearly 40,000 elephants are killed for their tusks every year, Poole told the South China Morning Post. 'It's either China does something, or we lose the elephants. It's that big,' she said. 'If we can't even save the elephants - . such an iconic keystone animal, important to the African habitat - then . what hope do we have?' Ivory is known as 'white gold' in China, she said, and is symbol of wealth and status. A worldwide ban on ivory was imposed in 1989, with two sanctioned sales of stock to China and Japan in 1999 and 2007. Hong Kong customs officials have seized at least 16 tonnes of ivory worth HK$87million (more than £7million) bound for China in the past five years - which would require the tusks of 1,800 elephants, the paper reported. Items made from ivory, as seen in this Bejing market, show wealth and status in China (file photo) About 93 per cent of elephant carcasses have been found to have been killed by poachers, said Poole, who has researched elephants for 40 years. One elephant would earn an African poacher the same as a typical annual salary, she told the newspaper. 'I think many people don't know that you can't get the tusks [for ivory] without killing the elephants,' Poole said. '[Beijing is] still in denial that they have any part to play. Ivory isn't worth much to the [Chinese] economy, but losing the elephants will make a huge difference to African countries.'","Elephants could be gone in a decade at current poaching rate, says expert .

"The Chelsea Supporters Trust have called for the introduction of safe standing areas to improve the atmosphere at Stamford Bridge. Blues manager Jose Mourinho last month criticised the home support, claiming that playing a match at Stamford Bridge felt as though they were playing in an empty stadium. And a survey of 660 members backed Mourinho's assessment, listing the ways they feel the stale atmosphere at the Bridge can be improved. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Jose Mourinho slam the Chelsea atmosphere . Jose Mourinho was unhappy with the crowd during Chelsea's match against QPR at Stamford Bridge . A single Chelsea fan before a match, but Mourinho claimed the stadium feels like this during games too . Other than safe standing, the survey revealed 'the desire for more affordable ticket pricing especially for younger supporters (which in turn would help the atmosphere).' Members also believe that a solution to the atmosphere concerns would be to reduce the amount of overzealous stewarding on a matchday. Tim Rolls, chair of the Chelsea Supporters Trust, said in a statement: 'The results of the second CST members survey reinforce the view of the board that there are a couple of fundamental issues the club need to address as a matter of urgency. Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge wave flags before a Champions League match against PSG . Mourinho during Chelsea's last game at Stamford Bridge - and he wasn't happy with the home support . 'The recent publicity following the manager's comments about the lack of atmosphere at Stamford Bridge led to a healthy debate about the reasons for this. 'The need for more affordable ticketing for young supporters, the desire for safe standing to be introduced and concerns about over-zealous stewarding are all highlighted as significant member concerns in the survey results, and support the CST board view on these matters.'

"In custody: Ex-PM Dominique de Villepin has been arrested in connection with a corruption case . Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was in police custody today after being arrested in connection with a corruption scandal. The 58-year-old has been implicated in a fraud enquiry centred on the prestigious Relais & Chateaux (R&C) hotel and restaurant club. Regis Bulot, a former senior manager at R&C, spent seven months in prison this year while waiting trial over the alleged theft of 1 million pounds through over-charging for the club’s guidebooks, which are available all over Britain. De Villepin, who made his name in the UK by making a passionate speech to the United Nations opposing the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq in 2003, is a close personal friend of Bulot, 64. Now transcripts of telephone conversations have emerged from late 2011 which are said to prove De Villepin tried to stop R&C’s new management from proceeding with court action against Bulot. There are also suspicions that some of the money siphoned away from R&C may have been used to fund De Villepin’s political career. The two men are close friends and their families have often holidayed together in R&C hotels all over the world. Bulot had other high-profile supporters in his legal battle. Alain Ducasse, the multi-starred superchef, was overheard telling Mr Bulot: ‘You must quickly cut the head off your successor’ in another call recorded by investigators. Bulot has admitted to benefiting from illegal cash payments but denies involvement in any illicit political financing. Chain in chains: Relais & Chateaux own luxury resorts all over the world, inculcating the Xara Palace on the island of Malta, and is now at the centre of the fraud scandal involving de Villepin . De Villepin admits going to see the new R&C management about his friend, but insists it was at their invitation. ‘I have strictly nothing to feel bad about,’ he said before his arrest. ‘To try and implicate me in a story in which I have nothing do with is unbearable.’ The scandal follows former president Jacques Chirac receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last year. Nicolas Sarkozy, Chirac’s successor, is also facing allegations that he received illegal cash payments from Lilliane Bettencourt, France’s richest women. Both Chirac and Sarkozy were once close cabinet allies of De Villepin, a fellow conservative, but they have since all fallen out. Police confirmed that Mr De Villepin was being questioned at a station in central Paris following a request by judges sitting in Strasbourg, eastern France. He can be held for up to 48 hours before being charged or released. Ends .","Ex-PM arrested in Paris and questioned today .

"Trials of safe standing at football grounds moved a step closer after a survey of fans across the country revealed that 96 per cent backed its return. The campaign to see standing in the terraces introduced back into English football has been gathering pace. Last year, Manchester United chief executive Ed Woodward pledged to support the principle of having safe standing at Old Trafford, as revealed by Sportsmail.

Director of Communications for the Football Supporters Federation Michael Brunskill said: ‘Many fans love to stand at games, it can vastly improve the atmosphere and camaraderie at games, it's only natural to stand when you sing. ‘Safe standing areas exist on the continent and the FSF believes they should be introduced into our grounds as well. These areas are modern and safe, a million miles from the crumbling death traps of the 80s. ‘It's fantastic to see fans, clubs, and politicians coming together to deliver this message to Westminster. We need a safe standing pilot - and why shouldn't that be in Wales?’ Standing areas at football grounds in the Premier League and Championship has been outlawed since 1994 at the recommendation of the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool supporters.","Campaign to see standing in the terraces has been gathering pace .

"France today unveiled a 'soak the rich' budget that hammered big business and the wealthy in a high-risk strategy 'to get the country back on the rails'. Francois Hollande – France’s first Socialist president since Francois Mitterrand in the 1980s – outlined a £24 billion austerity package in the harshest budget for 30 years. But to the dismay of business leaders who fear an exodus of top talent, the centrepiece was a 75 per cent super-tax on incomes over £800,000 a year. Taxman: President Francois Hollande claims the spending plan for next year would win the 'battle' against joblessness . There was also a new 45 per cent band for earning over £120,000 and business lost a series of tax breaks. Critics said it risked driving entrepreneurs and the wealthy overseas – . including to London – and voiced alarm over the decision to impose £16 . billion of tax rises and just £8 billion of spending cuts. But French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault insisted it was 'a fighting budget to get the country back on the rails'. He said: 'It is a budget which aims to bring back confidence and to break this spiral of debt that gets bigger and bigger. 'It's true we’re asking for an effort of the richest, the top 10 per cent and the top one per cent in particular. 'Big companies pay less than the small companies and sometimes don't pay at all. So we’re asking them for an effort too.' Confirmation of the 75 per cent super-tax – the highest rate anywhere in . the world, which by the government’s own figures will only raise . £160million next year – is likely to cause a stir in Downing Street. In June, David Cameron promised to 'roll out the red carpet and welcome . more French businesses to Britain' if the tax hike went ahead. The comments sparked a furious reaction in France but business leaders . warned that Mr Hollande is doing untold damage to the economy. Guillaume Cairou, head of the Entrepreneurs Club in France, said austerity should have been more balanced towards spending cuts. 'France is sick because of the model it has but is choosing to preserve . it,' he said. 'The government is impeding investment and so will block . innovation.' Exodus: The tax announcement for the top 10 per cent of earners in France will see many of 'the most talented French workers' heading to London, it is claimed . Dr Jon Mulholland, a senior lecturer in sociology at Middlesex . University and an expert on the migration of highly-skilled workers from . France to London, said Britain stood to benefit from the super-tax. 'The tax announcement for the top 10 per cent of earners in France will . lead to an exodus of some of the most talented French workers to London,’ he said. 'Many highly skilled French workers are attracted by the UK’s economic . and political model, and London is the prime destination for them and . this rise will exacerbate this.' Sophie Dworetzsky, a partner at law firm Withers, said the French are already seeking advice on coming to the UK. 'We may need to spruce up Britain's red carpet for the French sooner . rather than later, given President Hollande's latest announcement,' she . said. 'Since Monsieur Hollande's election we have seen a definite, and strong, . increase in French individuals and corporates investigating the best, . and most tax-efficient way to relocate to the UK and minimise their . French tax burden. 'Typically, we are asked how to avoid becoming UK-resident for tax . purposes, but it in this case UK residence is highly favourable, whereas . French tax ties are seen as a burden.' Mr Hollande swept to power in on an anti-austerity and pro-growth ticket . but his approval rating has plummeted since he took office in the . summer. The French economy is on the verge of recession having stagnated for the . last nine months and unemployment has soared to its highest level this . century. With the French national debt at a post-war record of 91 per cent of . national income, any hopes that Mr Hollande would water down austerity . were quickly dashed. As well as hiking taxes on the wealthy and targeting big business, the . government froze government spending as it battled to get the . country's finances back under control. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici said the 'unprecedented' budget was . needed to cut the deficit from nearly £70 billion or 4.5 per cent of . national income this year to 3 per cent next year. 'The 3 per cent target is vital for the credibility of the country,' he said. 'We are committed to it and we will meet it.' But economists are sceptical about the government’s ability to meet the . target – particularly as it is based on the assumption that the French . economy will grow by 0.8 per cent in 2013 and 2 per cent in 2014 despite . the debt storm tearing through the eurozone. 'The 3 per cent target is not possible,' said Ludovic Subran, chief . economist at credit insurer Euler Hermes. 'I don’t believe they’ll make . it.' Philippe Waechter, an economist at fund manager Natixis Asset . Management, said: 'I have a hard time seeing how we’re going to find the . necessary growth in 2013 and afterwards.' Mr Hollande's soak the rich policies have already sparked a backlash in France. Jean-Paul Agon, chief executive of L'Oréal, the world’s biggest . cosmetics company, this week said it would be 'very, very difficult to . attract talent to work in France' if taxes are hiked. Earlier this month, Bernard Arnault, head of the luxury goods group . Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy, admitted he had applied for Belgian . citizenship. Eric Chaney, chief economist at investment manager AXA, said: 'The . government has understood that the increase in the public debt has got . to be halted but the way that they are doing it is not the right way. 'It amounts to strongly increasing the tax burden on companies, their . shareholders and executives, in other words those who create added . value. 'It will lead to an even bigger loss of competitiveness and so a . reduction in long-term growth. That will in turn keep the deficit and . debt from being reduced over the long term.'","Socialist French government's plans designed to save 30 billion euros (£24bn)

"Most people would have to be paid large sums of money to even consider swallowing an amputated human toe. But one customer at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City threw down $500 for the privilege before gulping one down. The incident took place at the famous saloon in Yukon Territory, Canada, on Saturday night and staff there said it's not the first time it has happened, but the first time it was done deliberately. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Toe joke: A customer at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City swallowed the toe in the famous Sourtoe Cocktail on Saturday night - the first time it was purposely done . Saloon: The Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, is famous for its Sourtoe Cocktail - a 40-year tradition which has been done by more than 65,000 people . Origins: The Sourtoe started in September 1973 when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson, not pictured, found a severed toe preserved in a jar, put it in a glass of champagne and knocked it back until the toe touched his lips . Captain Dick shows how it's done: The now-83-year-old says the Sourtoe Cocktail is his greatest and proudest achievement . For more videos, please go to CanadianTourism . People come from far and wide for the area's gold rush - and for the Downtown Hotel's Sourtoe Cocktail - wherein an amputated toe, which has been . preserved and pickled, is dropped into a glass. The customer must . drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips. The idea of the Sourtoe Cocktail started in September 1973, when riverboat captain Dick Stevenson found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar. Captain Dick somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - Take a beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back…and the toe must touch the lips. In September 1973, eight people participated in the first attempt; nearly four decades later, the Sourtoe Cocktail Club has an estimated 100,000-plus members. Any liquor can be used in the cocktail, but the norm now is a shot of Yukon Jack whiskey. It costs just $5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club. One rule must be adhered to however: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it . slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.' It has been described by members of the club as a 'leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached'. It costs $5 and the drinker signs a logbook and gets a certificate from the night's 'Toe Captain' confirming their membership to the Sourtoe Cocktail Club. The drink can be anything, as long as . the following rule is applied: 'You can drink it fast, you can drink it . slow. But the lips have gotta touch the toe.' Terry Lee was the 'Toe Captain' of the . bar on Saturday night when the patron - known only as 'Josh from New Orleans' - came in, threw $500 on the table and . drank down the shot of whiskey - toe and all. He said the latest toe was 'mummified' with salt, and plunked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night. Lee told CBC News the customer was an . American who had been living in Dawson for the summer, he had just picked up . his rent deposit and was leaving town. The posted fine for swallowing the toe is $500. It has since been raised to $2,500. Speaking to The Star about what happened, he said: 'This guy popped it in his mouth, takes $500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away. 'I said, ""Where’s the toe?"" and he said, ""I swallowed it"". I was shocked.' Throughout the 40-year tradition, more than 100,000 people have joined the Sourtoe Cocktail club. The Sour Toe started in September 1973 . when a local eccentric named Captain Dick Stevenson found a severed toe . preserved in a jar. He came up with the original rules . for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends: take a . beer glass full of champagne, drop in the toe, tip the glass back. Since then a number have been swallowed, lost or . destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar, they always manage to find . someone to donate a new toe. Lee said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one. He told CBC: 'We like to have two toes - . we switch them off once a week - and now we can't do that. We need . toes. We're putting it out there, if you have a spare toe, hey we need . one.' Gnarly: While it may sound unsanitary, the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers . New member: A female customer prepares to take the Sourtoe challenge so she can join the prestigious club . Down in one: The famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the Sourtoe Cocktail Club .

Whitehorse, who got his pinkie toe amputated in January 2000 after . developing hammertoe. He kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in April 2002. Manager at the Downtown Hotel Dick Van Nostrand told the Wall Street Journal last year: 'We've had people throwing up, we've had . people gagging on their drinks.

"Tony Blair was given a gong at the Polish Business Leaders Awards in Warsaw . In Britain, his ‘open door’ immigration policies have been criticised by all sides. But in Poland, which was transformed by entry into the EU, Tony Blair is feted as a hero. And yesterday the former Prime Minister was handed a special award for helping hundreds of thousands of Poles come to live in the UK. He was honoured with the gong at the annual Polish Business Leaders Awards ceremony in Warsaw. Mr Blair's prize paid tribute to his backing for Poland’s efforts to join the EU, opening up the British labour market to Poles and overseeing a growth in trade between the two countries while in office. A golden statuette was accepted in his absence by Robin Barnett, Britain’s ambassador in Poland. But Mr Blair recorded a video message for the audience at Warsaw’s National Opera house, in which he said ‘As you know, Poland is a country I admire greatly. 'I admire the Polish people greatly. I'd like to thank you for the contribution you've made to the European Union since you joined, and to my country, to Britain, both at the workplace and in society. 'This is a difficult economic time . and I know the Business Centre Club of Poland do fantastic work. So to . be given this award for the contribution I have made, in my way, to . relations between Britain and Poland, between British people and Polish people is an especial honour.' The award, referred to as the ‘Special Prize’, is awarded to a figure from outside the world of business who has helped Poland. Previous winners include Margaret Thatcher, Bill Clinton and Bertie Ahern. Mr Blair shared it with two Poles, former defence minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz and former deputy prime minister Janusz Steinhoff. Scroll down for video . British Ambassador to Poland Robin Barnett (left) collects the Special Award on behalf of Tony Blair .

Between December 2003 and December 2010 the Polish-born population of the UK increased from 75,000 to 532,000. Latest census figures reveal that the number of Poles living in Britain now stands at 625,000. Tory MP Philip Hollobone, raged last night: ‘This award is entirely appropriate. ‘Tony Blair presided over the biggest wave of immigration this country has seen since the Norman conquest, 2.5million net migrants came in to the UK while he was in charge and Britain will never be the same again’.

"The taxpayer paid £10,000 for a 20-foot snake called Albert to be restuffed by the Foreign Office. Despite insisting deep public spending cuts were ‘essential to the future of the country’, William Hague signed off on the extraordinary bill for the restoration of the 120-year-old anaconda. The reptile hangs in the library of the Foreign Office, but was found to be in ‘poor condition’  so a refurbishment was ordered. The Foreign Office insisted Albert the snake is a 'unique historical heirloom deserving of essential maintenance' A team from the Natural History Museum spent five weeks on the work, using an expensive X-ray CT scanning machine. The Foreign Office, which is cutting its budget by a quarter over four years, defended the work, saying the snake had not been restuffed for up to 50 years. The snake is thought to have been presented by a Bishop, in what is now Guyana, to the Colonial Secretary in the 19th century. According to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), exact names and dates are unknown but Albert was pictured in Whitehall building in 1892. Tonight Mr Hague was unavailable to . defend the £10,000 bill personally. Officials said he was hosting . Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on a state visit. But a FCO spokesman tried to justify defended the cost, admitting it was 'quite a bit of money but he is a very big snake'. He . added: 'We will not be constricted nor will we scale back in our . dedicated to preserving this historic national treasure. This will . preserve him for posterity. Foreign Secretary William Hague signed off the restuffing of the snake, which he complained was the only thing left in the Foreign Office library after being run down by Labour . 'Albert is a unique historic heirloom deserving essential maintenance to an appropriate standard after decades of neglect.' Responding to a Freedom of Information request by the Guido Fawkes website, the ministry added: ‘As a gift to the FCO, Albert is therefore regarded as an FCO asset. As such, the FCO is obliged to maintain its assets, and the work on Albert was essential maintenance. ‘It is believed that Albert was first re-stuffed in the 1960s or 1970s, but there are no records of how much it cost on that occasion. Certainly no significant maintenance has been carried out on him in the last 40-50 years. ‘Albert was never housed in a glass case, as is commonly believed. In moving him from his suspended position in the Ansell Library (a separate Library area to the old Home Office Library referenced above) to facilitate planned refurbishment to the area it was observed he was in poor condition. ‘A decision was taken to use this opportunity to carry out a refurbishment to ‘Albert’ including a safety check on the suspension fittings. The cost of the conservation and restoration work on ‘Albert’ was £10,000. ‘The level of detailed, delicate work in the restoration involved an intensive amount of care and attention from highly trained staff.’ In a speech last year Mr Hague criticised his Labour predecessors for stripping the Foreign Office library of its 6,000 books. He said: ‘It is ironic that the only object to survive the gutting of the library is a one hundred year old twenty-foot stuffed anaconda known as Albert, who remains suspended over the empty bookshelves, while the books from the period when such an unusual foreign gift found its way into the Foreign Office have been dismantled around it, and can never be reassembled. Officials said Albert had been photographed in the Foreign Office on Whitehall 120 years ago . ‘To my mind the fate of the FCO library is emblematic of a gradual hollowing out of the qualities that made the FCO one of our great institutions.’ In May 2011 Lord Jay of Ewelme, the former head of the diplomatic service, demanded to know what had become of Albert. Tory Foreign Office minister Lord Howell of Guildford, who is George Osborne’s father-in-law, told the peer: . ‘Albert, the 20-foot long stuffed anaconda, has graced the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) library for over a century. He remains proudly in place, just as he did throughout the noble Lord's distinguished career in the FCO, and continues to be held in great affection by FCO staff. ‘We have no plans for Albert other than to clean and stuff him from time to time.’ At some considerable cost, it turns out. The Foreign Office is one of the grandest buildings in Whitehall. Durbar Court is a glass roofed courtyard, originally occupied by the British Indian Office which is now part of William Hague's ministry . Foreign Secretary William Hague he bill for refurbishing Albert the snake was revealed in a Freedom of Information request to the Guido Fawkes website. It stated: . ‘Albert’ the anaconda was allegedly presented by a Bishop, in what is now Guyana, to the Colonial Secretary in the 19th century – exact names and dates are unknown. However, he appears in a photo from circa 1892, which means he has been in the FCO for at least 120 years. As a gift to the FCO, Albert is therefore regarded as an FCO asset. As such, the FCO is obliged to maintain its assets, and the work on ‘Albert’ was essential maintenance. It is believed that ‘Albert’ was first re-stuffed in the 1960s or 1970s, but there are no records of how much it cost on that occasion. Certainly no significant maintenance has been carried out on him in the last 40-50 years. ‘Albert’ was never housed in a glass case, as is commonly believed.

A decision was taken to use this opportunity to carry out a refurbishment to ‘Albert’ including a safety check on the suspension fittings. The cost of the conservation and restoration work on ‘Albert’ was £10,000. The work was undertaken by the Conservation Team at the Natural History Museum, over a 5-week period, from 21 May to 26 June 2012. As nothing was known about previous work done on ‘Albert’, the conversation team at the NHM needed to use x-ray CT scanning, which is a costly procedure that required extensive data processing and a specialist to do the analysis. Also, the level of detailed, delicate work in the restoration involved an intensive amount of care and attention from highly trained staff.","Foreign Secretary called in a team from the Natural History Museum who spent five weeks with an X-ray machine restoring the reptile .

"The Mormon Church is thought to bring in $7billion per year in donations, most of which come from wealthy adherents like Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Relying heavily on church records in countries that require far more disclosure than the United States, University of Tampa sociologist Ryan Cragun and Reuters were able to learn a great deal more about the financial backing of the often misunderstood religion. The church claims 14 million members around the world, more than half outside the United States. All are supposed to tithe, or give 10 per cent, of their income, which Mormons frequently interpret as pre-tax earnings. But only about 40 per cent of Mormons counted by the church actually attend weekly services in the United States and Canada, and in many countries, including Mexico and Brazil, only a quarter of nominal members are active, according to Cumorah, an independent research group headed by a devoted, active Mormon. Wealthy world: A study of the Mormon church's global financial statements estimates that it collects an estimated $7billion per year largely from members of the church . These active members are most likely to tithe, and the result is that from a financial standpoint at least, the church remains largely a venture of active American members, says Mr Cragun, who adds that U.S. Mormon men tend to be wealthier than the average U.S. male. 'Most of the revenue of the religion is from the U.S., and a large percentage comes from an elite cadre of wealthy donors, like Mitt Romney,' said Mr Cragun. '(It) is a religion that appeals to economically successful men by rewarding their financial acuity with respect and positions of prestige within the religion.' The church is full of successful businessmen, including chemical billionaire Jon Huntsman Sr., the father of the former presidential candidate, J.W. 'Bill' Marriott Jr. and his hotel-owning family, and even entertainer Donny Osmond. Romney gave $4.1million to the church over the past two years (amounting to 9.7 per cent of his gross adjusted income, according to the two years' worth of tax returns he has released). He would tithe on his IRA, valued at as much as $102million, only when he withdraws from it and pays taxes. Several countries around the world require religious groups and charities to file financial reports, including Canada. The country has only 185,000 Mormon members but a wealth of statistics on them. Big donor: Romney gave $4.1million to the church over the past two years (amounting to 9.7 per cent of his gross adjusted income, according to the two years' worth of tax returns he has released) Taking total reported Canadian donations and dividing by the estimated number of active Mormons and family financial data from the World Bank indicates that active Canadian Mormons give slightly less than 8 per cent of their income to the church. Assuming that active U.S. Mormons give at a similar rate and adjusting for higher U.S. income, total U.S. tithing would amount to more than $6billion, or about $6.5billion annually between the United States and Canada. Australia, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, which also require financial disclosures, all have sharply lower donation rates than Canada. Based on data from those countries, tithing outside the United States and Canada totals several hundred million dollars, taking global total donations to about $7 billion. Canada also requires the church to disclose the value of its assets and spending. Using those figures as a basis suggests the total value of church buildings, including temples and meeting houses, would be about $35billion globally. Church spokesman Michael Purdy declined to comment specifically on the estimates but said that the church was different from a corporation. 'Other projections are speculative and do not reflect an understanding of how the church uses its income to bless the lives of people,' he added, saying the church was financed primarily from member tithing and offerings. Concerned or disgruntled current and former Mormons complain that the church spends too much on real estate and for-profit ventures, neglecting charity work. Priorities: Concerned or disgruntled current and former Mormons complain that the church spends too much on real estate- like it's main temple in Salt Lake City, Utah- and for-profit ventures, neglecting charity work . The Mormon church has no hospitals and only a handful of primary schools. Its university system is limited to widely respected Brigham Young, which has campuses in Utah, Idaho and Hawaii, and LDS Business College. Seminaries and institutes for high school students and single adults offer religious studies for hundreds of thousands. It counts more than 55,000 in its missionary forces, primarily youths focused on converting new members but also seniors who volunteer for its non-profits, such as the Polynesian Cultural Center, which bills itself as Hawaii's No. 1 tourist attraction, and for-profit businesses owned by the church. The church has plowed resources into a multi-billion-dollar global network of for-profit enterprises: it is the largest rancher in the United States, a church official told Nebraska's Lincoln Journal Star in 2004, with other ranches and farms in Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Australia and Great Britain, according to financial documents reviewed by Reuters. Ranching and farm industry sources say they are well-run operations. It also has a small media empire, an investment fund, and is developing a mall across from its Salt Lake City headquarters, which it calls an attempt to help revitalize the city rather than to make money. These enterprises are also part of a vast nest egg for tough times. The church expects wars and natural disasters before Christ returns to earth in the Second Coming, and members are encouraged to prepare by laying in stores of food. Farms and ranches are part of the church's own preparation. 'The church teaches its members to live within their means and put a little money aside for life's unexpected events. As a church, we live by the same principle,' Purdy said. The rainy-day fund and operating budget rarely mix, officials say. Well known adherents: The church is full of successful businessmen, including Mitt Romney, billionaire Jon Huntsman Sr. the father of Romney's former opponent, J.W. 'Bill' Marriott Jr. and his hotel-owning family, and even entertainer Donny Osmond . Controversial selling point: Though Mitt Romney's Mormonism was a potential issue during the beginning of the presidential campaign, it has subsided since he became the presumptive nominee . Cost-cutting is a top priority, church documents show. It has even laid off janitors and called on members to clean temples and meeting houses, but the buildout of temples continues, including one under construction in Rome. Those temples take a lot of money to operate, Purdy points out, and many of the grand church buildings are short on congregants, says David Stewart, a physician who leads research group Cumorah. 'I have been to beautiful church buildings in Hungary and Ukraine, and Latvia and other places, and there are these huge buildings and 35 people there, and you say, how can this work financially? The math - it just doesn't work,' Stewart said. ‘The Seventh-day Adventist Church, which had about 17 million members a year ago, appears to be getting a better return on investment: It builds smaller meeting houses and lots of schools and hospitals, and its numbers are swelling faster than the Mormons', said Stewart. The Adventists claim a million new members join annually, compared with every three years or so for the Mormons. 'The Seventh-day Adventists clearly have a much more expansive humanitarian project in terms of building hospitals and medical schools and schools and universities and long-term developmental infrastructure around the world,' said Stewart. 'It's paid off for them.' The Mormon church, meanwhile, appears to be decreasing transparency and member control of donations. New tithing slips give fewer donation options and come with an expanded disclaimer saying the church has sole discretion over spending, even though it will make 'reasonable efforts' to follow donors' wishes. Purdy did offer a list of spending priorities: building houses of worship, supporting Brigham Young University and a seminary system, operating nearly 140 temples and the world's largest genealogy research program, and humanitarian aid for both members and non-members. Since 1985 the church has spent a total of $1.4billion on relief for disasters such as Japan's earthquake and Ethiopian famine, and it operates 129 'bishops' storehouses' with food and household items for the needy. Romney himself focuses on the act of giving, not the result. As he told Fox News Sunday, 'Hopefully, as people look at various individuals running for president, they'd be pleased with someone who made a promise to God and kept that promise.'","Estimates come from study of financial records from countries that require more disclosure from the church than the United States .

"The BBC is sending 272 staff to the World Cup in Brazil this summer - enough to field almost 25 football teams. Licence-fee payers will spend £12million funding the trip to cover the month-long tournament in South America starting on June 12. The bill will include five-star treatment for pundits Gary Lineker, 50, Alan Shearer, 43, Alan Hansen, 58, and Robbie Savage, 39. Boys trip: Alan Hansen, Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer will be among 272 BBC staff heading to the Brazil World Cup this summer . Corporation bosses have justified the spending by saying they plan to make Brazil 2014 the first '24/7' World Cup and say it will cost viewers and listeners 'less than a pint of milk' each. There will be 12 separate commentary teams covering more than 50 matches for TV and more than 60 for radio as well as shows including a documentary about David Beckham travelling to the Amazon rainforest. BBC and ITV split World Cup coverage down the middle yet the licence-fee funded Corporation are sending more than double the number of personnel to Brazil than their commercial rivals. Bosses claim their bloated presence of 272 at the tournament is less than the excessive 295 they sent to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup but will be delivering up to 50 per cent more TV output. Yet the BBC army compares with ITV making do with a 120-strong task force in South America, with most of those freelance operators. BBC director of sport Barbara Slater tried to justify the cost to taxpayers in a lengthy website blog claiming: ‘Our aspiration is to make Brazil 2014 the first 24/7 World Cup, which will appeal to all age groups, is available across all devices at any time of the day or night. We will be producing all this for less than the cost of a pint of milk for each viewer, listener or website user.’ Dream trip: The BBC has promised the first 24/7 tournament but needs double the amount of staff ITV does to do it . Blanket coverage: There will be 12 separate commentary teams covering more than 50 matches for TV and more than 60 for radio - including here at the Maracana in Rio . Ms Slater added: ‘Throughout the planning process, all parts of the BBC have been acutely aware of striking a balance between editorial ambition and value for money'. But critics have accused the BBC of sending staff on a 'wasteful jolly'. Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said:‘Auntie continues to send an army of staff to cover big sporting events while other broadcasters manage to with far fewer. ‘The BBC needs to stop wasting so much of the licence fee on this extravaganza and cut back on the number of additional jollies that come with the coverage. ‘Viewers want to watch the World Cup, but they shouldn’t have to pay for so many extra staff to cover the games.’ It came in the week where fans accused the Football Association of ripping them off over the £90 price of England's new shirt for the World Cup. Fans are unhappy that the new, costly kit has been launched less than a year after the last new strip went on sale. Problem: Supporters fear they are being priced out of purchasing England's World Cup strips - with the new Brazil shirt costing £90 . It was only last May that the previous home kit was released, which has been worn just seven times. The red away kit, released even more recently in June 2013, has had just two airings. The . £90 shirt is identical to those worn by Roy Hodgson's side, while an . adult 'stadium' England shirt is priced at £60 and shirts for children . aged between eight and 15 cost £42, with mini-kits priced at £40.

"The Prime Minister has labelled extremist movement the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) as one of 'utter ferocity' and 'medieval barbarism' and says it is now a problem for Australians. In announcing a counter-terror package of $64 million, Tony Abbott said 'because of the Australians who are involved with this movement, what might otherwise be a problem in a far away country is a problem for us'. Mr Abbott added that there are ' there are at least 60 Australians fighting with the ISIL movement in Iraq and Syria'. Scroll down for video . Tony Abbott has announced $64 million in anti-terror measures including programs in Australia to stop youths being lured by extremist groups . 'Obviously we are boosting our security services generally,' he added. The money, Mr Abbott said, would be specifically spent to 'counter violent extremism and radicalisation' and the battle would begin at home. A key part of this will be local community programs aimed at stopping Australian youths being drawn in by extremist organisations. 'We have got new laws to ensure that people who are coming back from terrorist activity in the Middle East can be arrested and detained,' he said. 'It's also important, though, that we engage with the community so that everyone understands that the enemy here is terrorism. 'This is a movement, as we have seen on our TV screens and on the front pages of our newspapers, of utter ferocity, medieval barbarism, that is how serious and dangerous this movement is,' he said. Khaled Sharrouf has become the face of home-grown terrorism. Here he's seen here with former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson (left), and he reportedly (top right) posted this image of a young boy, believed to be his son, holding a decapitated head. The Prime Minister's new measures will target 'home-grown terrorism' at a local community level . The ISIL movement, which is allegedly led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been labelled one of 'utter ferocity and medieval barbarism' by Prime Minister Tony Abbott . In keeping with his 'Team Australia' message of last week, Mr Abbott went to pains to stress that this was not about a specific party of the Australian community. 'It's not any particular religion,' he added. 'What we are targeting is extremism, not members of any particular community.' The package includes $13.4 million boost to community engagement programs and $6.2 million to establish a new Australian Federal Police Community Diversion and Monitoring Team to target returning foreign fighters and their supporters. An additional $32.7 million will go toward a multi-agency national disruption group to investigate and disrupt foreign fighters and their supporters and a further $11.8 million for new local and regional AFP liaison officers. The Prime Minister said that the best defence against radicalisation was 'well informed and well equipped' families and communities . Mr Abbott said the best defence against radicalisation was 'well informed and well equipped' families and communities. 'We want to stop radicalised youngsters from leaving this country to join terrorist groups overseas, we want to work with our allies and partners to try to monitor them while they are overseas,' Mr Abbott said. 'We want to be able to charge them and jail them where they have been working with terrorist groups overseas.'The security and terror travel announcements made last month have bolstered the Coalition's standing, according to the latest Newspoll. The federal Coalition has trimmed Labor's slim lead, which also shows voters are in favour of the government's proposed terror travel laws. The poll shows the Coalition has picked up one point in the past fortnight in the two party-preferred results, trailing Labor 51 per cent to 49 per cent, but is still 4.5 points below its election result last year. The Coalition's support, after the PM also announced new terror travel laws worth $630 million last month, has enjoyed a slight increase to cut Labor's lead in the latest Newspoll . No change has been recorded in the primary votes of the two major parties since the previous Newspoll, with the Coalition on 40 per cent and Labor on 34 per cent. An overwhelming 77 per cent of Australians are in favour of proposed new laws for travellers returning from countries such as Iraq and Syria having to prove they are not involved with terrorist groups. A total of 18 per cent were against the laws. Despite that vote of confidence, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has jumped above Tony Abbott in who would make a better prime minister. Mr Shorten gained three points to 40 per cent, with Mr Abbott dropping two points to 39 per cent.","Up to 60 Australians are believed to be working with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)

"All children could soon be given annual flu vaccinations at school. A panel of experts advising the Government says the vaccine should be handed to everyone aged five to 17 on the NHS. At present, it is offered to the over-65s, pregnant women and anyone with an underlying health condition, such as diabetes. Advise: A panel of experts say a nasal flu vaccine should be given to everyone from the ages of five to 17 on the NHS . But the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said immunising children would help prevent the spread of the illness. Many youngsters catch flu at school before passing it on to more vulnerable family members, such as grandparents. However, experts recommend the vaccine is not offered until 2014 to allow time to buy in stocks. They also believe pupils should be given a nasal spray rather than an injection because it is safer and more effective for children. Minutes of a meeting held last month, uncovered by GP Magazine, show the JCVI believes the scheme would ‘appreciably lower the public health impact of flu’. Although the cost of the scheme is not known, it would likely run into millions of pounds. However, the NHS would save money because fewer people would become ill and need treatment. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Extending the vaccination programme would be a huge undertaking so it is important we get this decision right.’","Experts advising Government say the vaccine should be given to everyone from five to 17 on the NHS .

"Four rhinos have been slaughtered for their horns at a reserve in South Africa, it emerged today. Grim pictures show the bloodied remains of the animals lying close together at the Lalibela game reserve, near Grahamstown, in the Eastern Cape as forensic teams examined them. It is believed that the rhinos – a 28-year-old cow, an eight-year-old pregnant bull, a second eight-year old bull, and a male, three, may have been darted before their horns were clinically removed. Carnage: These four rhinos were thought to have been darted before having their horns hacked off . Outrage: The killiing of rhino gets widespread condemnation . The deaths come in the same week that four rhinos were found shot and dehorned in Assam, north-east India. Two of the animals died, including a female found terribly mutilated but still alive at Kaziranga National Park . Vets fought a desperate battle to save her but eventually succumbed to her injuries. Brutal attacks: The number of rhinos killed in South Africa this year is now over 400 . Brutal: The examination clearly found that the rhinos were killed for their horns . Footage of her lying stricken on the ground was shown across India and prompted outrage. The attack on the one-horned rhino . sparked outrage in the state of Assam, home to the world's largest . concentration of the rare rhino. Footage of the bleeding rhino with its horn removed and a cut to its ear was broadcast on local television. Heavy rains across Assam have caused flooding in recent days that killed 18 people and forced 1.4 million to flee their homes. Much of the 480 square kilometer (185 square mile) Kaziranga National Park was also flooded. Many other animals migrated to higher . ground. The rhino was one of them, leaving the park for a highland . across a busy highway, where trailing guards lost track of it, Chand . said. The rhino was then shot by poachers, who sawed off its horn while it was still alive. Horrific: Villagers look at a wounded endangered one horned Rhinoceros that was butchered by poachers in the jungle in Assam . Today, forest guards in the Jagdamba . Tea Estate near the Kuthori region, of Assam were trying to catch . another rare rhinoceros that was shot and dehorned. Two other rhinos had died after being attacked by poachers. Back in South Africa, the deaths of the four rhinos had provoked fury. There have already been 400 of the animals killed in the country this year. All of them have died on private reserves, which is particularly alarming as security is usually better at these sites than at state-run parks. Desperate bid to save: Villagers and vets failed to rescue the endangered animal after heartless poachers ripped off its horn . Vernon Wait, marketing director at the game reserve, said that the four animals found dead today had probably been poisoned. 'Unlike usual incidents of poaching where the horns are hacked off with pangas or axes, in this case, the horns were ‘clinically’ cut off,’ he told South Africa Press Association. He described the attack as ‘very professional.’","Four rhinos poisoned and dehorned in in Eastern Cape, South Africa .

"This is the brave little girl who is battling through a massive birthmark. Matilda Callaghan was born with the birthmark which stretches down from her face, down the side of her body. Strangers have even asked her parents if they have left her too near the radiator and burnt her, when they see her for the first time. But brave Matilda, two, doesn't let the regular laser treatments dampen her fighting spirit. Matilda Callaghan has to undergo laser treatment on a regular basis to help get rid of a birthmark on her face . Some people have even asked Matilda's parents if she has been left next to a radiator and burned . Parents Paul and Rebecca Callaghan said they did not think Matilda would live for more than a few hours. This month they are looking forward to celebrating her third birthday . Father Paul, 45, who lives in Leigh, Lancashire, with wife Rebecca, 41, said: 'Matilda is absolutely amazing. 'Despite everything she has been through, she is still happy and she has a smile for everyone. She's doing fantastically well.' The couple had no idea there was anything wrong with Matilda before she was born in October 2010, weighing a healthy 5Ib 5ozs. Her father described her as a fighter adding that 'She's our little miracle ' Mrs Callaghan's pregnancy hadn't been easy as there was too much fluid in her amniotic sac, and the doctors decided to deliver the baby early. When she was born she had a dark purple mark down the side of her face, which initially doctors thought was a bruise. But then half an hour later, they broke the devastating news to the couple that it was a birthmark. Two weeks later she was diagnosed with a condition called Sturge Weber Syndrome, a rare neurological and skin disorder. It causes learning difficulties, paralysis and seizures. Because she was so ill, Matilda was rushed from Wigan Hospital to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Paul . said: 'We couldn't travel with her as she was so ill. As we stood . watching her being taken away, we didn't know if we were going to see . her again. 'We'd been so excited at our baby's . arrival, now within a matter of hours we didn't know whether we would . even see her alive again.' But . even from a day old, Matilda was a force to be reckoned with. She had . also been born with two holes in her heart, which was even more . difficult for her survival. She . managed to survive her first surgery, and when she was two months old . she went to the operating theatre again for surgery to repair the two . holes in her heart. Paul . said: 'We were terrified when she was wheeled down for the surgery - . even though she was two months old - she still looked so small to be . having such major surgery. Eventually the surgeon came up to see us and . told us the surgery had been successful.' The . doctors have said take Matilda's birthmark may take 16 years of . treatment for it to fade. She has recently started laser treatment to . stop it carrying on growing as she gets older. When she was born she had a dark purple mark down the side of her face, which initially doctors thought was a bruise . Two weeks after being told Matilda had a birthmark she was diagnosed with a condition called Sturge Weber Syndrome . Paul said: 'She has treatment every . couple of months, and the laser does make it look more red and angry, . and her face is covered with blobs afterwards, which then gradually fade . away again. 'We do get people staring at Matilda when she goes out - especially after she's had the laser treatment - which is hurtful. Matilda pictured in a walking frame which her parents have recently bought . 'We have even had people accusing us of leaving her to near the radiator, and causing her face to go red. 'People think we are the bad parents - that we have somehow caused Matilda to look like she does. 'They just see what is in front of them and jump to hurtful conclusions. 'I wish they could see past the birthmark and see what a wonderful little angel she is. 'She's always got a smile for everyone but she'd feisty too. It's her way or not at all. 'She can't see very well as the condition also causes glaucoma, which can cause blindness. 'The doctors can't tell us whether she will ever be able to see. 'And she can't walk at all. But recently we have bought a special walking frame, so she's taking her few steps in that. It does worry me how Matilda is going to cope as she grows older. 'Other children can be so cruel and I want them to be able to see past the birthmark too. Matilda is such a special person in our lives, and every day with her is a bonus. 'Recently she said ""mummy"" for the first time, and it was such an emotional moment. We know that her whole life has been such a fight for her. She can point to her dummy too, so she's learning to communicate more. 'She'll be celebrating her third birthday this year, and it will be such a celebration for us. When she was born, we didn't even know whether she would survive a few hours. 'But she's proved everyone wrong. She was a fighter from the moment she arrived into the world and she's carried on fighting ever since. She's our little miracle. ' The couple are fundraising for Alder Hey Children's Hospital where Matilda was treated, and the Sturge Weber Foundation UK.","Matilda Callaghan born with Sturge Weber syndrome .

"A self confessed tanorexic who refused to ditch her five sunbed-a-week habit when nine months pregnant was later diagnosed with skin cancer. Jo Irving, from Blackpool in Lancashire, started using sunbeds when she was just 14 years old. But the 32-year-old said she will never step foot in a tanning salon again, after hearing the devastating diagnosis from doctors last April . The mother-of-one first noticed a 'pearly white boil' on the left side of her nose four years ago. Scroll down for video . Self-confessed tanorexic Jo Irving, left when tanned and right now, was diagnosed with skin cancer in April 2012, after refusing to ditch her sunbed addiction when she was nine months pregnant. After surgery and treatment, she has now vowed to never step in a tanning salon again . While at an antenatal appointment Ms Irving mentioned the blemish to medics, having noticed it wouldn't heal. She was shocked when tests revealed the mark was a basal cell carcinoma - a type of skin cancer, . After surgery to remove the disease, the flight attendant was left with a gaping hole in her face. She had the spot, a 'rodent ulcer', removed, along with the tissue around it and a skin graft using skin from behind her ear to repair the damage. Now, after spending more than half her life using sunbeds, Ms Irving, who was addicted to being brown, said she will never go near one again. She said: 'I first noticed the lump four years ago. 'It was a small boil under the skin with a pearly white head on the top. 'It didn’t bother me in the slightest at first. I didn’t think much of it. 'The only time I thought about it was in the morning when I looked in the mirror to put my make-up on and then my make-up would cover it. 'I thought it would go over time but my boyfriend, Bobby, started mentioning it quite a lot to me and would tell me to go and get it checked out.' Even when the lump started bleeding Jo says she still didn’t feel the need for any concern. She said she first mentioned it to a doctor when she went for her post-natal check-up with her son Ryley, now two, in August 2012. The 32-year-old first noticed a 'pearly white boil' on the left side of her nose four years ago. It was only in April 2012 that the expectant mother raised the blemish with doctors at an anti-natal check up. Tests revealed it was basal cell carcinoma - a form of skin cancer . The small blemish was removed by surgeons, who then used skin from her ear to create a graft over the hole left. She said: 'The skin graft didn't take, and I was left with a hole in my face, which took over five weeks to heal,' right. There are two main types of skin cancer, melanoma and non-melanoma. A basal skin carcinoma is a non-melanoma skin cancer, and is the most common form of the disease. It accounts for 80 per cent of all cases in the UK. The cancer is often refered to as 'rodent ulcers'. The commonest cause of a basal cell carcinoma is too much exposure to UV light from the sun or sunbeds. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common in areas exposed to the sun, including your face, head, neck and ears. BCC mainly affect fair-skinned adults and are more common in men than women. Those at highest risk are: . Most are painless, and often first appear as a scab that bleeds and does not fully heal. Some BCCs are very superficial and look like a scaly red flat mark, others have a pearl-like rim surrounding a central crater. If left for years, the latter, can erode the skin causing an ulcer. BCCs can be cured in almost every case. Source: British Skin Foundation . 'The doctor told me to just see how it goes, but if I see any changes in it and it keeps bothering me, I should go back,' she said. 'His reaction to it didn’t give me much cause for concern. 'I thought I was making something of nothing. 'It wasn’t until March the next year that I went for an appointment.' Ms Irving said to become concerned when she was sent to Clifton Hospital in Lancashire, in April 2012, for an appointment with a specialist. She said: 'When I got in to see the doctor, he looked at it straight away and called it a ‘rodent ulcer.’ 'He said, ""I don’t know what your relationship with the sunbeds is but I suggest you never use one again"". 'I had two plastic surgeons working on me at Royal Preston Hospital - one working on my face and the other taking skin from behind my ear. 'Under the local anaesthetic, I could just feel the tugging and pulling, which is a horrible feeling. 'I could smell the burning of my flesh and because it was behind my ear, I could hear every little thing. 'The skin graft didn’t take, and I was left with a hole in my face, which took over five weeks to heal. 'And my ear was swollen from having the skin removed, and so painful I couldn’t bear for it to be touched.' Ms Irving started using sunbeds when she was fourteen, at one point averaging five times a week. She is now left with a small white scar, the only indication of her ordeal. 'I was addicted to being brown,' she said. 'I wouldn’t go on a night out unless I’d had a sunbed. Ms Irving continued to use sunbeds when she was pregnant with baby Ryley, pictured left. She is now urging others to think before using sunbeds, adding: 'I decided to look at it in a positive way. It's a wake up call. It means I haven't used a sunbed since and I never will again' 'If I went on holiday and didn’t come back with a tan, I would be disappointed about the whole holiday. 'I even went on when I was pregnant with Ryley, for the full nine months.' Ms Irving said now the ulcer has been removed, the cancer is gone. But she said doctors have warned there is no reason why it won't return. She said: 'Luckily, it was the least harmful form of skin cancer, basal cell skin carcinoma. 'I decided to look at it in a positive way. It’s a wake-up call. It means I haven't used a sunbed since and I never will again. 'It’s a wake-up call. It means I haven't used a sunbed since and I never will again...  I thought it would never happen to me. But it did' - Jo Irving . 'I always use a factor 30 or 50 when I’m out in the sun now. I used to use a factor 15 on my face so it didn’t go red, but on my body I’d start with a factor two, and a few days later I’d move to an oil. 'Now, I look back at pictures of myself when I went on the sunbeds all the time, and I looked ridiculous. 'All my friends used to joke and say I had ‘tanorexia’ because I could never see my true colour. 'I just thought they were jealous of my tan.' Ms Irving, who is engaged to her partner Bobby Jones, added: 'I hope sharing my story helps others. 'I want to get the message out about sunbeds. And to make people aware its not just moles they should check. 'They should look for other changes in their skin too. When I think about how often I went on sunbeds since my teens, I feel embarrassed. 'I see people coming out of sunbed salons and I feel sick. People don’t realise the damage they are doing.

"Footage has emerged of the moment locals made contact with a remote Amazonian tribe forced from their homes by drug traffickers and illegal logging. Campaigners believe the indigenous people on the Envira river, on Brazil's border with Peru, had their homes burned down and were shot at by Peruvian cocaine gangsters. They walked several days through the Amazon rainforest, before telling a translator in Brazil's Acre region their relatives had died and vultures had picked at the bodies they were unable to bury. Scroll down for video . First contact: This is the moment loincloth-clad natives of the Envira river region, on the border between Brazil and Peru in the Amazon rainforest, took an offering of bananas from locals living along the river's banks . Chase: The footage released by the Brazilian authorities showed locals wading out into the muddy river to deliver the bananas. They also took weapons and tools after their homes were reportedly burned down . The five young men and two young women, who were wearing loincloths and carrying bows and arrows, are believed to be part of a group of at least 50 natives isolated from the outside world. They first made contact on June 29 with the Ashaninka local people of northern Brazil, and spoke using the Panoan group of languages unique to the Brazil-Peru border. The Brazilian government's National Indian Foundation (FUNAI) intervened to protect the tribe, and released a video of the tribespeople accepting an offering of bananas. The video shows them shouting to locals across the wide, muddy river before taking axes and blades and returning to their homes. In one part of the footage, a tribesman is shown operating a rifle - though it is not known if the guns  returned with them to the village. Worrying change: Part of the footage showed one of the tribesmen handling a rifle after taking supplies from locals living along the riverbank. It is unclear whether the weapon was taken with him back to the village . Health danger: The natives, who were carrying bows and arrows, had to be treated for flu but survived . It is thought they came in search of basic tools and weaponry, but during their contact some of the tribespeople contracted the flu - which is often fatal for their immune systems. They were treated at an 'ethnoenvironmental protection base' in the Xinane indigenous region, which is protected for natives under Brazilian law. Anthropologist Terri Aquino told Brazilian news site G1: 'These people are in search of technology. This is important to their lives, because there is an internal ""war"" between them and the contact with other non-indigenous groups.' The government said they have now returned to their villages - but campaigners said they were still under threat. Fiona Watson, the research director at tribal rights group Survival International, said there were up to 600 uncontacted natives in the region whose lives were threatened by development. 'The latest situation is really serious and deeply worrying,' she told MailOnline. Offering: The video began with one of the local residents wading out into the river near the border with Peru . Approach: After a moment of debate in a language native to the border, the locals accepted the fresh fruit . 'What we think has happened, from piecing things together from what the uncontacted Indians have said to the interpreter, is they fled after their homes were set fire to and their relatives were shot at by white people in Peru. 'It tallies with information we have from Peru that drug traffickers are planting coca plants, making cocaine and trafficking it. 'Illegal logging is also happening in Peru and we believe this is pushing the people out. It is dismaying. 'All indigenous people have a very strong notion of territory. They've had their land invaded and been attacked. They mimicked firearms being shot at them and one talked about burying people. 'Others they couldn't bury and they said vultures ate the corpses.' She added: 'There are places that until 20 or 30 years ago were very remote, like the Amazon rainforest. Accepted: The five young men and two young women were dressed only in loincloths and live traditionally . Scenic: The Acre region of Brazil is home to around 600 uncontacted indigenous people, campaigners believe . 'Parts of it are still remote, but loggers, miners and settlers are pushing deeper into the rainforest and governments want to open it up for gas, oil and hydroelectric dams. 'That means more infrastructure is being built and the frontier is being brought down. 'Indigenous peoples are the vanguard in the protection of rainforests. There are hunter gatherers but there are also people who grow plants or fish in the rivers.' The group is running a petition calling for better resources to protect indigenous peoples' way of life. A spokesman for Brazil's National Indian Foundation said: 'In dialogues with indigenous group through interpreters, they reported that they suffered acts of violence committed by non-Indians in the headwaters of the river Envira, located in Peruvian territory . 'As this is the region of Brazil-Peru border and on these reports, measures that seek to ascertain the facts reported and implement an action plan under the Technical Cooperation Agreement signed between Funai and the Peruvian government in March this are being taken year, in order to protect isolated indigenous peoples and the territorial border monitoring in the region.'","Young men thought to be part of 50-strong group along Brazil's Envira River .

"Julia Gillard has taken a swipe at Labor colleagues, media commentators and her old sparring partner Tony Abbott in her first interview since leaving politics. Channel Nine's Ray Martin has told Triple M's 'The Grill Team' this morning that he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with the former Prime Minister, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'. 'There are a dozen books out at the moment, all of which I read in advance of this thing and all about that period of time, that dysfunctional Kevin 07,' Ray Martin said. Scroll down for video . Ray Martin says of Julia Gillard's interview 'she says she had no choice but to get rid of him (Kevin Rudd)' Channel Nine's Ray Martin says he came away from the three hour sit-down conversation with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, thinking that Mr Rudd was 'pretty treacherous'. Julia Gillard admits to Ray Martin that her 'real Julia' comment was 'my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister' 'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing.' The veteran journalist was asked whether the real Kevin Rudd was hidden from the Australian public. 'Right to the point where she suggests that, at the end, she says she had no choice but to get rid of him,' he said. Happier times between Gillard and Rudd but her interviewer told Triple M that 'they all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up' On the night she told Kevin Rudd she would challenge him for the leadership: . The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality. Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd)hope. I shouldn’t have done that. On Kevin Rudd after she had deposed him: . I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that. On her decision to campaign as the 'real' Julia: . I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister. On the 'odd couple' - her relationship with Tim: . You look at all of that and you say, how much of that is gender working, because would we think it was quite so odd if a male Prime Minister or a male chief executive officer of a big bank or whatever had a wife who worked as a hairdresser? Would we think that was kind of you know really, really odd? Why on earth did he marry her? She’s a hairdresser! I just don’t think it would occur to us. I think it was the gender thing a bit. But in terms of you know being supportive, Tim was there and, yes, there’s the blow-drying of the hair, but there’s so much more. On why she hasn’t married Tim: . It’s just the right decision for us and the right decision for me. We’ve just been joking about it, the various descriptors you can put on my forehead, I am an atheist, I’m not a person of faith, and so I don’t think about marriage in that religious sense. And I don’t feel that we need you know some ceremony or anything to you know make our relationship meaningful; it is meaningful. So it’s the right choice for us. On life at The Lodge and Kirribilli: . I’d had no life experience that prepared me for having ah staff around you in that close, intimate sense that staff in The Lodge or Kirribilli are. And I thought there’s only a couple of ways of reacting to this. You could pretend you were poncing around in Downton Abbey or something like that! Or you could just try and embrace it and make it an extended kind of family circumstance. On same sex marriage: . I’ve got what may be in the modern age a kind of old-fashioned, feminist view about can we, take the traditional institution of marriage and stretch it? Or do you create some other way of solemnising relationships and recognising them as of worth and status. And when I was a young feminist I would’ve said overwhelming the gay community was on that track too, but things have changed! I accept the course of human history now is that ah we are going to see same sex marriage here and in you know most parts of the developed world. 'They all knew how dysfunctional he was and they'd been covering him up. 'Certainly she (Julia Gillard) thinks he was heading for an emotional breakdown.' 'The way I tell it in the book is my side of it … you know…a very emotional time, if anything the accusations against me in politics and you still read in the newspapers you know the woman who wielded the knife, if anything the reputation I have from that night is one of political brutality,' Ms Gillard said. 'Actually in the moment I was hesitant, a conversation went too long, I certainly fed (Rudd) hope. I shouldn’t have done that. 'I thought his reaction would be one of hurt and acute distress. I know a lot now about what it feels like to lose the prime ministership, so I expected him to feel very, very battered and bruised. Obviously I was wrong about that.' Ray Martin revealed that Kevin Rudd was not the only Canberra connection or high-profile person targeted by the ex-Labor leader. 'She unloads on The Canberra Press Gallery, she says that's one of the things she doesn't miss, almost without exception,' he said. 'Alan Jones gets a fair thumping, in there for probably in her mind with good reason.' Not all the brickbats are reserved for others. Julia Gillard accepted full responsibility for her 'real Julia' claim, putting it down as a rookie mistake. She admits to Ray Martin that 'I put my hand up for that one hundred per cent. That’s my fault you know sort of dumb, dumb error, rookie error maybe. I mean I wasn’t a rookie in politics, I was a rookie at being prime minister'. But it's the revelations about then Foreign Minister Bob Carr which have raised eyebrows. 'Bob Carr as well, she says there was a mistake to a point, Bob Carr, that in fact when he got there he was lazy,' he added. 'I'm sure he's got a different opinion.' But Mr Carr has rejected the accusations that he was lazy. He told the Sydney Morning Herald today that 'I think she's saying this because I clearly disappointed her by switching to Rudd but as I said in my diaries I did so for one reason it was the very viability of the party we love'. Mr Carr, who recently released his own diary-based account of the tumultuous time which dripped the then Labor Government, stated that 'the great value of a diary is that it presents the daily reality of life and that's what my diary does, it demonstrates that I was totally engaged in a tough and demanding job'. Ray Martin pointed out that the ex-PM was warm during the interview and that she did not just focus internally, delivering some strong words on the current Prime Minister. 'She's fairly savage on Tony Abbott, as well,' he added. The former Australian Prime Minister was recently called to give evidence at the Royal Commission into Trade Union Corruption. During four hours of testimony, Ms Gillard denied having any knowledge of an illegal 'slush fund' and having any role in setting up an account for the Australian Workers Union Workplace Reform Association. While in the witness box Ms Gillard admitted that she may have done some things differently but added that 'none of us get to go in a time machine and go backwards'. The former Prime Minister takes a swipe at radio broadcaster Alan Jones during the interview with veteran tv journalist Ray Martin . Julia Gillard now says that appointing Bob Carr as Foreign Minister was a 'mistake' and describes him as 'lazy'. He has countered with 'I think she's saying this because I clearly disappointed her by switching to Rudd' Tony Abbott does not escape the wrath of Julia Gillard in her sit-down interview with Ray Martin . 'It's extraordinary, they covered him up for awful long time and it's not just her but they all say the same thing' according to interviewer Ray Martin . Ray Martin interviewed the former Prime Minister ahead of her book release. Up until today, much of the detail in the book had been kept a closely guarded secret. The interview airs tomorrow night at 6.50 on the Nine Network.","Former PM Julia Gillard tells how she thought Kevin Rudd was on the verge of a breakdown .

"Earning a fortune: Ex-PM Tony Blair is costing taxpayers more than £400,000 a year in pensions, public duties allowances and security costs . Tony Blair is costing taxpayers more than £400,000 a year despite building up a £30million fortune since leaving Downing Street. Figures have revealed that multi-millionaire Mr Blair is drawing the maximum Prime Ministerial pension – worth about £70,000 a year. The gold-plated pension comes on top of the £115,000 allowance that Mr Blair received last year to support his ‘public duties’. Then there is his security team, which is estimated to cost at least £250,000 a year. The revelation will anger taxpayers at a time of unprecedented public spending cuts and double-dip recession. The 59-year-old has built up a fortune estimated at more than £30million since leaving Downing Street in 2007. It was recently reported he earned a total of £20million last year from government advisory work, speeches and consultancy. On top of this, his company, Tony Blair Associates, is also generating several million pounds’ revenue. But now it has emerged that Mr Blair is also claiming the maximum pension which can be claimed by former Prime Ministers. In response to a Freedom of Information request, the Treasury confirmed that under the Parliamentary and Other Pensions Act 1972 former premiers are entitled to a pension ‘based on one half of salary at the time of leaving office’. This payment is regardless of length of service and former Prime Ministers do not have to make any contributions. A spokesman said: ‘We can confirm Tony Blair is being paid the pension he is entitled to under this legislation and that the pension was calculated on the salary that was due to a Prime Minister at the time Mr Blair left office.’ Pricey protection: Mr Blair is surrounded by his security team, which costs at least £250,000 a year . The Prime Ministerial element of Mr . Blair’s pay was £128,000 when he resigned – meaning he will have been . due to receive £64,000 a year. But increases to account for inflation over the past five years are likely to have taken that figure to about £75,000. Buying an equivalent pension in the private sector would cost well over £2million. Both of Mr Blair’s successors, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, have forgone the traditional ex-PM’s perk because it was too generous. Mr Brown announced he was giving up the pension when he entered Number 10, and reduced his overall salary from £197,000 to £150,000. Mr Cameron followed suit and now earns £142,500 after all Coalition ministers agreed to a 5 per cent pay cut in recognition of the UK’s financial straits. Differing perspectives: Both of Mr Blair's successors, Gordon Brown (right) and David Cameron (left) have forgone the traditional ex-PM pension because it was too generous . Every living ex-Prime Minister is also entitled to an allowance of more than £100,000 for ‘public duties’, such as attending public events. Last year, Mr Blair is believed to have claimed the maximum £115,000. In addition, the taxpayer also funds the former Prime Minister’s security team, estimated to cost £250,000 a year. The elite protection squad travels with Mr Blair on luxury holidays and international business trips. Since he left Downing Street, the former Prime Minister’s financial affairs have been shrouded in mystery. Mr Blair insists that he pays 50 per cent of income tax on all his earnings and that the money is ploughed back into philanthropic ventures. In an interview last year, he said: ‘If what I was interested in doing was making money I could make a lot more.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be astounded at the degree to which Tony Blair is still drawing on the public purse. ‘When former Prime Ministers are leaving office in their prime and earning millions as they strut the world stage, they should be thinking of ways to ease the burden they place on taxpayers.’","Mr Blair draws maximum PM pension of £70k a year .

"Hundreds of MPs – including Ed Miliband – have together claimed a total of £200,000 on expenses to pay their energy bills. Politicians have claimed up to £6,000 each for gas and electricity in their second homes, leaving hard-pressed taxpayers to pick up the bill. Some 340 MPs, some of them multi-millionaires, have taken advantage of the perk at a time when many people are struggling to pay rising utility bills. Even Labour leader Mr Miliband, who has attacked the Government over spiralling costs, claimed £403.59 for fuel at his constituency home in Doncaster. Claims: Ed Miliband, who has attacked the Government over spiralling costs, claimed £403.59 for fuel at his constituency home, while Nick Clegg claimed £254.29 for gas and electricity . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed £254.29 for electricity and gas in his Sheffield constituency home, but David Cameron and George Osborne did not take advantage of the privilege. The highest claimer was Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, who charged the public £5,822.27 for power at his £1million constituency home in the year to March. Eight of the top ten claims are from Tory MPs. Northern Ireland minister Andrew Robathan claimed £4,586, international development minister Alan Duncan claimed £3,998.06 and education minister Liz Truss claimed £2,579.67. Former Labour ministers Peter Hain and . Dame Margaret Beckett were both in the top five, with bills of £4,571 . and £3,960 respectively. The revelation brings back memories of the 2009 expenses scandal when MPs and peers were revealed to have exploited parliamentary allowances to subsidise their lifestyles in multiple homes. Mr Duncan, who was shadow Leader of the House during the 2009 scandal, was demoted by David Cameron after he was secretly filmed saying MPs were being made to live ‘on rations’ and had been treated ‘like ****’. All the claims are within parliamentary rules, which allow MPs to claim up to £20,100 in expenses for second homes – having been granted a £100 rise in April. But they come at a time of heightened tensions over rising fuel bills. The average dual fuel bill is set to hit £1,400 this winter as four of the Big Six energy firms – British Gas, nPower, Scottish Power and SSE – introduce inflation-busting price hikes of an average of 9.1 per cent. Bills of more than £1,000 were submitted by 41 MPs, while another 78 made claims for at least £500 for their second homes. Some 310 MPs did not claim anything. Shadow transport minister Mary Creagh claimed £2,182, while culture secretary Maria Miller asked for £2,011. Stratford-upon-Avon MP Mr Zahawi, who founded the polling firm YouGov, is seen as a rising Tory star and sits on David Cameron’s policy board. He and his wife Lana run a riding school and their second home is set in 31 acres. They also have a £5million London home. The bills were revealed in documents filed to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority between April 2012 and March 2013. MPs claimed £23million in personal expenses over this period. Under new rules since 2010, MPs are allowed to make claims on their second homes for gas and electricity, as well as rent, hotel stays, council tax, service charges and their phone and internet. But campaigners said constituents would feel outraged that well-off MPs were claiming for their fuel bills when voters are struggling. Labour MP John Mann, who has not submitted any claims, said: ‘There will be people including pensioners who can’t afford to heat their homes who will be furious to find out that MPs who can afford to pay them are putting in such high claims.’ Referring to a remark made recently by a Number 10 aide, he added: ‘Perhaps the MPs who have submitted claims should start wearing thicker jumpers.’ Expense: Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi, pictured right with Prime Minister David Cameron, claimed £5,822.27. Mr Cameron did not make a claim for his energy bills . Neil Jordan-Duncan of the National Pensioners Convention said: ‘Pensioners will be disgusted at how out of touch many MPs are, when many older people have to choose between heating and eating.’ And Clare Welton of the campaign group Fuel Poverty Action said: ‘It is little wonder that many MPs have done nothing to tackle fuel poverty in this country when they are immune from the price hikes by the profit-hungry Big Six energy companies.’ Mr Miliband’s spokesman said he had made ‘a legitimate claim’.","Politicians claimed a total of £200,000 on expenses for gas and electricity .

So THAT's her secret! Kim Kardashian pays a stylist £3,000 a day to perfectly tailor her jeans to fit her derriere, according to Grazia . According to Grazia, Kim and Kanye employ stylist Cornelius Clay to make alterations whenever the couple desire. 'It means Kim can buy jeans, have them altered and be photographed in them within a matter of hours,' revealed the source, who also claimed that Kim even gets her own Kardashian Kollection jeans tweaked. 'Kim has a size 4 [UK size 8] waist and size 10 [UK size 14] bottom, so she often has to buy a size up and have jeans taken in at the waist for a snug fit.

West complimented him on the way he was dressed, sparking a short conversation. The pair exchanged email addresses, and within weeks, Clay was hired. In his very first interview, published on the website of fashion label Opening Ceremony, Clay said that despite his conservative background, he had always had an eccentric personal style. At the age of ten, he had already shunned his school dress code in favour of his own personal uniform. 'My school had a dress code of khakis with collared shirts for the younger boys. Dissatisfied with the informality of khakis, I adopted a personal uniform of exclusively white turtlenecks, grey flannel trousers, and black & white spectator shoes.' He admits to being 'obsessed' with Nicki Minaj and cites Vogue veterans Anna Dello Russo and Grace Coddington as his favourite stylists.","Kim pays Cornelius Clay £3,000 a day to alter any pair of jeans she wants .

"A Minoan fresco of children boxing: New DNA analysis has debunked the theory that the Minoans were refugees from North Africa . DNA analysis has debunked the longstanding theory that the Minoans, who some 5,000 years ago established Europe's first advanced Bronze Age culture, were from Africa. The Minoan civilisation arose on the Mediterranean island of Crete in approximately the 27th century BC and flourished for 12 centuries until the 15th century BC. But the culture was lost until British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans unearthed its remains on Crete in 1900, where he found vestiges of a civilisation he believed was formed by refugees from northern Egypt. Modern archaeologists have cast doubt . on that version of events, and now DNA tests of Minoan remains suggests . they were descended from ancient farmers who settled the islands . thousands of years earlier. These people, it is believed, are from the same stock that came from the East to populate the rest of Europe. Evans . set to work on Crete in 1900 with a team of archaeologists soon after . the island was liberated from the yoke of the Ottoman empire, almost . immediately unearthing a great palace. He . named the civilisation he discovered after the legendary Greek king . Minos and, based on likenesses between Minoan artifacts and those from . Egypt and Libya, proposed that its founders migrated into the area from . North Africa. Since then, . other archaeologists have suggested that the Minoans may have come from . other regions, possibly Turkey, the Balkans, or the Middle East. But . now a joint U.S. and Greek team has made a mitochondrial DNA analysis of . Minoan skeletal remains to determine the likely ancestors of the ancient . people. Mitochondria, the . energy powerhouses of cells, contain their own DNA, or genetic code, and because mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mothers to their children . via the human egg, it contains information about maternal ancestry. Findings . suggest that the Minoan civilisation arose from the population already . living in Crete, and that these people were probably descendants of the . first humans to reach there about 9,000 years ago. Further, they found, the remains have the greatest genetic similarity with modern European populations. Senior . researcher Dr George Stamatoyannopoulos, professor of medicine and . genome sciences at the University of Washington, said the analysis . showed these people probably came to the area from the East, not the . South. Minoan Palace Ruins at Knossos: The Minoan culture, Europe's first advanced civilisation, arose on the Mediterranean island of Crete in approximately the 27th century BC and flourished for 12 centuries . 'About 9,000 years ago there was an extensive migration of Neolithic humans from the regions of Anatolia that today comprise parts of Turkey and the Middle East,' he said. 'At the same time, the first Neolithic inhabitants reached Crete. 'Our mitochondrial DNA analysis shows that the Minoans' strongest genetic relationships are with these Neolithic humans, as well as with ancient and modern Europeans. 'These results suggest the Minoan civilization arose 5,000 years ago in Crete from an ancestral Neolithic population that had arrived in the region about 4,000 years earlier. 'Our data suggest that the Neolithic population that gave rise to the Minoans also migrated into Europe and gave rise to modern European peoples.' Dr Stamatoyannopoulos and his team analysed samples from 37 skeletons found in a cave in Crete’s Lassithi plateau and compared them with mitochondrial DNA sequences from 135 modern and ancient human populations. The Minoan samples revealed 21 distinct mitochondrial DNA variations, of which six were unique to the Minoans and 15 were shared with modern and ancient populations. None of the Minoans carried mitochondrial DNA variations characteristic of African populations. Further analysis showed that the Minoans were only distantly related to Egyptian, Libyan, and other North African populations. Indeed, the Minoan shared the greatest percentage of their mitochondrial DNA variation with European populations, especially those in Northern and Western Europe. A restored clay vessel at the Palace of . Malia ruins: Sir Arthur Evans, who discovered the civilisation, . proposed his theory of its origin based on likenesses between Minoan . artefacts and those from Egypt and Libya . When plotted geographically, shared Minoan mitochondrial DNA variation was lowest in North Africa and increased progressively across the Middle East, Caucasus, Mediterranean islands, Southern Europe, and mainland Europe. The highest percentage of shared Minoan mitochondrial DNA variation was found with Neolithic populations from Southern Europe. The analysis also showed a high degree of sharing with the current population of the Lassithi plateau and Greece. In fact, the maternal genetic information passed down through many generations of mitochondria is still present in modern-day residents of the area where the Minoan skeletons were found. Dr Stamatoyannopoulos said he believes that the findings highlight the importance of DNA analysis as a tool for understanding human history. 'Genetic analyses are playing in increasingly important role and predicting and protecting human health,' he said. 'Our study underscores the importance of DNA not only in helping us to have healthier futures, but also to understand our past.'","British archaeologists who in 1900 discovered the Minoan culture believed they were from Libya or Egypt .

And plans are being made for the 26-year-old to return to these shores. Richards feels he is completely over the injury concerns that dogged the latter part of his career at City. Nevertheless, the England defender has found first team chances hard to come by in Florence, due in part to a change in formation from manager Vincenzo Montella, though he impressed in the side’s 3-1 win over Sassuolo at the weekend.

"A bitter spat between former Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating over who was most responsible for the success of Labor in the late 1980s, shows no sign of ending. The latest saga in this simmering feud, which has been running for nearly 30 years, involves Mr Hawke's recent appearance on ABC Television's Australian Story and contributions by cabinet colleagues of the time. Mr Keating takes aim at Gareth Evans, Ralph Willis and Kim Beazley for their rosy view of Mr Hawke's prime ministership. It's this way, no it's not. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating were a formidable combination as Prime Minister and Treasurer after Labor was returned to power in 1983. The partnership ended in 1991 when Hawke was toppled by Keating in a party room challenge for the top job . At odds. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating have had very different points of view on just who was most responsible for Labor's significant success while in power during the 1980s . Paul Keating (left) and Bob Hawke served as treasurer and Prime Minister from 1983 until 1991 in an era considered one of Labor's most successful in government . As far apart as ever. Bob Hawke was pictured next to Julia Gillard at the Gough Whitlam State Memorial Service and Paul Keating alongside Kevin Rudd . He also dismisses as a 'tawdry hagiography' a book written by Mr Hawke's wife Blanche d'Alpuget in 2010. 'As he often does, he uses relatives, friends and colleagues to do the rebutting for him,' Mr Keating said of Mr Hawke in The Australian. Mr Keating argues Mr Hawke was a lucky prime minister, as well as a good one. But he uses published accounts of the time, including by Ms d'Alpuget, to back his argument that Mr Hawke was paralysed by inertia in the years following a traumatic personal issue involving his daughter in 1984. One of the few occasions in which Keating and Hawke have been pictured together was following a State Funeral for former NSW Premier Neville Wran in Sydney on May 1st this year . Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating are pictured chatting at the Gough Whitlam State Memorial Service . Bob Hawke greets Julia Gillard at last week's Gough Whitlam State Memorial Service . Mr Keating says no word would have been uttered by him about those 'vanishing' years, had Mr Hawke not distorted history in his own memoir. 'But Bob, as he often does, overdid it - he baited me one time too often,' he said. 'And no apologia by his mates, no matter how well meant or sentimental, can change the truth that obtained at the core of his government's management.' Both Keating and Hawke received rousing receptions inside and outside of the Sydney Town Hall at last week's Gough Whitlam Memorial Service but arguably the biggest cheer was reserved for Julia Gillard.","30 years on the Paul Keating - Bob Hawke spat takes another bitter twist .

"Police fired Tasers at a terrified Alzheimer’s sufferer in a troubling incident that reopens the debate on the controversial weapon. Six officers were called to take the unarmed 58-year-old man to hospital but he had no idea what was going on and lashed out at them. What happened next left his wife ‘heartbroken’ and his neighbours in tears. Shocking: Police shot former farm worker Peter Russell with several Taser stun rounds, before manhandling him to the living room floor. He is pictured with his wife . Diane at their wedding in September 2010 . Police shot former farm worker Peter Russell with several Taser stun rounds, before manhandling him to the living room floor. His arms and legs were tied together and he was carried outside ‘like a bag of potatoes’ in full view of horrified neighbours. Mr Russell, described by his wife as a ‘loving’ family man ‘who wouldn’t hurt a fly,’ was then put into a police van and driven off. Two months later, Mr Russell is still receiving psychiatric treatment in hospital and his wife Diane, 50, remains traumatised. She has criticised the behaviour of doctors and police officers and has spoken out ‘to prevent other families suffering the same needless ordeal’. Mother-of-two Mrs Russell, of Epworth, North Lincolnshire, said: ‘There was no need to use the Tasers. ‘If he was a wife beater or an armed  robber then I could understand it, but this is someone who will stop his tractor when ploughing a field and move a nest of mice to the side.’ Ordeal: Diane and Pete Russell are pictured together at a pub in Epsworth, North Lincolnshire. Two months after the incident, Mr Russell is still receiving psychiatric treatment in hospital and his wife remains traumatised . Traumatised: Diane Russell stands on the driveway outside her house where police officers laid her husband Pete, 58, after shooting him with a taser . Police chiefs have backed the officers’ actions, saying they faced ‘a significant level of violence’ from Mr Russell. But the incident raises issues about the understanding and appropriate treatment of people suffering from dementia. Mr Russell, who has a daughter from a . previous marriage and married Diane in September 2010, began being . forgetful about three years ago. He went to hospital for a scan and Alzheimer’s disease was diagnosed. The farm worker was forced to retire and over recent months his condition became worse. Mrs Russell said he began ‘pushing’ her and doctors decided to section him under the Mental Health Act to review his treatment. On March 6, two nurses and a psychiatrist visited the couple’s home and Mr Russell became agitated at hearing talk of him going to hospital. Mrs Russell said he began swearing and ‘slamming cupboards’. She suggested he be given sweets and his favourite Noddy toy to calm him and then be driven to hospital by a neighbour. But this was rejected and the medical staff were told to go outside because they were upsetting Mr Russell. Several hours later, a doctor, . hospital consultant and social worker arrived and discussed calling an . ambulance. Mr Russell became agitated again. The  doctors left and . police arrived to handle the hospital transfer. Mrs . Russell was told to go into the kitchen and it was then that her . husband ‘lashed out’. She said ‘five or six’ officers went into the . living room. After he was tasered, a policewoman came into the kitchen crying and told Mrs Russell: ‘We didn’t want to do this, but we had no option.’ Mrs Russell said: ‘He was fighting them off because he didn’t want to go to hospital. He was petrified and scared. He was shouting “get off” as they carried him. I was going mental and I remember saying “it’s not him, it’s the Alzheimer’s”. Defence: A police spokesman claimed that the officers were faced with a significant level of violence . Concern: The Alzheimer's Society said the incident, which happened in Epworth in North Lincolnshire, would have been very distressing for Mr Russell . ‘He was not armed and wasn’t about to kill himself, they should not have tasered him.’ Neighbour Jez Taylor, 58, said: ‘The treatment he received was disgusting.’ Mrs Russell said she may lodge a formal complaint to police. Chief Superintendent David Hilditch, of Humberside Police, said: ‘The officers were faced with a significant level of violence. It is to their credit that they successfully restrained the man without injury to himself.’ Two police officers are believed to have suffered minor injuries in the incident. Sarah Moody from the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘This unfortunate incident illustrates a lack of understanding in society of dementia and the best way to support and help people who are affected by this devastating condition.’","Police shot Peter Russell with several Taser stun rounds, before manhandling him to the living room floor .

"Japanese whalers carved up a whale in front of a crowd of schoolchildren and later offered them free samples of the animal's fried meat, in a demonstration to mark the opening of the country's whaling season. Employees of Gaibo Hogei whaling company carried out the annual event in the coastal town of Minamiboso in the Wada district, south of Tokyo, in order to educate the young students who were on a school excursion. Their teacher Michiyo Masuda told Reuters eating whales was common in the district and most families would eat it at least once per season. Scroll down for video . Grade school students look at a Baird's Beaked whale before it was carved at Wada port in Minamiboso, southeast of Tokyo . The demonstration was put on to mark the start of Japan's whaling season . 'If we are eating whales, we have the responsibility to see and learn how they're prepared,' Mr Masuda said. The practice of whaling is controversial and while whaling for scientific purposes in the Southern Ocean was banned by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in March, coastal whaling is allowed. Gaibo Hogei president Yoshinori Shoji, who gave the demonstration to the children, told them to close their eyes if they were scared. The Baird's beaked whale was chopped into pieces, carved into, and had its entrails removed as the students looked on. Workers used a large knife to slice into the whale's thick blubber, as some students admired their skilfulness while others became distressed. Japanese whalers carved up a whale in front of a crowd of schoolchildren and later offered them free samples of the animal's fried meat . The students' teacher said eating whales was common in the district and most families would eat it at least once per season . In the past week Mr Shoji's company, which processes whale meat for eating, has killed six Baird's beaked whales, and will catch another 24 before the whaling season ends. He said that his company's practices are lawful, because the ICJ ruling only deals with whaling for scientific research. 'It's our right to take and eat whale within our waters,' Mr Shoji told Reuters. Greenpeace spokesman Nathaniel Pelle said there was no need for Japan to engage in commercial whaling. 'There's no food security issue for the Japanese they're quite able to get protein,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Workers used tools to slice into the whale's thick blubber, as some students admired their skilfulness while others became distressed . The Baird's beaked whale was chopped into pieces, carved into, and had its entrails removed at the students looked on . 'In fact they're the world's biggest consumers of seafood and just like all whale meat this is rejected by most of Japan. 'These kinds of public relations events are a desperate attempt to win favour with a public that increasingly doesn't want to eat whale meat.' In March, the International Court of Justice ruled that Japan's Antarctic whaling program was not scientific as Japan had claimed and must stop. Japan has suspended next season's Antarctic hunt but is seeking to revise and resume it. In the past week Gaibo Hogei, which processes whale meat for eating, has killed six Baird's beaked whales and will catch another 24 before the whaling season ends . During the 2013-14 season, Japan caught 251 minke whales in the Antarctic, or just a quarter of its target, and 224 others in the northern Pacific program. Japan has slashed the Pacific catch target by nearly half - to about 210 - for this year. The court said Japan's Antarctic research program produced little actual research and failed to explain why it needed to kill so many whales for the study. The ruling left Japan the option of retooling its Antarctic program, but any new plan is likely to face intense scrutiny.

"Russia and Qatar have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after a corruption probe ruled there were no grounds for reopening the controversial bidding process. But there was severe embarrassment for England after the world governing body's ethics committee launched a scathing attack over its doomed bid for the 2018 event. The verdict by FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert on the investigation into the murky World Cup bids concludes that Qatar and Russia did not do anything that warranted stripping them of the tournament. Astonishingly, he reserved his strongest language for the England campaign, reprimanding its attempts to woo the support of disgraced former FIFA committee member Jack Warner. He also criticised England for a $55,000 (£35,000) sponsorship of a gala dinner, but let Qatar off lightly for a similar $1.8million (£1.1million) deal. Scroll down for video . Russia and Qatar (announced, above, by FIFA president Sepp Blatter in 2010) have been cleared to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after a corruption probe ruled there were no grounds for reopening the bids . Eckert's long-awaited findings accused England on a number of occasions of 'damning the integrity of the bidding process and the image of FIFA' in chasing Warner's vote. England 2018 were reprimanded for finding a job for a friend of Warner, hosting a Caribbean Football Union dinner, setting up a training camp for a Trinidad Under-20 team and offering help to Warner's Joe Public football side. The 42-page summary by the chairman of FIFA's ethics adjudicatory chamber into 430-page report by New York lawyer Michael Garcia will cause considerable embarrassment to the FA as well as anger. Relationships between the FA and FIFA, already at rock bottom, will take a long time to recover from these findings. The FA considered their bid for the 2018 World Cup to be the most transparent of the nine countries involved and the monies spent on the breaches of bidding regulations listed by Eckert are a fraction compared with Qatar's spending. Click here to read the full verdict by the FIFA ethics judge . England have been criticised for trying to woo disgraced former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner . Lord Triesman was FA Chairman from 2008-10 and 2018 CEO Andy Anson led the bidding process . And while some countries, especially 2018 hosts Russia, were highly unco-operative with Garcia's investigation, England look to have suffered for being so open about all their bid activity. An FA spokesman said: 'We strongly refute any suggestions of impropriety by those involved in the England bid.' And Conservative MP Damian Collins said FIFA's report is a whitewash, adding: 'FIFA are trying to con people that there has been a proper independent inquiry when there hasn't been'. As expected, Eckert names and shames Warner, the biggest rogue in the FIFA gallery who has resigned all his football positions. Despite England's lavishing attention on him and him promising his support to Prince William and PM David Cameron in person, Warner reneged on his vote. Also singled out is Qatari Mohamed bin Hammam, who has been banned from football for life. But Eckert rules that his cash for votes bribes activity was connected with his aborted bid for the FIFA presidency rather than the 2022 World Cup bid. The FA came fire for trying to woo former FIFA vice president Warner (second left, with David Beckham) Warner promised Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron he would vote for England - then reneged .

FIFA investigator Michael Garcia clasping at Mulberry bags which caused controversy during England's World Cup 2018 bid . And a further blow to the FA's reputation will be former FA chairman Lord Triesman being named by Eckert for not co-operating – due to legal reasons – with Garcia's investigation. Qatar spent $1.8m on sponsoring the African confederation CAF's Congress in 2010. Eckert said that created a 'negative impression but the circumstances were not suited to affect the integrity of the FIFA World Cup.' And in conclusion about Qatar, whose hosting of the tournament in 2022 has been mired in controversy since the December 2010 vote in Zurich, Eckert writes: 'The potentially problematic facts and circumstances identified by the report regarding the Qatar 2022 bid were, all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the World Cup 2018/2022 bidding process as a whole.' The same wording is used to clear England of 'all in all, not suited to compromise the integrity of the World Cup bidding process.' But nevertheless, Eckert went into a lot more detail about England's transgressions and the 'potentially problematic conduct of certain individuals in the light of relevant FIFA ethics rules.' Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani holds the World Cup after Qatar win the bid to host the 2022 tournament . And Eckert passes the buck back to Garcia's investigatory chamber to take 'appropriate steps of it deems such measures appropriate and feasible.' This means that Garcia has full independence to discipline specific individuals involved in the England bid. Eckert reported that the England team 'often accommodated Mr Warner's wishes in apparent violation of bidding rules and the FIFA code of ethics.' The first transgression was 'to help a person of interest to him find a part-time job in the UK and not only provided the individual concerned with employment opportunities but also kept Mr Warner apprised of their efforts as they solicited his support for the bid. 'And England 2018 gave the appearance that it sought to confer a personal benefit on Mr Warner in order to influence his vote.' An artist's impression of how the 45,330 capacity Al Khor stadium located in the north east of Qatar will look . England also provided 'substantial assistance' to setting up a training camp for an Under 20 Trinidad and Tobago Football Federation in the UK in the summer of 2009 in response to Mr Warner's 'improper demands.' Warner also asked for favours and benefits around his Trinidad team the Joe Public Football Team and email correspondence showed that 'England football offocials appeared willing to do so.' Eckert said Warner repeatedly used his power in FIFA as a vice-president on the executive committee and the CONCACAF confederation overlord to exact personal benefits in violation of the FIFA code of ethics. And that 'England 2018's response showed a willingness, time and again, to meet such expectation, thereby damaging the image of FIFA and the bidding process.' The fourth England misdemeanour highlighted by Eckert was sponsoring a gala dinner for the Caribbean Football Union at its annual Congress in Trinidad in 2010 'once again in an effort to curry favour' with Warner. 'The relevant support amounted to $55,000 suggested by Mr Warner. The England bid team bowed to that pressure because of Mr Warner's potential vote and in this way damaged the integrity of the bidding process.' Fans in Qatar celebrate on the streets as their country are awarded the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . England were also mentioned for agreeing a memorandum of understanding with the Oceania Football Confederation led by President Reynald Temarii, later banned from the FIFA ExCo after accepting bribes in a newspaper sting, for development projects. Eckert writes that that England 2018 granted Mr Temarii 'considerably preferential treatment in terms of allocating football development projects.' Lord Triesman is singled out for speaking out at a Culture, Media and Sport Committee meeting under privilege about unethical conduct by four FIFA ExCo members making improper requests for favours from the England bid team. But Triesman, who resigned in May 2010 as FA and England bid chairman, was criticised by Eckert for waiting until after the vote before making is accusations and not helping the Garcia investigation. And Eckert had yet another jibe at England saying they had 'accommodated or at least attempted to satisfy the improper requests made by these Executive Committee members, thereby jeopardising the integrity of the bidding process.' The report by US attorney Michael Garcia has cleared Qatar and Russia to host their World Cups . Other countries get off remarkably lightly for what seem far more serious breaches. Spain, one of England 2018's rivals, are hardly mentioned apart from the fact they were 'highly unco-operative.' And Russia 'made only a limited amount of documents available'. This was explained by the computers used during the bid having been leased. They were then returned to the owner and subsequently destroyed along with any email trails. FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the great survivor who set to be voted in for a fifth term next May, escapes blame and Eckert says he, 'deserves credit for the cooperation FIFA demonstrated throughout this investigation.' But Eckert, in almost his only show of true independence, supports the term limits for the FIFA president that the body's congress rejected in 2014.","FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert slams England's bid for 2018 .

"A performance artist has given her baby son the greatest art debut possible - after he was born inside a gallery as part of a live exhibition. The Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York, said Marni Kotak's son Ajax was healthy and weighed 9lbs 2oz when he was born yesterday at 10.17am. The 36-year-old artist - who said giving birth is the 'highest form of art' - had set up a home-birth centre at the gallery. Art: The website of The Microscope Gallery in Brooklyn, New York, where Marni Kotak gave birth announced that the child was a healthy baby boy, weighing 9lbs 2oz . She had turned the space into a brightly decorated bedroom with ocean blue walls and photo-imprinted pillows. The gallery would not confirm how many people witnessed the birth, but an audience of 15 had been expected. Katarina Hybenova wrote on bushwickdaily.com that Kotak experienced the 'unforgettable moment' surrounded by a small group of family members, friends and 'handful of randomly chosen participants'. She said: 'I was one of the lucky ones attending, and the atmosphere in the gallery was magical. I believe that all of the participants were deeply moved by this emotional, raw and true 'piece of art'. 'I feel like the entire audience accomplished this together with Marni, using the commonly created positive energy.' Araceli Cruz, of the VillageVoice blog, said she just missed out on witnessing the birth. She also revealed, in a post, that the baby was to be called Ajax, and that he measured 21 inches long. All set: Marni is now terrified of the media attention but her painter-artist husband Jason Robert Bell spoke briefly Wednesday . She said: 'We first received notice that the baby was coming soon at 9.34am and rushed to the quaint gallery. 'Although . we were one of the select few to attend the live birth, an art . performance/installation by Marni Kotak, we, unfortunately, didn't . arrive in time. 'What we did find when we entered the steamy space, which the artist converted into a birthing centre, was Kotak calmly eating a banana, the placenta in a bowl and the baby's father, Jason, holding his son who was wrapped in a blue towel. 'The beautiful baby boy was wide-eyed, and as quiet as could be, staring blankly into the camera and video lenses that hovered above him.' A video of the birth will be added to forthcoming exhibition at the gallery, and forms the start of an 18 year project which called Raising Baby X, where Kotak will document her child's upbringing until college with weekly video podcasts. Kotak launched the exhibition on October 8 and the gallery's opening hours were extended so that she could develop a rapport with members of the public. Marni laughs as her artist-painter husband Jason Bell, plays with a rubber ball that is part of the birthing room . She and her painter-husband, Jason Bell, did not know the baby's gender prior to the birth. She said, last week, that those who had spent time talking to her about motherhood, birth and art and learning about the project would be notified when she went into labour. And she also revealed that, if she went into labour at home then she would move to the gallery. She said she did not plan to talk to her audience, but that: 'I never know how a performance will progress and sometimes unexpected things happen.' Marni, whose childhood was spent in Norwood, Massachusetts, said all her performances focused on everyday life experiences. She has been re-enacting events from her life for more than 10 years, including her own birth, losing her virginity in 'a sunny blue Plymouth' and her grandfather's funeral. Jill McDermid, a curator and co-director of the performance art Grace Exhibition Space in Brooklyn, called Marni's work 'daring, challenging and honest.' And she said people should not be shocked. No photographs or video were taken of the birth, as only Mr Bell was allowed to film so that the exhibition will be unique. The exhibition runs until November 7.

"A mysterious 'crop circle' that appeared in a California barley field a week ago has been explained: it was a publicity stunt for a tech company. Nvidia Corporation, a company that makes chips for computers and smart phones, owned up to the stunt at a press conference in Las Vegas Sunday. CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said he had given his marketing department a small budget and a mission to promote the company's new Tegra K1 chip. Scroll down for videos . Mystery: This intricate marking cropped up in a field in California on Monday morning . Debate: Some people see the crop circle as proof of alien visitation while others think it was made by humans . Discovery? A YouTube video uploaded by an anonymous user claims to show the first finding of the circle when two friends noticed a flashing green light in the field beside the road . The marketing department delivered, with the 'crop circle' and accompanying YouTube video garnering widespread attention. The crop circle near Chualar, California, contained a stylized image of a computer chip and the number '192' in Braille. On Sunday, the company announced the Tegra K1, a new chip for tablets and smartphones that contains 192 computing 'cores,' or mini-computers, for graphics applications. In the new Tegra K1, the graphics component based on its ""Kepler"" design, used in high-end PCs. The chip would makes for a tablet more powerful than an Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 game console, while consuming one-twentieth the power. 'We've bridged the gap - we've brought mobile computing to the same level as desktop computing,' Huang said. The 192 cores in the new chip compare to Nvidia's previous flagship, the Tegra 4, with 72 graphics cores. Huang demonstrated near photo-realistic simulations of environments and human faces, run on the new chip. He said Epic Games will adapt the next version of its Unreal Engine, the basis for many popular games, so that it will work on the chip. He didn't announce when the chip would be available or any gadget makers that were adopting it. The . giant markings caused believers to claim that aliens had landed in . Salinas Valley, while crop circle experts were quick to claim that the . shape, which resembles a computer chip, was a hoax. An anonymous video surfaced on YouTube . that claimed to show the first discovery of the circle, after two . friends noticed flashing lights in a field and got out of their car to . investigate. The first pictures of the markings were taken by photographer Julie Belanger of the 111th Aerial Photography Squadron who flew over the site near Chualar, ten miles south of Salinas. Berlanger told KSBW: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful... I believe it's possible that aliens exist, but I don't know if they would bother making a crop circle to give us a message.' The YouTube video claimed to show two men finding the markings after they witnessed green flashing lights next to the road. The footage showed the men leaving their car and climbing over the fence into the field. While the green lights flickered few more times the cameraman focused on the flattened plants. At one point one of the friends said: 'Dude, are you seeing this? Dude, this is a crop circle.' After walking in the field for a couple of minutes the men appeared the panic and run back to their vehicle. 'A friend and I were driving on Chualar Canyon Road south of Salinas, California before sunrise, and THIS happened,' the YouTube user known only as Cannot Say commented on the video. View from above: Aerial photographer Julie Belanger shot the circle from a helicopter . Impressive sight: 'It was beautiful. Quite beautiful,' said the aerial photographer who shot the marking . 'Needless to say, pretty wild, but we slipped away and it's too good not to share. Created this account since I don't want this tied to me. Still not sure what to make of it.' Many people were not convinced that the markings were proof of an alien visitation. The Monterey Herald reported that the site was being protected by security guards on Monday, but they would not name the client they were working for. Jeffrey Wilson of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association also told the paper that there were several signs that the circles were made by human rather than extra-terrestrial life. Wilson pointed out that the marking was too well aligned with the road, the center of the circle resembled braille and that the YouTube video could have been a form of viral marketing. 'My guess is that ... it is commissioned work for an advertisement,' Wilson explained to the Herald. 'Or a commissioned work for a production company making a documentary on crop circles or for some kind of film.' Proof?

"George Osborne today hailed a surprise fall in inflation to a five-year low which means a rise in interest rates could be delayed until the middle of next year. Cheaper travel, restaurants, books and gadgets like tablets and laptops meant the CPI rate of inflation was just 1.2 per cent in September, well below the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent, and the lowest since September 2009. Low inflation removes any immediate pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates amid the continuing uncertain recovery in the wider economy. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne appeared on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street today, pulling a series of bizarre poses . The Chancellor's hand gestures were compared to those of comedian Tommy Cooper, whose catchphrase was 'just like that' The Office for National Statistics said the fall from 1.5 per cent in August had been sharper than expected. For the fifth month in a row food bills fell, down by 1.4 per cent year-on-year, the steepest drop since June 2002. The coalition's triple lock in pensions means the state pension will still rise by 2.5 per cent. Mr Osborne said: 'We have a double-dose of good economic news for families and for pensioners. The increase in prices is much lower than expected. And that helps families. 'And the pension next year will go up by more than double the rate of inflation thanks to the Government's triple-lock. 'So it's an example today of how the long-term economic plan is not just working, but working for you.' The Chancellor seemed in good spirits in Downing Street today as he posed for the cameras with Australia's Treasurer Joe Hockey. At one stage Mr Osborne appeared to be mimicking the hand gestures of 1970s comedian Tommy Cooper. Mr Osborne seemed in good spirits as he hailed a 'double dose' of good news for families and pensioners . Mr Osborne was appearing in front of the door to Number 11 to welcome Australia's Treasurer Joe Hockey . Today's figures reveals the longest sustained period of flat or falling food prices since the end of 2004. Low inflation is good news for millions of families who have been struggling to cope with rising bills. Latest figures show that average wages are rising by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, so even with 1.2 per cent inflation incomes are being outstripped by rising prices. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It's good news that inflation remains low. Our long-term economic plan is delivering more financial security and stability for families. 'Today's inflation figures mean a big real-terms increase in the state pension next year - helping people who've worked hard all their lives.' The Bank of England targets inflation at 2 per cent but it has now been below this level for nine months in a row. With inflation falling, the Bank will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show the CPI rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent . Cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation, the ONS said . London properties continue to pull away from the rest of the country, according to this morning's ONS figures . Britain's house price boom is showing no sign of slowing – after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year. The average cost of a house in the UK hit a new high of £274,000 in August, as increases in London and the South East fuelled a nationwide jump in prices. In the capital property prices jumped by 19.6 per cent – with the average home now worth £514,000. The increasing cost of housing is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder. In August, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12.9 per cent higher on average than the same time last year. The average price for properties bought by first-time buyers increased was £210,000. England continued to see the largest house price growth across the UK – with properties going up in value by 12.2 per cent in the year to August. The cost of buying a home in Wales was up 4.7 per cent, while in Scotland prices jumped 6.7 per cent. Northern Ireland also enjoyed strong house price growth – with property values up 9.6 per cent over the year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months,. 'This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policy-makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months. 'While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.' ING Bank economist James Knightley said: 'With inflation substantially below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate, there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon. 'This means our February prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early.' Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, said: 'We have long been expecting the Bank of England to first raise interest rates from 0.50 per cent to 0.75 per cent in February - but it is looking ever more likely that the Bank will delay acting until nearer mid-year.' The pound fell sharply today as the sharper-than expected inflation drop meant it was less likely that the Bank of England will need to take action soon to raise interest rates from their five-year low of 0.5 per cent. The ONS said there were three key factors in the fall in inflation: transport, recreation and culture, and restaurants and hotels. The cost of transport fell by 2.4 per cent between August and September, especially for air and sea fares, as travel firms cut costs after the summer holidays. Under recreation and culture, prices fell by 0.1 per cent. The ONS said: 'Much of the downward contribution came from price movements for technological goods such as laptop and tablet computers, computer accessories (eg printers and routers), games consoles and computer games. 'Prices for hardback books and ebooks also contributed to the slowdown in the rate of inflation.' Prices in restaurants and hotels rose at a slower rate between August and September, with the downward contribution coming from price movements in restaurants, cafes and canteens. The figures also showed that petrol fell by 0.8p per litre in September compared with the previous month, and diesel by 0.7p, amid tumbling oil prices. The CPI figure means that state pensions will rise by 2.5 per cent or £2.85 a week next spring as the Government's 'triple lock' ensures an increase of whichever is the greater out of average earnings, September's inflation rate or 2.5 per cent. Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: 'This below target inflation number is good news for everyone, but will help pensioners in particular as the Liberal Democrat flagship 'Triple Lock' policy will kick in to give an above inflation pension increase. 'The Triple Lock delivers a pension rise of whichever is the greater of average earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent. 'This means that next year the basic state pension will rise by 2.5 per cent or £2.85 a week. With Liberal Democrats in Government the basic state pension has risen by over £950.' Labour's shadow treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: 'The squeeze on working people continues despite this fall in the rate of inflation. 'Total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent, which is half the rate of CPI inflation announced today.'","CPI rate of inflation falls to 1.2%, Office for National Statistics said .

"Carl Cooper thought he was doing a public service by offering seven benefits claimants the chance to work for him. But the company boss was flabbergasted when none of them turned up on the first day. Astonishingly, not a single one even had the courtesy to tell the marketing firm boss they would not be coming in. Empty desks: Businessman Carl Cooper today slammed 'work shy' Britain after seven of his new recruits failed to turn up to their first day of work yesterday because it was raining . Mr Cooper and other staff members called the new employees to ask them . where they were. Initially, some refused to answer their phones  when . they recognised the number calling them. When the staff finally got through, five said they would be better off . staying on state benefits rather than doing the commission-based work. Four of the seven also claimed  torrential rain had put them off. One was unhappy about the prospect of paying a £5 train fare and another called at 12.45pm and said: 'Oh, sorry – I overslept.' The saga illustrates the problems of enticing many young people to work, even at a time of recession and high unemployment. Yesterday Mr Cooper, who runs Car Smart, a marketing firm for . independent car dealers in Canterbury, Kent, criticised the benefits . system and said it rewarded people for doing nothing. He added: 'I was . left stunned when none of the new recruits turned up for work. They are a . bunch of workshy layabouts. Mr Cooper with his job advert. Astonishingly, some of those who failed to show up told him they would be better off staying on state benefits - and could not be bothered to spend £5 getting to work . 'These are people who are so morally twisted that they would rather stay on the dole than work. 'People keep saying there are not enough jobs in the UK but the real . problem is that there are not enough determined or ambitious people. 'The benefit system is too generous and encourages the unemployed to stay unemployed and just breeds more laziness.' Mr Cooper, 26, placed adverts for sales positions on the JobCentre . website, which is run by the Department for Work and Pensions. Those claiming benefits must apply for a certain number of jobs each . week and attend any job interviews they get to ensure they keep . receiving handouts. Claimants must also take up jobs offered to them, unless the conditions of the work do not 'fit their circumstances'. Mr Cooper said all his employees received a basic retainer of £100 a . week initially and are enrolled on to the company’s commission . structure, which could see earnings rise to up to £400 a week. The jobseekers who failed to turn up will not lose their benefits because the basic pay is under the minimum wage.

"Tirade from beyond the grave: George MacDonald Fraser branded political correctness an evil as big a threat to free speech as communism and fascism . Sir Harry Paget Flashman couldn’t have put it better. George MacDonald Fraser, author of the Flashman novels, branded political correctness an ‘insidious’ and ‘dishonest’ evil as big a threat to free speech as communism and fascism. The author of 12 books chronicling the further adventures of the sadistic bully from Tom Brown’s Schooldays, launched his tirade in an unpublished memoir just discovered by his family. MacDonald Fraser, who died in 2008 aged 82, wrote: ‘My chief concern is the kind of prejudice rooted in the fear of being thought illiberal. Such attitudes are dangerous and intellectually dishonest. 'But then, political correctness is by definition dishonest and is, I believe, the most insidious doctrine to plague the Western world since those abominable soul mates communism and fascism with which it has more in common than its dupes seem to realise. ‘It cannot face truth; it rejects what is, simply because what is does not suit what the politically correct thinking ought to be.’ The comments are likely to delight fans of his books who love the character’s bad behaviour. Flashman’s womanising, heavy drinking, casual racism, bullying and outrageous cowardice make him one of the most un-PC characters in the whole of English literature. MacDonald Fraser, who wrote several Hollywood film scripts, also recalls how he was forced  to remove a scene based on real events where unscrupulous white whisky traders peddled alcohol to Plains Indians for fears scenes of drunken ‘Native Americans’ would upset their descendants. Bully: Malcolm McDowell as Flashman and his co-star Britt Ekland in Royal Flash, based on a Flashman book . He writes: ‘They wouldn’t like  to think that it happened, so it musn’t be shown happening, even though it did. God help history.’ His family discovered the manuscript, called The Bug Of Senachie, six weeks ago while sorting out his collection of papers. A Senachie is a teller of tales from the Scottish Highlands. The manuscript is not dated  but the author’s reference in it to having written 11 Flashman books means it was written between 1999 and 2005.

The group that has kidnapped Miss Ramelli and Miss Marzullo have not yet been formally identified, but Jordanian newspaper Assabeel was . quoted as saying investigators believe they an armed Islamist group . which has previously kidnapped Western activists and journalists. Although official details of the kidnapping remain sketchy, the newspaper cites a local activist as saying the women were kidnapped on August 1 and taken to the town of El Ismo, west of Aleppo where they were transported to the home of the head of the local 'Revolutionary Council'. The newspaper claimed the activist told them that details of the abduction came from Italian journalist Daniele Raineri of Il Foglio, who they say was taken along with the woman but managed to escape. Speaking to the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera today, Miss Marzullo's father said he had pleaded with his daughter not to travel to Syria to distribute aid, but she had insisted on doing so. Conflict zone: The two Italian aid workers were kidnapped in the north Syrian city of Aleppo . Friends: While Vanessa Marzullo (left) and Greta Ramelli (right) were studying at the University of Milan, their interest in activism grew - as did their desire to travel to Syria and help refugees . Apparently speaking in a voice cracked with emotion and anxiety, Salvatore Marzullo said: 'What could I do? Vanessa is an adult, a golden girl, brave and responsible. I tried to reason with her, I tried to convince her in every way I could not to do what she had in mind.' 'But when you realize that all your talk, your thoughts, and eventually all your prayers are not heard, what can you do?,' he added. 'I could not stop her from doing what she wanted. It's not like you can take a person and tie them down. Tell me what I had to do. Was I wrong? I had to tie her down?,' he went on to say. Mr Marzullo said his daughter had long sympathised with the plight on Syrians and had taken part in a number of protests and demonstrations in her home city of Bergamo. While studying Linguistic and Cultural Mediation at the University of Milan, her interest in activism grew - as did her desire to travel to Syria and help. Mr Marzullo said the family - including younger brother Mario - tried to convince the 21-year-old to stay in Italy and set up a foundation, but she said it wouldn't be enough and that she must do more.

Headstrong: Salvatore Marzullo said his family tried to convince Vanessa (right) to stay in Italy and set up a foundation, but she said it wouldn't be enough and that she must do more to help Syrians . According to their Facebook pages, the two women have made several visits to Syria since 2012. On their latest trip they flew to Turkey before sneaking into Syria through Atma - a huge refugee camp on the border between the two countries - according to La Stampa. Miss Ramelli's most recent Facebook update was on July 31 and showed a picture of a young boy holding a rifle in a heavily shelled area of Aleppo. Meanwhile Miss Marzullo's latest post read: 'Red, red like that crib, and in the crib . the battered little body of the girl of Aleppo whose legs were . pulverised by an explosion.' 'Red like the bloodstains encrusted on . the walls and the floor - in the corner of the room where you have been . tortured until you want to die, until you die in an unspeakably horrible . way,' she added.

Target: Atletico Madrid have joined the race to sign Liverpool target, Belgium striker Divock Origi . Wanted: Spanish newspaper Marca claims Atletico Madrid are chasing Liverpool target Origi . Rising star: Origi scored for Belgium during the World Cup and netted five times for club side Lille last season . And that leaves the opportunity for Atletico, who are in desperate need of attacking reinforcements, to swoop. Atletico boss Diego Simeone has already seen David Villa and Adrian leave the Vicente Calderon, along with Costa, and he is keen to bring in the Belgian striker. Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez and Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku are also believed to be on Simeone's radar. Origi scored once for Belgium during the World Cup and has made seven appearances for his country. He made 35 appearances for French side Lille last season and netted on six occasions. Anfield bound?

"Arrested: Maxwell Winkler, 17, has been charged with the murder of a 73-year-old man . A 17-year-old high school student has been arrested for allegedly shooting and stabbing an elderly man to death as he took his daily walk through the park. Maxwell Winkler was found on his bike in a wooded area in Fishers, Indiana on Monday night as police investigated the brutal killing of Henry Kim, 73. Winkler did not appear to know Kim, police have said. His body was found in Windermere Park in Fishers at 7pm on Saturday by a dog walker. He had been shot three times - in the cheek, in the back and in the left upper arm - and also had a deep wound to the front of his neck, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office said, WISHTV reported. His family said he was likely out on his daily walk when he was attacked, the IndyStar reported. After the killing, police released images of a Trek mountain bike and a BMX helmet believed to belong to a potential suspect. A person was seen leaving the park on the bike before Kim's body was found. On Monday night, Winkler was found riding his bike in the woods when he was stopped on Monday. Police said they do not know what he was doing in the woods at the time. The teenager cooperated with police and was taken into custody. They executed search warrants at two different locations in Fishers and collected items believed to be related to the crime. The high school student was arrested around 5am on Tuesday and has now been charged with murder. He will be charged with an adult in the case. Wanted: Before his arrest, authorities had released images of a mountain bike owned by a person of interest in the case. When he was found in a wooded area on Monday, Winkler was on his bike, police said . Clues: The person on the bike, who was wearing a helmet like this one, was seen riding from the scene . Detectives do not believe the teenager knew the elderly man or was related to him. They are not searching for anyone else in connection to the crime. They have not released a motive for the killing. On Monday, divers from the Fishers Police Department searched a retention pond in the park, but turned up nothing. They did find a knife on the grounds of the park but police have not yet confirmed whether it was the one used in the attack. Winkler is a student at Hamilton Southeastern High School, and detectives said he lives in the neighborhood near Windermere Park, the IndyChannel reported. Scene: Henry Kim's body was found by a dogwalker at Windermere Park (pictured) in Fishers on Saturday . Investigation: Police Sergeant Tom Weger said the victim and the suspect did not know each other . Kim was a married father who had lived in Fishers for more than 15 years. On Sunday, his son Steve, 43, wrote on Facebook: 'I lost my father last night... Feeling sad. He was found dead shot twice in the face in the park. He had no enemies.' The killing comes just four months after an 18-year-old was stabbed during a party - the first homicide in the area in nearly two decades, police said. Connor Shockley was killed on June 22 during a gathering in the Harrison Green area and an 18-year-old classmate was charged in his death.","Maxwell Winkler has been arrested for the murder of Henry Kim, 73, who was shot three times and cut across the neck in a park on Saturday .

"Britain’s house price boom is showing no sign of slowing – after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year. The average cost of a house in the UK hit a new high of £274,000 in August, as increases in London and the South East fuelled a nationwide jump in prices. In the capital property prices jumped by 19.6 per cent – with the average home now worth £514,000. Scroll down for video . London properties continue to pull away from the rest of the country, according to this morning's ONS figures . The average cost of a home in London is now almost twice as much as elsewhere in the country . The increasing cost of housing is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder. In August, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12.9 per cent higher on average than the same time last year. The average price for properties bought by first-time buyers increased was £210,000. England continued to see the largest house price growth across the UK – with properties going up in value by 12.2 per cent in the year to August. The cost of buying a home in Wales was up 4.7 per cent, while in Scotland prices jumped 6.7 per cent. Northern Ireland also enjoyed strong house price growth – with property values up 9.6 per cent over the year. England’s housing boom was driven by the capital – but also by East Anglia and the wider South East. In the areas around London prices jumped 12.3 per cent, while ‘the East’ region saw the cost of properties increase by 11.6 per cent. Excluding London and the South East, UK house prices increased by 7.8 per cent in the 12 months to August 2014. The North East has the lowest average house price at £154,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of £274,000. Excluding London and the South East, the average house price across the country was £208,000. House prices are continuing to soar across the country - driven by runaway property costs in London and the South East . After a big drop in price rises during 2009 prices have carried on booming in the property market . Labour this morning raised concerns that soaring prices were making it increasingly leaving workers behind. Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister, said: 'Total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent. 'Working people whose real wages have fallen by £1,600 a year since 2010 face a further hit if the Tories win the election and cut tax credits again.' A rise in interest rates could be delayed until the middle of next year after inflation dropped to a five-year low. Cheaper travel, restaurants, books and gadgets like tablets and laptops meant the CPI rate of inflation was just 1.2 per cent in September, well below the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent, and the lowestr since September 2009. Low inflation removes any immediate pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates amid the continuing uncertain recovery in the wider economy. New figures from the Office for National Statistics show the CPI rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent . The Office for National Statistics said the fall from 1.5 per cent in August had been sharper than expected. For the fifth month in a row food bills fell, down by 1.4 per cent year-on-year, the steepest drop since June 2002. It is the longest sustained period of flat or falling food prices since the end of 2004. Low inflation is good news for millions of families who have been struggling to cope with rising bills. Latest figures show that average wages are rising by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, so even with 1.2 per cent inflation incomes are being outstripped by rising prices. Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It's good news that inflation remains low. Our long-term economic plan is delivering more financial security and stability for families. 'Today's inflation figures mean a big real-terms increase in the state pension next year - helping people who've worked hard all their lives.' The Bank of England targets inflation at 2 per cent but it has now been below this level for nine months in a row. With inflation falling, the Bank will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery. Cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation, the ONS said . Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months,. 'This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policy-makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months. 'While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.' ING Bank economist James Knightley said: 'With inflation substantially below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate, there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon. 'This means our February prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early.'

"Flagship brand: Barr’s other brands, including Rubicon, Tizer and Strathmore Water, are also expected to have achieved resilient performances . According to the hugely successful advertising campaign, it is a drink made in Scotland from girders. But Irn-Bru maker AG Barr has seen sales soar in the past year, mainly thanks to a new production plant in England which has helped it crack the UK market. The facility opened in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, last year to help accelerate a sales drive south of the Border. Now the company is expected to reveal that sales have risen by 5.6 per cent to around £135million after seeing a big increase in popularity among consumers in England. Barr, which saw rival Britvic pull the plug on a proposed £1.9billion merger last year following a Competition Commission inquiry, is expected to cite the growth as a platform for further expansion in southern England. The factory in Milton Keynes was not open in the first half of last year and the group said in a summer trading update that sales were likely to have grown 5.6 per cent to about £135million. AG Barr has expanded beyond its core Scottish customer base in the past four years, with England and Wales now chipping in more than half of group sales. The drinks maker said in May it was to invest a further £4million in the Milton Keynes site and confirmed plans to close its Tredegar carton-making factory in Wales, with the loss of 67 jobs. Barr’s other brands, including Rubicon, Tizer and Strathmore Water, are also expected to have achieved resilient performances when chief executive Roger White reports the firm’s trading figures tomorrow. City analysts believe falling commodity prices should help underpin the company’s further growth, with input prices expected to be lower next year, especially for the crucial component, sugar. Charles Pick, drinks analyst at Numis Securities, forecasts interim pre-tax profits of £17.8million at Barr compared with £16.6million last time. Scots' favourite: A woman clutches a bottle of Irn-Bru as she waits for the results of the independence referendum at George Square in Glasgow. The soft drink is also growing in popularity south of the border . The City consensus for annual profits at the group to January 2015 is £41.6million. Chris Wickham, analyst at Oriel Securities, said: ‘The group remains on track to deliver organic growth. ‘In particular, the group’s flagship Irn-Bru brand continues to grow share by expanding southwards.’ Scotland’s ‘other national drink’ was invented in 1901 by Andrew Greig Barr. Only two people know the 32 secret ingredients used to make the drink, including Robin Barr, 74, who stood down as chairman of the firm in 2009 after 31 years.","Maker AG Barr expected to reveal 5.6 per cent rise in sales in market update .

"Rave on: Taking ecstasy ¿ even in relatively small amounts ¿ can damage memory, scientists have warned . Taking ecstasy – even in relatively small amounts – can damage memory, scientists have warned. Worryingly, the memory lapses are similar to those that occur in the early onset of dementia. Even ten pills a year – less than one a month – caused problems, says the journal Addiction. Ecstasy, also known by its chemical name MDMA, is a Class A drug. But there are disagreements over how dangerous it is. Government chief drugs advisor Professor David Nutt was fired three years ago after claiming taking ecstasy is no more dangerous than riding a horse. Although the drug’s effects on memory have been studied before, results have been muddied by the possibility that users already had memory problems. To avoid this, researchers from the University of Cologne focused on young people who had tried the drug in the past and expected to use it more in future. They were tested on their memory, learning, brain processing speed and attention at the start of the study and a year on. At the end of a year, 23 had become regular ecstasy users, having taken between ten and  62 ecstasy pills since the start  of the study. Those who had become regular users showed  a clear deterioration in episodic memory in comparison with  the others. This memory details personal experiences, combining information about what happened with when and where – such as remembering not only the last film you saw but who you went with and where you sat. Lapses in it are seen as an indicator of the first stages of dementia. Even low numbers of pills still caused memory problems.Importantly, users of ecstasy, which is also known as MDMA, may not realise their brain is being affected until the damage was done. Even ten pills a year ¿ less than one a month ¿ caused problems, the journal Addiction reports . A spokesman for the researchers said: ‘As the nature of the impairments may not be immediately obvious to the user, it is possible people wouldn’t get the signs that they are being damaged by the drug until it is too late.’ Lead author Dr Daniel Wagner, of the University of Cologne, said: ‘By measuring the cognitive function of people with no history of ecstasy use and one year later identifying those who had used ecstasy at least ten times and re-measuring their performance, we have been able to start isolating the precise cognitive effects of this drug. ‘Our findings may raise concerns with regard to MDMA use, even in recreational amounts over a relatively short time period.’ Valerie Curran, professor of psychopharmacology at University College London, said that any effects on memory are likely to be small and transient. She said: ‘The general agreement that is emerging about ecstasy is that while you are using the drug, you might expect a very subtle memory impairment but it’s probably not significant in the real world. ‘When you stop using it, as most people do, things go back to the way they were.’ Young men and women in the UK are thought to be Europe’s biggest users of ecstasy and the drug has been linked to more than 200 deaths since 1996.","Just one pill a month can cause memory loss .

"Britain could be ready to join the Euro within just 10 years, Labour peer Lord Mandelson claimed today. Anti-austerity protests are sweeping across Europe amid speculation of further bailouts for the troubled single currency. But in a remarkable prediction branded ‘breathtaking’ by Tories, Lord Mandelson claimed the problems would be sorted out soon ‘in fits and starts’ and a new 'Eurozone Mark II' would emerge which the British people will want to join. Lord Mandelson today said Britain's interests risk being ignored if it chose not to join a Eurozone Mark II . The former European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister said the battle to secure the future of the single currency will mean a 'more powerful political . and institutional framework of policy and decision-making' emerging in Brussels. He added: 'Now if that is successful - over the next five to ten years, not over the next five to ten months - I think it is possible, quite possible that Britain will want to review its relationship to the eurozone core. 'In those circumstances, I think we would have to revert to the British people again and ask them to take a view on what sort of relationship Britain has with Europe in the coming decades.' David Cameron has faced growing calls for an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. The Prime Minister is reported to be preparing to give a major speech soon on Europe soon as a direct response to the European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso’s recent call for a federal Europe. In May Lord Mandelson said a referendum was needed as a ‘healthy means of re-establishing a consensus’ on Britain’s place in the world. But today he made clear he still believes that Britain should move closer to the EU to stop its interests being ignored. 'What we don’t want to see is that as the . eurozone integrates further, our interests are progressively ignored. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin today said Lord Mandelson's enthusiasm for Britain to join the euro was 'breathtaking' 'We are deliberately putting ourselves in a position . where we are choosing not to act constructively, not to engage with our . European partners and inviting them to ignore what we believe are our . interests and how we want to see the single market managed in the . future. 'That’s the great danger of the direction in which the Government . is presently going,' he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. However, the idea of Britain joining the Euro brought a furious response from senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin. ‘He wants Britain to be to be in the core in the euro and it is breathtaking that this man can [come] on your programme and not be questioned about the disaster which he advocated, he advocated this euro.’ Mr Jenkin added: ‘He very mellifluously tries to reassure you we can just lie back and let Europe develop. ‘I think the moment has probably passed where we can determine the direction of Europe, that passed us all 20 years ago. ‘But we can determine our relationship with Europe and the vast majority of the British people do not want to go anywhere near the core.’","Former Business Secretary says troubled single currency will reemerge as a Eurozone Mark II in five to 10 years .

"David Cameron has taken a fresh swipe at the French government – ridiculing its 'nonsense' rule stopping people working more than 35 hours a week. The Prime Minister said the French 'obsession' with the policy was to blame for the country's unemployment crisis – with more than 10 per cent of the population out of work, while the UK's jobless rate has plummeted to just 6.2 per cent. Mr Cameron's jibe, which will spark fury in Paris, comes after the International Monetary Fund predicted Britain would overtake France to become the second-biggest economy in Europe next year. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, talking to pensioners and older working people at Age UK's headquarters in London today, said French regulation was strangling its economy . David Cameron gave a fresh hint he would like to increase the inheritance tax threshold so that it only hits the 'very wealthy'. The Prime Minister said people who did not feel 'in any way mega-rich' were being hit by the tax. He told a gathering of pensioners and older workers that people should be able to pass their family home to their children 'rather than leave it to the taxman'. Inheritance tax is levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the £325,000 threshold - with married couples able effectively to combine their allowances to £650,000. The Tories had promised to raise the threshold to £1million, but the policy failed to make the coalition agreement with the Liberal Democrats when the Government took office in 2010 - with the priority given to raising the personal income tax allowance instead. But the Prime Minister said today he would like to see 'more progress' on the issue, adding that Chancellor George Osborne was 'keen' to address it. He said: 'To me inheritance tax is a tax that should be paid by the very wealthy. I think you should be able to pass a family home on to your children rather than leave it to the taxman.' He said he had ambitions to go beyond the current £650,000 threshold for couples. The UK economy is expected to grow by 3.2 per cent this year and 2.7 per cent in 2015, compared with just 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent in France. Mr Cameron has made a habit of criticising France following Francois Hollande's election as President in 2012. Just weeks after Mr Hollande's election victory the Prime Minister said he would 'roll out the red carpet' for French companies fleeing his proposed 75 per cent tax on millionaires. And earlier this year Mr Cameron Mr Cameron made a thinly-veiled dig at Mr Hollande's economic record – criticising governments pursuing policies which would lead to 'more borrowing, more spending and more debt'. He said countries following this approach were seeing 'increasing unemployment, industrial stagnation and enterprise in free fall'. Mr Cameron's latest swipe comes after the chief John Lewis told a group of young entrepreneurs last Thursday that 'France is finished' and was 'sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat'. In the Prime Minister's latest assault on France today, he said the 35 hour week had resulted in lower investment and an unemployment rate far in excess of the UK's. Mr Cameron said France was in danger of falling for the 'nonsense' idea that there were a fixed number of jobs in the economy and that a 35-hour week would help share the work around. He acknowledged it was 'very dangerous' to point a finger at a fellow European country, but launched an attack on the policy which has remained in place under socialist president Francois Hollande - despite calls for reform from within his own administration. Mr Cameron launched his attack on the French employment model while responding to questions from pensioners and older workers at Age UK's London head office. He was asked about prejudice against over-50s in the workplace and how some older workers felt pressured to retire to make way for a new generation. But Mr Cameron said: 'People feeling guilty that they are somehow hogging a job that could otherwise be available to a young person? I just think we should have no truck with that argument at all. 'The idea - economists would call it the lump of labour fallacy - the idea that there is just a fixed number of jobs and all you have got to do is try and divide them up between young people, old people, males, females - I think it's nonsense. 'What we have demonstrated in the last four years, and of course it's been a difficult time economically for many, we have demonstrated that you can create millions more jobs. There are 1.8 million more people in work today than when I became Prime Minister. 'If we had sat there in 2010 and said 'it's going to be tough, we are not going to get any more jobs, let's just carve them up and tell some people to retire early' I think that would have been a terrible mistake.' Unemployment in the UK has fallen steadily since 2011, while France has seen its jobless rate spike . The British economy recorded better growth than France last year - and is predicted to pull away from its continental rival this year and next . He then set his sights on the economy across the channel, telling the audience: 'Very dangerous to ever point a finger at another European country but I sometimes think the French, with their obsession with the 35-hour working week, they are falling into the danger of a lump of labour fallacy, where 'if only everyone just worked 35 hours there would be more work to go round'. 'I think what you have seen is that results in higher unemployment, less competitive industry, fewer people wanting to invest in your economy. 'That's why the rates of unemployment in France and in Britain are so different. Ours is way, way below theirs.' Mr Cameron said there should not be a stigma about employing older people, saying some companies such as DIY chain B&Q were 'doing amazing work' . He added: 'The truth is fewer and fewer of us are going to start a job aged 21 and work through that job for the rest of our lives. Training and on the job training and continuous training is going to be part of people's lives, and that should be the case for people in their 50s and 60s as well.'","PM said French 'obsession' with  policy to blame for  unemployment crisis .

"Ukip has become 'quite seductive' to voters fed up with the coalition, David Cameron has admitted. The Prime Minister said families who have seen their living standards squeezed while immigration rises have faced a 'tough time' and are attracted to Nigel Farage's party. His comments strike a markedly different tone to previous Tory attacks on Ukip, in the wake of Douglas Carswell becoming the party's first elected MP. But after warning voters they could 'got to bed with Farage and wake-up with Miliband', Mr Cameron also ridiculed the Ukip leader with a mock newspaper front page with his two opponents under the sheets together. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, appearing on ITV's The Agenda, ridiculed Nigel Farage and Ed Miliband with a mock newspaper frontpage which suggested the Ukip and Labour leaders were in bed together . The Conservatives have swung between attacking Ukip and trying to woo their supporters. During the Tory party conference, Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'. Mr Cameron attacked Tory defector Mark Reckless for betraying the hard work of ordinary Conservative activists which had got his 'fat arse' into the Commons. But speaking last night, Mr Cameron admitted the combination of growing Eurosceptcism, high immigration and low wage were fuelling Ukip's appeal. One poll at the weekend put Ukip on 25 per cent, which in theory would give them 128 MPs at the next election. Mr Camron told ITV's The Agenda: 'We've had a very tough time in Britain. People haven't seen pay rises or living standard rises, often for year after year, you've got Europe looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity, immigration has been too high, there's been a coalition which not everyone has liked. 'And that's given the seductiveness of the simple answer that Mr Farage suggests. I think it's become quite seductive.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday celebrated in Westminster after Douglas Carswell took his seat in the Commons, but Mr Cameron warned a vote for Ukip would help boost Labour . Tory activist Parveer Hasan posing for a selfie with David Cameron . As Prime Minister, you might think he has better things to do. But David Cameron has revealed he will always make time for a selfie, because he does not want to disappoint a potential supporter. During the Tory party conference, Mr Cameron was repeatedly stopped by people wanting to have their picture taken with him. Mother-of-two Parveen Hassan from Birmingham revealed that the PM was always happy to pose for a picture. 'He's one of these types of people, if you stop him, he doesn't say no,' she said. Mr Cameron told ITV that he had seen the report, and could refuse smiling the for cameras. 'I read this thing that 'he never says no to a selfie'. 'It's quite rude if someone asks you for a selfie and, you know, we politicians are in the business of trying to win people over, to say 'no you can't have one'.' Ukip has been boosted by the election of Mr Carswell, who triggered a by-election in his Clacton seat after defecting from the Tories to Ukip in August. He took his seat in the Commons yesterday, with Mr Farage watching from the public gallery. The Tories are planning to 'throw the kitchen sink' at the by-election next month in Rochester and Strood, caused by Mr Reckless' defection. Today it was announced the by-election will be held on November 20. At the 2010 general election, Mr Reckless won the Kent seat as a Conservative with a majority of 9,953 over Labour. Ukip did not field a candidate. Mr Cameron announced that the Tory candidate would be one of two local women - to be chosen by a postal 'primary' of local voters. In a letter to residents, the Conservative leader said Ukip wanted to 'turn this election into a national media circus'. 'We want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area. The decision is in your hands. There's no stunts or backroom deals, just a strong local candidate you can trust.' The candidates up for selection - in a poll open to voters regardless of which party they support - are local councillors Kelly Tolhurst and Anna Firth. In his letter, Mr Cameron said Ms Tolhurst, who runs a marine survey business, 'has seen the strain that excessive immigration has put on housing and our local services' and would push for action to get it 'under control'. Fears over the scale of immigration are a significant factor in the surge in popularity that saw Ukip win May's European elections and then secure its first MP and come within a whisker of snatching a safe Labour Commons seat in Greater Manchester. Ms Firth, a former barrister, would 'fight for more police on our streets to tackle anti-social behaviour, better health services and a better deal for our armed forces, to whom we own so much', Mr Cameron said. Both candidates would take part in public hustings around the constituency before the selection vote, he said. 'We're putting the people of Rochester and Strood in the drivers seat. No stunts: just a strong local candidate you can trust.' However, the by-election is likely to be held days after the Commons votes on signing up to EU rules on policing, including the European Arrest Warrant. It is claimed up to 40 Tory MPs could rebel on the plan, fearing it plays into the hands of Ukip. Mr Cameron wants to pitch the next election as a direct choice between him and Labour leader Ed Miliband. Polls suggest barely one in five people think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister. Mr Cameron told ITV: 'I think the question at the next election is a big one, and I think there is quite a big choice. 'The difference between what Ed Miliband wants and what I want is quite profound, and I think we'll see a big turnout at the next election.' Tory defector Mark Reckless is hoping to win his Rochester and Strood seat for Ukip in the by-election which will take place on November 20 . In his speech to the Tory party conference, Mr Cameron warned that a vote for Ukip made it more likely that Labour would win the general election. He said: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.' He returned to the theme last night, with the mock newspaper front page with an image of Mr Farage and Mr Miliband in bed. The headline 'Shock: Lastest #WakeUpCall selfie revealed' follows the  campaign by Unicef where celebrities have posted pictures online of themselves first thing in the morning, as a Wake Up Call to the humanitarian crisis in Syria. Mr Cameron joked: : 'We've had the wake-up selfies with pictures of people that have just woken up - very brave. 'And I told you that if you go to bed with Nigel then you could wake up with Ed Miliband and so I've got the wake up selfie.' Meanwhile plans for TV debates ahead of next year's General Election are in chaos, with growing doubts over whether they will take place. Broadcasters announced Mr Farage would be given a place in one of three debates, but Ukip suggested he should be included in more than one and the Greens, the SNP and Respect each demanded a place. Mr Cameron said he wanted the proposed TV debates to happen, but raised doubts about the detail of the plans. 'I wouldn't have them all in the campaign, they took all the life out of the rest of the campaign, they were the only thing that people were judged on. 'And the second thing is I think you can't have one new party without having another new party. And the Greens have got an MP, Ukip have now got an MP, I don't see how you can have one without the other.'","PM admits Ukip has tapped into concern over low wages and the EU .

The woman’s attorney, Keith Halpern, said last month that she appears to have mental health issues. Health department employees took hundreds of pictures inside the home prior to its demolition, which show an unimaginable clutter, with mounds of refuse mixed in with old beat-up furniture, discarded electronic equipment, empty soda cans and food wrappings, dog feces everywhere and soiled diapers. Investigators in full hazmat suits and respirators spent several days documenting the deplorable conditions inside the squalid house that four young children, between the ages of 6 months and 13 years, had called home. Health officials also found the filthy, stench-filled dwelling crawling with rats and insects. It took clean-up crews 90 hours spread over four days of work to clear out Murray's house before heavy machinery was brought in to raze it to the ground. The clean-up and demolition cost the City of Blacktone just under $30,000.

Authorities found the remains of the woman's three infant children in a more thorough search a few weeks later. Two of them were entirely skeletal. The corpses were discovered dressed in diapers and onesies, and hanging in bags in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm, reported NECN. Her four surviving kids were rescued August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in his own feces. Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds. In court in October, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back. On Wednesday, it was announced that Erika Murray's next court appearance has been delayed until January 2015 pending the state medical examiner's report on the remains of her  babies, MassLive.com reported.

"This does not appear to be a sick joke. Architects have designed a pair of apartment towers in South Korea that are unbelievably reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks on New York's World Trade Centre.

"Rise: The cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters has almost doubled to £15.5million in just one year, according to official figures . The cost to the taxpayer of hiring court interpreters has almost doubled to £15.5million in just one year, according to official figures. The bill for translators brought in to assist non-English speakers appearing at magistrates or Crown courts for criminal cases soared from £7.9million in 2012. The figures, uncovered in Freedom of Information responses from the Ministry of Justice, appear to show the rise occurred since services were outsourced to under-fire firm Capita Translation and Interpreting. They were revealed after the handling of court foreign language services to just one company was branded ‘shambolic’ by MPs amid concerns the change had caused trials to collapse or be delayed. Farcical episodes that have emerged since privatisation include the case of a man who was charged with perverting the course of justice was instead accused of being a ‘pervert’. In a burglary case at Snaresbrook Crown . Court in east London, a retrial was ordered when it emerged that the . Romanian interpreter had muddled the words ‘beaten’ and ‘bitten’. And in Winchester, a murder trial was brought to a halt when the court interpreter confessed he was an unqualified stand-in for his wife, who was busy. Standards were allegedly so lax that a director of another translation company was able to sign up his cat Masha as a translator – who was then offered jobs. MPs on the Commons’ Justice Select . Committee were told that a ‘catastrophic’ shortage of interpreters had . forced courts to rely on Google Translate, a comparatively crude and . time-consuming online translation service. There are around 11,000 foreign . nationals in UK prisons, around 13 per cent of the total prison . population, with many needing interpreters at numerous court hearings . and appeals. Lax standards: The rise apparently  occurred since services were outsourced to Capita TI. Following the move, a 'catastrophic' shortage of interpreters forced courts to rely on Google Translate (pictured), MPs were told . Courts across England used to rely on local interpreters but in January 2012 the former Ministry of Justice controversially handed a monopoly on translating to a private firm, Applied Language Solutions, in an attempt to cut costs. The company was then bought by Capita TI amid a wave of criticism from the National Register of Public Service Interpreters (NRPSI), which previously provided courts with language experts. In the first 18 months of the contract there were 10,000 complaints about the interpreting services it provided. MPs were told the company had failed to send interpreters to a fifth of trials, sent people speaking the wrong language, or translators who are simply incompetent. Savings: Courts Minister Shailesh Vara said privatisation had saved taxpayers £15million in 2012-13, its first year . In July last year Lady Butler-Sloss, a retired judge, told the House of Lords there was a massive ‘disruption and delay to criminal trials as a result of serious inaccuracies of court interpreting’. Five months earlier, the Justice Committee said the privatisation had been ‘shambolic’ and led to cases collapsing and people unnecessarily being remanded in custody. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice confirmed it paid out £15.5million for ‘interpreting and translation services’ to the courts last year compared to £7.9million in 2012. But he said the FOI response had only identified payments to Capita TI. Because of blunders after the start of the contract, local interpreters were hired on an ad-hoc basis to fill in shortfalls and paid for their services. The MoJ said the total payments to all interpreters in 2012 exceeded the bill for 2013, although the department said it could not provide documented figures to prove this. It stated, however, that the new system had seen ‘dramatic improvements’ and that ‘record numbers of booking are now begin made and fulfilled’. A MoJ source said: ‘During the first year of the contract a lot of things weren’t running brilliantly but since then the whole system has been sorted out.’ Courts Minister Shailesh Vara said privatisation had saved taxpayers £15million in 2012-13, its first year. He said: ‘The new interpreting contract was introduced to tackle the inefficiencies and inconsistencies in the previous system . ‘We have seen dramatic improvements over the life of the contract so far, record numbers of bookings are now being made and fulfilled, and we continue to drive further improvement in performance.’","Cost to taxpayer of hiring court interpreters has soared from £7.9m in 2012 .

"Heyday: Ray Easterling,l seen in his Atlanta Falcons uniform in 1975, is understood to have shot himself at his home in Richmond, Virgina . Former football star Ray Easterling has become the latest sportsman to kill himself after suffering from depression believed to have been linked to head injuries during his career. The 62-year-old, who police say shot himself at his home in Richmond, Virginia, played for the Atlanta Falcons during the 1970s and later sued the NFL over its handling of concussions. He began showing signs of brain damage 20 years ago with bouts of depression and insomnia. Then, the former safety developed symptoms of dementia as he lost the ability to focus, organise his thoughts and relate to people. His wife, Mary Ann Easterling, said she would continue the lawsuit in which she claims the NFL tried to cover up the danger of concussion. In the last year, the suicides of several sportsmen have been linked to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is caused by repeated blows to the head and often leads to bouts of depression and anger. Last year former Chicago Bears star Dave Duerson, who died in February 2011, was found to have the condition, which can only be diagnosed during a post-mortem examination. The brains of 50 sports stars have been donated to Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, which made the diagnosis. Ice hockey players, who engage in fights, are also prone. But the condition, nicknamed 'punch drunk syndrome' is best known for afflicting boxers.

Tough: Easterling was part of the Falcons' 'Gritz Blitz' 11977 defence that set the NFL record for fewest points conceded in a season . ‘Half the time the player puts themselves back in the game, and they don't know what kind of impact it has,’ she said. Ray Easterling may have suffered from the brain condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy . Also known as punch drunk syndrome, it has been most common in boxers and is associated with receiving multiple concussions. Sufferers can show symptoms such as memory loss, aggression, confusion and depression which may appear within months of the trauma or many decades later. Later in life and can eventually cause dementia. In recent years a number of sportsmen’s suicides have been linked to the condition, including Chiacgo Bears star Dave Duerson and hockey players Wade Belak and Derek Boogaard. It is not fully known why this syndrome occurs and it can only be diagnosed after death when the brain can be properly examined. Duerson’s brain is one of 50 donated to Boston University’s Center for the Study of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.  Experts believe CTE may be caused by the loss of neurons and scarring of brain tissue among other injuries caused by repeated concussion. It changes brain cells' cytoskeletons, which is thought to be due to damage to cerebral blood vessels. The condition is virtually indistinguishable from Alzheimer’s. ‘Somehow this has got to be stopped. It's destroying people's lives.’ She described Ray, who died at their home on Thursday, as ‘a wonderful husband and father’. ‘In everything he did, he was a charger. He went full tilt,’ she said. Describing his dementia, she said: ‘It's been a progression over the last 20 years,’ she said. ‘It's very sad to see.’ He was was found by his wife, who contacted police at 6.14 am on Thursday. Easterling was dead, with a handgun nearby, when police arrived, Richmond police Captain Yvonne Crowder told FOXSports.com.“Based on our investigation, we are ruling it a suicide,” Crowder said. Easterling played for the Falcons from 1972 to 1979, helping to lead the team's ‘Gritz Blitz’ defence in 1977 that set the NFL record for fewest points allowed in a season. He was born on September 3, 1949 and played in college at the University of Richmond. He was drafted by the Falcons with the 9th round pick in 1972 and played for seven years, starting four seasons. He was a leader of the secondary that established a team record in 1977 with 26 interceptions. The defense that year set the NFL record at the time for allowing just 129 points in a season. ‘He was one of the hardest working football players, most disciplined football players I've ever played with,’ said Greg Brezina, a friend and former Falcons teammate. ‘He loved the lord. We roomed together in training camp and every morning we would get up early and pray for everybody on the team. ‘We did that every day. He was a very unselfish person.’ After his playing days ended, he returned to Richmond where he ran a financial services company and started a youth football camp. But he started showing signs of brain damage about 20 years ago, his wife and friends said. ‘He just wasn't thinking right. You could tell that 20 years ago,’ said Brezina. ‘He'd start talking to you about one topic, and then he'd end up in another topic and he wouldn't know how he got there.’ Easterling was part of a group of seven former players who sued the NFL in Philadelphia in August, claiming the league failed to properly treat players for concussion and tried to conceal for decades any links between football and brain injuries. It was the first potential class-action lawsuit that was filed. The NFL has said any allegation that the league intentionally sought to mislead players is without merit.

"A horse, a dog, a flock of seagulls and a box of eggs. Not the start of a bad joke, but some of the highlights – and surprises – of campaigning to maintain Scotland within the United Kingdom. I always knew the independence referendum would be the most important event I would ever be involved in, the most important event for Scotland. Because of that I decided to campaign in a totally different way, going back to an old-fashioned politics predating social media and spin doctors. I embarked on a 100-stop tour of open-air meetings across my beautiful country. It was just me, my microphone, my makeshift stage of two Irn-Bru crates and whoever turned up. Thousands of Scots came along and joined the great debate. Scroll down for video . Labour MP Jim Murphy, right, received plenty of abuse campaigning for No on his upturned Irn-Bru crates . And I loved most of it. I visited places I’d never been to before and discovered that the best comedians aren’t only found at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Many were in the crowds with a wry comment or a well-timed put-down. I’m not sure I got the better of every exchange. From Barra to Barrhead, it wasn’t just undecided voters that got involved. On the island of Islay I was heckled by a horse wearing a Yes Scotland blanket. In Ayr I was barked at by a dog with ‘Freedom’ scrawled across its back. His purple-bearded owner claimed to be called William Wallace, and spent most of the meeting trying to climb on my crates bellowing ‘Traitor!’ in my right ear. One meeting in Oban harbour was disrupted by uninvited visitors. When I arrived the crowd had their hoods up. Surprisingly, some even had umbrellas above their heads on a lovely rain-free evening. A journalist had to explain that the Yes voter at the edge of the crowd was the ‘Oban Seagull Whisperer’, who had summoned dozens of gulls over us to disrupt our gathering with droppings, but we just kept going! There was a lighthearted edge to many of the criticisms – hecklers helped make many of the meetings more authentic. Jim Murphy, right, faced groups of organised Yes protesters anytime he tried to take to his stump . However sometimes it became far more sinister. There is a dark corner of Scotland where an intolerant Scottish nationalism lives. We all know that no political movement is without its idiots. But what went on at times in the referendum was of a different nature altogether – it wasn’t the occasional fool but an orchestrated campaign. In places like Motherwell, Dundee and Kirkcaldy, Yes groups organised big crowds of their followers to drown out our events, preventing undecided voters from joining open-air democracy. In their dozens and sometimes in their hundreds they screamed ‘Traitor!’, ‘Scum!’, ‘Quisling!’ and even ‘Terrorist’. And there was one more vile insult they hurled at me. In the midst of the campaign, new details appeared in the media about alleged 1970s child abuse in and around Westminster. To some of my opponents, it didn’t matter that I was in primary school when these terrible cases were alleged to have taken place. Instead it became a regular insult to scream ‘Paedophile!’ at me throughout my street meetings. An anti-English group, Siol nan Gaidheal – or ‘Seed of the Gaels’ – boasted that they had been ‘following Murphy’ for ‘in-your-face confrontations’. And there was a lot of publicity for the least-skilled egg thrower – it took him four eggs before he hit me. But I couldn’t care less about an egg thrower, what was worrying was their determination to deny us space in Scotland’s streets. Mr Murphy, pictured, said party leader Ed Miliband also faced abuse while on the campaign trail . And it wasn’t just me; Ed Miliband and others were also in their sights, and the BBC’s Glasgow HQ was targeted by Yes protesters because of unfounded allegations of anti-independence bias at the BBC. I know the vast majority of Yes supporters would never dream of behaving like this. They decided to support the Yes campaign because they believed it was best for their family and our country. They are decent and honest people, many of whom are hurting this weekend. But wherever we went there was often a noisy crowd that followed us. Rightly, nothing like this ever happened to Alex Salmond or the Yes campaign. After a while my meetings became impossible places to guarantee public safety – I had to halt my tour and seek police advice. To this day, I still don’t know how high up in the Yes campaign these actions were sanctioned, but I do know how widespread they became. I lost count of how many No voters told me they were too worried to wear a sticker or display a poster. The effect was that visually, the Yes campaign appeared to speak for the majority. If the vote was decided by which campaign had the most window posters, then Scotland would be independent. Fortunately windows don’t vote. But this phenomenon of passionate political silence gave me confidence that there was an undeclared pride in many people at being both Scottish and British. And Alistair Darling among others continually emphasised that referendum day was the time for ‘the quiet patriotic majority to stand up and be counted’. ‘Better Together’ was our campaign motto. But it has to be more than just a slogan. It’s time to put the divisions of the campaign behind us and concentrate on what we have in common. In a dangerous and complicated world, the combined power, prosperity and influence of the four nations in our imperfect Union is something to be cherished.","Jim Murphy said the referendum was the most important vote in his life .

"A New York man has been curbed from committing an outrageous transgression: running in Central Park at 4:30am. The jogger, self-described entrepreneur, author and worldwide connector Peter Shankman, was duly given a ticket as he and a running partner entered mile two of his scheduled 10-mile run on Thursday, training for an upcoming triathlon. The NYPD officer who witnessed Shankman's early-morning workout informed him that 'the people's park' does not open until 6am and issued him with a summons. Keen jogger: Peter Shankman flagrantly flouted the Central Park opening hours by jogging too early in the morning . 'Note - Running in the park. Not ""performing sex acts for crack,"" or ""laying down explosive charges,"" but ""running.” Because apparently, a 215 pound man running through Central Park at just over a 9:10 pace is a threat to Manhattan,' wrote Shankman on his Facebook page. Shankman says he saw no signs or warnings at 63rd Street and Central Park West where he entered displaying the park's opening hours which, for any keen joggers, are 6am until 1am. Dutiful: A dedicated police officer apprised Shankman of his misdemeanor and issued him with a ticket that could cost him $1,000 . As a busy father, husband and jack-of-all-trades ('marketer, NASA adviser, TEDx speaker') Shankman says that if he didn't get his 10 miles in early, he'd never fit training in. Shankman must now to go court in May to fight his ticket, and says he could be fined up to $1,000. He suspects that the ticket was written to meet end-of-month quotas. Running rage: Shankman will have to attend court in May to fight the summons . Have a laugh: Shankman has maintained his sense of humor, tweeting yesterday, 'It's almost 9am, and the good news is that I haven't been given a summons for anything so far this morning' 'A ""hey, buddy, the park doesn't open until six, you need to run on the sidewalk outside"" from the police officer wouldn't have sufficed?' he wrote on Facebook. 'Apparently not, since he made it clear that his boss was in the car with him, so he had to write me up.' Shankman says he understands that the law is in place to prevent people staying in the park too late or sleeping on the benches, but that he entered early to work out. 'The last 12 years have really been about getting the city healthy, you know. No smoking in bars, no trans fats, and here I was, I was running, I was exercising, trying to lose a few more pounds before this race,' he told Pix 11.

"Russian scientists believe a giant crater which appeared in far northern Siberia was caused by rising temperatures in the area - not a meteorite. Andrei Plekhanov, a senior researcher at the Scientific Research Center of the Arctic, said the mysterious hole which appeared in the gas-rich area earlier this week was most likely the result of a 'build-up of excessive pressure' underground, due to the region's changing temperatures. On Wednesday, Mr Plekhanov traveled to the 262ft wide crater, in the Yamal Peninsula of northern Russia, to study how the crater was formed. Scroll down for video .

The darkening around the inner rim of the crater indicates 'severe burning' that scorched its edges . Footage from inside the original crater showed that there is a lake at its base. The two new craters follow the discovery of a larger hole earlier this month around 230ft (70 metres) in diameter. Now the new holes - smaller in diameter but similar in shape - are posing a fresh challenge for Russian scientists . He said . 80 per cent of the crater appeared to be made up of ice and that there . were no traces of an explosion. The discovery eliminates the possibility that a . meteorite had struck the region - the name of which translates as 'the end of the world'.

Some said the hole could have been formed by a meteorite striking the spot, but that no longer seems to be the case . Scientists working at the site measure some of the soil and debris around the crater . Until the expedition took place, shown, scientists had been baffled by the appearance of the giant hole .

Gas accumulated in ice could have mixed with sand beneath the surface, and then mixed with salt. Some 10,000 years ago this area was a sea.

"A popular 15-year-old student has committed suicide after he reportedly faced expulsion and could have been placed on the sex offenders' register simply for streaking at a high school football game. Christian Adamek, from Huntsville, Alabama, hanged himself on October 2, a week after he was arrested for running naked across the Sparkman High football field during a game. The teenager died two days later from his injuries and on Wednesday, friends and family gathered at a memorial service as they struggled to comprehend the beloved student's death. A video of Adamek streaking during a game against a rival team was posted on YouTube hours after the event and students took to Twitter to call him a 'legend'. Loss: Christian Adamek, 15, hanged himself last week after he faced possible expulsion and criminal charges for streaking across his high school's football field during a game the week earlier . 'Sparkman's new slogan is gonna be ""Welcome to Sparkman High School, Home of Christian Adamek"",' one student wrote. But school staff did not treat the situation so lightly. Sparkman High Principal Michael Campbell told WHNT a day before the suicide attempt that the teen could face major repercussions because of his actions. 'There's the legal complications,' Campbell said. 'Public lewdness and court consequences . outside of school with the legal system, as well as the school . consequences that the school system has set up.' Incident: Adamek, seen right, was filmed streaking across the school football field on September 27 . In Alabama, indecent exposure is linked to the state's sex offender laws, meaning that he could have found himself on the sex offenders register due to the streaking. Campbell added that that the incident was not just a prank and needed to be treated seriously. Sparkman High administrators even recommended . that Adamek face a hearing in the Madison County court system to . determine if formal charges would be filed, WHNT reported. Adamek had also been disciplined by the school district but the details had not been made public. The day before the suicide attempt, the principal had confirmed that Adamek was not at school and the teenager's sister suggested on Twitter that Adamek faced expulsion, AL.com reported. Popular: After the streaking, fellow students called Adamek, pictured, a 'legend' but the school district took it far more seriously, recommending that he had a court hearing and disciplining him . Missed: He is pictured with his mother, Angela, in his younger years. He also leaves behind a brother and sister . Campbell declined to comment on Adamek's death but the Madison County school district issued a statement saying it had 'received word that a Sparkman High School student has passed away'. 'Our prayers and thoughts are with the family during this time of bereavement,' the statement read. The messages on Twitter have now turned from congratulatory to somber. 'Praying for the Adamek family. Christian was so funny and nice. He will be missed by so many,' one girl wrote. The family - Adamek leaves behind his mother, Angela, and a sister and a brother - shared photos and memories online of the fun-loving teen, who was pictured posing and grinning at the camera. At Wednesday's memorial service, his Boy Scout Troop master, David Silvernail, said Adamek was a popular teenager who always had a smile on his face. Questions: The principal of Sparkman High School in Harvest, Alabama has not commented on the suicide . 'There are two kinds of people in the world; ones that brighten the room when they walk in and those that don't,' he said. 'He was one that brightened the room when he walked in. That's what I'll always remember about Christian.' His mother, Angela, thanked her son's friends and said they could learn from his life, AL.com reported. 'Remember to smile, don't be afraid to do something goofy and remember the consequences of those actions, ask for help when you need it, ask for help if you think your friends need it if you don't know what to do, be quirky, be happy, be smart,' she said.","Christian Adamek hanged himself on October 2 and died from his injuries two days later - a week after he streaked at his high school football game .

"The world’s longest prehistoric animal dung is set to go up for auction next week. The fossilised excrement dates back to the Oligocene and Minocene Epochs, which makes it anywhere from 5.3 to 33.9 million years old. Found in Lewis County, Washington State the giant dung is expected to reach £4,700 to £5,800 ($8,000 to $10,000) when it goes under the hammer on 22 July . The longest ancient animal dung on Earth (shown) is going up for auction in Los Angeles. It measures 40 inches (one metre) in length and has a pale brown-yellow colour. Auctioneer I.M. Chait expects it to reach up to £5,800 ($10,000) when it goes under the hammer on 22 July . The lack of vast amounts of fossilised dinosaur feces has baffled scientists for years. However, Slovakian researchers believe the answer lies in the diet of cockroaches, which might have dined on dinosaur waste millions of years ago. Using cutting-edge imaging methods, the scientists discovered particles of wood inside an ancient cockroach’s gut, which they think came from dinosaur feces. Researchers from the Slovak Academy of Sciences in Slovakia said that dinosaurs certainly must have produced a lot of feces, and yet fossils of the waste are not very widely discovered. ‘Although appearing trivial, cockroaches, one of the dominant insect orders during the Mesozoic, were never examined as representing top candidates for partial processors of dinosaur dung,’ they wrote in their study. The dung is what is known as coprolite, fossilised feces that can provide information about an animal’s diet rather than just its appearance. It is described by Beverly Hills auctioneers I.M. Chait as an ‘eye-watering 40 inches [one metre] in length’. However, research has failed to reveal what animal the excrement originated from. ‘This truly spectacular specimen is possibly the longest example of coprolite - fossilised dinosaur feces - ever to be offered at auction,’ said Josh Chait, spokesman for the auctioneer. 'It boasts a wonderfully even, pale brown-yellow colouring and terrifically detailed texture to the heavily botryoidal [globular] surface across the whole of its immense length. ‘The passer of this remarkable object is unknown, but it is nonetheless a highly evocative specimen of unprecedented size.' He continued that the specimen was 'presented in four sections, each with a heavy black marble custom base, an eye-watering 40 inches [one metre] in length overall.’ Despite being many millions of years old the excrement is not thought to have belonged to a dinosaur though, as these animals existed only up until 66 million years ago. Also for sale are a selection of five stool-shaped specimens thought to have come from a Miocene turtle, 23.03 to 5.332 million years ago, estimated to sell for £2,300 to £3,500 ($4,000 to 6,000). 'Although it is often impossible to tell which species produced these fascinating petrified feces, it is supposed that the fine examples found in a small area of Washington State are from a Miocene turtle,' said Mr Chait. 'It is also suggested that rather than being coprolites, they are in fact cololites, internal casts of the intestine.'

"A 'strong connection' exists between mass shootings and domestic or family violence, a study has found (file picture) An analysis of gun murders in the U.S. has found 'a strong connection' between mass shootings and domestic or family violence. Gun-control advocacy group Everytown For Gun Safety analysed FBI data and media reports to identify a total of 110 mass shootings between January 2009 and July 2014. The group found 57 per cent of mass shootings, defined by the FBI as incidents in which at least four people were murdered with a gun, were related to domestic or family violence. The analysis also found the victims of mass shootings were disproportionately female. While just 13 per cent of the total number of victims of gun homicide in the U.S. were female, the figure of female victims in mass shootings was 51 per cent. The report says in at least 63 of the 110 cases the shooter killed a current or former spouse, partner or other family member. The Everytown analysis also discovered gunmen who carried out mass shootings were on average older than those who committed gun murders in the U.S. as a whole. While the median age of all known gun murderers is 26, those who had carried out mass shootings had the average median age of 34. Under federal law, certain people, including felons, certain domestic abusers and those with a severe mental illness, are not allowed to possess guns. The analysis found of the 110 mass shootings, it was possible to judge whether the shooter was prohibited from carrying guns in 78 per cent of cases. Of these 86 incidents, a total of 42 per cent were prohibited, the report claims. The group found 57 per cent of mass shootings, defined by the FBI as incidents in which at least four people were murdered with a gun, were related to domestic or family violence . The Everytown analysis also discovered gunmen who carried out mass shootings were on average older than those who committed gun murders in the U.S. as a whole . The report also notes mass shootings represent only a small part of the total number of gun murders in the U.S., with less than one per cent of victims recorded by the FBI in 2012 killed in such incidents. Kim Gandy, president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post gun laws needed to be tightened. She said: 'It’s clear that many of these murders were committed by people already barred from gun ownership by federal law - but that law is full of loopholes, like background checks not being required for private sales, like Craigslist or at gun shows.'","Everytown For Gun Safety carried out analysis of FBI data and media reports .

The launch date was reported by Fortune magazine, which cites Apple investors hearing the date from 'multiple sources'.

Fortune reports that Apple will send . out invites for the launch on October 10, gathering tech journalists and . stakeholders together to unveil the device. If Apple follows previous form, the event will be held in San Francisco, with a simultaneous launch on London. Images purporting to show the iPad . Mini suggest a device measuring 7.85inches, with an aluminium back-cover . similar to the most recent iPad. It is likely to sport a rear-facing . camera and come with Apple's newest 'lightning' connector, a . controversial re-design which made previous accessories and chargers . obsolete without an adapter. If Apple follows its usual design . styles, it is likely to come in white and black versions, with a choice . of WiFi only, or a 3G option. However this unconfirmed. The device, while still likely to garner a premium price-tag, will help Apple compete with the burgeoning smaller tablet market. The 7-inch Google Nexus tablet sells for £159 for the cheapest version, while Amazon is also producing a budget tablet range. Steve Jobs was . unconvinced that a smaller tablet would be a success, seeing it as a . poor compromise between a tablet and a phone. However Apple appears to have had a change of heart, particularly now that the tablet market has now matured. One issue Apple might face by launching a Mini is a fragmentation in its core product lines. Until the release of the iPhone 5, . Apple's two product lines had kept the same screen resolution, meaning . apps did not need redesigning for different devices, a problem that plagues the competing Android platform. But with the increased screen size of . the iPhone 5, some apps now have a black border, at least until the . developers update their apps, and this problem may now afflict Apple's . tablets, depending on the final size of the Mini. Front and back: Alleged sightings of the iPad Mini suggest it retains the simple, minimalist style of previous models . According to these images, the iPad Mini comes with dual speakers on the rim, as well as the newly-designed dock connector . However this is unlikely to cause . much of a worry to either developers or customers, as most apps will be . updated quickly and developers still only have a small number of devices . to consider, unlike Android which has hundreds of combinations of . models, screen sizes and software versions. Apple does not speak publicly on . future devices, so the launch will not be confirmed until a minimalist . white envelope arrives to the media, inviting them to meet the newest . member of the Apple family.

"YouTube star Will Reid’s instructional video series for teens has returned to the place where it all began – the bathroom. In the third instalment of his popular online series, the Southampton father has a simple lesson for teens who leave their wet towels on the floor. The tongue-in-cheek clip intended for his own children, James and Beth, teaches teens – and likely some adults – how to hang their used towels on a heated towel rail. 'Distressed dad' Will Reid points to a wet towel left on the bathroom floor . Mr Reid then points to a heated towel rail where the towel should have been placed to dry . In the one-minute video, the self-proclaimed ‘distressed dad’ points to an offending blue towel on the floor and folds it twice before hanging it on the metal rail. He tells the camera: ‘That’s all there is to that. Other places where towels don’t dry are on your bed, bedroom floor, hall floor, lounge floor, pretty much anywhere with the word floor in it.’ Writing on his YouTube page, he said: ‘In this episode I try and teach them how to hang up their towels so that they dry and can be used more than once! Fold twice: Mr Reid said he will continue his YouTube series because it is annoying his children . Hang to dry: It's so easy that even a teenager can do it . ‘Again, they say no one will be interested and still can't believe people watched my first video. Let's prove them wrong and show them that us parents do know what we are talking about. Please don't let me down!' He added: ‘You may have someone in your life that isn't a teenager but you think still needs to see this video. Please feel free to share with them too.’ Mr Reid’s first video taught teenagers how to change an empty toilet roll in the bathroom and went on to surpass four million views, making him somewhat of an online celebrity. Will Reid's other videos have taught teens how to change a loo roll and load a dishwasher . He followed that up with a clip that shows teens – and, again, likely a lot of adults – how to load filthy cutlery and crockery into a dishwasher. Without giving any hints he is promising to release a fourth video soon. In his latest video, he tells the camera: ‘I’m going to continue using social media because it’s sort of getting the message across to (James and Beth) and it also annoys them’","This is the third video in series produced by Southampton father Will Reid .

"Most people feel pretty risqué having one or two tattoos, but one man has taken body art to an entirely new level. Vin Los, 24 from Montreal has covered his face, neck and torso with dozens of tattooed words. Far from the elaborate artistic designs most tattoo fans covet, Vin has basic words, inked in different sizes, spread haphazardly across his face and body. Scroll down for video . Vin Los has 24 tattoos on his face alone, including phrases like 'scream my name' and and 'iconic face' Vin says he chose words because drawings don't mean anything to him and he wants to make an 'impact' Looking slightly like someone has gone to town on his (admittedly perfect) body with a marker pen, Vin has even filmed himself rubbing his body down with a wet cloth to prove his inkings are real. As well as his own name in huge letters on his stomach, Vin’s arms and face are covered with words such as ‘sex bomb’, ‘iconic’, ‘Tokyo’, ‘fame’ and ‘guilty’. Vin has also had hairs tattooed onto his chest. Speaking to Vice, Vin explains: ‘Drawings don’t mean anything to me. It may sound like I have bad values or something, but my tattoos aren’t just for me. Vin also had chest hairs tattooed onto his torso, but we assume the facial hair is real . Vin says his ambition is to be the 'most famous man in the world' Vin got his first tattoo - the Le Coq Sportif logo on his chest - aged just 16 . 'I want to be an image for people to look at, something that has an impact. Everybody who sees me is bound to ask questions: “Why fame? What’s his life like?”’ Vin caught the body art bug early, getting his first tattoo - the Le Coq Sportif logo - at aged 16. He now has 24 words tattooed on his face. Despite the fact the words will be with him forever, he is surprisingly relaxed about choosing them. Far from the elaborate artistic designs most tattoo fans covet, Vin has chosen to mark himself with words, inked in different sizes and haphazardly scrawled across his face . ‘It’s very superficial. I’ll go on YouTube and listen to all the big hits and I’ll just take words from these songs. For example, “Top of the World” is from the song by The Cataracs, but it’s also what I want. ‘A lot of people ask me if I’m scared I might regret it one day. If I was indecisive, I don’t think I would write on my face.’ Unsurprisingly his highly unusual appearance combined with his good looks are gaining him increasing attention online, which is a good thing for the man who says he wants to be ‘the most famous man in the world.’","At just 24, Vin Los has 24 tattoos on his face alone .

Keira is known to attend  photo shoots without an agent or assistant: 'Why not?' she says . 'The people who make movies, whether it's directors or producers, or money people, look for things that they can identify with and if they're all predominantly middle-aged white men, then what you see are things that middle-aged white men can identify with.

Then suddenly you worry, 'What am I planting with that? I don't want her to be waiting around for a man to fix her problems. 'Maybe it's a bit silly, but because equality is going so hugely the other way, I think it probably does take being silly to try and swing it back around.'

"A silent electric bike is to be used by police forces as a means to approach criminals undetected. Zero Motorcycles in northern California have designed their a motorcycle that law enforcement officials can use to get the upper hand on criminals. And with a top speed of up to 98 miles (158 km) per hour, the police of tomorrow can chase criminals down as well if the stealth approach fails. Scroll down for video . California-based Zero Motorcycles are releasing an electric bike for police (shown). It takes between six and 9.9 hours to charge depending on the model and weighs up to 473 pounds (215 kg) Zero Motorcycles are known for their range of bikes for personal use, but this range is the first that has been developed for use by police forces. It follows in the footsteps of a similar bike, the MMX, which is an off-road bike designed for use by the military in addition to the police. Top speed: 98 miles (158 km) per hour . Range*: Up to 151 miles (243 km) Charging time*: Between six and 9.9 hours . Weight*: 396 to 473 pounds: (180 to 215 kg) Equivalent fuel economy: 408 miles to the gallon (0.58 litres per 100 km) Cost to recharge*: $0.96 to $1.60 . *Depending on model . This police bike, however, is intended to be used by law enforcement in urban locations and, owing to its silent engine, it could enable them to be safer and more discreet while on the job. According to BBC Future the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is evaluating the use of such electric motorcycles for its officers. 'There are quite a few attributes that make these bikes appealing to the police and military,' Abe Askenazi, chief technology officer for Zero Motorcycles, told BBC Future. ‘They’re quiet; they’re very stealthy.’ The motorcycle is silent to it can be used to creep up on criminals undetected. The LAPD is evaluating the vehicle for use by its officers on the city streets (shown) There are two bikes being rolled out for law enforcement services: The Zero SP and the DSP. The former is intended solely for street usage, while the later can be used both on and off road. With a range of 164 miles (264 km) on one charge, the city bike should suit police operating in urban environments quite comfortably. Each bike is devoid of a loud and polluting combustion engine, meaning they can creep up on people without alerting them or enter a dangerous location undetected. The matter of cost is also important: after the initial outlay, upwards of £10,650 ($17,900), it is said a single charge costs about 60p ($1) ‘There are major benefits to incorporating these environmentally friendly motorcycles,’ said Officer Steve Carbajal of the LAPD Off-Road Unit in a statement. ‘It costs less than 50 cents to charge compared to using gallons of gas, maintenance is simple, and the community appreciates how quiet they are.’ ‘Most importantly, our officers have an added tactical advantage while on patrol.’ The bike boasts a top speed of 98 mph and has a range of more than 150 miles. There are two models available for police officials, one just for street use (shown) and another for on and off-road driving . And it’s not just the police that are taking note of the bike - a military version called the MMX is also garnering attention. Designed for more rugged use off-road, the bike boasts two separate batteries than can easily be replaced and a simple electric motor drive. And it even has an ‘override’ switch, that can be pressed when a biker is in danger such as being shot at. This will nullify any safety systems allowing for extra speed, albeit at the risk of damaging the bike. It’s also equipped with infrared lights for night vision. For the police and military of the future, it might be bikes like these that give them the edge when it comes to stopping criminals.

"Deep-sea explorers have recovered thousands of gold and silver coins and more than 40 heavy gold bars easily worth millions of dollars, along with a slew of personal items that are a virtual time capsule of the California Gold Rush in a 150-year-old shipwreck. Newly unsealed court documents provide the first detailed inventory of a treasure trove being resurrected from an 1857 shipwreck at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The recovery effort at the SS Central America shipwreck, about 200 miles off the South Carolina coast, began in April and is expected to continue throughout the summer. A photo from 1989 shows gold bars and coins from the SS Central America which sunk in a hurricane in 1857 off the South Carolina coast. Newly unsealed court documents provide the first detailed inventory of the treasure trove which is worth millions . The operation is being directed by a court-appointed receiver of an Ohio company, led by a treasure hunter and dreamer named Tommy Thompson, that first found the Central America in 1988 in what was then a monumental achievement that was funded by a group of central Ohio investors. Immediately after finding the ship and recovering a fraction of its garden of gold, Thompson became embroiled in a decades-long legal battle over who had rights to the treasure and how it was being dispersed. None of the investors ever saw a return, and in August 2012 after failing to show up for several court hearings, a warrant was issued for Thompson's arrest. He has been a federal fugitive ever since. Meanwhile, the Central America and its gold sat untouched since 1991, the last time Thompson and his team were at the site. The new recovery operation was made possible after an Ohio court appointed a receiver over some of Thompson's companies, and he awarded a contract to conduct the efforts to Tampa, Florida-based Odyssey Marine Exploration. The inventories, unsealed by a federal judge in Virginia late Wednesday, show that Odyssey Marine has brought up 43 solid gold bars, 1,300 $20 double eagle gold coins, and thousands more gold and silver coins. An artist's impression of the U.S. Mail ship SS Central America which foundered in 1857 with a loss of 423 lives in a hurricane off Charleston, South Carolina . Odyssey Marine could not immediately provide an estimate of what the gold is worth, but it's easily in the millions, based on past sales of such items. Included among passenger items recovered from the Central America are a safe that contained two cotton pieces of clothing wrapped tightly around gold coins, nuggets, and dust, a pouch with 134 gold double eagles, a leather saddlebag with more nuggets, and a small packet filled with paper and sealed with twine. Other personal items include the photographs of at least 60 passengers, which were left at the bottom of the ocean until Odyssey Marine can figure out how to safely recover them. The photos are known as ambrotypes, a short-lived type of photography that used glass plates. 'Photographs of any mid-19th century Gold Rush miners are rare, and these ambrotypes are the only examples found on any 19th-century shipwreck worldwide,' according to a court report by Odyssey Marine. The inventories document what Odyssey Marine recovered at the shipwreck from the beginning of the operation on April 15 through June 15. An inventory of operations in the last month should be filed soon.","The recovery effort at the SS Central .

"A father with Parkinson’s disease was arrested as he watched the Olympic cycling road race because he ‘failed to smile or look like he was enjoying himself’. Mark Worsfold, a martial arts trainer and former soldier, claims that he  was thrown to the floor and handcuffed just as cyclists passed by. His worried wife Nicola only found out he was being held after she reported him missing when he did not turn up for their daughter’s ninth birthday party. Arrested: Parkinson's disease sufferer Mark Worsfold, pictured with his wife Nicola and their daughter, was held by police as he watched the cycling because he 'failed to smile' The 54-year-old had his fingerprints, DNA and mugshot taken before being questioned about why he did not appear  to be enjoying the event on July 28. Police said Mr Worsfold, who was held for over five hours, was arrested because of ‘his manner, his state of dress and his  proximity to the course’. A spokesman added that the arrest was necessary to avoid a breach of the peace because he was standing near a group of protesters. But Mr Worsfold, who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in 2010, said that one of the symptoms of the disease is muscle rigidity,  which can cause his face to become expressionless and mask-like. Mr Worsfold, who had stopped  to watch the men’s road race in Leatherhead, Surrey, after holding a Taekwondo demonstration nearby, said officers told him he was being arrested and taken to Reigate police station because he was not smiling. Martin Worsfold . ‘I was sitting minding my own business,’ he told a local newspaper. ‘Before I knew anything the police grabbed me off this seven-foot wall, threw me to the floor and cuffed me so all I saw of the cycle race was between the feet of people from the pavement. ‘It could have been done better. I was arrested for not smiling. I have Parkinson’s.’ Mr Worsfold, who lives in an £800,000 three-bedroom house in the picturesque village of Ockham near Woking, has since asked for a letter of exoneration from police. Surrey Police said he was  initially arrested on suspicion of a public order offence but was ‘given words of advice’ before being ‘released with no further action’. A spokesman added that he was found to be in possession of a legal folding knife and several rubber knives which had been used for his Taekwondo demonstration. Thousands of spectators lined the route of the cycling road race through London and Surrey on the first day of the London Olympics . The officers who made the arrest have apologised to him. In a statement, the spokesman added: ‘He was positioned close to a group of protesters and based on his manner, his state of dress and his proximity to the course, officers made an arrest to prevent a possible breach of the peace. ‘There were a number of factors which led officers to make this arrest, including the fact the race was approaching, the heightened level of security due to the high  profile nature of the event and the sheer number of spectators.’ The force has received a letter from Mr Worsfold in which he has said he ‘fully understands and appreciates the action taken by officers’, the spokesman said. Last night, campaigners for Parkinson’s patients said it was an example of the ‘chronic misunderstandings’ those with the condition face. Laura Bowey, of Parkinson’s UK, added: ‘Despite affecting more than 127,000 people in the UK, those with Parkinson’s are subject to chronic misunderstandings and misconceptions about the condition. ‘All too frequently people with Parkinson’s tell us how are they are accused of being drunk, or acting suspiciously as they go about their daily lives. ‘We hope that Mark’s experience will help to raise awareness of this distressing problem.’","Former soldier Mark Worsfold arrested for his 'manner, state of dress and proximity to the course' as cyclists came through Leatherhead .

"The parents of murdered U.S. hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig said today that they would forgive his ISIS terrorist killers. Ed and Paula Kassig made a short statement on Monday afternoon at their church in Indianapolis after it was confirmed that the extremists had beheaded their 26-year-old son, following a review of an ISIS video released on Sunday. Mr and Mrs Kassig said 'our hearts are battered but they will mend' and asked people around the world to pray for their son. Scroll down for video .

American ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, with Jihadi John, who threatens to behead him in a video for the terror group . 'In 26 years, he has witnessed and experienced firsthand more of the harsh realities of life than most of us can imagine,"" Paula Kassig said of her son, Peter, who changed his first name to Abdul-Rahman after converting to Islam during captivity. 'But rather than letting the darkness overwhelm him, he has chosen to believe in the good — in himself and in others. 'Peter's life is evidence that he's been right all along — one person can make a difference.' The aid worker and former U.S. Army Ranger was captured October 1, 2013, while delivering aid in Syria through a relief organization he founded. The White House confirmed Kassig's death on Sunday after the Islamic State group released a video showing that Kassig had been beheaded. The slain hostage's parents said they were 'heartbroken' by their son's killing, but 'incredibly proud' of his humanitarian work. Kassig 'lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,' the parents said. With Kassig's death, the Islamic State group has killed five Westerners it was holding. Peter Kassig standing in front of a truck filled with supplies for Syrian refugees. He was captured October 1, 2013 by militants . Mr and Mrs Kassig maintained their compsure as they spoke to the media on Monday about the recent execution of their son by ISIL forces at Epworth United Methodist Church in Indianapolis, Indiana . American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded, as were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. President Obama confirmed Kassig's slaying on Sunday after a U.S. review of the video, which also showed the mass beheadings of a dozen Syrian soldiers. Kassig 'was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity,' Obama said in a statement. Unlike previous videos of slain Western hostages, the footage released Sunday did not show the decapitation of Kassig or the moments leading up to his death. The footage released Sunday identifies the militants' location as Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that the Islamic State group uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur. The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The black-clad militant warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate. In this August 2013 photo provided by Peter Kassig, right, works as a medic to help a wounded man near Deir Ezzor, Syria . 'We say to you, Obama: You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago,' the militant said. 'Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies.' A U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters and the Iraqi military. Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, he returned to the Middle East in 2012 and  formed a relief group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to aid Syrian refugees. A certified EMT, Kassig had delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrians before being captured in eastern Syria on Oct. 1, 2013. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman. In a statement issued as he flew back to Washington from the Asia-Pacific region, Obama said Kassig 'was a humanitarian who worked to save the lives of Syrians injured and dispossessed' by war. The president offered prayers and condolences to Kassig's family. 'We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time,' he said.","Ed and Paula Kassig made a short statement on Monday from their Indiana church where they said their 'hearts were battered but will mend'

"The UN's full and final findings on the state of the planet's climate have been published (pictured) Global warming is unequivocal and human influence has been the dominant cause since the mid-20th century, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC's full and final findings on the state of the planet’s climate have been published and the report, which was put together for the UN, says that limiting climate change will require ‘substantial and sustained’ reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. The findings of the report, which includes the comment that global warming is 'almost definitely' caused by humans, were approved by the member governments of the IPCC in September. The final version has now been released to provide detailed information to policymakers and the scientific community. The Working Group I Fifth Assessment Report has 1,500 pages of text, 600 diagrams, cites 9,000 scientific publications and claims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the physical science basis of climate change. ‘The report provides information about what has changed in the climate system, why it has changed, and how it will change in the future,’ said Thomas Stocker, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group I. It says that atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, already at levels not seen in at least 800,000 years, will persist for many centuries and ‘continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all components of the climate system’. Enlarge . The IPPC reported revealed that it is 'extremely likely' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming. It claims a rise in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (right) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century. But the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely 'paused' over the past two decades (left) The high latitudes and the equatorial Pacific Ocean are likely to experience an increase in annual mean precipitation by the end of this century (right). In many midlatitude . and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986-2005 period (left) Since the publication of the IPCC report, more Americans than ever before believe that global warming isn't happening. The Yale Project on Climate Change Communication study, which was published last month, found the number has risen to 23 percent, up seven percentage points since April 2013. The latest survey, taken in November 2013, finds that the majority of Americans — 63 percent — do believe in climate change, and 53 percent are 'somewhat' or 'very' worried about the consequences. The researchers also say Americans believe that even if it exists, global warming is not their problem. 'Over years of research, we have consistently found that, on average, Americans view global warming as a threat distant in space and time – a risk that will affect far away places, other species, or future generations more than people here and now,' the report says. 'We still find this same pattern, in which fewer than half of Americans (38%) believe they personally will be harmed a 'moderate amount' or a 'great deal' by global warming. The report highlights a number of doomsday scenarios, including extreme storms, heat waves, rising sea levels and the melting of Greenland. Among its findings are that sea levels have risen by 19cm since 1901 and are expected to rise a further 26-82cm by the end of the century. But it concedes that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years, despite growing amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. Temperature rises have dropped from 0.12°C per decade since 1951 to just 0.05°C per decade since 1998. This slowdown has been seized upon by climate sceptics who claim carbon dioxide is not as damaging as has been suggested. IPCC scientists, however, believe the pause is temporary and a return to 'substantial warming' is expected in coming decades. Perhaps most controversially, the report it says that humans are between 95 per cent and 100 per cent to blame for the warming of the planet since the mid 20th Century and this level of certainty among scientists is a boost from the 2007 report, which said that global warming was ‘very likely’ to have been caused by humans. ‘Human influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,’ says the report. CO2 concentrations have . increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions, claims the IPCC. The ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted . anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification . ‘This evidence for human influence has grown since AR4 (the last IPCC report). It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century,’ it adds. An ‘atlas’ of global and regional climate projections is included in the final version of the report, which contains a series of maps showing temperature and rainfall estimates for 35 regions of the world. In order to show the way drafts and reviews of the report were put together, the IPCC has also released all of  the 54,677 comments by experts that informed the final version. Scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report. They say it will 'very likely' exceed that observed during 1971-2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets .","Finalised version of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report has been released .

"A small remote town where Wi-Fi is banned has become an unlikely haven for people claiming modern technology has been making them ill. The so-called 'Wi-Fi refugees' are flocking to the tiny settlement to escape painful symptoms including burning skin, chest pains and acute headaches. The sufferers argue the affliction - a condition known as Electromagnetic Sensitivity - has been eased by the move and report feeling much better. Behind the times: Dozens of Americans have relocated to the small town of Green Bank, West Virginia in hopes of escaping electromagnetic signals . Green Bank is in the middle of the National Radio Quiet Zone which was established to provide optimum conditions for telescopes . Refugee: Diane Schou moved to Green Bank from Iowa when she started noticing pain whenever she was near a cell phone or device with WiFi . Many have relocated to Green Bank, West Virginia, from across America to avoid mobile phones, Wi-Fi hotspots, TV and radio transmissions. As of 2013, 36 people have relocated to Green Bank. One, Diane Schou, travelled nearly 1,000 miles from her former home in Iowa to join the isolated town of just 147 residents. Diane said: 'I used to be sick all the time when I lived in Iowa. I was in constant pain. 'If anyone came near me with a cell phone or a device with Wi-Fi I would be in agony. 'But since I've moved to Green Banks the illnesses have cleared up.' Condition: People who claim to suffer from pain associated with WiFi and other signals say they have Electromagnetic Sensitivity . Sweden is the only country to recognize Electromagnetic Sensitivity as a real condition . Green Bank, in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, falls in the middle of the 13,000 square mile National Radio Quiet Zone. Here, mobile phones, radio and TV transmitters and Wi-Fi are forbidden to prevent interference with one of the world's largest radio telescopes. The National Radio Astronomy Observatory telescope is the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. Nearly 4 per cent of the UK and US population could be affected by EHS, estimates reveal. But despite nearly 30 studies being carried out into the phenomena, Sweden is currently the only country to recognise it as a medical condition. Sufferers there can claim social support the same as if they had other disabilities. Another EHS sufferer, former bank vice-president Deborah Cooney said she felt she was being 'slowly poisoned' back in San Diego, California. New life: Deborah Cooney, one of Green Bank's newer residents, moved from San Diego where she says she was being 'slowly poisoned' by a WiFi smart meter installed next to her home . The 50-year-old said her symptoms developed after hundreds of Wi-Fi enabled smart meters were installed next to her home in 2011. Deborah said: 'It began with a constant ringing in my ears. I couldn't sleep in the house anymore and felt sick all the time. 'Any food I brought into the house would make me feel ill. I got heart palpitations. 'It was like I was slowly being poisoned.' Even her pet cat Mimi, a purebred Himalayan, became ill from the harmful radiation she believed had been emitted from the smart meters, she added. Deborah added: 'Mimi went from being a typical house cat to one that would never stay home and eventually she ran away and never came back.'","Green Bank, West Virginia is situated in the middle of the National Radio Quiet Zone .
All electromagnetic signals are banned within the zone including WiFi and cellphones .
The zone was set up to protect the world's largest radio telescopes from electronic interference .
Americans from across the country have resettled in Green Bank to get away from the signals, which they find physically damaging .
More than 30 people have relocated to Green Bank as of 2013 ."
