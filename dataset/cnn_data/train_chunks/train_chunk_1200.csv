"Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Cern, Geneva say they have discovered two new subatomic particles by smashing protons together. The two new particles, called Xi_b'- and Xi_b*, were previously predicted to exist but had never been seen before. It's hoped the discovery could shed more light on how the universe works beyond the currently accepted models of physics. The Large Hadron Collider in Geneva has discovered two new particles. The discovery was made by smashing protons at 99.9999% the speed of light (illustration shown). The two new particles are called Xi_b'- and Xi_b* and are each six times more massive than a proton . The new particles were created by firing protons around the 17-mile (27km) tube of the LHC, specifically the Large Hadron Collider Beauty (LHCb) experiment. They were then smashed together at 99.9999 per cent the speed of light, replicating the conditions at the Big Bang . As the protons collide, huge energies are released and previously unseen particles can be created and detected for a fraction of a second. Discovering new particles isn't that rare at Cern - Dr Patrick Koppenburg from the Netherlands’ Nikhef Institute told the Wall Street Journal that three to five are discovered every year. Quarks are elementary particles, the smallest particles we know to exist. When they combine they form compound particles known as hadrons that are grouped in two families - baryons and mesons. Quarks are said to have six ‘flavours’: Up, Down, Charm, Strange, Top and Bottom (also known as Beauty). Combinations of quarks within these flavours gives rise to the ‘larger’ particles. Groups of three quarks are known as baryons. An example of a baryon is a proton, which is made of two 'Up' quarks and a 'Down' quark. But, he added: 'Here we have two in one go, which is quite extraordinary.' The new particles discovered are known as baryons, and are made up of smaller subatomic particles called quarks. Quarks are among the smallest particles known to exist that make up all other particles, known as elementary particles. There are six different types of quark, and combining them together in different combinations produces larger particles. Baryons include some of the more massive subatomic particles, such as protons and neutrons, that make up most of the visible matter in the universe. But while particles like protons and neutrons are ever-present in the modern universe, other particles decay rapidly and are harder to spot. That is what scientists at Cern have been investigating - namely, over the past few years they have smashed particles together at close to light speed to simulate the conditions of the Big Bang. By creating a replica cosmic 'primordial soup' they are able to create some of the particles that were present at the Big Bang but do not exist today. A loose analogy would be smashing an apple and a pear together at the speed of light, and seeing a strawberry flash into existence for a tiny fraction of a second. This graph shows the results from the LHCb that confirmed the existence of the particles. Xi_b'- is the first peak and Xi_b*- is the second peak. The black points are the signal sample and the hatched red histogram is a control sample. The blue curve represents a model including the two new particles, fitted to the data . The new particles were created by firing protons around the 17-mile (27km) tube of the LHC, specifically the Large Hadron Collider Beauty (LHCb) experiment, pictured . Atoms are usually made of protons, neutrons and electrons . These are made of even smaller elementary particles. Elementary particles, also known as fundamental particles, are the smallest particles we know to exist. They are subdivided into two groups, the first being fermions, which are said to be the particles that make up matter. The second are bosons, the force particles that hold the others together. Within the group of fermions are subatomic particles known as quarks. When quarks combine in threes, they form compound particles known as baryons. Protons are probably the best-known baryons. Sometimes, . quarks interact with corresponding anti-particles (such as . anti-quarks), which have the same mass but opposite charges. When this happens, they form mesons. Mesons . often turn up in the decay of heavy man-made particles, such as those . in particle accelerators, nuclear reactors and cosmic rays. Mesons, baryons, and other kinds of particles that take part in interactions like these are called hadrons. In this latest research the new X_iB particles are made of one 'strange', one 'down' and one 'bottom' (or beauty) quark. They were created by smashing together protons, but were found time be six times as massive as a proton. Each of the two new particles also had it's own 'spin', which basically explains how they interact with magnetic fields. It was found that the spin of the lighter strange and down quarks in the Xi_b*- particle were aligned, while in the Xi_b'- particle they pointed in opposite directions - making the former slightly heavier. Scientists hailed the discovery of the two particles as an important moment for physics that would help them further understand the universe at a subatomic level. 'Nature was kind and gave us two particles for the price of one,' said Dr Matthew Charles of the CNRS's LPNHE laboratory at Paris VI University. 'The Xi_b'- is very close in mass to the sum of its decay products: if it had been just a little lighter, we wouldn't have seen it at all using the decay signature that we were looking for.' Dr Steven Blusk from Syracuse University in New York added: 'This is a very exciting result. Thanks to LHCb's excellent hadron identification, which is unique among the LHC experiments, we were able to separate a very clean and strong signal from the background. 'It demonstrates once again the sensitivity and how precise the LHCb detector is.' Subatomic particles can be largely classified in two groups (shown in graphic): Fermions, which include quarks and leptons, are those that make up matter, while bosons are said to be the 'force' particles . Finding new particles improves our knowledge of subatomic physics (illustrated is an atom with eletrons), and it also reveals how the universe works beyond our models. The finding of two particles in one experiment was also described as being 'extraordinary' In addition to finding out the mass of the particles, the scientists also discovered how unstable the particles were. The results match up with predictions based on the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is part of the Standard Model of particle physics, the theory that describes the fundamental particles of matter, how they interact and the forces between them. Testing QCD at high precision is key to refining our understanding of quark dynamics, models of which are tremendously difficult to calculate. 'If we want to find new physics beyond the Standard Model, we need first to have a sharp picture,' said Dr Koppenburg. 'Such high precision studies will help us to differentiate between Standard Model effects and anything new or unexpected in the future.' The latest measurements were made with data taken at the LHC during 2011-2012. The LHC is currently being prepared - after its first long shutdown - to operate at higher energies and with more intense beams. It is scheduled to restart by spring 2015.","The Large Hadron Collider in Geneva has discovered two new particles .

"Seeing just one waterspout is thought by many to be a once-in-a-lifetime event, but one lucky boat passenger managed to capture four in these amazing pictures. Italian Roberto Giudici managed to take the pictures while sailing off the Greek Island of Orthoni, in the Ionian Sea, when a huge storm blew up over night. The morning light then revealed this stunning scene of the four waterspouts, which develop in a similar way to tornadoes but are usually far weaker. Waterspouts: Roberto Giudici captured these pictures while sailing off the Greek Island of Orthoni, in the Ionian Sea . The pictures were taken in 1999 but have only come to light after they appeared on a NASA website. Mr Giudici, who now lives in Rennes, France, said: 'We were about a mile away from the nearest one, I asked the captain if they were dangerous as we were heading towards them. 'He looked at me and made a gesture, but he seemed to be hopeful. 'I observed this sight over the Adriatic Sea on a boat trip to Brindisi, Italy. As we departed, the weather was very summer-like with some humidity, hot and sunny. Awe-inspiring: The pictures were taken in 1999 but have only come to light after they appeared on a NASA website . 'Cumuliform clouds developed during our excursion, but the weather didn't appear threatening. In fact, the atmospheric pressure was stable at 1,024 millibars. Photographer: Roberto Giudici said the boat he was on actually passed through the funnels as it continued on its journey . 'Suddenly, we saw a line of funnel clouds straight in front of our boat. The photo shows the most recently formed waterspout in the foreground; the oldest spout, in the background, would disappear in a few seconds.' Mr Giudici however said these were not the only waterspouts he saw while on the boat. He said: 'I could count at least 10 on the starboard and some on the port side and they lasted for about four minutes each. 'The photo shows actually the first waterspout as being the youngest and the latter very thin and the oldest, ready to disappear. 'Our boat actually passed through the scary funnels. The spouts were spaced about a third of a nautical mile from each other. 'This is obviously an old picture and is not even digital but I have been asked recently if it is a fake, which it is not, it has now been used on the website Earth Science, part of NASA's Earth Science Division.' Waterspouts form at focused points over the warmer sea-water where condensation builds between the water and cloud, which contains cool, moist air. The spouts do not pull water into the sky, they remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils. Nasa's Jim Foster said he believed the photograph was real. He said: 'Waterspouts having multiple funnels, while not often photographed, occur more often than do tornadoes that have multiple funnels. 'It seems that the convective cloud systems that lead to waterspout formation, which have relatively weak circulation fields compared to tornadoes, can support more but much smaller funnels.' Waterspouts form in a similar way to tornadoes but are often weaker than their land counterparts. The spouts do not suck up water but instead remain just above the sea forming clouds which form into twisting coils. The water comes from condensation building up between the warm sea-water and the cloud which contains cool, moist air. Stronger versions can occur from mesocyclones - which are a vortex of air within a convective storm. While waterspouts often form in the tropics they have been spotted in other areas including Europe, New Zealand, the Great Lakes and Antarctica.","Italian Roberto Giudici captured images while sailing off Greek island .

"Tara Kyle, the wife of murdered ex-Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, is suing the bosses of the Texas-based tactical-training company that he co-founded in 2009. Kyle has filed a suit in Dallas County that alleges that Steven Young, the CEO of Craft International, and Bo French, the company’s COO, have conspired to ‘steal’ the company. The suit claims that the pair stole Craft’s ‘assets, client lists, contacts, contracts, trademarks, training and operating manuals… and caused confusion in advertising services’. Law suit: Tara Kyle (right) alleges that the bosses of the company her slain husband Chris (left) co-founded are trying to steal it . Logo: Craft's emblem, which Chris Kyle designed himself, states that violence can be a solution . It also alleges that they have been ‘manipulating Craft’s stock, mishandling funds, diverting assets and mismanaging and usurping Craft’s contracts’. The suit says that Taya Kyle is the 85 per cent interest holder of Craft and as such has the right to inspect the company’s financial records. However, it is  alleged that Mr Young and Mr French have refused this request – ‘a violation of the Texas Business Organizations Code’. The pair both had the right to buy Chris Kyle’s share of the company, but did not do so within the time frame of 130 days stipulated by Craft’s rules. The suit alleges that they diverted Craft’s profits to a new company called Craft International Risk Management. Kyle’s attorney, Larry Friedman, told The Dallas Morning News: ‘Someone is manipulating the company, and we can’t stand for that.’ The suit describes Mr Young as ‘an experienced thief’, pointing out that he was arrested for burglary of a vehicle in 1988. When approached by the Dallas Morning News, Mr French made no comment. Kyle is considered to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. military history with 255 confirmed kills in combat. While serving in Iraq, insurgents named him ‘The Devil of Ramadi’ and placed an $80,000 ransom on his head. Allegations: The suit brought by Tara Kyle makes a series of claims against Craft International's CEO and COO . Bestseller: Chris Kyle penned an account of his time as a SEAL sniper . 'Killer': authorities say Eddie Ray Routh killed Kyle at a gun range in Texas where the pair had been shooting . He was killed in February along with his friend Chad Littlefield at a Texas gun range, allegedly by Iraq War veteran Eddie Ray Routh. Routh, is believed to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, and Kyle was trying to help the troubled former soldier by taking him to the gun range to relax. Routh, instead, allegedly turned the gun on Kyle and Littlefield, killing both men.","Tara Kyle claims that the CEO and COO of Craft International have been diverting assets .

"Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital over stomach problems related to last summer's shooting where he was wounded six times. Knight, 49, had been due in a Los Angeles courtroom on Thursday to face robbery charges after he and rapper Katt Williams allegedly stole a paparazzo's camera last September. The rap mogul was being transferred to court this morning when he fell ill and was taken by ambulance to hospital. Marion 'Suge' Knight (right), next to his attorney David E Kenner, is arraigned on murder charges in Compton, California on February 3. His lawyer, David Kenner, told TMZ  that Knight had suffered bleeding in the stomach as part of a number of health problems following the nightclub shooting. There was no update on his condition. Knight, 49, also faces charges of murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run after authorities said he ran down and killed one man and seriously injured another in a parking lot on January 29. Knight has pleaded not guilty. Authorities allege Knight killed Terry Carter, 55, and injured another, Cle 'Bone' Sloan, 51, with his pickup truck near a film set in Compton, California. Police said he fled the scene. Knight was out on bail in the separate robbery case at the time. His lawyer claimed that Knight was ambushed and feared for his life prior to the hit-and-run. The music producer was earlier hospitalized on February 3 when he had a panic attack moments after pleading not guilty to all charges. Armed guards reportedly watched over Knight in hospital. TMZ reported that doctors discovered he had a blood clot and he was treated with blood thinners. Knight's blood clots have been an ongoing health problem for him since he was shot last August at 1Oak Nightclub in West Hollywood. He returned to court on February 9 where a judge ordered him to stay behind bars until his next hearing. Knight is the co-founder of Death Row Records, which once boasted Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg on its books. Knight struck two men with his truck on January 29 in Compton, California.

"They've been married since 1966 but Phil Robertson has only just bought his wife Kay a wedding ring. The under-fire Duck Dynasty star splashed out on a diamond sparkler for his long suffering wife this Christmas and granddaughter Sadie Robertson shared a picture of the happy couple on Twitter. 'After 50 years of marriage, Papaw Phil finally gave Mamaw Kay a wedding ring for Christmas (sic)', Sadie wrote. Robertson provoked outrage when homophobic comments he made in an interview with GQ magazine were made public two weeks ago. He was quoted as saying: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. Scroll down for video . She only had to wait 50 years: Phil Robertson bought his wife Kay a wedding ring for Christmas, even though the couple married in 1966 . 'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' Comparisons he made between homosexuality and bestiality also caused offense. 'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there... Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men.' The 67-year-old has faced condemnation from some corners, but his supporters have rallied around the embattled reality TV star, saying he has a right to free speech. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Robertson refused to back down from his controversial comments, saying that 'sexual immorality' is the 'number one' sinful act. 'I have made hundreds and hundreds of speeches and you can pick them apart and the center has always been Jesus Christ. Patriarch: Phil Robertson made his fortune manufacturing duck calls and has cemented his notoriety with a reality television show . God-fearing: Phil Robertson (center) leaves the White's Ferry Road Church of Christ in West Monroe, Louisiana the Sunday before Christmas . Running around: 'Miss Kay' has said her husband of more than four decades Phil Robertson, whose homophobic comments have raised ire recently, used to cheat on her with other women . ‘Do many people get up and walk out? Yeah, all the time, do I hold it against them? No. Anybody can get up and stop listening. We are all just humans on this planet.’ His family and local community have come to his defense and stood firmly behind him, and the family's $400 million empire doesn't seem in any danger of collapsing. Despite the patriarch being put on an indefinite hiatus by network A&E, the family's merchandise has been reinstated by Cracker Barrel after fans complained about its removal from shelves. In a picture of the couple taken yesterday, Kay perches on the sofa wearing a Christmas jumper, huge . smile and the large diamond rock, while her . husband reclines on the sofa pointing at the ring. While they are happily married now, Phil and Miss Kay, as his wife is known, have previously opened up about their pre-fame struggles with Robertson's alcohol problems and adultery. In the documentary The Robertsons, she said: 'The drinking got worse. And I knew then, but I didn't want to believe it - he was running around on me. 'And what I would tell my boys all the time is, “That's not your daddy. That's the devil in your daddy.”  I’ve been fighting for this marriage for a long time.' Despite his past, Robertson appears to have no qualms with moralizing about other people's lifestyles. He came under fire from gay rights group GLAAD after making the homophobic comments in the January 2014 issue of GQ magazine and Duck Dynasty show bosses have put him on indefinite hiatus. Ring in: The long-awaited wedding ring looks to be a sizeable diamond . Struggle: Kay has admitted her marriage to Phil was tough before he gave up drinking and found God . Robertson, who claims to be devoutly Christian, then grouped homosexuals in with terrorists and prostitutes in a paraphrased Bible quote. He said: 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right.' Hometown heroes: A sign in West Monroe, Louisiana, the setting for 'Duck Dynasty' in support of Phil Robertson . GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. Despite being put on suspension by the network, Phil has stood by his statements and his family have defended him - saying they wouldn't continue to film the show if their patriarch wasn't involved. MailOnline was given exclusive access to a bible study meeting held last Sunday at the family's church in West Monroe, Louisiana. At the meeting, Robertson spoke out about the criticism, saying: 'I will not give or back off my path'. At the small gathering, Robertson gave a speech going so far as to say that Jesus could save gay people. 'I love all men and women. I am a lover of humanity, not a hater,' he said. Robertson addressed White's Ferry Road Church . wearing his full camouflage suit for around 45 . minutes. Reality star: This undated image released by A&E shows Phil Robertson from the popular series 'Duck Dynasty.' Robertson was suspended last week for disparaging comments he made to GQ magazine about gay people . He said: ‘I have . been immoral, drunk, high. I ran with the wicked people for 28 years and . I have run with the Jesus people since and the contrast is astounding. I tell people, ""You are a sinner, we all are. Do you want to hear my story before I give you the bottom line on your story?"" ‘We . murder each other and we steal from one another, sex and immorality . goes ballistic. All the diseases that just so happen to follow sexual . mischief… boy there are some microbes running around now. ‘Sexual . sins are numerous and many, I have a few myself. So what is your safest . course of action?

The family are multimillionaires due to the success of Phil’s Duck Commander Company, which he formed in 1973 to sell the duck call he invented a year earlier.

"Secret Service agents rarely speak, but there’s nothing wrong with their hearing. Agents confessed to Ronald Kessler, author of an upcoming blockbuster book about the hidden lives of presidents,  that they have overheard Michelle Obama pushing her husband ‘to be more aggressive in attacking Republicans and to side with blacks in racial controversies.’ And Obama did as he was told, says Kessler in The First Family Detail. Scroll down for video . Protection: The first family of Barack and Michelle Obama, Sasha and Malia walk across the lawn of the White House guarded by Secret Service agents . When Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida on the night of February 26, 2012. 'That could have been me thirty-five years ago', Obama stated. Obama was also vocal about a Cambridge, Massachusetts police officer who arrested a black Harvard profession being noisy during a break-in investigation. He viewed it as an unnecessary and stupid arrest. A former agent listening to the first couple's conversations in the presidential limo, believed Michelle's agenda goes back to a statement she made when Barack was running for president. 'For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country'. Significant: New book, First Family Detail, claims that Michelle Obama tried to push President Obama into being more vocal in support of the family of Trayvon Martin following his death at the hands of George Zimmerman, (right) Beer summit: Vice President, Joe Biden, (left), Harvard professor, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Sgt. James Crowley and President Obama at the so-called Beer Summit at the White House 2009 . Is rude as Hillary is to the Secret Service, the current First Lady, code named Renaissance, is friendly, considerate and treats the agents with respect. She has twenty agents protecting her and she insists that they all call her by her first name. ‘Michelle is friendly – she touches you’, an agent stated and her mother, Marian Robinson, in residence at the White House to help care for their two daughters, goes out of her way to be gracious to the Secret Service as well. Michelle even gave Father’s Day cards to agents who were dads and working the shift on that day. The Obamas invited agents to dinner two times at their Hyde Park home in Chicago while he was running for President, and he made sure the agents took time out to eat the chili. While Bill Clinton was chronically late, Obama usually runs on time but if he’s dragging, Michelle gets on his case and reminds him he is being disrespectful to the agents. Gatecrashers: Michaele and Tareq Salahi attended a White House function without invitation in 2009 and were introduced to President Obama in one of the Secret Service's most notorious security breaches . Daughters Malia and Sasha get high marks for being ‘great kids’ and ‘very respectable young ladies’. While both Barack and Michelle are well liked and respected by the Secret Service, agents disclosed that laxness and undercutting of basic security protocols in this administration now threaten the life of the president as well as the First Lady. Lax security has allowed guests into events without proper screening to detect firearms. Current agency protocols are not up-to-date and using the latest firearms and they have cut back on the size of counterassault teams. Agents are also filling out their own test scores on their physical fitness tests as well as not following proper rules for firearm re-qualification. This imposed cost cutting and lowering of standards first emerged when serial party crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi and Carlos Allen were allowed into a White House state dinner in November 2009 while not on the guest list. Special treatment: According to First Family Detail, Hollywood superstar Bradley Cooper was allowed to drive his car into a function attended by the president and exempted by security checks . The ‘gatecrashers’ were subpoenaed by the U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee to appear at a hearing to discuss the breach of security where they invoked the Fifth Amendment. Allegations: Ronald Kessler has claimed that the Secret Service has a huge underfunding problem in his new book First Family Detail . The lowered agency security standards surfaced again when agents were sent home in April 2012 and exposed as engaging prostitutes while traveling with Obama to Cartagena, Colombia. Their sordid little affairs blew up when one belligerent agent refused to pay the prostitute her requisite fee. If agents blow the whistle on any breach of security, they know they will suffer retribution from management so they keep quiet. ‘The pressure not to rock the boat takes precedence over protecting the president from the jackal, the term agents use to refer to a potential assassin’. Another major breach of security occurred on the night of the White House Correspondent’s Dinner at the Washington Hilton in April 2013. While the advance security detail swept the hotel and grounds, agents received orders from a high-ranking agency official in New York to allow movie star Bradley Cooper’s vehicle onto the grounds without screening. Agents were shocked at the breach knowing that it could have been loaded with explosives, biological or chemical weapons. The canine team was not even allowed to inspect the vehicle. ‘Agents were told not to sweep the car. Just let it in and don’t give Cooper any problems’. Cooper was given a free pass – ‘and this was two weeks after the terrorist attack on our soil in Boston’. ‘That’s just one example of the arrogance of senior managers in the Secret Service. They think they’re accountable to no one’","New book claims that Michelle Obama asked President Obama to be vocal in support of African Americans .

"Mohammed Abdi, who had a small part in Captain Phillips, has been jailed for the violent attacks . An actor who appeared alongside Tom Hanks as a Somali pirate in the blockbuster film Captain Phillips has been jailed for assaulting a man so badly he was left brain damaged. Mohammed Abdi, who had a minor role in the 2013 action film, fractured the man's cheekbone by kicking him in the head before bundling him into a car in Rusholme, Manchester, with two accomplices. The 27-year-old was jailed for two-and-a-half years for his 'deplorable' attacks by a judge who said he was a fan of the movie which was filmed in 2012. Manchester Crown Court heard how Abdi and two others attacked the man outside a fried chicken shop at 6am on March 2. Kicked unconscious, the victim, with whom Abdi had previously been involved in a fraud case, suffered a brain haemorrhage. In August the actor was involved in a separate attack in which he used bottle to slash a man's arm at a bakery in front of horrified staff and customers. David Temkin, defending, said there was 'another side' to Abdi, who had the 'privileged experience' of nine weeks filming in Morocco after being cast in Captain Phillips. Sentencing the criminal to two-and-a-half years behind bars, Judge Martin Rudland said, referring to the film's final scenes: 'Was he in the capsule at the end when the Navy Seals were trying to get in? 'When I watched this film I thought where have they got these fantastic Somali actors from? They are extremely convincing.' The 27-year-old had a minor role in the film, starring (left to right) Barkhad Abdi, Tom Hanks and Faysal Ahmed, none of whom are implicated in the defendant's crimes . He added it was a 'great shame' to see the man facing jail. 'It's a whisker between behaviour of this sort and death, but you were completely unmindful of that,' the judge said. Mohammed Omar Ali, 33, and Hamid Hassan, 27, were jailed for two years after admitting GBH. Abdi's accomplices in the second attack, Ismail Warsama, 30,  and Abdi Arteh, were given 12-month suspended sentences after admitting affray.","Mohammed Abdi had a minor role in Captain Phillips, filmed in 2012 .

"It is a rebrand aimed at helping students track down a university's website more quickly. But Newcastle University's attempts to trademark a rather rude word as part of an image change might just leave those students somewhat offended. According to City AM, the university has attempted to patent the Central University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Rebranding? The University of Newcastle has reportedly applied for several rather unfortunate patents . The name could cause offence if, as so many educational institution's names are, the university is known in its unpublishable acronym form. The Tyneside uni has also reportedly applied to trademark the Civic University of Newcastle upon Tyne name. A slightly more publishable acronym, but one that could still leave the uni open to much sniggering is RUNT, derived from a third name the university has attempted to make its own, the Research University of Newcastle Upon Tyne. But the suggested trademark that could land the university in particularly hot water is the idea it could become the NewcastleGateshead University. Current name: The institution's current guise is unlikely to offend . That name is likely to offend people from both Newcastle and Gateshead, neither of whom are quick to welcome being associated with their neighbouring town. A Newcastle University spokesman told HuffPost UK: 'We have registered these new trademarks to help students who may be searching for us on the web, particularly international students. 'They are all common variations that people may search for and they will simply help interested students find us quicker.' An American high school raised eyebrows last month when students were seen wearing their new pride T-shirts emblazoned with the letters 'WTF'. The students, from the North Pointe Prep High School in Arizona, insisted that the letters respectfully referred to We're The Falcons. But some parents disagreed, with the letters more commonly used as a popular acronym for 'What the f***'.","Newcastle University has reportedly tried to patent the Central University of Newcastle upon Tyne name .

"The married lead pastor of a mega-church in the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert has been forced to resign after church leaders discovered that he has been engaging in multiple extramarital affairs with women from his congregation. Mark Connelly admitted to his sins and resigned as lead pastor of Mission Community Church on December 30 after being confronted about the affairs and asked to leave. Connelly and his wife, Kay, have been married for 29 years and have two children, Luke and Naomi, together. Mark Connelly resigned as lead pastor of Mission Community Church on December 30, but this photo of him together with his wife Kay remains on the church's website . An estimated 6,000 people attend services at the Arizona church every weekend and members received news of Connelly's misdemeanor at worship on Jan. 4 and 5. ‘We are committed to helping Mark rebuild his marriage and we have offered all of the mercy and counseling resources of our church to help him and his family through this time,’ said Executive Pastor of Ministries Gary Sutliff, who has been named interim lead pastor. ‘In addition, we have offered the same resources to the women involved. Our priority right now is helping all those involved, including the people of our church, heal from this.’ Just last year Connelly had hosted a seminar on what makes a successful marriage at the Buckhead Church in Atlanta. 'Their past struggles and present challenges put Mark in a unique position to encourage us all,' stated the event's invite.

On Sunday Pastor Randy Thomas addressed the congregation about the news and said that at first he felt angry and betrayed by Connelly. ‘We may be knocked down but we are not knocked out,’ Thomas said. ‘If ever there was a time for us to lean on each other, this is it.’ The church held a special prayer service at 7 p.m. on Jan. 7, inviting ‘all followers of Jesus to join with us in praying for wisdom and healing’, reports AZcentral.com. Reaction from church-goers on social media was been mixed, with many expressing their sympathy for Connelly’s family, while others have questioned if the church is right to judge Connelly. 'I ask people how that is showing mercy. We all have one god and one judge. I do not condone marks actions but he did not have relations with people that where not consenting adults. We are all sinners. I think the church has handled this totally wrong,' wrote Lane Anderson. 'My wife and I will be staying,' wrote John Berger.

"A bid by a triple killer to win release from prison under a human rights ruling was last night greeted with outrage by his victims. Arthur Hutchinson was sentenced to a whole-life tariff after stabbing a bride’s parents and brother to death on her wedding night and raping a teenage guest. But the 73-year-old has become the first Briton to launch a bid for freedom after European Court of Human Rights judges last month decided that ‘life-means-life’ sentences are unlawful. Challenge: Triple killer and rapist Arthur Hutchinson, now 73, is demanding the right to seek parole . Yesterday the decision was attacked by . the family of Basil and Avril Laitner and their son Richard, who were . murdered by Hutchinson in 1983. They . said in a statement: ‘Whenever even the name Arthur Hutchinson rears . its ugly head, it does nothing but create fear and distress to the . victims of this heinous crime. 'Let the human rights judiciary members be . thrust into our position for just a day and maybe they would understand . this. ‘We are confident . that justice will be done and more importantly, be seen to be done, so . that this matter can finally be put to rest.’ The . Government has been asked to provide an official response to . Hutchinson’s claim, which could lead to a full hearing next year. The killers who launched the challenge were Jeremy Bamber (left), Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore. At the time of the ruling, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling (right) said the original authors of the Human Rights Convention 'would be turning in their graves' Dominic . Raab MP, who is campaigning for reform of human rights legislation, . said: ‘You couldn’t get a better example of a case where life should . mean life. ‘UK democratic . accountability over our criminal justice system is yet again being . threatened by the insatiable appetite of the Strasbourg court.’ The . human rights ruling came after a challenge by three killers including . Jeremy Bamber, who shot dead five members of his family in 1985. The judges said whole-life terms were ‘inhuman and degrading’ and demanded that cases should be reviewed after 25 years. The . judgment cleared the way for early release bids by Britain’s 49 . whole-life prisoners – including notorious felons such as Rose West and . Dennis Nilsen. Ruling: European judges at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg (pictured) ruled that whole-life tariffs were 'inhuman and degrading' and proposed that cases should . be reviewed after 25 years . However, it . is thought ministers will do nothing to apply the ruling in Britain. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said yesterday: ‘I continue to strongly . believe that whole-life tariffs are appropriate for the worst murder . cases.’ Hutchinson killed . solicitor Mr Laitner, 59, and his 55-year-old wife after breaking into . their home in Dore, Sheffield, hours after the family had celebrated the . wedding of their daughter Suzanne. He killed their son Richard before . tying up and raping an 18-year-old woman.

"She might have just become a mother for the fifth time but it seems Katie Price, 36, has no intention of putting her feet up. Between writing a new book, signing up with a hair colour brand and slamming Kim Kardashian's naked magazine cover, the former glamour model has found time to create a new fragrance named 'Kissable Fierce'. 'It's my first evening fragrance that I've released and I love it,' she said in an exclusive interview with MailOnline. Scroll down for video . New look: Katie Price is unveiling her latest fragrance, Kissable Fierce, and says it's reflective of her personality and smells 'gorgeous' 'It's an extension of my Kissable line  - the bottle is so cool and I love the fact it's pink and black - two of my favourite colours.' Price, 36, who gave birth to her fifth child in August, also said that not only are the orange and peach notes  'gorgeous', she's been getting plenty of compliments while wearing it. But it is the name of the fragrance, Kissable Fierce, that most reflects Ms Price, who said it was inspired by her personality. 'I think the name Kissable Fierce is quite reflective of my personality,' she explained. 'I'm the most loyal person and fun-loving and kind but if people take advantage of those good qualities I can have a fierce side that comes out too.' One for the Christmas stocking? Katie's new fragrance is just the latest in a roster of celebrity scents but she maintains that hers is different and she apparently gets plenty of compliments when she wears it . Moving on: Katie, pictured at the launch of her last fragrance, says her latest creation is her best yet and she wanted to create something that her fans would love . And despite being one of a veritable deluge of celebrity fragrances, Price says hers is different - and it's all down to her experience of the showbiz world. 'I've been doing this for a long time,' she explained. 'My perfumes have been best sellers and I'm involved in every aspect of the production as well. 'I started creating Kissable Fierce a year ago and wanted to bring out an affordable, long lasting evening perfume that my fans would like.' The perfume is, she says, an extension of her changing lifestyle and reflects the more mature, more sophisticated woman she is today. Indeed, the 36-year-old claims that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline. 'The older you get, the less interested in make-up you are. A smokey eye is ageing and with five kids, the last thing on my mind is make-up,' says Price. 'In fact, I don't wear any. Vaseline is the only thing in my make-up bag to keep my lips moisturised.' So what does 'beauty' mean to the star? 'My children and relaxing at home with them and having quality time.' Au natural: The 36-year-old maintains that she's so disinterested in beautifying herself these days - apart from for public appearances - that the only thing in her make-up bag is a tub of Vaseline . Family is clearly important to Price, who has managed to overcome husband Kieran's infidelity and presented a united front at the recent Hunger Games premiere in London. She also used the glamorous night as a platform to show off her post-baby body, which, as photos reveal, is more toned than ever. 'I'm quite good at eating healthily but biscuits are my weakness,' she admits. 'The day starts off well with a freshly made juice but it goes downhill, usually in the evening. 'This is the problem with my fitness - I come up with all these ideas to work out and then I literally don't have time. 'I'm working on the release of Kissable Fierce, I'm Global Ambassador for CB4, I've also got to factor in writing my next autobiography, which I'm doing at the moment, and then TV work and my TV role for Channel 7 in Australia plus the kids, my husband and family and friends.' Still with us? Good, because she is also working on a photo call for the perfume, penning her next tome, celebrating Superdrug’s 50th Anniversary with the Medichem team, doing 'something that hasn't been done before' and heading over to Australia again - all in the next few months. 'I am looking forward to getting back to work,' added the model. 'The next year is looking good for me and I can’t wait. 'I’ve moved house, it’s a fresh start and I am eager to get back to doing what I do best - working.'

"Kidnappers in Nigerian who took an American missionary hostage on Monday morning are demanding a ransom of nearly $300,000, authorities have said. The Rev. Phyllis Sortor, 70, was abducted while she was at the Hope Academy, where she works as a financial administrator in Emiworo, Kogi State, officials from her Seattle church said on Tuesday. Friends of Sortor were later contacted by the thugs who are demanding 60 million naira, or nearly $300,000, for her safe return, Kogi Police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi told NBC News. Scroll down for video . Kidnappers in Nigerian who took American missionary Rev. Phyllis Sortor on Monday morning are demanding a ransom of nearly $300,000, authorities have revealed . Dramatic: A group of masked gunmen stormed Hope Academy on Monday morning around 10am and fired sporadically to scare off bystanders while they took Sorter into their custody . He believes the kidnapping is the work of a local criminal gang, rather than terrorist group Boko Haram doesn't usually operate in the area. 'We will do all within the available resources to ensure the safe rescue of the victim,' the commissioner said, noting that officials are combing the forest for her. State Department officials declined to provide information about the kidnapping, reports . 'The U.S. Embassy has been notified, and the State Department and the FBI are working with local authorities to find and rescue her,' Bishop David Kendall said on the Seattle church's website. Tensions? Sorter has been working as a missionary in Africa for the past 10 years. Friends and family say she has infuriated local leaders by building Christian schools in the majority-Muslim country . A group of masked gunmen raided Hope Academy, the school that Sorter and her church built in the village of Emiworo around 10am on Monday morning. The kidnappers 'came into the school premises shooting sporadically to scare away people before taking (the hostage) away into the bush', a Kogi state police spokesman said. Sorter has been working as a missionary in Africa for the last decade, and friends say she has faced some resistance from local leaders for building Christian schools in the majority-Muslim northern portion of the country. 'She's had a lot of opposition,' friend Judy O'Brien, who attended Seattle Pacific University with Sorter, told KOMO. On Monday night, Sorter's friends and family gathered at her church at Seattle Pacific University to pray for her safe return. Coming together?

'We just want her to be safe and get out,' he said. 'We are just a working-class family, we don't have any money. That's not a huge church, they don't have money.' Nigeria is one of the world's worst country's for kidnapping, a major criminal enterprise that makes millions of dollars a year. Criminal gangs have kidnapped scores of expatriates in southern and central Nigeria over the years. The central Kogi state has also had low level activity by Islamist militants linked to insurgent group Boko Haram, security sources say - though that group operates mainly in northeastern Nigeria.","Reverend Phyllis Sortor was kidnapped in the central Nigerian village of Emiworo on Monday .

"These extraordinary pictures give a glimpse into a beautiful underground landscape, the eerie remains of a once-bustling mine in Wales. The Dinas silica mine, at the head of the Neath Valley in South Wales, was once a prominent source of silica – a heat-resistant material that was used to line industrial kilns and furnaces. But the mine was abandoned in in 1964, and is now surrounded by danger signs warning off all but the most experienced cavers. Annette Price, a professional photographer and keen caver, uncovered the amazing lakes and silica formations in an abandoned Welsh . The images show rusted mining equipment in the eerie caverns and tunnels . And now, decades later, photographer Annette Price, 49, has captured the caves' stunning natural beauty mingled with the rusting relics of the their industrial past. The mine, which was first opened in the 18th century, is now unstable in places, and mostly filled with water, adding a new dimension to the underground landscape. The . images show the beautiful variety of coloured stones and tranquil . clarity of underwater lakes left dormant miles under the surface. Mrs Price and her fellow climbers had to brave total darkness to reach the silica formations . The cave complex is now largely filled with water, which makes it dangerous to traverse, but also adds a new dimension to the beautiful rock formations. Annette, . 49, spent days crawling through the pitch black tunnels exploring and . documenting the mine, most of which is completely underwater. She said: 'We worked in total darkness, the only light available is from . our headlamps and sometimes we take hand torches too. 'When we first entered the cave, we sat on the ground and switched off all of our lights for a few minutes. 'This . gives our eyes time to adjust to the darkness. It's really relaxing to . experience true darkness, something we rarely do in our modern lit . world, and sit and listen to the sounds of the cave, which can be an . occasional drip of water falling from the roof, water trickling down the . wall, a waterfall or the sound of a raging underground river or just . our own breathing. Only expert cavers are permitted to enter the Neath Valley cave complex, which is surrounded by danger signs . Exploring the centuries-old caves can involve crossing treacherous gaps, while relying on a head-torch as the only available source of light . When we turn our lights on again they seem incredibly bright and we can see so much more of the cave than we could before. Silica mining was very popular in the late eighteenth century and in the mid 1960s. The . material is used to create 'fire bricks' which were used in the . construction of kilns and furnaces for the copper, steel and iron . industries. The abandoned mine is surrounded by signs warning off inexperience explorers . The caves, below the picturesque scenery of Brecon, South Wales, are now mostly underwater and extremely difficult to explore . Annette . added: 'I was struck by the beauty of the rock in the silica mine, the . bright varied colours within it and the enormous stone pillars that the . miners had created to hold the roof up. 'A . significant part of the mine is underwater, as a photographer I love . this, because of the clarity of the water and reflections. 'I . was also intrigued by the remains of the mining equipment, the railway . tracks that disappear down steep passages or go round a bend then . suddenly stop, the up-turned carts that would have been used to haul the . silica out of the mine. 'It's a tantalising glimpse into of a very different and industrial past that has long disappeared.' With . over a decade of caving experience, Annette has had to navigate . difficult and risky climbs as well as leaping over huge gaps in the dark . to reach her goal. The silica walls of the Dinas mine may be beautiful – but for centuries they also served a vital industrial purpose. Silica – a form of silicon dioxide – is very heat-resistant and was used to line industrial containers such as furnaces and converters, which were used to smelt the pure metals which were at the heart of Britain’s industrial revolution, which began in the 18th century. The silica formations in this mine were especially sought-after because of their great purity – which is close to 100 per cent. This purity, combined with the geological forces which shaped the caves over thousands of years, has led to the vivid and colourful formations which can be seen in the images above. As heavy industry waned in post-war Britain, the need to robust materials such as silica also dwindled, leading to mines such as this one being closed for good. Although silica can be converted to silicon – the material used to create the tiny circuits which power computers – the mines had closed before global demand for pure silicon took off, and it is now mostly manufactured in China.","Annette Price, 49, took the photographs on a caving expedition to the Dinas silica mine in South Wales .

"A woman who was battered for refusing a thug's sexual advances took justice into her own hands and forced him to stand by a roadside with a sign reading: 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag.' Alisha Hessler, 20, from Tampa, Florida, persuaded Gabriel Urena to undergo the humiliating ordeal - during which he also wore a dunce's hat - in return for her dropping charges against him. 'I think it will teach him a lesson,' she told Fox 13. 'I think he'll think twice about doing it again.' Scroll down for video . Punished with humiliation: Gabriel Urena sits at a busy Tampa, Florida intersection after beating up a girl when she refused his sexual advances . Bruised and battered: 20-year-old Alisha Hessler went out clubbing with Urena and friends last Saturday night. When he started groping her she hit him and he responded by beating her up so bad she got a concussion . Hessler had never met Gabriel Urena . before last Saturday night, when he was invited to join a group of her . friends for a night out clubbing. By the end of the night, Hessler and Urena sat next to each other in the back seat of a car and he started groping her. The obvious choice: Urena avoided legal ramifications by going alone with Hessler's punishment . Heslser told him to stop, but he didn't listen so she hit him in defense. 'I did hit him first and then all of a sudden that's when he started beating me repeatedly, punching me until I had a broken nose and concussion,' Hessler told WFTS. A picture taken after the beating shows blood running out of her nose, with red marks all over her face. The following morning, Hessler filed a report with the Tampa police who recorded her side of the story and took her to the hospital for treatment. 'We responded to her home. She did . have visible injuries. The officer initiated a report for battery, and . rescue personnel transported her to a local hospital,' Tampa Police . spokeswoman Janelle McGregor told NBC Miami. But Hessler's legal case against Urena stopped when she read a remorseful message written on his Facebook page. 'Lastnight (sic) was a wake-up call. I seriously need change,' Urena wrote. Hessler challenged that statement by . crafting up an alternate punishment for Urena. If he sat outside at a . busy intersection for eight hours holding up a sign that says 'I beat . women' she wouldn't press charges. Avoiding legal ramifications, Urena took her up on that offer. In addition to holding up a sign that read 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag' Urena also wore a dunce cap. Sorry: The morning after the incident, Hessler found this remorseful message written on Urena's Facebook page . Citizen justice: Urena sat at the Florida intersection for eight hours holding a sign which read 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. He also wore a dunce cap. Hessler was nice and seems to have let him pass the time playing on his cell phone . Hessler thinks this punishment was more appropriate to Urena's crime, and says she didn't want him to go to jail for a year. While Hessler thinks she got justice for the beating, women's advocates and local police don't agree. Mindy Murphy, an advocate for battered women said the punishment trivializes a serious issue. Tampa police say Hessler shouldn't have taken the law into her own hands. They have tried several times to get in contact with Hessler, but she has not returned any of the calls - per her agreement with Urena. Trivialized: Local police and an abused women's activist believe Hessler shouldn't have taken the law into her own hands .

"Reading a map on a smartphone can be distracting and cumbersome. But now two engineers have created a shoe that can guide the wearer by simply vibrating. The footwear’s investors claim they have created the world’s first 'haptic feedback shoe' and while they initially designed it to be used by the visually impaired, they think their technology could prove useful to anyone navigating their way around a new city. Scroll down for video . The Lechal shoe (pictured) is the brainchild of engineers Anirudh Sharma and Krispian Lawrence, who originally designed it to help the estimated 285million visually impaired people across the globe . Navigation: The shoes use haptic feedback (vibrations) to tell a wearer which way to turn to reach their destination. They can do this as they are linked to a smartphone via Bluetooth to ascertain the wear's location and destination. The shoes and insoles were orginally designed to help visually-impaired people. Connectivity: The shoes will work with iOs, Android and Windows smartphones. Charging: The shoes and insoles contain rechargeable vibrating units that work with a USB charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking. Fitness: Lechal shoes and insoles can also count steps and calories burned with the help of an accompanying app. Workouts can be created by individuals and goals set. Cost: The shoes and insoles are available to pre-order and cost $100. The Lechal shoe is the brainchild of Anirudh Sharma and Krispian Lawrence, engineering graduates from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and MIT, who now live in Bangalore, India and originally designed it to help the estimated 285 million visually impaired people across the globe. The shoes will be connected to a user’s smartphone via a Bluetooth connection to work out a person’s location as well as their destination. This information means the shoes will 'know' when to tell the wearer to turn left or right and they will vibrate accordingly – the left shoe to indicate a left turn, for example. While this could prove very useful for visually impaired people who can struggle to navigate cities, the duo have made their shoes available for pre-order to everyone as they think the footwear will make it easier for people to find their way around hands-free without having to read a map on their smartphone. The shoe's name comes means ‘Take me there’ in Hindi. Polyurethane insoles (pictured) have also been designed to fit inside any pair of shoes and feature the same technology as the shoes. The insoles buzz to indicate whether the wearer should turn left or right . The shoes and insoles contain an electronic module (pictured) that includes a vibrating unit, chip and battery that can be removed to be charged and come with a USB charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking . Polyurethane insoles have also been designed to fit inside any pair of shoes and feature the same technology as the shoes. They contain an electronic module that includes a vibrating unit, chip and battery that can be removed to be charged and come with a USB charger that can be switched on and off using voice controls and finger clicking. These features will also make it user friendly for visually impaired people and the fully-charged units can be used for three days of navigation. The shoes are designed for visually impaired people to be used alongside a cane (pictured) While they cannot look out for traffic like a guide dog, the shoes buzz to indicate whether a wearer should turn left or right and can lead them to their destination . The shoes (pictured) and insoles are available for pre-order for $100 and can also be used as a fitness device alongside an app, which is able to track calories and routes . People will also be able to use the Lechal shoes and insoles as a fitness system to count steps and calories burned, as well as create their own workouts. A wearer will be able to tap their foot to tag a location and set goals and the shoes can also buzz when a runner goes past a place of interest. While the shoes are designed to be used by everyone, they are principally made for the blind and profits made will be used to subsidise pairs of shoes for underprivileged visually impaired people. They are now available for pre-order on the company' website and both the insoles and the shoes will cost $100, according to Gizmag. The hi-tech footwear could make it easier for people to find their way around a new city hands-free without having to read a map on their smartphone (illustrated) A Sydney-based fashion and technology company has created the Navigate jacket that comes with a GPS unit built into the sleeves. As the wearer walks, drives or cycles, either the left or right sleeve vibrates to tell them which way to turn. If the turning is on the left, the left shoulder of the jacket vibrates, and vice versa if the turning is on the right. To create the jacket, electronic circuits and LEDs were sewn into the sleeves. The wearer programs their destination using a custom-made mapping app that connects wirelessly to the jacket. As the wearer moves, the LEDs in the jacket's sleeves light up to warn them they are approaching a turning. Each sleeve is fitted with five lights and the number of illuminated lights decrease the closer the wearer gets to this turning.","The Lechal shoe is the brainchild of two engineering students in Bangalore India and was originally designed to help visually impaired people .

"Massive ice floes rose out of a lake in Canada over the . weekend, destroying a dozen homes and damaging fifteen others. Within mere moments, strong winds drove piles of ice onto . the shore from Dauphin Lake on Friday, inundating homes and giving . residents only minutes to flee. 55-mile-per hour winds drove masses of ice from the thawing lake in a phenomenon that is commonly witnessed but rarely seen with such intensity and size. Scroll down for video . Dwarfed: Winds forced massive walls of ice onto the shores of Lake Dauphin, dwarfing homes in rural Manitoba, Canada on Friday . By Friday night, a state of emergency had been declared in . the town of Ochre River, a 188 miles northwest of Winnipeg. Authorities told the Winnipeg Free Press that seven of the . destroyed homes were ‘literally crushed by the ice that rose up within minutes . from Lake Dauphin.’ Twenty-seven homes were affected in total as the frozen wall to plowed through everything in its way . along Ochre Beach. Though the moving ice was as tall as a house in places, no . injuries have been reported. Nonetheless, residents were still shaken Saturday . Unusual: A dozen homes were destroyed and many others left uninhabitable after winds piled ice onto Ochre Beach Friday in an unusually large ice flow . Terrifying: Homeowners had only minutes to flee as the mounting ice entered their doors and windows . Even some of those whose houses remained standing were . allowed inside only to collect their belongings after authorities declared many . of the seemingly spared dwellings to be structurally unfit to inhabit. One family told the Free Press the ice easily topped and pushed . into their two-story home, shuffled moved furniture around, and ‘pushed the . bathroom tub and vanity into the hallway.’ ‘They heard it before they saw it coming up their decks,’ Ochre . River deputy Reeve Clayton Watts told the Free Press Saturday. ‘Then, it came . right in their front windows. It was just a matter of minutes. Fortunately, no . one was hurt. We were very lucky.’ Unlucky: The affected town Ochre River, 188 miles outside Winnipeg, had only recently begun to recover from severe floods in 2011 . Help: Hundreds of volunteers showed up Saturday to help dig Ochre Beach out of the massive ice floe . The town, still reeling from a severe 2011 flood that . destroyed many homes, was somber but not helpless.

"'H8GAYS.' It's the last thing you'd expect to see while walking through an airport and glancing down at your boarding pass. Indeed the one worse configuration you might see on a plane ticket would be 'LST-UR-LUGGAGE'. But according to Jeff White, a student at the University of West Florida, the confirmation code printed on a boarding pass issued to him by Delta Air Lines read as the anti-gay slur 'H8GAYS'. 'At first I didn’t think I read it right,' White told The Washington Post. 'I was worried that another customer might think I somehow picked that code. Eek: An alleged copy of Jeff White's 'boarding faux pas' as seen on Twitter, with the confirmation code 'H8GAYS' highlighted in yellow . Likeness: The NoH8 Campaign was set up by an American charity organization to support gay marriage and was endorsed by a litany of celebrities, such as Katy Perry and Miley Cyrus (pictured) 'If I were a gay male, I might have thought that a Delta worker purposely gave me that code, and that would have made me extremely uncomfortable.' The error occurred on a flight to Pensacola, Florida, earlier this month. While the pass appears to be a genuine mistake, the lettering raised eyebrows because of its likeness to that of the NO H8, an American charity set up to promote equality, specifically to endorse same-sex marriage. Delta Air Lines apologized for any 'concern or misunderstanding' the error occurred, but insisted that the confirmation codes 'are computer-generated and are completely random'. 'We will make every effort to ensure that a similar combination does not occur in the future,' added Russell Cason, a spokesman for the airline. Oops: Delta Air Lines apologized for the printing error and for any 'misunderstanding and concern' it caused . However the mistake has raised questions on why the combinations 'GAY' and 'H8' weren't previously blocked from Delta's system. White, an IT major, said that Delta has surely blocked other letter combinations and could have done so with these words/expressions. 'What surprises me is that they didn’t block [the confirmation code] as a possibility of the string of random numbers and letters in the software they use to generate the code', he said. 'I’m sure they removed many four-letter words that would be seen as offensive. 'I’m surprised that ‘gays’ and ‘H8’ weren’t blocked as well.' The situation is reminiscent of a incident in September, when Blake Loates, of Edmonton, Canada, opened a bottle of Vitamin Water and found 'You Retard' written on the inside of the lid. Coca-Cola apologized to the family of an Alberta woman who was shocked to unscrew a bottle of the companys Vitamin Water and find the words 'YOU RETARD' printed inside the cap. To make matters worse, Loates has a daughter with Autism and Cerebral Palsy. Vitamin Water's parent company, Coca Cola, apologized, saying that retard in French is 'slow down' and that was what the bottle was supposed to mean. In a separate incident earlier this year, Jetstar, the low-cost Australian airline, issued an apology to a passenger who pulled his suitcase from a baggage carousel at Perth Airport to find the message 'I am gay' written on it with stickers. The man, a father of two, wrote about the incident in a blog, and said that his suitcase had been the first to appear on the carousel. Budget Australian airline Jetstar launched an investigation into an incident which occurred at Perth Airport wherein a passenger retrieved his bag from the carousel only to find it had 'I AM GAY' written across it in stickers . He said he was 'utterly disgusted' and saw the eyes of fellow passengers 'look him up and down'. 'I was taken aback by the slogan but thought I had thick enough skin to ignore the leering,' he added.","University of West Florida student Jeff White claims to have received a boarding pass with the confirmation code 'H8GAYS' during a recent flight with Delta Air Lines .

"In what looks like a scene from post-apocalyptic film, a Swedish developer has transformed towns and cities around the world into urban jungles. Using Google images, Einar Oberg built his jungle version of Street View to lets users virtually travel anywhere in the world, and see what that location would look like covered in trees, vines, and bushes. Oberg has even redesigned Google’s iconic Pegman so he’s holding a fire torch and wearing an Indiana Jones-style fedora. Urban Jungle Street View was built by Stockholm-based developer Einar Oberg. It uses depth data taken from Google's existing maps to plot 3D plants and tress over the top. Users then cover a location, such as Trafalgar Square in London pictured, with plants, trees and bushes . Search for a location, famous landmark or city. Click on the Pegman and drop him on areas which light up in blue. Not all areas within a location will be accessible. Move the view around by clicking the mouse and moving it up, down, left and right. Move forward by clicking the stone-like arrow. To change location, click Back To Map in the top left-hand corner. And when users drop the Pegman onto a location, a speech bubble appears saying: ‘I hope there are no snakes.’ Only areas accessible on Google Street View can be accessed on Oberg’s Urban Jungle version, for example, users can’t get inside the grounds of Buckingham Palace or The White House. The site images render slowly, and work better on the Chrome browser, although the service is also available on Firefox. It has limited controls and users can only move around when clicking the stone-like arrow that appears on the screen. Oberg said his Urban Jungle experiment uses an 'undocumented part of Street View' called depth data. Once depth maps are combined with traditional maps, Oberg said he is able to plot the position of 3D flora and fauna. This urban image is of 7th Avenue in New York . The gardens of the Taj Mahal plotted with bushes on Urban Jungle Street View. The site images render slowly, and it works better on the Chrome browser than Firefox.

This grab, taken on 16th St NW in Washington, pictures the Washington Monument in the background. Only areas accessible on Google Street View can be accessed on Oberg's Urban Jungle version, for example, users can't get up close to Buckingham Palace or The White House . Oberg said: ‘Visit any place available in Street View by entering a location, drag the map to browse around and drop the little guy on a road. 'It works best in environment with large buildings surrounding the streets. Some locations need a little more imagination than others.’ He continued the experiment uses an ‘undocumented part of Street View’ called depth data.

There have been similar projects in the past, namely the 2011 Streetview Zombie Apocalypse game. It used Google Street View images as the base of the game and as players move around, they have to escape zombies placed over the top of the maps.

"Missouri L-G Peter Kinder has asked for an expense account due to his 'gradual impoverishment' Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder wants more money for doing his job. The Republican officeholder is asking legislators to put money in the budget for a daily expense allowance when he is working in Jefferson City. Kinder lives in Cape Girardeau and maintains a second home in Jefferson City. He receives an annual salary of about $86,000. But Kinder says he's experienced 'gradual impoverishment' during his decade in office. His salary is less than other statewide executive officials, but well more than the $36,000 that legislators receive. One of the lieutenant governor's duties is to preside over the Senate. Kinder, who is the number two to Missouri Governor Jay Nixon, wants to receive the same allowance that legislators get, which is $103 a day. He's seeking a per diem whenever he's in Jefferson City, not just when the Legislature meets. The median household income for Missouri in 2010 was $44,306, according to the US Census Bureau Small Area Estimates Branch. Kinder's Cape Giradeau home is worth an estimated $186,000. Kinder's salary is lower than what other statewide officials earn. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koser was paid $116,000 last year. Secretary of State Jason Kander made $106,000. Governor Jay Nixon earned $134,000. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from Mr Kinder's office on Thursday. Prior to entering public office, Kinder was an attorney and then later went into real estate, reportedly working for the Drury Hotel Group. In 2011, the St Louis Post-Dispatch reported that over five years, the public official had billed the state for around two months per year at hotels around St Louis. The bill was $35,000 for hotels, with the most nights spent at the Chase Park Plaza hotel in St Louis. St Louis is about a two-hour drive from Jefferson City and 90 minutes from his home in Cape Girardeau.

"For more than 20 years, KSTZ radio station in Des Moines, Iowa has been granting Christmas wishes for listeners, but this year they received a request unlike any other. Brenda Schmitz wrote into the station, asking them to fulfill three wishes, but there was a catch: Brenda isn't alive. The wife and mother to four died in August 2011, after losing a battle with ovarian cancer. Her youngest son, Max, was just two at the time. She wrote the letter one month before she passed away and entrusted it with a friend, giving specific instructions not to send it until her husband had found someone new. That happened this past summer when her husband David proposed to Jayne Abraham, a mother of two herself. Scroll down for video . Beyond the grave: Brenda Schmitz died two years ago, but before she did she organized an elaborate Christmas gift for her family - including her husband's new finacee . The true meaning of the holidays: Before Brenda (center) died, she wrote a letter to a local radio station, asking them to fulfill three Christmas wishes. Her husband David is pictured on the left . Moving on: Brenda gave the letter to a friend with the instructions not to send it to the station until her husband found a new woman. Above, David is pictured with Jayne Abraham. He proposed to the mother of two this past summer . In the letter, Brenda asks the station to fulfill her last wish to do something for the new woman in her husband's life, for her family and for the doctors and nurses who helped ease her pain. On Friday, Brenda's husband was brought into the station, but didn't know what was happening until host Colleen Kelly started reading his wife's last letter. 'When you are in receipt of this letter, I will have already lost my battle to ovarian cancer,' Brenda wrote. 'I told [my friend] once my loving husband David had moved on in his life and had met someone to share his life with again, to mail this letter to all of you at the station. Her first wish was directed at her husband's fiance Jayne, asking that she be treated to a spa day. 'She deserves it,' Brenda wrote. 'Being a step-mother to all those boys, and especially giving little Max a mother's love that only she can give. Make her smile and know her efforts are truly appreciated from me.'

The second wish was that her family be taken on a magical trip, somewhere they could all enjoy and make memories to last a lifetime. Her final wish was for the nurses and doctors who took care of her in the cancer unit at Mercy Medical Center. 'A night out full of drinks, food and fun for all they do every day for the cancer patients they encounter,' she wrote. Her husband David fought back tears while listening to the letter, and said he wasn't surprised that Brenda would have organized such an elaborate gift. 'It's not surprising, because the last year and a half she's shown so many signs that she's there,' he said, adding that he saw a double rainbow the morning after she died and that 'Somewhere over the Rainbow' was her favorite song. Touched: David fought back tears throughout the radio segment, saying he wasn't surprised his wife would have organized such an elaborate Christmas gift even after her death . 'There was no question that we were going to do something for this wish,' station manager Scott Allen told the Des Moines Register. 'It was what could we do that would be deserving of Brenda's name and memory.' With the help of sponsors, the station was able to grant all three of Brenda's wishes. The family of eight will be treated to a vacation at Walt Disney World in Florida where Jayne will relax with a spa day. As for the nurses and doctors at Mercy Medical Center, they'll get get three coordinated food drops provided by a local catering company.

"Baby wipes are leaving children with an itchy, scaly and red rash which is often misdiagnosed as a more serious skin condition, a study revealed today. An allergic reaction to moist wipes is believed to be behind the rash which is being mistaken for conditions such as eczema, impetigo and psoriasis. Dr Mary Wu Chang, a professor of dermatology and pediatrics at the University of Connecticut . School of Medicine, said that she has seen six children with the mysterious rash over the past two years. A study published today has found that a mysterious, itchy rash affecting children may be caused by a chemical in moist wipes . The study which Dr Chang co-authored was published on Monday in the medical journal Pediatrics. Her first patient was an 8-year-old girl who had a rash around her mouth and on her buttocks. Dr Chang treated the child with antibiotics and steroids but the rash came back time and time again. After investigating the child's medical history, the doctor realized she could be suffering from an allergic reaction. The doctor explained that she remembered a Belgian study which was done after a patient reacted badly to methylisothiazolinone - a chemical that is often found in baby wipes, hand creams and lotions. In recent years, some manufactures have also upped the concentration of the chemical in cosmetic products, often by up to 25 times. Overuse of moist wipes might also lead to greater intolerance of the chemical which is used on a plethora of household products. After an allergy test and laying off the wipes, the little girl's rash disappeared. Following the initial patient, Dr Chang saw five other similar cases in the next two years. The doctor told NBC that parents need not throw away packets of wipes but just limit their use. She told NBC: 'I have three kids, so I know how hard it . is to do the changes, especially when you’re traveling. But maybe when . you’re at home, it would be better to use a gentle cleanser and water. That way you minimize exposure.' Some children have suffered itchy, red rashes after an adverse reaction to  methylisothiazolinone - which is found in baby wipes along with other household products like hand cream and lotion (stock image) Dermatologist Dr Chang said that parents should be careful not to overuse moist wipes on children .","Connecticut dermatologist Dr Mary Wu Chang has seen 6 children with condition over the past 2 years .

"Fire spits high into the air as rivers of lava ooze from a Hawaiian volcano that has been erupting continuously since 1983. Taken under starlit skies, the stunning images of Kilauea, the most active of the five volcanoes that form the main island of Hawaii, could easily be mistaken for scenes from another planet. They are the work of daredevil photographer Sean King who regularly scrambles to within inches of molten lava at temperatures of up to 1,500C, dodging poisonous fumes and burning off the soles of his shoes along the way. Hot in Hawaii: A river of molten lava flows menacingly from the crater of  Kilauea , the most active of the five volcanoes that form Hawaii's main island . Lava lover Mr King, 47, who is colour blind, has dedicated his life to documenting hauntingly beautiful images of volcanoes on his island home of Pahoa, Hawaii. Mr King spends hours waiting for the ultimate eruption and has even had to dodge fountains of lava bubbling at over 1,500C. He has not only captured eruptions, but skies filled with glowing red clouds, otherworldly pictures of the milky Way, meteors, moon bows and lava waterfalls. Molten lake: A huge flood of lava streams down the side of the live volcano in one of photographer Sean King's brilliant images . Fire and smoke are belched into the starry sky from a crater on Hawaiian island of Pahoa, home to Kilauea, one of the most active volcanoes on earth . Alien land: Molten lava glows from cracks as the surface layer begins to harden into solid rock . Cooling off: Huge plumes of steam are created as lava from the Kilauea Volcano flows into the Pacific ocean . Sean said: 'I usually shoot wide angle . 15 to 25 second exposures of the flow during the night time, so I need . to get extremely close, usually about an inch away. 'Flows . can move at around five miles an hour and can really make you sweat or . melt your gear. You can hear the lava churning, popping, hissing from . the distance and the plume from the Halemaumau volcano is usually pretty . big, it's amazing to witness. 'It's . pure magic to watch new land being formed and watching how it reacts . with the ocean. It's definitely worth every pair of hiking boots that I . have melted the soles off to get there.' In Hawaiian folklore, all the five . volcanoes on the island are sacred with Kīlauea's Halemaumau Crater . serving as the body and home of Pele, the goddess of fire, lightning, . wind, and volcanoes.

Safety is paramount and coming home to his wife and mother is what spurs him on to be diligent during his adventures. He added: 'If I'm out taking photos I have to be super careful, poisonous . fumes and the unimaginable heat from the lava is extremely dangerous. Where the lava meets the ocean it spills down 45-foot-high cliffs sending boiling water bouncing back.

"'Is there anyone else you can call?' For a group of friends in New Jersey recently, apparently not, after all three received DUIs after systematically following each other to the police station. It started with 34-year-old Carmen Reatequi, of Whitehouse Station, who was pulled over by a patrolman for swerving on Route 22 East about 1.45am on Monday. After a standardized field sobriety test, Rautequi was arrested and taken to Readington police headquarters, according to NJ.com. Bad news come in threes: The arrest of one woman, 34, in New Jersey for driving while intoxicated lead to the arrest of the friend she called to pick her up, which then lead to the arrest of the third friend called to give both a ride . She was charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol, failure to stay in her lane and failure to provide a vehicle insurance card. Enter: Nina Petracca. Reatequi then called a friend Nina Petracca, 23, of Dunellen for a ride, however she showed signs of intoxication while officers were explaining the potential liability form. She was made to do sobriety tests in the lobby and failed. Petracca was arrested for DUI, and a search of her purse revealed seven Vicodin in an unlabeled container, leading to other charges for possession and driving while in possession of a controlled substance. Scene: Carmen Reategui, 34, of Whitehouse Station, was pulled over here, on Route 22 east at Route 523 in Readington, New Jersey, about 1.45am Monday . Enter: Ryan Hogan. Later both drivers called Ryan Hogan, 33, of Whitehouse Station. Police detected the smell of alcohol. Hogan then also underwent a field sobriety test and also failed. He was also charged with DUI. All three were released into the custody of an adult, this one thankfully sober. The trio will appear in court in January. Perhaps bad news really does come in threes?

"A U.S. veteran who has experienced combat all over the world and was once a special aide to military top brass has been reduced to living in his van as he can't find a job. But it's not for a lack of trying. Homeless Robert Freniere, 59, told his story to Philly.com, and explained how he has been rejected for dozens of jobs he has applied for from public libraries, despite having excellent references and three graduate degrees. When people ask why don't you get a job as a janitor, Freniere replies: 'Well, I've tried that.' He lives out of his blue minivan in King Of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Frustration: Despite having a wealth of military experience and three graduate degrees, Colonel Robert Freniere is currently living in his van with all of his possessions in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania . Pride: Robert Freniere displays his Air Force Colonel's uniform in his van (and his home) Freniere, who served in the military for 30 years and reached the rank of colonel, said he hasn't had regular employment since 2012 when he worked as defense contractor.

"These stunning images capture a graceful show by a rare white whale. Photographer Jenny Dean managed to shoot the action last month as the humpback dived out of the water in Etty Bay near Innisfail, far north Queensland. The mother-of-three, who is a clinical nurse and midwife, was on a whale-watching trip with her husband when they spotted the amazing mammal in the water. Stunning: Photographer Jenny Dean was on a whale-watching trip with her husband when she captured these amazing images of the rare white humpback in Etty Bay near Innisfail, far north Queensland, Australia .

Migaloo is believed to migrate up the east coast of Australia from Antarctica to the warmer waters of Tropical North Queensland. Jenny explained: 'On Saturday, August 17, my hubby suggested we take a trip in our boat to see if we could spot some whales which had been around the previous day when he had been fishing. 'I have had many whale watching trips on a promise that ''there were heaps around yesterday'' and they have all resulted in no sightings at all. The amazing mammal gave the couple a spectacular show with lots of 'breaching and blowing' Glad: Photographer Jenny Dean revealed she had been reluctant to go out that day as she was sceptical of spotting a whale . Photographer Jenny Dean, who captured the dramatic pictures, said it had been an amazing experience . 'I was a bit reluctant to go out on that day, lots to do and sceptical about success, but just out of Mourilyan Harbour, near the North Barnard Islands, we could see on the horizon a long distance away, a humpback breaching and blowing over and over again - having a whale of a time. 'It was heading south quite quickly and too far away to pursue so we continued on our way. 'After about 10 minutes we noticed that the whale had changed direction and seemed to be coming closer still with lots of activity then at about 200 meters distance it gave us a real show with lots of breaching and blowing once again. 'We cut the boat motor and sat and watched the show and couldn't believe it when it seemed to be the extra special Migaloo, the infamous all white whale. 'When he disappeared we thought it was all over but out of the depths he came straight up and looked at us from about 50 metres away. That was absolutely incredible, just checking us out. 'After that he continued to frolic around the 50 metre mark again appearing to show off, then dived down and headed back towards the boat. 'There were a few anxious moments where we wondered where he would surface, and while holding our breaths we heard a big blow and he was about 50 metres on the other side of the boat. 'After that he continued on his merry way having checked us out and shown off enough! 'It was an amazing experience, incredible to see that huge creature propel out of the water with such ease and agility. Even better to catch some pictures and they even worked out OK which considering the boat was rocking and Migaloo was very fast and unpredictable is double lucky.' What lies beneath: Jenny said the humpback continued to frolic around the boat and even appared to be showing off .","Photographer Jenny Dean took the images in far north Queensland .

"Around 1.5 million people living in Ebola-ravaged Sierra Leone are today in lockdown as experts reveal the official death toll has reached almost 3,000. Six months into the most deadly outbreak in history, the latest figures indicate the disease may be slowing pace in Guinea - the site of the original outbreak in February. But experts have warned a dire lack of beds and community resistance in some areas are helping the virus spread. Meanwhile efforts to straighten out muddled data are gradually revealing an epidemic even more deadly than first thought. A third of Ebola-ravaged Sierra Leone is in lockdown as health workers attempt to stop the spread of the disease. A health worker sprays disinfectant on a colleague after he helped load the body of a man suspected of suffering the virus, into an ambulance in Freetown, the nation's capital . It comes as the World Health Organisation revealed the global death toll is close to 3,000 in the worst epidemic on record since Ebola was first discovered in 1976 . The streets of Freetown, Sierra Leone were deserted during a three-day lockdown earlier this month . The World Health Organisation (WHO) said of the 6,263 cases of Ebola recorded in five West African countries, 2,917 people had died as of September 21. Compared to the agency's previous update, the latest data shows 99 more deaths in Liberia since September 17. However there have but only four new cases in Sierra Leone since September 19 and three in Guinea since September 20. The proportion of cases in the last 21 days - the incubation period of the virus - has also fallen in the three nations, suggesting the spread of the disease may be slowing. The WHO said: 'The upward epidemic trend continues in Sierra Leone and most probably also in Liberia. 'However, the situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilised. 'Between 75 and 100 new confirmed cases have been reported in each of the past five weeks.' The WHO said Liberia had 315 bed spaces for Ebola patients and aid agencies had promised to set up 440 more, but the country needed a further 1,550 beds that nobody had yet offered to provide. In Sierra Leone, 297 planned new beds would almost double existing capacity, but a further 532 were needed. With too few beds and a huge shortage of expertise, the effort to tackle Ebola has switched to setting up care centres in communities and training locals, including 11,000 teachers in Liberia, to educate people about how to combat the disease. In Sierra Leone travel has been restricted into and within three more 'hotspots' in the West African nation, where 1.5 million people live. A medical worker feeds a child suffering Ebola at a facility in one of the worst hit areas of Sierra Leone . The proportion of cases in the last 21 days - the incubation period of the virus - has also fallen in the three nations, suggesting the spread of the disease may be slowing, WHO said . A quarantine officer is pictured decontaminating a ship at Pepel port in Sierra Leone . It means more than a third of the population is now in quarantine. Sierra Leone is one of the hardest-hit countries in an Ebola outbreak which has swept through West Africa in the last six months. More than 2,900 people have been killed by the virus, the World Health Organisation today said. The health agency said the situation in Sierra Leone continues to deteriorate, driven by a sharp increase of cases in the capital, Freetown. In an address to the nation on Wednesday night, President Ernest Bai Koroma put Port Loko, Bombali, and Moyamba districts under isolation, meaning only people delivering essential services can enter and circulate within these areas. WHO also noted that these districts were seeing a rise in cases. In other areas, including Freetown, homes will be put under quarantine when cases are identified, a government statement after the address revealed. The current epidemic, the largest on record since Ebola was discovered in 1976, has also hit Liberia,and Guinea. It is thought to have infected more than 6,000 people. One victim is thought to have slipped across the border from Guinea to Senegal, though the disease does not appear to have spread there. Similarly in Nigeria, the virus appears to have been stopped in its tracks, with the outbreak seemingly contained. With too few beds and a huge shortage of expertise, the effort to tackle Ebola has switched to setting up care centres in communities and training locals . The president of Nigeria has declared his nation 'Ebola-free' after eight people died and another 20 cases were recorded when a Liberian man crossed the border and died in July . Around 20 cases and eight deaths, have been linked to the death of Patrick Sawyer, a U.S. citizen and consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance who entered the nation from Liberia, after attending his sister's funeral. She too died after becoming infected with the disease. Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said on Wednesday: 'Nigeria is free of the virus now but we know that to be permanently free from it, we must remain vigilant and work with WHO and the international community to eradicate it completely from our sub-region and forestall the possibility of its re-emergence on our shores through migration.' The outbreak's unprecedented scale and geographic spread have pushed governments to impose severe measures, like the cordoning off of entire towns or regions. Last week, Sierra Leone imposed a three-day nationwide lockdown, confining its six million people to their homes while health teams spread out to look for the sick and educate people about the disease. The exercise revealed the outbreak is worse than thought, the government said, with 160 Ebola cases found during the shutdown. 'There is a desperate need to step up our response to this dreaded disease,' the Sierra Leone government statement said. 'The prognosis is that without additional interventions or changes in community behavior, the numbers will increase exponentially and the situation will rapidly deteriorate.' Two districts near the outbreak's epicenter - Kenema and Kailahun - had already been isolated. Liberia, the country hardest-hit by the disease, cordoned off areas of its capital at one point to slow transmission. In Sierra Leone, 75 percent of targeted households have been reached by 'social mobilisers'. The WHO said: 'The upward epidemic trend continues in Sierra Leone and most probably also in Liberia. However, the situation in Guinea, although still of grave concern, appears to have stabilised' But in some areas of Guinea, where an Ebola team was killed last week, there was still resistance to such efforts, the WHO said. 'For example, there are reports from Fassankoni, Guinea, that communities have set up roadblocks to screen entering response teams,' it said. The risk of infection among health workers is also much higher than previously thought. A recount has shown 81 have died in Sierra Leone out of 113 who caught the disease - a 72 per cent death rate, instead of a 40 per cent rate previously reported. The WHO said its latest data did not yet include the cases and deaths found during a three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone.","1.5 million people in three Ebola 'hotspots' in Sierra Leone are in quarantine .

Jill Preston, Snarf's director of marketing, told the Huffington Post on Monday: 'We really regret our employees were given last-minute notice, but they were aware of the loss of business during the past year.'

"Lawmakers are fuming over President Barack Obama's admission on Thursday that his White House lacks a strategy for dealing with the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in Syria, with one congressman comparing his performance to the bumbling sheriff's deputy Barney Fife from 'The Andy Griffith Show.' And as House and Senate members piled on with sharp criticism, a former senior aide to a retired defense secretary told MailOnline that the Joint Chiefs of Staff are 'seeing red' and 'spitting nails' following Obama's candid admission. 'They're losing confidence in their mission,' said the long-time Pentagon insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'When the president doesn't know what direction to point people in, all his advisers can do is guess at what he wants. That's not good.' Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert told Fox News.on Thursday that Obama articulated 'a pitiful foreign policy, and Barney Fife is in charge,' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . No strategy: Obama said Thursday that he hasn't settled on a direction in Syria as ISIS solidifies its bases there despite losing ground to US airstrikes in Iraq . 'Barney Fife is in charge': A Texas congressman slammed Obama, likening him to Don Knotts' 1960s character Barney Fife (left), a scatter-brained sheriff's deputy on The Andy Griffith Show . 'I don't know where he's getting his information,' said Gohmert. 'Maybe it's CIA Director [John] Brennan who said earlier this year that ""No, these guys don't want a caliphate"".' 'He must have his head buried in a hole somewhere on the first green.' As Washington scratched its collective head, the president headed on the road Friday for a political fundraising trip. 'I don't want to put the cart before the horse,' Obama had said Thursday, referring to the thorny problem of whether to attack ISIS inside Syria's borders. 'We don't have a strategy yet.' 'We need to make sure we've got clear plans, and we're developing them,' the president said. 'At that point I will consult with Congress and make sure their voices are heard.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest scrambled to mop up after the ill-timed gaffe on Twitter, saying Obama 'was explicit – as he has been in the past – about the comprehensive strategy that we'll use to confront' ISIS. He repeated that word – 'comprehensive' – in a hastily arranged appearance on CNN. On Friday he told reporters that the Obama administration isn't going to walk back the president's choice of words, but was concerned about 'the way it was being reported' by news outlets. A reporter from CNN had challenged him, saying that 'the fact that you came out so quickly and tried to explain what the president had to say suggests that what he said was not what he intended to say.' Earnest said the Pentagon is 'developing' a strategy to 'confront some of the challenges there.' Karl Rove, a deputy chief of staff in the George W. Bush White House, said Thursday night on Fox News that he was 'appalled' by the president's 'we don't have a strategy' moment. 'He was warned about the role that ISIS was playing inside Syria, and he has had all that time to develop a strategy about what to do about ISIS in Syria – and he still doesn't,' Rove said. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said on CNN that Obama's appearance Thursday 'was an odd press conference at the very best, but to have a press conference to say we don't have a strategy was really shocking given the severity of the threat.' Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republicans' vice presidential nominee in 2012, said Thursday night, in California said the U.S. needs a 'strategy to finish [ISIS] off.' 'Not to contain them ... but to fundamentally finish them off,' Ryam said. 'And I don't think the president sees this moment for what it is.' Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama 'to exercise some leadership' and determine a plan for eradicating ISIS that Congress can support. The president mentioned four times on Thursday his intention to seek advice from Congress before deploying more military assets in the Middle East, likely in response to concerns from members of the House and Senate that he was unconstitutionally freezing them out. But 'there's no point in me asking for action on the part of Congress,' Obama told the press corps, 'before I know exactly what it is that is going to be required for us to get the job done.' Taking over: This undated image posted on a militant website shows fighters from ISIS marching in Raqqa, Syria . Clad in a muted tan suit that drew as many comments on Twitter as the content of his remarks, he emphasized that he is mainly focused now on pushing back ISIS in Iraq, where American military jets and drones have executed more than 100 airstrikes this month. But he boasted that America could put down the ISIS threat in Syria – at least in the short-term – at a time of his choosing. 'As I've said before – I think I said it in the previous press conference,' he said, 'our military is the best in the world.' 'We can rout ISIL on the ground and keep a lid on things temporarily, he insisted, referring to ISIS by the White House's preferred name. 'But then as soon as we leave, the same problems come back again.' 'My priority at this point is to make sure that the gains that ISIL made in Iraq are rolled back and that Iraq has the opportunity to govern itself effectively and secure itself,' the president said. The vicious terrorist group has its most comfortable stronghold in Syria, leaving open the possibility that defeating them in Iraq could leave them more entrenched one nation to the west – in a country that shares a hotly contested border with Israel, a key U.S. ally. The administration has green-lighted surveillance flyovers across portions of eastern Syria in recent days to assess ISIS's numbers and evaluate potential military targets. Horror: Video emerged Thursday showing ISIS militants marching 250 Syrian soldiers, lad only in their underwear, to a mass execution near the key northern Tabqa air base . Gathering strength: ISIS captured this munitions warehouse in Raqqa, Syria on Sunday . White House aides have leaked to a variety of news outlets the idea that Obama is considering striking ISIS in Syria despite objections from the country's dictator, Bashar al-Assad. Syria is in general disarray as rebels from a range of moderate and militant Islamist groups have fought a civil war for more than three years with the aim of taking over the country. ISIS is among the groups that oppose Assad. Crushing them could strengthen the barbaric regime in Damascus, and vice versa. Dealing with that conundrum 'is going to be a long-term project,' Obama said. 'It's going to require us to stabilize Syria in some fashion' but identifying moderate Sunni Muslims who can govern the country. Expanding his Iraq campaign to a second country, though, could highlight his administration's failure to intervene a year ago after Obama warned Assad about the consequences of crossing a 'red line' by deploying chemical weapons against the rebels. He said Thursday that he has directed Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff 'to prepare a range of options' for him.","Texas congressman compares Obama to bumbling deputy Barney Fife from 'The Andy Griffith Show'

"It is the stuff of dreams: one of the world’s most beautiful beaches complete with swaying palm trees, crystal blue waters and an endless procession of bikini-clad girls sashaying across the sand. This is the sight that will greet Wayne Rooney and his England colleagues as they step out on their balconies at the Royal Tulip Hotel after arriving in Brazil to prepare for the World Cup. But should they turn just a little to the left, they will face an altogether more disturbing vision: the stinking filth and squalor of the biggest shanty town in South America spilling down the hillside less than half a mile away. Hands up: An undercover female detective on patrol in the Rocinha favela as police tackle drug gangs . Patrol: Heavily armed police officers monitor the favela to prevent the gangs from taking control . The Rocinha favela is a place where crackling gunfire lights up the night sky, and where police death squads and drug gangs battle for control of the sewage-filled streets. There has been an orgy of extra-judicial killing by Brazil’s military police – the result of a government crackdown to ‘pacify’ the favelas before the world’s media arrive. Last week a popular local DJ was murdered by police just feet from Rio’s famed Copacabana Beach, leading to violent demonstrations. On Monday nine buses were set on fire in protest at police brutality. Seven police officers have died in clashes since the start of the year. Rocinha is a maze of haphazard steps carved into the hillside leading to a muddle of one-bedroom shanty homes made from breeze blocks where 200,000 deprived and desperate Rio citizens live. Stalls sell live chickens next to dead ones and fly-covered fruit and veg. There is a ceaseless cacophony of motorcycle horns, loud music and yelling voices. Inside every shack, no matter how tiny, families crowd around television screens. Eighteen-year-old Amarildo de Souza Jr is among them. His father was snatched by police who mistook him for a drug dealer, then killed him. Violence: Human rights activists have complained that the police have gone overboard to pacify the favelas . The death last year of Amarildo Sr, a 42-year-old bricklayer, is now a cause celebre.Some 25 officers including the head of the favela’s police force are standing trial. Officers are said to have tasered, strangled and then drowned their victim during a  40-minute torture session before dumping the body in a nearby forest. His son tells me: ‘Dad would have been just another statistic, except the favela rose up.’ The protest spawned riots across Brazil and led to three deaths when police fired on rioters.Amarildo Jr continues: ‘The case got so much publicity they had to charge the cops. I hope they go to jail but Brazil is a corrupt country. The police have a licence to kill. The World Cup will come and go but the violence will remain.’ Clandestine police ‘body dumps’ have sprung up. One notorious dumping ground – Grumari Forest – has been given the gruesome nickname ‘the microwave’ because of reports of nightly fires and the smell of burning flesh. One witness who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ‘The police cars enter without lights. We hear gunfire. One time we found four bodies riddled with bullets. We found a hand sticking up from the ground.’ When Brazil was awarded the tournament in 2007 the government introduced a programme to ‘pacify’ hundreds of favelas. Officials refuse to reveal the numbers who have died since the ‘clean-up’ operation started, but in Rocinha alone ten men have been killed since January. Now the authorities are promising to ‘secure’ the slums using an elite military police squad called BOPE, a shadowy organisation of highly-trained special forces whose logo is a dagger piercing a skull. Tackle: The Brazilian government began 'cleaning up' favelas in 2007, as soon as they were awarded World Cup . Last week Maria de Fatima da Silva, 56, buried her only son Douglas Rafael, 26, a popular DJ and dancer after he was killed by police in the Pavao-Pavaozinho favela which overlooks Copacabana Beach. Police are thought to have mistaken him for a drug dealer. Maria says: ‘The police told me he had fallen and died but when I saw his body in the morgue I found a bullet hole in his back. The only reason I got his body back was that people filmed the cops on cellphones. Otherwise he would have “disappeared” along with all the others.’ She adds: ‘There will be blood on the streets during the World Cup, be sure of it.’ The number of registered ‘disappearances’ in Rio has surged from 3,997 in 2009 to 6,004 last year. Amnesty International spokesman Alexandre Ciconello said: ‘The government is trying to paint a pretty picture for the world saying things have been cleaned up and that Brazil is safe for tourists. But the reality is far darker.’","Heavily armed police have been patrolling the favelas in advance of tournament .

"These extraordinary images may appear to show colourful boiled sweets or even glass beads - but in fact, they show specially bred ears of corn. Glass Gem corn was developed by a Native American farmer who noticed that every so often, a cob showed signs of unusual colouring shining through. Now the unique strain is available for purchase online, and is in hot demand from gardeners keen to add a touch of colour to their vegetable patch. Scroll down for video . Colourful: This extraordinary Glass Gem corn was bred naturally by a part-Cherokee farmer . Unique: The corn was developed from ears with natural splashes of colour which were then bred together . Gleaming: The kernels are so brightly coloured that they look like precious stones or glass beads . Bright: The colours which make up the corn include blazing red and black as well as the usual golden . The crop originates from Oklahoma, where part-Cherokee farmer Carl Barnes had the idea of gathering colourful ears of corn and breeding them together. As the years went on, he managed to produce corn displaying dozens of different colours on a single cob. Shortly before he died, Mr Barnes passed on his seed collection and breeding know-how to his friend Greg Schoen and asked him to safeguard the Glass Gem tradition. In 2010, Mr Schoen decided he had to find a permanent home for the collection, and gave the seeds to Bill McDorman, owner of a small seed comany in Arizona. Blue: One strain produces corn with deep blue kernels as well as some which are almost white . Contrast: The different varieties of Glass Gem can appear starkly divergent from one another . Popular: Native Seeds/SEARCH, which sells the corn, frequently sells out thanks to the high demand . On the branch: Despite its rainbow colours, Glass Gem is grown in the same way as other types of corn . 'I was blown away,' Mr McDorman said of the first time he grew Glass Gem corn. 'No one had ever seen corn like this before.' The seedsman is now head of Native Seeds/SEARCH, a non-profit organisation which seeks to preserve the agricultural heritage of the Native Americans. The organisation sells Glass Gem seeds through its website for $7.95 (£4.90) per packet, although they are so highly sought-after that they are frequently sold out. The corn can be used to make flour or popcorn, although it is not recommended to eat it straight off the cob. Attractive: From some angles, the corn looks just like a colourful children's toy . Appetising: Glass Gem should not be eaten off the cob, but can be turned into flour or popcorn . Tradition: Buyers are encouraged to keep the seeds in order to stop the corn strain dying out . Ruby-red: This is one of the most striking-looking plants produced by the seeds . Most customers apparently use Glass Gem as an innovative gift which can be displayed as an ornament around the house. Additionally, Native Seeds encourages buyers to save their favourite strands of the corn to replant in order to continue the Glass Gem tradition. Mr McDorman said: 'As Carl Barnes has taught us, all it takes is one person to create a more colourful, diverse and abundant world - one seed at a time.' Green shoots: This slender plant will eventually grow up to produce ears of multi-coloured corn . All wrapped up: The corn is surrounded by green leaves before breaking out of its shell . Pioneer: Carl Barnes spent years developing Glass Gem corn and passed the secret on before he died .","Glass Gem corn developed by Carl Barnes was passed on after his death .

"President Obama has enlisted the help of Hollywood A-listers, TV stars and professional athletes to join an ambitious new campaign to fight sexual assault on campus.

All walks of life: NBA all-star Kevin Love (left) and musician Questlove (right) have been invited by President Obama and Vice President Biden to help put an end to violence against women . Allies: The Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik (left) and musician Randy Jackson (right) joined other celebrities in the campaign . McHale's in: Joel McHale from Community reminded viewers to 'not blame the victim' of sexual assault . Taking a stand: Hip hop artist Common says in the video that each one os us should take responsiblity to get a friend home safe . The campaign encourages everyone to consider making it their personal responsibility to stop sexual assault and to intervene when they suspect a woman can't or won't consent. The constellation of stars featured in the sleek PSA also includes actresses Rose Byrne and Mayim Bialik; comedian Joel McHale; musicians Randy Jackson and Questlove; TV and radio personality Ryan Seacrest, and hip hop artist Common. As part of the 30-second video, the celebrities look into the camera and recite the words: ‘it’s on us stop sexual assault, to get in the way before it happens, to get a friend home, say did not blame the victim; it’s on us to look out for each other, to not look the other way; it's on us to stand up, to step in, to take responsibility; it's on us, all of us, to stop sexual assault.’ At the end of the clip, President Obama appears on the screen and says: ‘learn how and take the pledge at itsOnUs.org.’ The campaign officially kicked off Friday afternoon at an event in the White House, which featured an appearance by sexual assault survivor Lilly Jay who introduced Vice President Joe Biden and shared her personal experience of being raped at Amherst University as a student. Leaders: President Obama and Vice President Biden say in the PSA that it is on all of us to stop sex abuse by making a commitment and taking a pledge . President Barack Obama, with Vice President Joe Biden, left, outlines the 'It's On Us' campaign to help colleges and universities to prevent and respond to sexual assault on campus, at the White House in Friday . ‘Recalling rape always hurts,’ she said, adding that having ‘allies’ on your side can make a world of difference. ‘They help carry the heavy truth that colleges can, and should, be safer.’ With an estimated 1 in 5 college women experiencing an attack, Obama decried ‘the quiet tolerance of sexual assault’ and called it ‘an affront to our basic humanity.’ Research has shown most victims know their attackers, alcohol or drugs are often involved and only 12 per cent of college women report the attack to police. The Obama administration has been raising awareness of the problem this year, ahead of a midterm election in which Democrats are counting on a strong turnout by female voters. In January, Obama launched the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault that recommended action campuses could take to protect victims. The U.S. Department of Education for the first time publicly exposed the list of colleges under federal investigation for their handling of sexual assault complaints. The latest effort has a particular focus on reaching men on campus. ‘You don't want to be the guy who stops a friend from taking a woman home,’ Obama said, while arguing it is men's responsibility to do so. Hope for change: Obama said society too often sends the message that women aren't valued . Story of survival: President Obama, left, steps off stage to hug Lilly Jay, right, a sexual assault survivor, during a 'It's On Us' campaign event in the East Room of the White House . Biden was even more blunt in his message to men. ‘Step up!’ he said. ""Be responsible. Intervene. You have an obligation to make a pariah of those on campus who abuse another person.’ Violence against women has taken on a new prominence recently amid controversy over the NFL's handling of domestic assault involving its players. Obama said society, including sports leagues, too often sends the message that women aren't valued. And with recent sexual assault scandals of their own, the nation's military academies are among the collegiate partners in the campaign, Obama said. The campaign is supported by partners who plan to help spread the message, including nearly 200 colleges and universities, the NCAA, several collegiate athletic conferences and media companies with reach among students. The NCAA plans to promote anti-assault messages on screens at their championship events. Video-game maker Electronic Arts will encourage fans to pledge to support the campaign through its online platforms. Calling her a hero, Vice President Joe Biden praises Lilly Jay who talked about the impact on her life after she was sexually assaulted as a freshman at Amherst College in Massachusetts . And media giant Viacom will promote the messages on websites, including for music channels MTV, VH1, BET and CMT. Visitors to the Itsonus.org website are asked to turn their social media profile pictures into the campaign logo badge. They are asked to use their name, email address and zip code to pledge ‘not to be a bystander to the problem but to be a part of the solution.’ The information is collected by Generation Progress, the youth arm of the liberal Center for American Progress advocacy organization with close ties to the White House. The Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women will also award over $6million to 18 colleges with grants to develop comprehensive campus sexual assault prevention and response programs.","Nearly a dozen stars took part in PSA released by President Obama's 'It's On Us' campaign against sexual assault .

"Four nuclear reactors are to be closed temporarily following a safety alert. The need to investigate a fault in a boiler system means that the reactors will be out of action for around eight weeks. Two reactors at Heysham, Lancashire, and two at Hartlepool, County Durham, will close tomorrow, according to French energy giant EDF. Two reactors at Heysham, Lancashire will close tomorrow so a fault in a boiler system can be investigated, according to French energy giant EDF . Together the four units serve three million homes, supplying 10 per cent of Britain’s nuclear power. The fault, detected in a metal support tube, was found at the Heysham 1 site in Morecambe Bay. The other three reactors will be closed as a precaution because they have the same design. The problems highlight concerns about Britain’s ageing power stations – no reactors have been built since 1995. The power stations at Heysham and Hartlepool were built in 1983 and are set to be decommissioned in 2019. They were originally due to come out of service this year. The Government is keen to kickstart a new generation of nuclear plants and last year ministers signed a deal with EDF and two Chinese firms to start building a plant in Hinkley Point in Somerset. The power stations at Heysham and Hartlepool (pictured) were built in 1983 and are set to be decommissioned in 2019 . But the project is on hold while the European Commission decides whether the contract meets competition rules. The £16billion project will be funded by levies on household power bills for 35 years. The firms will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity they supply. Officials in Brussels are investigating whether the deal is overly generous to the firms. Meanwhile, EDF has been seeking extensions to the life of its existing plants, most of which are scheduled to close by the end of 2023. Its other plants are at Sizewell B in Suffolk, Hinkley Point B, Dungeness in Kent, Torness in Dunbar, and Hunterston B in West Kilbride. EDF first found the fault at Heysham last year. The boiler was returned to service early this year on a reduced load, but in June a defect was found and Heysham 1 was shut down. EDF has been seeking extensions to the life of its existing plants, including Torness in Dunbar, most of which are scheduled to close by the end of 2023 . The firm said: ‘Until the results of the further inspections are known it is not possible to advise exact return to service dates for these four reactors, however an initial estimate is that these investigations will take around eight weeks. EDF Energy’s other nuclear power stations are not affected by this issue as they are of a different design.’ National Grid, which runs the UK power network, said there was plenty of surplus capacity during the summer months. A spokesman said: ‘We have many generation sources to call on and demand is low at this time of the year.’ But if the problems continue into the winter, it may well create a problem as demand increases. The Office for Nuclear Regulation said: ‘ONR is satisfied that EDF Energy is taking appropriate and conservative action in the interests of continued nuclear safety, and that they are seeking to obtain positive confirmation of the condition of the boilers. ‘There has been no release of radioactive material and no persons have been injured.’  The ONR said the cracking at the Heysham 1 site was in the ‘boiler spine’, the metal tube which supports the weight of boiler tubes coiled around it. It added: ‘Its failure could lead to water entering the reactor vessel. ‘The shutdowns will allow the company to undertake accelerated inspections of all of the boilers in each of the reactors which are a similar design, and to fit equipment that will enable monitoring of the condition of the boiler spines.’ Centrica, the owner of British Gas, which has a 20 per cent stake in EDF Energy’s nuclear operations, said the reduction in output would reduce the company’s 2014 earnings. Nuclear power contributes one-sixth of the country’s electricity.","Reactors at Heysham, Lancashire, and Hartlepool, County Durham will close .

"A ‘Twitter troll’ was today found guilty of bombarding a Labour MP with abusive messages after she supported a successful campaign to put Jane Austen on the £10 note. Peter Nunn, 33, admitted retweeting messages threatening to sexually assault Stella Creasy and branding her a ‘witch’ last summer but claimed in court that they were a joke. The father launched his ‘campaign of hatred’ after the MP backed a high-profile bid by feminist Caroline Criado-Perez to keep a woman other than the Queen on a British banknote. Scroll down for video . Tweets: Peter Nunn (left), 33, admitted retweeting messages threatening to sexually assault MP Stella Creasy (right) and branding her a 'witch' last summer after she backed a campaign to put Jane Austen on a banknote . Part-time delivery driver Nunn, of Bristol, told the City of London Magistrates' Court that he was ‘satirising’ the Twitter backlash to the campaign and had no idea he was causing offence. Among the messages he posted was one which read: ‘Best way to rape a witch, try and drown her first then just when she's gagging for air that's when you enter.’ Asked about why he posted it, the self-styled blogger said: ‘Purely in a joke. In the old days they tried to drown a witch - if she drowned she wasn't. It is just a joke. ‘It came into my mind at the time and I thought it was really, really funny. I couldn't imagine in my wildest dreams that anyone would think “He is going to come and drown me like a witch”. ‘The whole witch thing is obviously satirical, it is not cynical like the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) are claiming. I don't see that message as being menacing or offensive. ‘It is just humour, nothing more than that.’  He added: ‘You can call someone a bitch and that is offensive, but calling someone a witch is a bit less offensive.’ He said he thought he was writing a ‘good natured joke’ which was ‘in no way threatening’. He added: ‘I never really did make rape threats. ‘I did make some around this time because that is what the debate was about. But now I don't bother because I don't want to get arrested and I never wanted to offend anyone. ‘I wouldn't dream that Caroline or Stella would be offended by these messages. They are satire.’ Nunn, who lives with his partner and three-year-old daughter, admitted using a number of different Twitter accounts to retweet and post messages about the two women. Jane Austen plan: Labour MP Stella Creasy (centre right) backed a high-profile bid by feminist Caroline Criado-Perez (far right) to keep a woman other than the Queen on a British bank note . He also admitted retweeting another message from the @eatcreasynow account threatening to rape Miss Creasy. But Nunn told the court he did not mean it to read like a threat - and was trying to show his support for the Walthamstow MP by retweeting the message because she had also retweeted it. He said: ‘I just saw it as an incredible threat - not a legitimate threat. I was just passing it on to my Twitter followers to show them what was happening. ‘I would never incite someone to make threats to people or do something bad to someone. It's not in my nature. I was trying to support her, not say anything against her.’ 'Best way to rape a witch, try and drown her first then just when she's gagging for air that's when you enter' One message posted by Peter Nunn . And he admitted posting a message to Miss Perez telling her to treat threats to rape her as ‘a compliment’. He added: ‘I realise now that rape threats aren't a compliment. I said you could take it as a compliment, you are beautiful.’ Nunn posted the messages last summer - at the height of publicity around the Austen campaign. Miss Creasy and Miss Perez both spoke publicly about the abuse they received online at the time. And Nunn said he thought the ‘best way to approach the discussion was to scrutinise it by coming up with the idea of witches’. He added: ‘I'm the first to condemn anyone. I don't agree with people sending rape threats - it is not something I would do myself. But at the same time I didn't think it was criminal.’ He accused Twitter users who spoke out against his messages of being radical feminists who ‘hate people’ and created ‘a nasty atmosphere’ online. And he accused Twitter bosses of undermining his free speech by shutting down his accounts. Trial: Part-time delivery driver Nunn told the City of London Magistrates' Court (pictured) that he was 'satirising' the Twitter backlash to the campaign and had no idea he was causing offence . He said: ‘If I can make it clear that I didn't hate anyone because of this, I just found it a bit weird maybe a bit disturbing that my Twitter accounts kept getting banned. It felt like my free speech was being taken away and I didn't know why.’ He added: ‘I felt like I was being harassed myself at the time, which is ironic.’ Under cross-examination Nunn declared he is a ‘feminist’ and said he supported equal rights. He made the comments as Alison Morgan, prosecuting, challenged him over why he branded Ms Perez a lesbian in a tweet and asked: ‘Are all feminists lesbians in your mind?’ Nunn replied: ‘No, not at all. A lot of them are men as well. I'm a feminist myself. I believe men and women are equal.’  He added: ‘I'm all for feminism - I think it's a good idea.’ 'I realise now that rape threats aren't a compliment. I said you could take it as a compliment, you are beautiful' Peter Nunn . The father admitted posting foul-mouthed blog posts ranting about ‘f****** women’ and tweeting that he would only rape Miss Perez if he was ‘drunk’ and using the hashtag of date rape drug Rohypnol. The prosecutor said to Nunn: ‘It was a game for you - about how far you could take it. Freedom of speech, that's what you wanted to do here.’ She accused him of trying to get a laugh from ‘sad people’ on Twitter, adding: ‘You knew it was going to cause huge offence to these people. You hated this woman and you wanted to offend them.’ But Nunn insisted he did nothing wrong - and accused Miss Creasy and Miss Perez of stoking abuse on Twitter. He said: ‘I felt their actions were encouraging abuse on Twitter ... I didn't feel that they were personally getting bullied or menaced themselves.’ He added: ‘If I have caused any offence or menace I'm devastated by that.’  Nunn was arrested at his home on August 7 after Miss Creasy and Miss Criado-Perez reported his abuse. Nunn, who wore a smart grey suit, white shirt and grey striped patterned tie, had denied sending indecent, obscene or menacing messages.between July 28 and August 5 last year.

"Menacing storm clouds gather over green fields and quiet roads, about to embark on a path of destruction. Like a spaceship hovering above the earth, the cylindrical formation spells trouble for anything in its wake. As it sinks closer to the earth, clouds of golden dust are kicked up beneath the gloom by the tornado's rotating force. It's called Tornado Alley for a reason: The car and trees in this photo are dwarfed by the gigantic cloud . Storm chaser Marko Korosec, 31, was on an expedition in the USA for 26 days when he came across these cloud formations. Marko, a system administrator for road weather information, snapped the shots of the three storms in Tornado Alley in Texas, Kansas and Colorado. From a distance of 1km, he observed the scene for at least an hour at a time, saying the tornados ripped up trees and telephone wires on their journeys. The alley's unique conditions mean tornados form frequently here. On Cloud Nine: Storm chaser Marko Korosec could not believe his luck when he saw these incredible cloud formations . Dust to dust: Huge dust clouds merge with this cloud as it moves across the valley . The sun appears to be consumed by the cloud, sucked up by a giant, spinning vortex . Warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico meets cold, dry air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada, creating intense, tornado-producing thunderstorms known as supercells. Supercell storms contain a rotating tower, called a mesocyclone, giving the clouds a circular spaceship look. Marko, from Sezana, Slovenia, said: 'Storm chasing is dangerous as intense lightning, large hail, strong winds and tornadoes could pose threats at any time. 'I usually observe storms in as safe a position as possible, to avoid any dangerous conditions which could cause us damage or to the vehicle. 'It usually takes no more than an hour to form a supercell storm which usually brings down trees amd telephone wires. 'Hail can also damage roads and buildings, so it's important to stay at least 1km away. 'Storm chasing usually means a lot of moving around, remaining in one position for some time and then moving when storm gets closer.' The fluffiest UFO in the universe!

"South Koreans are in the grip of a frantic hunt for chunks of meteor which could be worth more than £50,000 ($83,000). Hundreds of people have been scouring hills and rice paddies for space souvenirs near the southeastern city of Jinju after the rare shower on March 9. Some of the treasure hunters were armed with GPS devices and metal detectors, according to media reports. South Koreans are in the grip of a frantic hunt for chunks of meteor which could be worth over £50,000 ($83,000). South Korean geologists are shown here surveying the area near where a chondrite (a type of meteorite) was found, in the southeastern city of Jinju . ‘Media hype claiming that chondrites [a type of meteorite] could bring you a bonanza sparked the fever for space rocks,’ an official from the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea (CHAK) told AFP. Local greenhouse owners have put up signs warning off trespassers after the first large chunk of rock, weighing around 20lbs (9kg), was found in a greenhouse near Jinju. A second piece weighing 8.8lbs (4kg) was found by another local resident.

A South Korean farmer checking a chondrite (a type of meteorite) at his greenhouse in the southeastern city of Jinju (left). On the right locals go on the hunt to find even more pieces that may be scattered in the area . Scientists confirmed that two rocks, found in the two days after the meteor shower, had come from space . Meteorites are typically sold by weight, but other factors come into play when putting a price tag on these space rocks. Rarity of type, condition of preservation and its beauty can all change the price. Prices vary from one source to another but it typically ranges between £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram. Unclassified stone chondrites, such as the ones found in South Korea, are at the bottom scale of the price range. Pallasites, stony-iron meteorites, are more valuable, particularly when cut and polished because of their attractive colour. Some can will fetch between $20 (£12) and $40 (£24) per gram. A quality slice the size of a small dinner plate is worth thousands of pounds. Scientists confirmed that both rocks, found in the two days after the meteor shower, had come from space. ‘Because it is suspected that a meteorite divided in the atmosphere into more than two pieces, it is still possible that more meteorite [debris] will be discovered,’ said an official of the Korea Polar Research Institute (Kopri). However, an an official estimate has yet to be confirmed. Treasure hunters hope they will sell any meteorites found for large sums. The current going rate for meteors ranges betwee £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram. The 20lb (9kg) rock found last week is expected to be worth up to $90,000 (£54,000). A U.S. meteorite-hunter has been handing out business cards in the local area, asking people to sell him any shards they find, the Korea JoongAng Daily said. Prime Minister Chung Hong-Won suggested the government should secure them for research or as a natural monument. The current international standard is of £3 ($5) to £6 ($10) per gram. This 20lb (9kg) rock found last week is expected to be worth up to $90,000 (£54,000) Ownership of the meteorites remains a legally grey area because of the lack of relevant provisions in South Korean civil law . Both space rocks were found in Jinju, a city in South Gyeongsang Province in South Korea . The CHAK official said the agency would designate any meteorites found as cultural assets to stop them from being taken out of South Korea. Ownership of the meteorites remains a legally grey area because of the lack of relevant provisions in South Korean civil law, the official added. A space rock was last found on its soil in 1943, when the Korean peninsula was under Japan's colonial rule. Meteor showers occur when hundreds of meteors - fragments of dust and rock that burn up as they pass through the Earth's atmosphere - light up the sky in a spectacular display. Meteorites are meteors that do not burn up completely, surviving the fall to Earth. Scientists check the authenticity of the finds.

"As if Facebook, Google and the federal government squirreling away your personal information wasn't enough, now it seems your car could also be spying on you. According to a new report from the Government Accountability Office, several major automakers and GPS manufacturers have been collecting data about drivers' whereabouts gathered from on-board navigation systems and keeping the information for varying lengths of time. The report was released on Monday. It focused on the big three Detroit automakers, Toyota, Honda and Nissan, as well as GPS manufacturers Garmin and TomTom, and app developers Google Maps and Telenav. Spies: Toyota is one of several car manufacturers named in the GAO's report on vehicle data collection . The GAO - as well as Senator Al Franken, who requested the investigation - worries that the privacy of motorists is at risk if information about their travels are being recorded without their knowledge, and kept for indefinite amounts of time. According to the report, even if a motorist wants data about their travel destroyed, the entity collecting the data isn't required to destroy it. According to the report, the companies can 'track where consumers are, which can in turn be used to steal their . identity, stalk them or monitor them without their knowledge. In . addition, location data can be used to infer other sensitive information . about individuals such as their religious affiliation or political . activities.' Franken, of Minnesota, chairs the judiciary committee on privacy, and has introduced location privacy legislation into the Senate. He now says he plans to reintroduce amended legislation following the GSO's report. Keeping tabs: The GAO also says onboard navigation devices like Garmin also are collecting travel information . 'Modern technology now allows drivers to get turn-by-turn directions in a matter of seconds, but our privacy laws haven’t kept pace with these enormous advances,' Franken said in a statement. 'Companies providing in-car location services are taking their customers’ privacy seriously — but this report shows that Minnesotans and people across the country need much more information about how the data are being collected, what they’re being used for, and how they’re being shared with third parties.' The Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, the trade organization that represents Detroit's 'Big Three' automakers, claims that the car companies are committed to ensuring the privacy of drivers, despite the report's findings. Privacy: Senator Al Franken says he plans to reintroduce location privacy information based on the GAO report . 'Details of the industry’s strict privacy policies are traditionally included in our sales and service agreements,' spokeswoman Gloria Bergquist told The Detroit News. 'That way, we ensure our customers have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with these strict privacy policies.' The report also found that vehicles can collect information in other ways, including the use of event data recorders, or 'black boxes,' or other transponders like EZ-PASS. The GSO also says that law enforcement officials will sometimes use information gathered from these sources, and that some car owners agree to have their driving habits monitored to qualify for lower insurance rates, or to keep tabs on teenage motorists. 'Companies should safeguard location data, in part, by de-identifying them; that companies should not keep location data longer than needed; and that such data should be deleted after a specific amount of time,' the report concluded, noting that none of the companies would say how long they keep data. 'OnStar takes seriously matters that affect our customers’ privacy and operates its services with strong privacy protections and practices,' General Motors said in a statement.","New GAO shows that automakers are collecting data on drivers' travel habits .

"Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas has resigned after being filmed apparently offering access to Prime Minister David Cameron in return for donations of £250,000 a year. The senior Tory fundraiser told undercover reporters pretending to be business representatives that 'things will open up for you' if they donated that amount of money to the Tories. In a meeting secretly recorded by The Sunday Times, he said: 'It will be awesome for your business.' Quit: Tory co-treasurer Peter Cruddas has resigned after being filmed apparently offering access to the PM in return for donations of £250,000 a year . Announcing his resignation, Mr Cruddas said in a statement: 'I deeply regret any impression of impropriety arising from my bluster in that conversation. 'Clearly there is no question of donors being able to influence policy or gain undue access to politicians. 'Specifically, it was categorically not the case that I could offer, or that David Cameron would consider, any access as a result of a donation. Similarly, I have never knowingly even met anyone from the Number 10 policy unit. Under fire: Labour challenged the Prime Minister to 'come clean' about what he knew and when . 'But in order to make that clear beyond doubt, I have regrettably decided to resign with immediate effect.' Mr Cruddas said he only took up the post at the beginning of the month and was 'keen to meet anyone potentially interested in donating'. He said he had not consulted any politicians or senior party officials before the recorded conversation. Mr Cruddas told the undercover reporters that 'premier league' donors - those giving £250,000 a year - could lobby Mr Cameron directly and their views were 'fed in' to Downing Street. He said there was no point in 'scratching around' with donations of £10,000. According to The Sunday Times, he believed that any prospective donations from the reporters - pretending to be wealth fund executives - would come from Liechtenstein and would be ineligible under election law. Peter Cruddas, Britain’s 15th richest man, has enjoyed a spectacular rags-to-riches story. The son of a meat porter in London’s East End, he left school at 15 and went on to become one of the richest men in the City. After starting out as an office junior he became a City trader before setting up the spread betting firm CMC Markets, which focuses on bets on the financial markets. In 2007 the investment bank Goldman Sachs bought a 10 per cent stake in CMC, which valued Mr Cruddas’s business at £1.4 billion. He has given about £350,000 to the Conservative Party in the last two years and also helped bankroll the recent ‘No to AV’ campaign. Friends describe Mr Cruddas as a classic ‘Cockney geezer’ who enjoys his wealth. He showed off a £200,000 platinum watch in one recent interview and boasted that he had 15 more. He told one interviewer: ‘I’ve got a £10 million apartment in Monaco, a £5 million house in England, another fantastic house in Antibes, a yacht and a private jet.’ In one shopping spree he bought 17 pairs of shoes at the same store so he could have identical pairs in each of his five homes. He is also known to have been a member of the prestigious Monte Carlo Golf Club, which plays host to some of Europe's top players. They are said to have discussed the creation of a British subsidiary and the possibility of using UK employees to make the donation. The journalists secured the two-hour . meeting with Mr Cruddas through Sarah Southern, a former Conservative . Party staffer now working as a lobbyist. The . Sunday Times said she told the reporters they should make a 'huge . donation' if they wanted access to senior government figures.' Mr Cameron today responded to the damaging revelations by branding Mr Cruddas's 'cash for access' claims as 'completely unacceptable'. The Prime Minister insisted that was 'not the way' the Conservative Party raised money and promised an inquiry to ensure it would not happen again. He said it was right that treasurer Peter Cruddas had resigned overnight in the wake of the revelations about his comments to undercover reporters posing as potential donors. 'What happened is completely unacceptable. This is not the way that we raise money in the Conservative Party, it shouldn’t have happened,' Mr Cameron told BBC News. 'It’s quite right that Peter Cruddas has resigned. I will make sure there is a proper party inquiry to make sure this can’t happen again.' The claims are particularly damaging, however, given Mr Cameron's strong stance on 'secret corporate lobbying' which he declared in 2010. In February 2010, while leader of the opposition, he said: 'I believe that secret corporate lobbying, like the expenses scandal, goes to the heart of why people are so fed up with politics. ‘It arouses people’s worst fears and suspicions about how our political system works, with money buying power, power fishing for money and a cosy club at the top making decisions in their own interest.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'No donation was ever accepted or even formally considered by the Conservative Party. 'All . donations to the Conservative Party have to comply with the . requirements of electoral law. These are strictly enforced by our . compliance department. 'Unlike . the Labour Party, where union donations are traded for party policies, . donations to the Conservative Party do not buy party or government . policy.' Labour challenged the Prime Minister to 'come clean' about what he knew and when. 'Time . and again the Tory party has been the obstacle to capping donations . from wealthy individuals. Now it appears obvious why,' said Labour MP . Michael Dugher who was speaking before Mr Cruddas quit. 'Pensioners, . the young unemployed and squeezed middle families cannot afford to buy . this sort of access or influence which is just another reason why this . government is out of touch with the overwhelming majority of British . people. 'David Cameron should come clean. Access: Mr Cruddas said financiers who gave 'premier league' donations could get access to Mr Cameron, possibly at venues such as the Prime Minister's Buckinghamshire retreat, Chequers . 'Will the PM say exactly what he knew and when about an apparent effort to sell access and influence in Downing Street?' The Conservative Party said Cruddas would be replaced in his post by Stanley Fink, a member of the House of Lords who had previously held the role. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said Mr Cruddas’s comments were 'utterly disgraceful' and made the case again for reform of party funding - an issue that came under scrutiny when Tony Blair’s government was embroiled in allegations that honours were awarded in return for cash for the Labour Party. Attempts at a cross-party consensus for reform have repeatedly foundered. Sleaze watchdog Sir Christopher Kelly warned today that the parties could 'duck the issue no longer'. Mr Cruddas also told the Sunday Times that Mr Cameron hosted major donors at receptions at his official Downing Street residence and at Highclere Castle, the location used in British television drama 'Downton Abbey.' Sir Christopher, chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: 'It would be wrong to regard this as an isolated event. Events like it are inevitable as long as the main political parties are dependent for their existence on large donations from rich individuals or, in the case of the Labour Party, a small number of trade unions. 'The parties collectively need urgently to address the damage this does to confidence in the integrity of the political process. 'All three of the major parties promised to end the ‘big donor culture’ in their manifestos for the last election. 'The promise also featured in the Coalition agreement. My Committee last autumn provided a blueprint for doing so which we believed to be both reasonably fair and sustainable and which, because we are an independent committee, was not distorted by thoughts of party political advantage. 'Nothing has so far happened. I imagine this is presumably because it requires all the parties to face up to some difficult issues which they would rather avoid. They should not be allowed to duck the issue any longer.' In November last year the topic of party funding became national news when a key committee warned that large financial contributors were being given 'preferential access to political decision makers'. The committee on standards in public life recommended that party donations be capped at a maximum if £10,000 each, while Conservative co-chairman Andrew Feldman told the committee: 'There is no question of individuals either influencing policy or gaining an unfair advantage by virtue of their financial contributions to the party.' The 'cash-for-access' row involving Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas evokes memories of political scandals past. Two years ago, with Labour still in power, there was a row over so-called 'cash-for-influence' when three former Cabinet ministers were suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party over allegations that they were prepared to take cash to influence government policy. Geoff Hoon, Stephen Byers and Patricia Hewitt were filmed by Channel 4's Dispatches programme discussing the possibility of working for what they thought was an American lobby firm. In 2010, Stephen Byers, Patricia Hewitt and Geoff Hoon were suspended from the Parliamentary Labour Party over allegations they were prepared to take cash to influence government policy . In the middle of the decade was the 'cash-for-honours' affair, which raised questions about the activities of the two biggest parties. Alleged links between the granting of honours and financial support for parties dogged the last two years of Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair's time at Number 10. An influential group of MPs which considered the issue said in December 2007 that membership of the House of Lords should be decided by an independent body in a fully transparent process. The then chairman of the Public Administration Committee, Dr Tony Wright, said that though no charges were brought over the scandal, trust in public life had been damaged. A police inquiry had followed a complaint by Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil in 2006 that financial support was being rewarded with honours in contravention of a 1925 anti-corruption law. It had been reported that millionaires who gave large donations to the Labour and Conservative parties were to be given peerages. During the inquiry, Mr Blair became the first prime minister to be interviewed by police as part of a political corruption inquiry. The following year, after a £1.4 million, 19-month investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service announced that nobody would be charged, as there was no realistic prospect of a conviction.","Peter Cruddas told undercover reporters that 'things will open up for you' if they .

"Many parents are failing to protect themselves against the sun because they are focusing on their children, a charity has warned. A poll of 950 parents found that 74 per cent always make sure their youngsters are wearing sun cream which is at least factor 15. However, that leaves a significant number of one in four that do not. Fun in the sun: But many parents are forgetting to slap on the sun cream because they are focusing on the kids . And 47 per cent said they often forget to use sun cream themselves because they are too busy concentrating on their child’s skin. Only 55 per cent always make sure their child spends some time in the shade and 62 per cent that their child covers up with clothing or a hat. Cancer Research UK carried out the survey with Nivea Sun. The charity is urging people to use sunscreen of at least factor 15, seek shade during the hottest parts of the day and to wear protective clothing. 'Parents need to practise what they preach and take care of their skin too,' said Sarah Williams, senior health information officer at Cancer Research UK. 'It was particularly worrying to see that while out in strong sun only a quarter of parents surveyed always cover up with clothing or a hat as this is one of the best ways to protect your skin. 'We want to help parents set an example so that their children have a healthy attitude towards the sun.

"It can be a struggle to get children to listen to instructions with so many distractions around, but speaking with a British accent might help. A new study claims that children respond better to an English accent than an American one - even in the US. A trial involving 600 families found that children as young as 18 months old listened more attentively and for longer when playing an app with an English voice, compared with other accents. Scroll down for video . It's all in the voice: A new study claims that children respond better and listen more carefully (illustrated with a stock image) to an English accent than an American one - even in the US . The research also found a northern lilt commanded more authority than clearly pronounced words said in a non-regional English accent. The makers of Little Clever - an app aimed at helping pre-school children develop reading, counting and recognition skills - tested its puzzles app on 300 families in the UK and 300 in the US. The children’s ages ranged from 18 months to six years old. The company asked the families to try out several different voice overs for a week, including Northern English, ‘received pronunciation’ which is a clear English accent without much regional bias, Scottish and American. Parents were also asked to experiment with male and female voices.

The study found that 95 per cent of the children in the UK responded better to an English accent and surprisingly, 70 per cent of children in the US did too. Kevin Croombs, chief executive of Little Clever, said: ‘We made sure any words which are pronounced differently in the US were correct, but even the parents in America preferred the English accent, believing it sounded more authoritative. ‘UK parents felt their children are already over-exposed to American accents thanks to the likes of Disney and video games, so our app made a welcome change.’ The trial also found that most of the children responded better to a female voice. Mr Croombs said: ‘As we get older we regard male voices as more authoritative, but children under five still respond better to a female voice, probably because of the bond with their mother.’ Together with his wife Louise, Mr Croombs created an app to engage children, including 101 animal puzzles divided into nine categories, which gradually become more challenging. ‘Children seem to listen harder and longer when playing the game using the British accent. It just seemed to engage them better and encourage them to do better in the game,’ he said. 'They seemed to like being praised in the British accent particularly and would show more excitement, such as clapping their hands and smiling wider. ‘Some of the parents from the US suggested it may be the intonation of a British speaker, which carries more authority.

The group found that the price of dairy — as in milk for the mashed potatoes and whipped cream for the pies — collectively jumped 25 cents over last year. Miscellaneous ingredients, such as coffee, sugar and eggs, account for another 28 cents, while 3 pounds of sweet potatoes jumped 20 cents. The good news is that a drop in fuel prices won't just make it cheaper to drive to Grandma's house for the big meal, it also helped keep down the cost of some ingredients. Flour-based foods, such as stuffing mix, pie shells and dinner rolls, will run about 21 cents less than last year, likely due to energy cost savings by the processors, says John Anderson, the Farm Bureau's deputy chief economist. Price hike: The group estimates the cost of Thanksgiving dinner by averaging non-sale food prices around the country based on feeding 10 people a traditional meal . The group estimates the cost of Thanksgiving dinner by averaging non-sale food prices around the country based on feeding 10 people a meal of turkey, bread stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls with butter, peas, cranberries, carrots and celery, pumpkin pie with whipped cream, and coffee and milk. And yes, their estimates account for needing leftovers. And here's something to consider: Though this year's cost is up, it's still 7 cents lower than in 2012. News earlier this week that turkey production is at its lowest level in nearly three decades and wholesale prices are at an all-time high briefly spooked some folks. But most consumers won't see that reflected on their grocery bills. Retailers aren't likely to pass on to consumer much if any price hike that they are paying for the big birds, and the Farm Bureau actually expects the cost of a 16-pound turkey to drop by 11 cents this year. Of course, there are plenty of ways to spend more this Thanksgiving. Pricey: Miscellaneous ingredients, such as coffee, sugar and eggs, account for another 28 cents, while 3 pounds of sweet potatoes jumped 20 cents . Upgrade that 16-pound conventional bird to an organic, free-range model and suddenly the Farm Bureau's $21.65 estimate can jump to $100 or more at specialty online retailers. Not into baking? Instead of spending about $3 on a homemade pie, you can spend $25 or more on high-end mail order versions. Or maybe you don't want to cook at all. A complete and fully cooked Thanksgiving dinner for 12 people from Whole Foods Market will cost around $170. Then again, maybe you want to spend less. Shop smart at a bargain retailer and you could shave more than a third off the Farm Bureau's total. Using the same menu for 10 people, Wal-Mart estimates that shopping for Thanksgiving dinner at one of its stores will cost just $32.64. But maybe you got off the hook this year and aren't hosting Thanksgiving. If instead of cooking you'll be traveling by car, you'll see savings at the pump. Gasoline is running about 33 cents less per gallon than it was a year ago, with a national average of $2.88, according to travel tracker AAA. And it doesn't matter where you're driving. Gas can be found for less than $3 a gallon in every state in the continental U.S. Don't want to drive? If you're traveling by train, you'll pay a bit more. Amtrak says its ticket prices have increased an average of 2 percent over last year. Same goes for flying. The average price of an airline ticket for travel this Thanksgiving is $307.52, not including an average $51 in taxes and fees, according to the Airlines Reporting Corp., which processes ticket transactions for airlines and travel agencies. That's up 1.1 percent from last year.","The price for putting Thanksgiving dinner on the table for 10 people is expected to rise slightly this year, clocking in at $49.41 .

"Rioters are being sentenced too harshly and should be treated like any other case in the courts, according to the head of the Crown Prosecution Service. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer insisted that those involved in last month's disturbances should not be regarded as a 'separate category' or dealt with differently from other criminals. His comments come amid concern that sentences being handed down to rioters are disproportionate. Some surveys have even suggesting they are a quarter longer than normal. Riots: The teenage looter, who cannot be identified, flees from the Poundland store in Peckham, south London . On Friday a 17-year-old girl who stole a bottle of Lucozade and some sweets from Poundland during the civil unrest was jailed for eight months. Mr Starmer did not criticise the sentencing of rioters but stressed: 'We should not treat these cases as a separate category to be dealt with differently. Jailed: The 17-year-old was given eight months behind bars after stealing Lucozade and a number of other items . 'We should treat them as we do any other case. We need to keep our feet on the ground. In other areas, such as big terrorism cases, we have resisted the temptation to call for special measures. With disorder cases, we should adopt the same approach,' he said to the Daily Telegraph. Another example of harsh sentencing includes a Territorial Army soldier who was jailed for 13 months after she admitted stealing a television. Lorraine McGrane, 19, who is part of the TA's bomb disposal unit, walked off with the television as looters raided an Argos store in Bermondsey, south east London. McGrane had never been in trouble with the police before. Aaron Mulholland, 30, joined looters as they ransacked a phone shop during the riots was jailed for 13 months. The lifeguard drunkenly followed looters into Fone World in Camberwell Church Street, south London, after leaving a nearby pub. Inner London Crown Court heard how he was caught by police crawling out of the store, which suffered £25,000 of losses, beneath security shutters empty-handed. A doctor's daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, stole a bottle of Lucozade and helped herself to some T-shirts and a pair of sunglasses as violence broke out in Peckham. The 17-year-old, who handed herself in to police, has been jailed for eight months and has been described as 'quiet and intelligent'. Mr Starmer also dismissed the idea that human rights legislation was a factor in last month's outbreak of violence and looting. Prime Minister David Cameron, by contrast, has praised the 'tough message' that the courts have been sending out in a recent interview accused the BBC of making excuses for last month's rioters. His remarks came following a row with . BBC presenter Evan Davis who asked Mr Cameron whether there was any . difference between his own membership of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford . University and the rioters. An . irritated Mr Cameron said everyone did stupid things when they were . young but dismissed any comparison with the 'organised looting and . stealing and thieving' seen across the UK last month. Mr . Cameron has promised to step up his crusade to mend Britain's 'broken . society' and said a 'misinterpretation' of human rights laws had . undermined the idea of people taking responsibility for their actions. He also underlined the need for more discipline in schools and said there need to be tougher measures to end welfare dependency. Awkward: Evan Davis tried to link rioting to the antics of those in the Bullingdon Club which Prime Minister David Cameron was a member of . Mr Cameron said problem youngsters needed ‘tough love’, adding: ‘You need both elements of it. ‘For some of these children there probably was a shortage of love. But you do need, when they cross the line and break the law, to be very tough.’ But the CPS chief said: 'I don't think human rights could be listed as one of the causes. 'No doubt there will be analysis of the possible causes, but to me human rights would not be among them.'

"A group of Republican governors tore into President Barack Obama on Wednesday over his forthcoming immigration directive and threatened to sue him for breaking the law. 'I would go to the courts,' Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Wednesday during an annual retreat for the party's chief executives. 'This is illegal.' Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry accused Obama of 'sticking his finger into the eye of the American people' and said his state may take legal action against the president, too. Scroll down for video . A visibly enraged Rick Perry talks about the costs of  illegal immigration in his state during a press conference at the Republican Governors Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, on Wednesday. The outgoing governor of Texas said its a 'possibility' his state would sue the president over immigration . 'I think that’s probably a very real possibility,' Perry, a probably 2016 presidential candidate, said. The comments came during a panel at the Republican Governors Association conference in Boca Raton, Florida, Wednesday afternoon, hours after the White House announced via a Facebook video that Obama would finally make public his immigration plans during a prime-time address on Thursday evening. The following day he will sign any official paperwork associated with his declaration during a rally at a Las Vegas, Nevada, high school. The president's speech detailing the major policy adjustment will be mostly unseen by Americans when it airs, however, as ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox will not carry it live. According to news reports, the White House put out feelers to the networks about having his remarks broadcast but they seemed unwilling to preempt hit shows that evening. As a result, the president's press shop never put in an official request to have it aired during primetime and regular programming will proceed as usual. The White House will air the speech on its website, though, and interested Americans can watch it there at 8 p.m. EST or on a handful of other networks, including Spanish-language channels Univision and Telemundo, as well as CNN, Fox News and MSNBC. Univision is planning to interrupt it's telecast of the Latin Grammy's to air it, the Washington Post has confirmed. What the president will say is still a mystery. The White House has been tight-lipped in its descriptions of the president's plans during its daily dealings with reporters. Numerous news publications have reported his executive order will include work permits for up to 5 million illegal immigrants, namely those who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2010 and those who have American citizen children. It is also also expected to authorize a half million new work permits for foreigners who graduated from U.S. colleges and obtained degrees in subjects like science and engineering. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that the planned executive actions would affect immigrants who 'have deep ties in America, are law-abiding and have children or spouses who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents.' Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez said Tuesday he believed the president would issue two-year work permits to illegal immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least live years, and possibly 10, as long as they pay for and pass a background check. 'You're going to submit your fingerprints and if they come back clear, he is going to give you a work authorization for two years and a Social Security card. He's going to put you on the books paying taxes,' Gutierrez told Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. He also suggested Obama's directive would provide allow an untold number of agricultural workers to stay in the U.S. legally. President Barack Obama is pictured here signing the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2014, into law in the Oval Office of the White House on Wednesday. On Friday he is expected to sign an executive order halting deportations for as many as 5 million illegal immigrants . Whatever action the president takes is likely to be unpopular with Americans, though. An NBC/WSJ poll conducted last weekend found that 48 percent of Americans opposed the president making changes to the immigration system through an executive order, and just 38 percent were for it. Republican governors - many of whom are mulling presidential bids next year - were fuming over the rumored proposals on Wednesday afternoon, saying they would place numerous burdens on their states. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback worried about the logistics of providing driver's licences to illegal immigrants shielded from deportation by Obama. 'That would be very difficult in our state,' he said, according to the New York Times. Meanwhile, Maine Gov. Paul LePage called the idea of expanding work permits in his state to accommodate Obama's order 'unacceptable.' 'I am fighting it, not helping it,' he said. Recalling the difficulty he and his wife experienced while trying to obtain legal documents for a Jamaican teenager they were caring for, LePage explained it took them 'nearly 11 years' to finish the paperwork. 'Why should everybody just get one tomorrow?' he pondered. Meanwhile, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, a former federal lawmaker, endorsed a strategy under consideration by congressional Republicans to 'use the power of the purse to work the will of the American people.' 'Every major change in the life of our nation has been done with the consent of our government,' a visibly upset Pence reportedly said. 'I think it would be a profound mistake' for the president to act unilaterally, he added. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie refused to engage on the subject of illegal immigration at all, saying as he had several times in the past, that he would make his views on federal issues known when and if he runs for president. But he did come out swinging against Republicans in Congress floating a government shut down unless Democrats go along with their plan to bar immigration agencies from using federal funds to support Obama's edict. 'It’s incumbent upon everybody in Washington, D.C., to do their jobs. And running the government is their job,' Christie said. 'All this kind of hysteria about shutdowns to me is just people who can make news.' Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal  said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight, it would be the president's fault for not signing the GOP's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order . Democratic Congressman Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, center, delivers remarks during a press conference in front  of the White House on Wednesday.  Gutierrez stood alongside immigrant farm, food and commercial workers from across the country to remind Americans of the people behind the Thanksgiving meal and to call on Obama to deliver the most inclusive changes to immigration policy possible through executive action . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was also reticent to share his personal views on immigration reform, telling his peers, 'we will deal with people here illegally compassionately and fairly' and calling for enhanced security at America's southern border. Weighing in on the issue before Congress, though, he said if the government did shut down during the upcoming spending fight, it would be the president's fault for not signing the GOP's hypothetical legislation that would block his executive order. 'I don’t think the president should shut down the government simply because he wants to break the law,' Jindal said. Only Ohio Gov. John Kasich indicated a willingness to embrace amnesty for illegal immigrants currently residing in the country, telling his fellow GOP governors, 'We’ve got to think about what’s going to bring about healing.' 'I don’t like the idea of citizenship when people jump the line. We may have to do it.' 'I’m open to it, I will tell you that,' Kasich, a possible dark horse presidential candidate, added. Wisconsin's Walker warned his allies not to be so distracted by Obama's immigration actions that they lose focus on other important issues like the economy, taxes, energy and education, however. The Associated Press said Walker characterized the president's latest move as a 'cynical ploy' to blind Republicans to divert Republicans' attention away from other more pressing issues. 'Come out with me on the road and I’ll tell you there aren’t a whole lot of people talking about immigration reform,' Walker told them.","'I would go to the courts,' Wisconsin Gov.

"Investigators probing the racist spray painting last month of the small-town Massachusetts home of an eighth-grade football player are now focusing on the 13-year-old boy's mother. Andrea Brazier, mother of football player Isaac Phillips, is now being investigated as the sole suspect in a crime that shocked the town and nation when she blamed her son's teammates for spray painting racist graffiti all over the family's home. ‘Knights don’t need n*****s' was found spray painted on the side of their Lunenburg home. The school cancelled the remainder of the Blue Knights' season in response. Scroll down for video . The heat is on: Mother Andrea Brazier (left) initially blamed son Issac Phillips' teammates for racially charged graffiti sprayed on her home, but investigators now view her as the only suspect . State and local officials have cleared the Lunenburg High School football team in the hate crime and are now focusing their efforts on Ms brazier, according to reports. A Wednesday search of Ms Brazier and Mr Phillips' home turned up cans of spray paint and multiple round of live ammunition, according to affidavit cited by the Boston Herald. It was all a lie: Ms Brazier still has this picture posted to her Facebook profile, but officials are pointing the finger at her . Federal agents also interrogated the embattled mother, and stated in the affidavit she wanted the investigation to end because she had committed the crime. 'Andrea stated she had painted over the graffiti and that she wanted nothing further to do with the investigation,' the affidavit said. Mr Brazier even appeared to halfheartedly admit her guilt under further questioning . 'Andrea was told by (an) FBI agent that . she wanted the investigation to stop because she was the one who spray . painted the graffiti on her house and Andrea stated ‘OK,' thew affidavit continued. She professed the innocence of both her son and husband Anthony Phillips before leaving the local police station in tears, said the affidavit. The teen's mother is white and his father is half black. Ms Brazier and Anthony Phillips refused an offer from authorities to remove the graffiti, the affidavit continued before adding that aerosol cans were found burnt in an outdoor fire pit. No arrest is imminent, according to the Boston Globe, but cops are now working to compare the graffiti to handwriting samples. 'Most of the leads that we have followed up throughout the investigation have led back toward the house,' an official told the Globe. Locals talking to the Globe expressed shock and disbelief over the allegations. 'It’s pretty shocking, if it’s really his mom,' said sophomore basketball player Sam Sargent. 'If it’s true, she didn’t just put her son through a lot, she put this whole town through a lot.' Hurt and embarrassed: Isaac Phillips is reportedly upset over the incident to the point he does not want to return to school . Cathy Hennessy, a 46-year-old mother of three, felt bad for Ms Brazier. 'This isn’t that kind of town,' she told the paper. 'If it was the mother, that’s just really sad.' A friend of Isaac Phillips expressed a similar sentiment. 'I don’t see why she would do such a thing and have our school disgraced.' The boy's parents moved to blame teammates they accused of repeatedly hazing their racially mixed son. ‘I don't really understand why someone would even do something like this,’ Phillips told WCVB-TV when news first broke of the awful graffiti. 'I have two younger brothers and another sister. This is our house, this is where we live. Eventually, they're going to see it.’ The teen's cleats have been thrown in the trash and the tires on his bicycle slashed in the past, she further detailed. Players were given an opportunity to come forward with information about the graffiti incident during a team meeting in the days after the incident was first reported, none came forward and the season was cancelled. The lack of an admission of guilt by any players make more sense in light of the most recent revelations. 'We didn't want this': Father Anthony Phillips (right) initially said he and Ms Brazier (left) had no idea the incident would receive this much attention . Lunenburg Public Schools Superintendent Loxi Jo Calmes then announced that the remainder of the school's football season would be forfeited. The decision prompted an angry reaction from some locals, including a former coach who launched a petition to get the remaining games reinstated - chief among them the annual Thanksgiving game. ‘I was so angry - this is so unfair to a lot of those kids,’ Matthew Roderick told Telegram.com. The change.org petition is titled ‘Loxi Jo Calmes: Let Them Play!’ ‘I grew up here and mentored a lot of those kids. The whole team shouldn't be punished with no facts,' he stated. 'I was disgusted that innocent kids were being punished and the majority did not do anything.’ Venom from locals over the decision to cancel the rest of the football season was spewed not at the team, but at the family. Isaac’s father Anthony Phillips, who owns a local construction company, has said he was listening to a local radio call-in about the incident when one of the callers blamed his family for causing all the problems. Terrible: Officials believe this racist graffiti was scrawled on the house by Ms Brazier . He just wanted to play football: Instead his mother's alleged actions cost his team the remainder of the season . ‘We did nothing wrong - it has been turned around like we did something wrong and we're the victims,’ he said at the time . ‘We didn't want any of this stuff.... Everything happened so fast,' he continued. 'We only expected a little bit of local attention after it happened. We're not vicious parents out to ruin the town. I'm hoping in the next few days someone steps forward.’ The graffiti, which is being investigated by the FBI as a hate crime, is just the latest accusation of racism that the team is facing. In two different games earlier this month, referees reported players using racial epithets against opposing players. In the weeks prior to the graffiti incident, Anthony Phillips said he spoke to the coaches about his son's treatment but they told him that they doubted any players were involved. A separate investigation into the team's conduct did find it guilty of hurling racial slurs at an opposing team, the Herald reported Thursday. The season was not reinstated, several seniors lost the last two games of their last season of football. 'It's gross to think someone did this and just stood back and let us take the blame for this, senior Greg McGrath said. 'We took the fall.'","The family initially blamed fellow football players and complained their son is the victim of hazing by the school football team .

"Davion Only, the 15-year-old Florida orphan whose courageous plea for adoption touched the hearts of millions around the globe will spend Christmas with a loving foster family, MailOnline can reveal. The teenager, who has spent his whole life being bounced around care facilities, is on the verge of seeing his wish come true of finding a home. He is currently living with his prospective parents so he can get to know the family before any permanent adoption is finalized. Still without a family: Davion Only, 16, who has spent his whole life in foster care and begged for anyone to adopt him at his church . Simple wish: Davion Only, the orphan whose plight gripped the nation, attended many interviews across the country about his plight . And according to Davion’s biological aunt Doris Barnes – the sister of Davion’s dead crack-addict mother La Dwina 'Big Dusty' McCloud – the foster parents plan to take Davion away for a proper family Christmas his first ever. Today a spokesperson for Eckerd, the Florida adoption agency handling Davion's case, told MailOnline: ‘Davion has moved from his group home placement at Carlton Manor to a foster home where he is enjoying getting to know the family. Davion is excited to be spending the holidays with a perspective adoptive family.’ And Mrs Barnes added: ‘I know he is going out of town with a family for Christmas. I wanted to buy him a present and maybe see him, but I can’t because he’s not going to be around. ‘I just want him to be happy and loved and to be with someone who is going to do the best for his future.’ The heart-warming, festive news will thrill the millions of people around the world who were deeply touched by Davion’s plight. The teenage orphan caught the nation's attention after he spoke before his church in St Petersburg, Florida in October and said he wasn't giving up on finding a loving family . Inspiring: Davion Only at 15 with his case worker Connie Going in September before nervously making his speech before the congregation . Back in October the teen stood up before a 300-plus member congregation at St. Mark Missionary Baptist Church St. Petersburg, Florida and begged for a family to adopt him and give him a real home. He told the congregation: 'I'll take anyone. Old or young, dad or mom, black, white, purple. I don't care. And I would be really appreciative. The best I could be… I know God hasn't given up on me. So I'm not giving up either.' Eckerd's Carlton Manor residential group home in St. Petersburg, Florida, where he was living with 12 other teenage boys, was immediately inundated with tens of thousands of calls and emails. Families in countries including Canada, . India, Mexico, Australia, Great Britain and Iran all made contact to . enquire about adopting him. Davion's plea caused so much traffic on the . agency's website that it nearly crashed. Emotional plea: The orphan speaks before St Mark's Missionary Baptist Church to ask if someone would become his parent . Unstable childhood: Davion has been in the foster system his entire life, going from one temporary home to the next . Speaking to CNN about the phenomenal reaction at the time, Davion said: 'It's not really cool not to have anybody. I'm pretty happy and excited that people are calling and asking to talk to me and possibly be my family. 'I just want people to love me for who I am and to grab me and keep me in their house and love me no matter what.' Last month Davion took his story to . Florida Governor Rick Scott and the Cabinet to speak on behalf of all . the State’s teenagers looking for their ‘forever family’. ‘Even . though I'm going through an adoption process right now at the moment, I . still hope that other kids in foster care get the benefit that I'm . going to have to be adopted and to have somewhere to call home and to . have a bed to call theirs,’ he said, speaking to a packed meeting. The . fact Davion addressed the Cabinet is in itself incredible when it is . considered that just a few months ago he was, by his own admission, . short tempered and badly behaved. Davion started to look for his mother, whom he had never met, using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and discovered that La-Dwina Ilene 'Big Dust' McCloud (left) had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before . Biological family: Carolyn Ware, grandmother of Davion Only, spent time with her grandson over Thanksgiving . Wanted him back: Davion's aunt Doris Barnes, pictured left in October, said Davion belongs with his biological family. She said she would take him in - but is not allowed because she has a criminal record . His case worker Connie Going said the teen has always longed for a family but he didn't seek one earlier because he hoped his crack addict mother, La Dwina 'Big Dusty' McCloud would come back for him one day. He started to look for his mother using his birth certificate at a local library in June. He found her obituary and saw that she had died aged 55 in Clearwater just weeks before. At the time of her death, the long-term drug abuser was blind and only had one leg because of severe diabetes. She had a long criminal record for a variety of offences and had spent years in prison. Because of her addictions Davion was taken into care when he was just a few months old. Before the heart-wrenching discovery . that his mother was dead, Davion was short-tempered and didn’t try in . school. He was also around 40 pounds overweight, which was affecting his . health. But the news of La . Dwina’s death gave him the wake-up call he needed, so he started to . improve his attitude towards education, obtaining top grades and losing . lots of weight. Davion shows an ABC presenter his small bedroom at the St Petersburg foster home where he shares bunk beds with another boy . Adorable: Davion, pictured at the age of seven, has been in foster care in Florida for his whole life . MailOnline exclusively interviewed his biological family in October and they told how La Dwina thought about Davion until the day she died and always dreamed of being reunited with him. They also revealed that they had an emotional meeting with the teenager around three months before his church plea and told how they were desperate to play a part in his life. They even wanted to be considered as possible options for adoption, but unfortunately many of them have criminal records, so they were instantly ruled out. But his aunt, Mrs Barnes, today revealed she did have a second meeting with Davion on Thanksgiving Day. Her cousin, police detective Maurice McCloud has been allowed regular contact with Davion and has become a mentor to the teenager. He brought him to meet Mrs Barnes and other family members last month. Speaking to MailOnline, she said: ‘The adoption agency don’t really talk to us, I don’t think there’s any chance of anyone in my family adopting him now. Looking for a family: 15-year-old Davion spoke to the church congregation about how badly he wanted a family to care about him . ‘Maurice picks him up and does stuff with him quite regularly. They are supposed to be going to New York soon to go to a ball game. ‘He brought him to see us on Thanksgiving Day, it was really nice, we had a good time. I explained to him that it would be better to have two parents rather than one. ‘He has never had either, so it would be great if he could have both when he gets adopted. I know he would love that. ‘We didn’t really talk about his adoption, he was just happy to see us. He said to us, “You guys can’t get me because of your past. It was a long time ago, it shouldn’t be like that”. ‘Then he said he’d rather be with his real family, but I told him it was just impossible. He understands that and he knows we are here and that we all love him. Maurice could try to adopt, but he is so busy with his hours at work and Davion needs two parents. ‘Anyway, I think Davion will come and find us when he’s old enough. He knows where we are.’ Davion Only's profile on the Heart Gallery is one of many children who are searching for a permanent home .","The Florida teenager, who has bounced around foster care his whole life, set to spend holidays with his 'own family'

"You might have seen some amazing images of Earth from space,  but you probably haven’t seen anything like this. Using images from a Russian weather satellite, an incredible time-lapse of Earth in 4K resolution has been created, showing our planet in stunning HD. In the video both hemispheres, and then Earth as a whole, are shown with the sun ‘moving’ across the surface as the planet rotates. Scroll down for video . James Tyrwhitt-Drake from the University of Victoria in Canada has created a high-definition video of planet Earth (still from the video shown). In it Earth is seen rotating with the sun sweeping across the surface. He used images from a Russian weather satellite . The video was created by James Tyrwhitt-Drake from the University of Victoria in Canada. He used images captured by the geostationary Elektro-L weather satellite from 15 to 19 May 2011. The images were resized by 50 per cent, misalignments between frames were manually corrected, and image artifacts that occurred when the camera was facing towards the sun were partially corrected. The images were interpolated by a factor of 20 to create a smooth animation. The animation was rendered in the YouTube 4K UHD resolution of 3,840 x 2,160. The Russian satellite orbits at a height of 25,000 miles (40,000km) above the ocean and at such a speed that it always remains over the same spot on the planet. Every 30 minutes the Russian satellite takes a 121 megapixel image (11,136 x 11,136 pixels) of Earth. Normally it shows vegetation as orange, rather than green, as the camera on the satellite uses both visible and infrared light. But Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake edited the images to make the vegetation appear more natural. In the video the glint of the sun can be seen on the Indian Ocean as Earth rotates. The first part of the video shows sunlight washing over the Northern Hemisphere, before then taking a look at the Southern Hemisphere. The final part shows the entire Earth being lit up by the sun in images from Elektro-L. To see the Earth in 4K at every angle click here video from James Tyrwhitt-Drake .

This Russian satellite orbits at a height of 25,000 miles (40,000km) above the ocean and at such a speed that it always remains over the same spot on the planet . On his YouTube channel Mr Tyrwhitt-Drake explains why features like the city lights and other stars aren’t visible. ‘City lights are not visible because they are thousands of times less bright than the reflection of sunlight off the Earth,’ he said. ‘If the camera was sensitive enough to detect city lights, the Earth would be overexposed.’ The sun is purposefully not visible directly to protect the cameras on the satellite from direct exposure to sunlight, while stars are obscured from view by a mask - although they would not be bright enough to be visible anyway.

"The under-25s will be stripped of their benefits to ensure they either ‘earn or learn’, David Cameron announced yesterday. Unveiling a new crackdown on welfare, the Prime Minister said young people will no longer be able to ‘opt for a life on benefits’. The plans will mean that school leavers either have to take a job or an apprenticeship or remain in education or training. Those who refuse will face sanctions, including the loss of out-of-work benefits. Scroll down for video . Tough: David Cameron said all school leavers should be earning or learning, not able to opt for a life on the dole . At the moment, those who refuse to take a job or an offer of a training place can lose their job seeker’s allowance (JSA), but the Tories plan to toughen that policy by also slashing or removing housing benefit payments if the under-25s refuse to co-operate. Mr Cameron told the Tory conference that the move was necessary because one million young people were not in education, employment or training. He said: ‘Today it is still possible to . leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and . opt for a life on benefits. It’s time for bold action here. ‘We . should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really . exist at all. Instead, we should give young people a clear, positive . choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job.’ Mr . Cameron said the Government should not allow young people to ‘just . choose the dole. 'We’ve got to offer them something better than that.’ Address: The Conservative leader told delegates that further reforms to the welfare state, schools and the economy were needed . He added: ‘This is what we want to see: everyone under 25 earning or learning.’ The . savings could be considerable. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says . there are 410,000 under-25s claiming JSA at a cost of £1.2billion a . year, while 380,000 young people are on housing benefit at a cost of . £1.8billion. The cuts are likely to be controversial since 169,000 of . the young housing benefit recipients are single mothers and another . 32,000 are couples with children. The Prime Minister and Work and . Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were originally planning to strip . housing benefit from the under-25s altogether – a suggestion floated by . Mr Cameron in his conference speech last year. But that plan foundered . because it was opposed by the Liberal Democrats. Mr Cameron and . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg have asked Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy . Heywood to draw up a report into training and education for the . under-25s. Under existing rules, young jobless people lose their . benefits if they train for more than 16 hours a week. Serious: Mr Cameron's speech was widely seen as an echo of John Major's pitch to voters in 1992, that the job of repairing Britain is not yet complete . As a result, the . system pays them if they are not in training – but stops supporting them . when they do. The Heywood review is looking at ways to support young people after they have started training programmes. Sir Jeremy will report back in the autumn. The Tories aim to persuade the Lib Dems to back the new sanctions regime. If they refuse, the Conservatives will ‘definitely’ put the measure in their election manifesto in 2015, sources said. Last night a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Clegg would wait until he has read Sir Jeremy’s report, but voiced concern that the scheme would work only if there were enough jobs or training places to offer people. ‘You need carrot as well as stick,’ the source said. ‘There are one million young people out of work and there are not enough jobs for them to go into.’ Not there yet: David Cameron warned delegates at the Tory party conference in Manchester that there was a 'long way' to go before Britain was out of the woods . Mr Cameron conceded that the cuts will be seized on by opponents as ‘callous’, but added: ‘With your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing? No – you’d nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way . . . and so must we.’ He accused Labour of being ‘intensely relaxed about people  staying stuck on welfare year after year’, and added: ‘We don’t patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head. We look people in the eye as equals and say: “yes, you’ve been down – but you’re not out, you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance”.’ A Labour source said: ‘This is an empty and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that there was absolutely nothing in David Cameron’s speech to deal with the cost-of-living crisis facing families.’ Stephen Twigg, backed a free school in Liverpool, Cameron said . David Cameron accused Labour of double standards on free schools by highlighting the ‘unbelievable’ record of shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg. The Prime Minister said Mr Twigg, MP for Liverpool West Derby, opposed free schools nationally but had backed one in Liverpool. It comes after the Daily Mail revealed last week that at least 21 Labour MPs – including four  members of the shadow cabinet – are supporting local free schools. Mr Cameron told the Tory conference: ‘You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools? 'Labour’s official policy is to be against them but – get this – Labour MPs are backing them in their local area. And not just any Labour MPs. ‘I promise I’m not making this up: the shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, has backed one in his own city. Unbelievable.’ The Prime Minister added: ‘Isn’t that always the way with the Left? They don’t like privilege – unless, of course, it’s for their own children.’ Mr Twigg has praised the Everton Free School in Liverpool as ‘inspiring’, and shadow health secretary Andy Burnham attended the ‘founders’ ceremony’ for the Atherton Community free school in his Leigh constituency.","Tory leader says under-25s should be stripped of benefits .

"Black holes are one of the strangest objects in the universe, preventing anything from escaping their grip – even light. Now astronomers have discovered something even more peculiar about these enigmatic objects; they are aligned with each other over distances stretching billions of light-years . The remarkable observations were made by the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile, which found an eerie alignment between enormous interstellar objects called quasars. Scroll down for video . A European research team has found that the rotation axes of the central supermassive black holes in a sample of quasars are parallel to each other over distances of billions of light-years. An artist's impression of the alignment is pictured . Quasars are galaxies with very active supermassive black holes at their centres. They shine more brightly than all the stars in the rest of their host galaxies put together. A European research team has found that the rotation axes of the central supermassive black holes in a sample of quasars are parallel to each other over vast distances. These black holes are surrounded by spinning discs of extremely hot material that is often spewed out in long jets along their axes of rotation. A team led by Damien Hutsemékers from the University of Liège in Belgium used the Fors instrument on the VLT to study 93 quasars that were known to form huge groupings spread over billions of light-years, seen at a time when the universe was about one third of its current age. When astronomers look at the distribution of galaxies on scales of billions of light-years they find that they are not evenly distributed. This detailed simulation of large scale structure was created as part of the Illustris simulation. The distribution of dark matter is shown in blue and the gas distribution in orange . 'The first odd thing we noticed was that some of the quasars' rotation axes were aligned with each other — despite the fact that these quasars are separated by billions of light-years,' said Professor Hutsemékers. The team then went further and looked to see if the rotation axes were linked, not just to each other, but also to the structure of the universe on large scales at that time. The giant black hole at the center of the Milky Way may be producing mysterious particles called neutrinos, researchers believe. If confirmed, this would be the first time that scientists have traced neutrinos back to a black hole. Researchers say the find could help explain how cosmic rays are produced, and solve a key mystery about how the universe operates. The evidence came from three Nasa satellites that observe in X-ray light: the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Swift gamma-ray mission, and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). 'Figuring out where high-energy neutrinos come from is one of the biggest problems in astrophysics today,' said Yang Bai of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who co-authored a study about these results published in Physical Review D. 'We now have the first evidence that an astronomical source – the Milky Way's supermassive black hole – may be producing these very energetic neutrinos.' When astronomers look at the distribution of galaxies on scales of billions of light-years they find that they are not evenly distributed. They form a cosmic web of filaments and clumps around huge voids where galaxies are scarce. This intriguing and beautiful arrangement of material is known as large-scale structure. The new VLT results indicate that the rotation axes of the quasars tend to be parallel to the large-scale structures in which they find themselves. So, if the quasars are in a long filament then the spins of the central black holes will point along the filament. The researchers estimate that the probability that these alignments are simply the result of chance is less than one per cent. 'A correlation between the orientation of quasars and the structure they belong to is an important prediction of numerical models of evolution of our universe,' said Dominique Sluse, a researcher at the University of Liège. 'Our data provide the first observational confirmation of this effect, on scales much larger that what had been observed to date for normal galaxies.' 'The alignments in the new data, on scales even bigger than current predictions from simulations, may be a hint that there is a missing ingredient in our current models of the cosmos,' added Professor Dominique Sluse.

"Troubled: Pastor Isaac Hunter (pictured) has died in an apparent suicide after admitting an extra-martial affair and having a domestic violence order served against him . The troubled son of a church pastor who is a spiritual advisor to Barack Obama has died in an apparent suicide. Father-of-three Isaac Hunter, 36, had been battling problems since resigning from a Florida megachurch he founded after admitting to an affair with a staff member last year. A judge also granted his wife a domestic-violence petition after claiming his erratic behavior and alcohol abuse had left her 'fearing for my life and the lives of our three children.' According to court documents, Hunter had written an undated suicide note saying: 'I have become what I never wished to be, a burden on those I love the most'. Darling Murray, a co-ordinator at Summit Church in Orlando, revealed the news of his death in an e-mail yesterday, reports the Orlando Sentinel. He said: 'We found out today that Isaac took his life. We are obviously deeply, deeply devastated and saddened beyond words by this news. 'We are praying for his family and this congregation as we walk through this together.' Hunter is the middle child of Joel Hunter, a Northland Church pastor who has been speaking to Mr Obama almost once a week since his 2008 presidential campaign, reports CNN. A week after admitting his affair in November last year, Isaac Hunter's wife, Rhonda, filed a domestic-violence petition against her husband, claiming he was unstable, erratic and suicidal. According to Charisma News, . the order bars Isaac Hunter from the couple's home in Winter Park, . Florida, his church, his children's schools and his wife's workplace.

"A teacher’s aide accused of sexually assault at least one high school boy may have also give that boy HIV. Mario Hunt, 35, had been a teacher’s aide in Cahokia, Illinois for seven years when police pulled him out of Cahokia Senior High School Wednesday for questioning. Hunt, who is HIV positive, was then suspended and has since been charged with sexually abusing a student and possibly transmitting HIV to the victim. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arrested: Police say Cahokia, Illinois teacher's aide Mario Hunt, 35, sexually assaulted a student and may have given the boy, 17, HIV . The male victim was 17 at the time of the crimes, which police say occurred over several months beginning in January 2011. ‘We were approached a week and a half ago by a student and his mother and asked to investigate the conduct between the suspect and several young boys. We conducted an investigation and turned the case in for review at the state's attorney's office on Friday. Our suspect was charged today,’ Cahokia Police Chief James Jones told the News-Democrat Monday. At the same time, school officials said the same boy’s mother approached them about inappropriate conversations her son was having with Hunt via Facebook. It remains unverified whether or not the boy is now HIV positive. The charges merely state that he knowingly exposed the victim to the virus. Shock: School superintendent Art Ryan said officials screen employees as best they can. Hunt worked at Cahokia Senior High for seven years before his arrest . Haven? Hunt worked with many children at Cahokia High, pictured, where he was also a track coach but only one victim has yet come forward . Also unclear is just how many victims Hunt may have had. The teacher’s aide was also reportedly a track coach at the high school, which likely gave him ample time to interact with students. Asked about potential fault on the part of the school, which failed to detect the longtime employee’s behavior, school superintendent Art Ryan told KMOV his officials protect students from such harm every way they can, but some criminals aren’t easily detected. Possible: Hunt is HIV positive and charged with sexual transmission of HIV, a charge that indicates he knowingly put the boy at risk . ‘We can’t be following every single employee every minute of every day, you just have to hope that between our screening processes, that things like that don’t happen.’ Ryan was unaware of Hunt’s HIV status until he was alerted to it by reporters Monday. ‘I’m shocked by that,’ he said. ‘I've not seen any reports about the charges being filed or anything of that nature…with HIPA laws and so on, you know, people who are not compelled to share any situations they might have with their employers.’ Hunt was arrested by U.S. Marshals at his home Monday.

On Earth, it's increasingly used in application such as dry cleaning or to sterilise medical equipment, but astrobiologists at Washington State University believe it could also be capable of sustaining life. 'I always have been interested in possibly exotic life and creative adaptations of organisms to extreme environments,' study co-author Professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch told Charles Choi at Space.com. 'Supercritical CO2 is often overlooked, so I felt that someone had to put together something on its biological potential.' Professor Schulze-Makuch and his team compared enzymes in carbon dioxide and in water, and found that they were more stable in supercritical CO2. An international team of scientists found evidence of tiny creatures living inside the basalt of the Pacific Ocean floor - covered by 2.5km of water and hundreds of metres of sediment . A parallel universe of life exists hidden beneath our planet's ocean floors and could help us search for life on other planets, research last year claimed. An international team of scientists found evidence of tiny creatures living inside the basalt of the Pacific Ocean floor - covered by 2.5km of water and hundreds of metres of sediment. The results of their studies revealed evidence of a vast ecosystem whose characteristics are entirely different from any previously investigated. Core samples taken from the sea floor off the west coast of the U.S. contained traces of micro-organisms living in the total absence of light, and almost entirely disconnected from the world above. 'We're providing the first direct evidence of life in the deeply buried oceanic crust,' said microbiologist Mark Lever, who worked on the study as a PhD student at North Carolina. 'Our findings suggest that this spatially vast ecosystem is largely supported by chemosynthesis.' Supercritical carbon dioxide makes enzymes choosier about the molecules they bind to, leading to fewer side reactions. They also found that a number of species of bacteria are tolerant of supercritical carbon dioxide. Previous studies have found that microbes can live near liquid carbon dioxide trapped under Earth's oceans – and area where the fluid can become supercritical. The researchers believe that supercritical carbon dioxide may be present on Venus (pictured), whose atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. If it is, it may have trapped remnants of life once existed on the planet . For instance, Core samples taken from the sea floor off the west coast of the U.S. contained traces of micro-organisms living in the total absence of light, and almost entirely disconnected from the world above. 'It would be great to drill into areas with supercritical carbon dioxide on Earth and investigate those environments in detail, but this is obviously difficult because of practical limitations and huge expenses,' Professo Schulze-Makuch told Space.com. The researchers believe that supercritical carbon dioxide may be present on Venus, whose atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide. If it is, it may have trapped remnants of life that may have once existed on the planet.","Supercritical carbon dioxide has features of both a liquid and a gas .

"The M25 can be a daunting prospect at the best of times, even for a confident young driver. So it’s perhaps not surprising that 82-year-old Dennis Leighton got rather lost amid its four-lane carriageways and busy junctions. However, he managed to disappear for an epic 30 hours behind the wheel. Dennis Leighton was reported missing after failing to arrive at his destination 55 miles away. He was found 30 hours later . Boarded up: Mr Leighton's home in Windsor yesterday . He set off from his home in Windsor on . Monday evening to visit his daughter Hazel 55 miles away in Swanley in . Kent. It was a route he apparently knew well and had travelled several . times before. A few hours later his worried family . reported him missing. The next day at 11.20am his silver Vauxhall Astra . estate was spotted on a police automatic recognition camera in Dartford, . Kent – six miles from his intended destination. The M25 celebrated its 25th birthday in October, despite first being proposed in 1905. It runs for 117 miles and almost encircles Greater London. When it was first built it was the world's biggest ring road/city bypass but now it is second to the Berlin Ring which is 121 miles long. The M25 took more than 11 years to complete and cost around £1billion. If people were to drive at 70mph it would take an hour and 40 minutes to complete the route. However, those in need of refreshments would need to carefully plan their stops as there are only three service stations along the entire length of the  motorway. Despite being designed with a capacity of 100,000 vehicles per day, almost double that figure now use it daily. The motorway inspired Chris Rea's 1989 hit Road to Hell and is also the inspiration behind the name of electronic duo Orbital. It appeared the former carpenter was . lost on the 117-mile London orbital and going around in circles. Thames . Valley Police put out a missing person’s appeal and called on other . forces to help. Then in the early hours of Wednesday – . more than 30 hours after going missing – a ‘confused but grateful’ Mr . Leighton and his car were found safe in South London. Neighbours said he . was in hospital last night, believed to be having treatment for . hypothermia after his two nights out in the cold in his car. A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: . ‘He had been driving around the south of the country, predominantly on . the M25 but had also gone on to some A roads in the area. He had stopped . to catch up on some much needed sleep – we think in a motorway service . area, before setting off again. He is, after all, 82.’ Mr Leighton has lived alone at his . semi-detached home since the death of his wife Audrey. Milk bottles were . outside his house yesterday and plywood had been used to board up the . door after the police broke in during their search. One neighbour said it was not unusual . for Mr Leighton to visit his daughter. She added: ‘He goes down to his . daughter’s every so often, so nobody thought anything about it. He’s a . lovely man. He’s got one daughter and a grandson born in June.’ Orbital nightmare: Mr Leighton is believed to have spent nearly two days on the M25 . Mr Leighton’s adventure echoes that of Mohammed Bellazrak’s three-day ordeal last Christmas. The grandfather hit the headlines when he fell victim to the airport snow chaos after taking his wife to catch a holiday flight at Gatwick Airport. The disorientated 72-year-old spent three days and nights driving up and down the M4 motorway trying to find his way home to Trowbridge, Wiltshire. Mr Bellazrak set off from Trowbridge on December 23 to drive his wife to Heathrow airport where she was due to catch a flight to Morocco. However, the snow and ice meant the flight was diverted to Gatwick. He was eventually found on Christmas Day, still at the wheel of his Peugeot 307, when he triggered a police camera and was flagged down by officers in Oxfordshire. Police cameras had recorded him driving around numerous towns in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire.","82-year-old gets disorientated on journey which should have taken just one hour .

"A criminologist has claimed Jack the Ripper could be a meat cart driver from Whitechapel and his blood-splattered appearance may have been what helped him evade justice . Jack the Ripper was a meat cart driver in Whitechapel, who legitimately blood-spattered appearance helped him evade justice, a criminologist has claimed. Dr Gareth Norris from Aberystwyth University believes 'carman' Charles Allen Lechmere, whose early route to work coincided with locations of Ripper killings, should be considered a suspect. Lechmere was found leaning over  victim Mary Ann 'Polly' Nichols' body on Buck's Row in Whitechapel on August 31, 1888 and told police he had only been there a few minutes. But research has revealed that he lied to police about his name, calling himself Cross, and it was likely that he was with her body for about nine minutes. He also passed Hanbury Street, Dorset Street and Mitre Square at roughly the same times as the Ripper killings - while another happened in Berners Street, where his mother lived. It is a theory that joins many others in relation to the string of murders during a three-month period in 1888 when six women were killed on the streets of London's Whitechapel. Their throats were slashed and bodies mutilated but no one was ever caught and 'the Ripper's' identity remains one of the world's greatest crime mysteries. In the years that have passed since the killing spree, many high-profile suspects have been suggested including Prince Albert Victor, the grandson of Queen Victoria and Sir William Gull, the Queen's doctor. Dr Norris, who worked with TV producer David McNab and Swedish journalist Christer Holmgren in a new Channel 5 documentary about the killer, drew up a profile of the likely murderer. He predicted that Jack the Ripper would have been local and able to walk the streets in the early hours without being suspected. Dr Norris said: 'He [Lechmere] would certainly be a person of interest and, while the evidence against him is circumstantial, he would have a case to answer. 'There couldn't feasibly be a re-opening of the case as the Ripper is most certainly deceased by now, but periodically reviews of historical cases can be sanctioned. An illustration of a Victorian meat cart driver, who is weighing dog meat for sale, similar to the job Lechmere had in 1888 . 'Again, there are no living witnesses or forensics of any sort so the basis of any investigation would be slightly flawed. 'Lechmere could be a match for the profile - along with many others - but whether he fits the conspiracy element that fascinates the public is another matter.' Dr Gareth Norris claims that Jack the Ripper could be Charles Allen Lechmere, whose route to work coincided with the killing locations in Whitechapel . He added that because of his job as a meat cart driver, Lechmere would have been 'routinely covered in blood'. David McNab added: 'Lechmere was discovered standing over the body but bizarrely no-one seemed to think that was important.' Dr Norris said investigations in Lechmere's life showed his mother was 'a pivotal figure' for him and he lived very close to her. But two months before the Ripper killings he moved further away to a new address while his daughter remained living with his mother. Dr Norris said that could have been due to some trauma and added: 'A big upheaval in the family just months before the killings could be of some significance.' Barrister James Scobie QC believes Lechmere's early lies and his passing by the murder scenes could have warranted a court case. He said: 'He is somebody who seems to be acting in a way that is suspicious, which a jury would not like. 'When the coincidences mount up against a defendant, it becomes one coincidence too many.' Lechmere died in 1920 and was survived by his wife who eventually passed away on September 12, 1940 in Stratford, east London. An image depicting police discovering one of the victims of the murders in London which took place in 1888 . Several theories have been manufactured over the years concerning the 'Jack the Ripper' killings . Numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer. At the time, police suspected the Ripper must have been a butcher, due to the way his victims were killed and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards, where meat was brought into the city. There are several alleged links between the killer and royals. First is Sir William Gull, the royal physician. Many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes' bodies, while others claim he was the Ripper himself. Another book named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous killer. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time. Another theory links the murders with Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, the Duke of Clarence. At one point, cotton merchant James Maybrick was the number one suspect, following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer. However some believe the diary to be a forgery although no one has been able to suggest who forged it. Other suspects include Montague John Druitt, a Dorset-born barrister. He committed suicide in the Thames seven weeks after the last murder. George Chapman, otherwise known as Severyn Kłosowski, poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903. Another suspected by polive was Aaron Kosminski. He was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died there. Dr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged. Some of the more bizarre links include Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice in Wonderland books, who taught at Christ Church until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the Ripper murder scenery. Winston Churchill's father - Lord Randolph Churchill - has also been named as a potential suspect. Crime writer Patricia Cornwell believes she has 'cracked' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms Walter Sickert, an influential artist, as the prime suspect. Her theories have not been generally accepted. While author William J Perring raised the possibility that Jack the Ripper might actually be 'Julia' - a Salvation Army soldier in The Seduction Of Mary Kelly, his novel about the life and times of the final victim, that it was perhaps not 'Jack' the Ripper, but 'Julia' - a Salvation Army soldier.

"Friends of a man who has been arrested five times for drink-driving have staged an elaborate prank in a bid to prevent him doing the same again. YouTube prankster Tom Mabe, of 'MabeInAmerica', from Louisville, Kentucky, decided to take matters into his own hands when his friend passed out after his latest bender. Using an office mocked up as a hospital theatre, and a team of actors who posed as medical teams, he convinced his pal he had been in a coma for 10 years. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Friends of a man who has been arrested five times for drink-driving have staged an elaborate prank in a bid to prevent him doing the same again . YouTube pranksters 'MabeInAmerica' (Tom Mabe and Jim Clarke) turned an empty office into a hospital room and convinced their mark (a friend of theirs who who remains nameless) that he had been in a coma for 10 years . They launched the prank after receiving a phone call to say that he has passed out in his truck . After filming the results he then posted the video online to discourage others from drinking and driving over the festive season. After first asking his family for permission, he set up the room - including the 'doctors and nurses' - and woke his friend, the Huffington Post reports. He even screened fake news reports into the room as his baffled and still groggy victim wakes to the realisation he has been out cold for ten years. As he wakes, a 'nurse' leans into him and tells him he is in hospital and that she is going to get a doctor, who informs him: 'Some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident. The pranksters transform the room into a hospital, with bed, telephone, and television so they can teach the man a lesson . Once they were told that he had passed out once again, they quickly enacted the plan.  After he was first transported to the bed, he wakes up to a 'nurse' who then runs to fetch a 'doctor' 'This accident took place in 2013. It is now 2023. 'You have been in a coma for the past ten years.' He immediately asks for his wife and daughter, before he is told to settle down to watch some TV news - which include fake reports that  Miley Cyrus is facing eviction from a trailer park for 'refusing to stop defecating in her neighbour's yard'. The doctor arrives in the room and tells him: 'Some time ago you were out drinking and you were in an accident. This accident took place in 2013. It is now 2023' The confused man immediately asks for his wife and daughter, before he is told to settle down to watch some TV news . A second medical professional comes in, who carries out some medical 'tests' to see of he can feel his feet . He then moves to his patient's side where he begins to slap him around the head and shout: 'You have five DUIs'. As he does so, his mask falls from his face, and the man realises it is his friend Mr Mabe who has pulled the prank .

"You may have to switch on the TV or go to the cinema to watch a film, but in the future you could wear hi-tech contact lenses to beam moving images onto your eyeballs. 3D printed contact lenses could also be used like Google Glass or a heads up display to show wearers data and even monitor their health, researchers claim. US scientists have taken the first step to make this possible, because they have managed to make a 3D printer that can create a five layered contact lens, where one layer beams light into the wearer’s eye. Scroll down for video . US scientists  have managed to make a 3D printer that can create a five layered contact lens, where one layer beams light into the wearer’s eye. A stock image of a standard contact lens is pictured . Michael McAlpine led a team at Princeton University to build the complex machine, which in turn made the new type of lens New Scientist reported. 3D printers typically build up metallic or polymer material to form objects, as instructed by computer code, which tells the machines the desired dimensions and appearance of the end product. But this machine is more complex. The lens printed by the machine is a transparent polymer with tiny ‘quantum dot’ light-emitting diodes and wires hidden inside that form electrical circuits. Dr McAlpine said that the most challenging part of the project was working out the best chemical solvents to use in order to create each layer and how long to leave them to dry for the next layer to stick correctly. 3D printers (stock image) typically build up metallic or polymer material to form objects, as instructed by computer code, which tells the machines the desired dimensions of the end product. But this machine is more complex and can embed the tiniest electrical components in layers of polymer . The team also had to work out a way of enabling the lenses to fit differently shaped eyeballs. To do this, they constantly scanned the lens with two cameras to check the final shape matched the wearer’s prescription. The US Air Force funded the research, because it one day hopes its pilots will be able to wear contact lenses that display in-flight data, like a heads up display for the eyeballs. If the LEDS were replaced by light sensors, such lenses could also be used to monitor a pilots’ health without the need for an invasive implant, by studying changes of the retina. Dr McAlpine said that a sensor could be embedded inside them to detect fatigue in the eye fluids, and therefore if a pilot is exhausted. The race is on to roll out contact lenses that consumers can wear to watch video. Unveiled earlier this year, a system by iOptik allows users to see projected digital information (like Google Glass) so that tiny screens sit directly on their eyeballs. However, a pair of lightweight glasses made by Washington-based Innovega, have to be worn for the lenses to work. They provide an experience equivalent to watching a 240-inch television at a distance of 10 feet, according to the company's chief executive, Steve Willey. The system works with smartphones and portable game devices to deliver video - or can be switched to a translucent 'augmented reality' view, where computer information is layered over the world we know it. Unveiled earlier this year, a system by iOptik allows users to see projected digital information (like Google Glass) so that tiny screens sit directly on their eyeballs. A concept image is shown . Innovega customised the standard contact lens manufacturing process with a unique filter to make the contact lenses. 'All the usual optics in the eyewear are taken away and there is a sub-millimetre lens right in the centre,' MD Stephen Willey told CNET. 'It's shaped, so the outside of the lens is shaped to your prescription if you need one and the very centre of the lens is a bump that allows you to see incredibly well half an inch from your eye.' An optical filter also directs the light. 'Light coming from outside the world is shunted to your normal prescription. Light from that very near display goes through the centre of the lens, the optical filter,' Mr Willey said . Last year, South Korean scientists created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs, bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures a step closer to reality. Last year, South Korean scientists created soft contact lenses fitted with LEDs (pictured), bringing the possibility of transparent, flexible materials that can be programmed to take pictures a step closer to reality . Unlike the iOptik, which requires glasses to work, these contact lenses can be used as standalone systems capable of performing tasks such as taking pictures. Microsoft and the University of Washington have also been working on similar projects that seem more like a prop in movies such as Mission Impossible 4. In 2012, they created a prototype of a hard augmented reality contact lens capable of receiving radio signals and transmitting them to the brain through optical nerves.","Scientists from Princeton University in New Jersey have managed to make a 3D printer that can create a five layered contact lens .

"A revolutionary new haircare system has been developed which promises to give you thicker, fuller, and longer hair in just three months. The Salon Science AnaGain range, which was developed by Dr Bernhard Irrgang with the help of  celebrity stylist Andrew Jose, uses stem cells from rare plant extracts - much like many face creams - to boost and build the hair. According to Dr Irrgang, the product promises not only to given denser and thicker hair but it also helps to prevent hair loss, protects your hair from everyday wear and tear and promotes growth from the root. Scroll down for video . It's a hair care dream! The Salon Science AnaGain range promises longer and thicker hair in just three months . It sounds too good to be true - so how does it work? He explained: 'The AnaGain collection is formulated with a powerful Organic Pea Sprout extract that helps to initiate the growth of new hair and encourage the growth of existing hair.' According to Dr Irrgang, at any given time the hair on most people's heads will be going through two different phases. Most of the time the majority of the hair - 85 percent - will be in the anagen or 'growth phase'. Meanwhile the other 15 percent of hair will be in the telogen or 'hair loss' phase. This means it is growing and shedding simultaneously. Dr Irrgang said their product enhances the 'growth phase' and reduces the 'hairloss phase'. He said: 'The AnaGain regime leads to reactivation of hair growth by reducing the amount of hair in the telogen phase and stimulating anagen hair in the growth phase. 'As the product helps to increase the number of hair in the anagen phase, the hair gets denser and fuller. Research: The Salon Science AnaGain range underwent clinical trails which showed how the products helped to boost hair growth . The results: After using an AnaGain gel the panelists saw a marked improvement in their hair . Man behind the products: Dr Bernhard Irrgang is the head of research and development for Salon Science . 'As the hairs in the anagen phase are being supported, hair becomes more vital and healthy which in turn helps to encourage hair growth by 80 per cent compared to normal levels.' And the results do seem to be pretty impressive. Of a select panel who tested the product, which is currently available exclusively at Boots, 95 per cent found the look of their hair improved and they had less hair loss. Harnessing stem cells from plants has been used to create creams and lotions for the body and face for sometime so using it in hair products is a natural progression. Dr Irrgang explains why the stem cells they use are so beneficial: 'AnaGain is based on Organic Pea Sprouts; a plant material known to have a high level of phytonutrients. The Pea is a vegetable with pod fruits. Each pod contains several peas which are rich in proteins, starch and fibres that protect the plant from disease, dangerous pathogens and UV pollutants. 'These health promoting phytonutrients are also known to exert beneficial effects on human hair by inducing dermal papilla cells [at the root of your head] to initiate the growth of new hair.' The Salon Science team recommend that you use the three AnaGain products together, firstly washing with the shampoo, conditioning and then using the Proacellerant treatment which specifically targets hair loss. Their wider range of products includes volume building shampoos and mousses and a Swiss Grape range with helps to repair and protect damaged hair. Roll back the years: The extended Salon Science range includes products which are designed to prevent ageing of the hair and restore volume . Andrew Jose uses the Salon Science products at his salon in Charlotte Street, London . Andrew Jose, who helped to develop the Salon Science range, heads up his own salon in London, has been working in the hair care industry for more than 20 years. During that time, he's amassed a number of celebrity clients. Amongst others, he's styled, preened and generally made fabulous the tresses of Jane Fonda, Alanis Morissette, Louise Redknapp and Jodie Kidd getting them red carpet ready on many an occasion. He said: 'The red carpet is a showcase of polished, effortless yet timeless hair that is luxurious and elegant. The hair styles are chosen to perfectly complement what the artist will be wearing so requires precision planning.' So what are his top tips for paparazzi ready locks? 1. Match your hair to your outfit . When choosing a show stopping hairstyle, bear in mind that less is more. If you have a statement gown, then keep the hair simple, if you have a simple gown then the hair can become more of a statement! 2. Be prepared! Make sure your red carpet hair schedule incorporates your colour appointment to ensure colour will be at its very best. Plus you should always carry an emergency fix kit, a couple of bobby pins, a small backcombing brush and a handbag sized hairspray are essential! 3. Don't be too clean . This may shock some people but I always recommend that my clients wash hair the day before putting it up to combat hair being too slippery. After washing apply SALON SCIENCE® Swiss Apple CELLUMAX™ Foam  to damp hair at the roots. Flip hair over to one side and blow dry hair in that direction until 80% dry and flip the hair back to the other side and blowdry again in the opposite direction to create maximum volume at the root. Celebrity clients: Andrew has worked with, from left, Jane Fonda, Alanis Morissette, Louise Redknapp and Jodie Kidd . 4. Pick a style that suits your face shape . Take into consideration head shape and the balance of your facial features when choosing a red carpet style. A style that is soft and flattering on most face shape is the low chignon or bun. Always tease hair at the crown to give volume and leave soft tendrils around the face. 5. Back comb, back comb, back comb but don't rush it . Teasing (back combing) and dry shampoo is a must have when creating a red carpet style – for volume and staying power. But remember great hair takes time DON'T rush it! If you are creating the style yourself, practise your look as some techniques can be challenging. Trial your style the day before to get it right on the night.","The Salon Science AnaGain range promotes hair growth .

"Camera traps are able to capture remarkable images of wildlife in ways film crews and photographers can’t. And to celebrate the rarity and beauty of seeing these animals in their natural habitat, the BBC Wildlife Magazine has rewarded the best shots as part of its annual camera-trap contest. This year's winner was a rare shot of an Asiatic cheetah, taken by a trap owned by the Iranian Cheetah Society (ICS) in the Naybandan Wildlife Refuge in South Khorasan Province. This year’s winner in the Overall Research category of BBC Wildlife Magazine's Camera-trap Photo of the Year Awards 2014, sponsored by Lowepro was a rare shot of an Asiatic cheetah (pictured).

A camera trap is a remotely activated camera fitted with motion sensors, or an infrared sensor that uses a beam of light as a trigger. They are being placed in remote regions, national parks and in woods and forests to capture animals in their natural environment. Typically, film crews would have to sit for hours to capture such images, and this potentially adds stress to the animals. The traps are sometimes known as camera trails and although they are predominantly used by researchers to track animals, hunters also use them to look for places to hunt.

"Prince Harry jetted into Emirati capital Abu Dhabi this afternoon clad in white jeans and ready to hit the polo field for a match in aid of his African charity, Sentebale. The royal arrived at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club to play in the Sentebale Polo Cup, raising funds for the charity he set up in memory of his late mother to help children affected by HIV and AIDS in southern Africa. Declining to pose for photographers as he was late, Harry was immediately ushered into a reception to chat to sponsors and VIP guests. Among them was former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, who was accompanied by her new fiancée Formula 1 Red Bull boss Christian Horner. Scroll down for video . Winning ways: Harry and his Huntsman team celebrate their 5-4 victory in the Sentebale Polo Cup . Round of applause: Harry and team mate Malcolm Borwick applaud the losing team during the presentation ceremony . Ruling dynasty: Harry chats to Sheikh Falah bin Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, and his young son . She said she had known Prince Harry since he was 10 - after being introduced to the young prince by his father, Prince Charles, whom she famously once pinched on the bottom. 'I have met Prince Harry a few times,' said Ms Halliwell. 'I've seen him since he was about 10. I have seen him grow up. It is brilliant what he is doing with his life. 'It's all for a good cause. I think he is a great ambassador for showing people that we care and he's got great spirit and heart. I think he's brilliant. We are looking forward to serving him in action.' The singer also revealed that she has been on a polo pony before and described them as 'amazing'. 'I want to say like a Ferrari...' she said, before sheepishly trailing off. 'No don't say Ferrari, it's Red Bull!' her Formula 1 fiancee interjected with mock seriousness. Ms Halliwell continued: 'Actually they are brilliant to handle. They are really light to the touch. But I've never actually been to a game to watch.

Also at the reception was the Duke of Argyll, global ambassador for the distillery Royal Salute, the main sponsor of the event, and Dan Stevens, the former Downton Abbey actor. The Duke explained: 'Dan is here as a guest of ours, and came over from New York for the event. I got to know him because they filmed the 2012 Christmas Special of Downton Abbey at my home, Inveraray Castle in Argyll. 'We’re very proud to be here supporting the Prince and Sentebale, as we have done for the past four years.' He also explained that because of the ban on alcohol advertising in the United Arab Emirates, Prince Harry’s team could not play under its usual name of Royal Salute, and was instead being called the Huntsman team, after the Savile Row tailor which is another of the sponsors. Also among the VIP guests was the former racing driver Sir Jackie Stewart, who said he had never tried playing polo because 'anything less than 500 horsepower is dangerous'. Running late: Harry was forced to rush past photographers as he arrived at the Ghantoot Polo Club as he was running late . No can do! Harry was asked whether he wanted to hold a falcon - the national bird of the UAE - but didn't have enough time .

Prince Harry, who has tried his hand at open cockpit racing on private visits to racing tracks, thanked Sir Jackie for sending him a crash helmet, and said a letter of thanks was on its way to him. He told Sir Jackie: 'I like what you did with it', before pointing to Sir Jackie’s trademark tartan trousers and adding: 'At least you didn’t do that with it.' The two men also chatted about whether polo players or racing drivers lost the most weight through perspiration while competing. 'I would lose six or seven pounds during a race,' Sir Jackie said, 'but in those days the races only lasted about an hour and 50 minutes.' Sir Jackie also said he expected fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton to win the Abu Dhabi Formula 1 Grand Prix - and with it the world title - on Sunday. Sentebale - which means forget me not - supports children in Lesotho, a tiny, poverty-stricken kingdom in southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. The Prince plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after today's polo to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit this weekend. He has spent the last thee days in Oman on a semi-official royal visit at the personal invitation of the country's Sultan. Harry's team eventually won the Sentebale Polo Cup 5-4, with the prince scoring at least one goal. He was also awarded the most valuable player of the match trophy.

"When Shaunna Lane's best friend suggested she should do a photo shoot to boost her confidence, after much thought, the naive girl, who was a teenager at the time, decided to strip down for a series of arty nude shots. And she was so thrilled with the photos that she decided to share them with her then boyfriend. Her confidence was completely destroyed when the pictures were circulated around the world via a revenge porn website. Scroll down for video . Shaunna pictured at home checking the revenge porn site, where naked photographs of her appeared . A picture of Shaunna Lane, which appeared on the site, that she wants to share to raise awareness . Rocked by public humiliation, Shauna, from Harlow in Essex, who is now 22, became too scared to leave her home after being targeted by hundreds of internet sex trolls, who inundated her with crude messages and even threatened to rape her. 'My privacy, my intimacy, my body had been completely violated. The pictures were taken and shared with trust.' Shauna said. 'I've felt embarrassed and ashamed, but I was wronged and there should be some justice for that.' Now she is sharing her story and the pictures in question herself as part of her campaign against revenge porn. She explains: 'I want to raise awareness about revenge porn - it's a life-ruining problem that needs to be policed.' 'My images are out there for everyone to see, you can search and find them. What difference does it make if the images appear in a newspaper or on a news site if they’re already everywhere else? 'I don't mind if it makes another girl stop and think before sharing intimate photographs.' Peers rejected calls to create a new criminal offence of revenge porn, as it was 'covered by existing laws' Days after the images went live Shaunna was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum . For Shaunna, it wasn't just about the photographs, it was about the vile trolling that followed in the aftermath of their publication. 'I was . called a whore and slut and told how ugly I was. I have been discussed . like a piece of meat,' says the traumatised young woman. 'I . would get messages from perverts who would say I'm going to come and . find you, or I can't wait to rape you. It left me completely shocked, I . was afraid to leave my home. 'I . stayed in the house for weeks after images went up. My full name and . Facebook information had been shared, making me even more vulnerable. 'It has completely shattered my confidence. I didn't want to have sex with my current boyfriend because I felt judged, and paranoid and the thought of being naked filled me with anxiety.' Last month the House of Lords discussed making serious changes to social media which would mean establishing the identity of account holders - stripping internet trolls of their anonymity. However the peers rejected calls to make 'revenge porn' a criminal offence, as it was judged to be adequately covered by existing obscenity and harassment laws. But they insisted clear guidance was needed for police and prosecutors to help them secure convictions. It has led to calls from some campaigners - including Lib Dems - for the UK to follow the example of a number of states in the US where laws aims at stopping revenge porn have been introduced. Ministers say scorned exes submitting revenge porn is a growing problem and claim they will only take action if they have public backing. But for Shaunna, a welfare officer, a change in the law couldn't come sooner. She said: 'It is despicable that there has been no law to protect me and other girls in situations like this. 'You'd be arrested if you went to the park and took pictures of other people's kids. 'Why was it okay for someone to upload my private and intimate pictures to a website without my permission? 'There should be privacy laws or anything that stops this from happening. It shouldn't have happened to me and it shouldn't happen to anyone else.' At the time Shaunna was thrilled with the photos and decided to share them with her boyfriend . Sharing her ordeal Shaunna told how she first discovered the images when she was left baffled by endless online friend requests and a stream of sexually explicit messages on Facebook. Reading through the trolled posts she was left horrified when she discovered links to her naked photos plastered across a vile revenge porn site. But Shaunna was to suffer further humiliation. Days after the images went live she was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum. Sharing the naked pictures and claiming she had 'raised a whore' men from across the world contacted Sarah Lane, 43, asking for sex with her daughter. 'Can you imagine having to explain to your mum why there are naked pictures of you on the internet?' said Shaunna. 'Or worse still, having some pervert pose as one of your friends on Facebook, add you, just to find members of your family to message them the photos. 'My mum was devastated for me. She is hugely protective, like any mum she's like a lioness with her cub she just wanted to kill the person who did it. 'She's tried everything to take them down. She has been hugely supportive of me, but no mother should have to see their daughter associated with a site like this. 'No mum should be told their little girl is a slut or be asked if she is willing to paid so they could have sex with me.' Shaunna and her mother Sarah, who was devastated for her and hugely protective . Shaunna was a typical teenage girl struggling with how she looked when a model friend advised she do a naked shoot to boost her body confidence. The tasteful portfolio of pictures was never intended for public use. Feeling flirty and exhilarated with her new-found confidence she was quick to share the images with her then boyfriend. Last year she began dating new boyfriend Karl Bond, 24, and she thought nothing more of her naked pictures. But Shaunna was left rocked when messages started filtering into her 'Other' message box on Facebook from men in America, Germany and across the UK linking back to a certain revenge porn site. Frightened in her own home and desperate to have the pictures taken down, Shaunna contacted the website only to be told it would cost £240 ($400) to have the images removed. But it was too late - just two days later, her naked images were appearing across social networks and circulating amongst people she knew. Shauna added: 'There was no stopping it, even if I tried to take them down they were every where. People could Google and find me naked on the internet. 'Its terrifying because you have no control and it ruins your life. 'I felt hugely ashamed, I couldn't be naked, I hated my body. 'Ultimately I was embarrassed.' Shaunna with her current boyfriend Karl, 24, who she started dating last year . The site in question is a US domain designed for scorned lovers to get back at their exes by posting their most intimate, personal and degrading pictures or videos. Unfortunately victims are unable determine who was responsible for their individual 'ex' post, as website disguises any IP addresses shielding the original source. While the site is the hub of the images, it accepts no responsibility for its content and will only remove pictures if they are of minors or a fee is paid. 'Sites like this are dangerous.' She said, 'Girls need to think more carefully about the images they take of themselves because once they are out there, there really is no going back. 'It should be illegal. It ruins your life.' Struggling to come to terms with her daughter's ordeal, mother Sarah, also from Harlow said: 'When I saw the images on the website, initially I felt sick, the comments were horrendous. 'The first message I got on Facebook said something along the lines of ""look what someone has done to your daughter"" along with abuse. 'I was very shocked and upset for Shaunna. 'Me and her boyfriend Karl have had other messages since, offering money or calling her names which is despicable. 'But my biggest concerns are that her details have been shared. 'People know her in her home town, and I am glad that her grandparents don't do social media. I worry it could potentially affect her future employment but hope that people aren't so narrow-minded.' 'After seeing some of the images I am not surprised by stories of suicides. It is probably the most humiliating thing you can do to someone.' In 2011 .

"Ever wondered if a super-fast football player could outrun a cheetah? NatGeo Wild has turned this hypothetical question into a one-hour documentary called Man v Cheetah, which premieres tonight at 9pm as part of the network’s Big Cat Week. The wild battle of speed and endurance was staged several months ago at Busch Gardens Tampa in Florida, pitting two of America’s fastest NFL players against a pair of cheetahs. Scroll down for video . Wild race: Chicago Bears Devin Hester races a cheetah during a scientific matchup between nature's fastest land mammal and the super-agile wide receiver and kick returner in the Big Cat Week special Man Vs.

Grand unveiling: The one-hour documentary called Man v Cheetah, which was shot back in May, premieres tonight at 9pm . Jenny Apostol, the executive producer of the program, told Tampa Bay Times she and her team 'had no idea what was going to happen' when they invited Tennessee Titans running back Chris Johnson and Chicago Bears kick returner Devin Hester to go head-to-head with the fastest land mammals on earth. On paper, the bipedal runners appear to be at a clear disadvantage compared to the lightning-fast big cats that can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3 seconds. In the past, Johnson and Hester have clocked 4.24 seconds and 4.4 seconds, respectively, in the 40-yard dash, while cheetahs Jenna and Nave have reached speeds of 62 mph. For comparison, Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt,  widely regarded as the fastest person ever, set a world record in 2009 by clocking 9.58-seconds in the 100-meter dash - more than 27 mph. Record times: In the past, Hester (left) has clocked at 4.4 second in the 40-yard dash, while Johnson (right) has posted 4.24 seconds . For the epic race held in May, NatGeo constructed a 220-foot-long course at Busch Gardens’ Cheetah Run with a 10-foot-tall barrier wall separating the human runners from their feline counterparts, Jenna and Nave. Need for speed: Olympic sprinter Usain Bolt, regarded as the fastest person ever, set a world record in 2009 by clocking 9.58-seconds in the 100-meter dash - but a cheetah would've beat him by 3.5 seconds . Hester and Johnson could not see their furry foes but ran simultaneously in one-on-one heats. Johnson told USA Today that when he was approached by NatGeo with the idea to race a cheetah, he did not hesitate. The doubts came later when the 191-pound running back arrived at the track and found out that the show's producers had to build a higher barrier because one of the cheetah had leaped over the first one. Hester said during filming that in a worst-case scenario, he was hoping to outrun his four-legged rival. Some 20 video cameras were installed along the track to capture the action from every angle. The filming was unscripted and shot in a single take so as not to exhaust the animals, according to the show's producer. To give the NFL players a fair shot, NatGeo set up the races in such a way that the runners had to sprint back and forth and rapidly change directions - something that may be tricky for an animal, RedEye Chicago reported.

"TV Land has announced it will stop airing reruns of 'The Cosby Show' - making it the latest company to distance itself from Bill Cosby following rape accusations by multiple women. A representative from the satellite and cable channel said the reruns will stop airing immediately for an indefinite time. 'The Cosby Show' also was to have been part of a Thanksgiving sitcom marathon. It comes after NBC spokeswoman Rebecca Marks said on Wednesday that a Cosby sitcom it was working on 'is no longer under development', while Netflix also postponed its stand-up comedy special with the once-beloved comic. The announcements came just hours after model Janice Dickinson became the third woman in recent weeks to allege she'd been assaulted by Cosby - charges strongly denied by the comedian's lawyer. Bill Cosby, pictured on Tuesday, has been accused of rape by multiple women. Since the allegations - some of which were reported a decade ago - NBC, Netflix and TV Land have all dropped projects with him . The developments, which involve allegations that were widely reported a decade ago as well as new accusations, have gravely damaged the 77-year-old comedian's reputation as America's TV dad at a time when he was launching a comeback. A year ago, a standup special - his first in 30 years - aired on Comedy Central and drew a hefty audience of two million viewers. His prospective new series was announced by NBC in January. Cosby has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations. Former Pennsylvania prosecutor Bruce L. Castor Jr., who investigated a woman's claims that Cosby had sexually assaulted her in 2004, said Wednesday he decided not to prosecute because he felt there was not enough evidence to get a conviction. Chilling: Former model Janice Dickinson claimed in an interview on Tuesday evening, pictured, how he drugged her with a pill and wine and raped her in 1982. The next day she was in a lot of pain, she said . 'I wrote my opinion in such a way as I thought conveyed to the whole world that I thought he had done it, he had just gotten away with it because of a lack of evidence,' the former Montgomery County district attorney said. Axed: TV Land has dropped re-runs of 'The Cosby Show' indefinitely, a representative said . If Cosby hadn't been cooperative with the investigation, 'I probably would have arrested him,' Castor said. Cosby was asked about the growing furor by an Associated Press reporter when the comedian was promoting an exhibition at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art that features the comedian's African-American art collection alongside African artworks. When the AP interviewed Cosby, on November 6, the story involved long-circulated accusations from several women and recent criticism from comedian Hannibal Buress. Cosby declined to comment, saying: 'We don't answer that.' Since then, more women have come forward publicly to accuse him of sexual assault, Netflix, TV Land and NBC cut ties and an appearance on 'The Late Show With David Letterman' was canceled. Brave: Barbara Bowman, left, says she was raped by Cosby in 1985 when she was an aspiring actress, while retired attorney Tamara Green, right, said Cosby drugged and raped her in the 1970s . Accusers: Joan Tarshis, left, says she was working as a writer in 1969 when Cosby assaulted her twice, while Amanda Constand, right, settled a civil suit against Cosby in 2006 for assaulting her in 2004 . ANDREA CONSTAND . In 2005, the Temple University employee said she was molested by Cosby. Without enough evidence, Constand launched a civil suit but settled out of court. 13 other women said they would testify about assaults they had suffered at the hands of Cosby but due to the settlement, they did not appear in court. BARBARA BOWMAN . In October she told MailOnline that when she was an aspiring actress living in Colorado in the 80s, she was introduced to the comic. She says she was 'drugged, raped an emotionally abused' by him. JOAN TARSHIS . On two occasions in 1969, the music publicist says Cosby gave her 'strong drinks that caused her to black out and when she awoke she was naked and he then attacked her'. LINDA JOY TRAITZ . Traitz of Hallandale Beach, Florida, claims she was just 19 when the actor drove her out to a beach in Los Angeles and tried to get her to relax by taking drugs. JANICE DICKINSON . The model said Cosby lured her to his home with a TV offer and then drugged and raped her in 1982. TAMARA GREEN . Green told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. THERESE SERIGNESE . She was just 19 when she met Cosby before he performed standup in Las Vegas in 1976. He invited her to an afterparty and she claims he drugged her and she woke up to find him having sex with her. CARLA FERRIGNO . She claimed Cosby lunged at her and forcefully kissed her at a party, but after hearing stories from other women 'I was the lucky one'. In recent days, as the allegations gained increasing attention, AP went back through the full video of the November 6 interview and decided to publish Cosby's full reaction to questions about the claims. As the interview was winding down, he comedian asked the AP to not use the brief on-camera refusal to comment he had just made about the allegations. 'And I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' he said. The interview was on the record. The AP had made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art has not changed its plans for the show, which opened this month on the National Mall and is scheduled to remain on view through early 2016. 'The exhibition has been very well received. We've actually had record numbers through the door,' spokesman Eddie Burke said, adding the museum has had no complaints. The NBC project was in the very early stages, without a script or commitment to production. But it would have brought Cosby back to the network where he had reigned in the 1980s with the top-rated 'The Cosby Show'. Cosby has continued working as a stand-up comic, and has at least 35 performances scheduled throughout the U.S. and Canada through May 2015. None of the performances has been cancelled. National Artists Corporation, which is promoting part of the tour, said it will not be canceling any shows. Dickinson told 'Entertainment Tonight' that Cosby had given her red wine and a pill when they were together in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room in 1982. When she woke up the next morning, 'I wasn't wearing my pajamas and I remembered before I passed out I had been sexually assaulted by this man.' Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a letter to the AP that Dickinson's charges were 'false and outlandish' and were contradicted by Dickinson herself in a published autobiography. Cosby's spokesman, David Brokaw, did not return calls for comment. Singer said the first Cosby heard of any assault allegation from Dickinson came in the 'Entertainment Tonight' interview, and suggested the actress was 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career'. Commissioner Bruce Castor, a former Montgomery County DA, says he stands by his decision not to charge Cosby in 2004 because evidence wasn't strong enough - even though he thought he should've been arrested .","The cable network  has removed his shows from their website and canceled reruns of his show indefinitely .

Tamara, the eldest daughter of Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, has lived in the house with her husband, Jay Rutland, and their five-month-old daughter, Sophia, for a year. The incredible house - built in the early 1900s - has four storeys above ground and two below and its value has almost doubled since the two-year renovation project she masterminded with London-born but Los Angeles-based designer Gavin Brodin was finished in 2013. Scroll down for video . The minute Tamara walked in, she knew the house would be a wonderful family home . 'It's rare for these houses to come on the market,' she says. 'The minute I walked in, I knew it would be a wonderful family home. It had a great energy. I felt it could be a home for life.' That home for life idea was cemented when Sophia was born. Understandably, Tamara dotes on her beautiful daughter: 'When I was pregnant I said to Jay I was going to breastfeed the baby for maybe two months at the most and then switch to formula milk. My sister breastfed for 14 months and I said, 'No way, Petra, they have teeth!' Tamara's grade II*-listed house stands on London's most expensive street, Kensington Palace Gardens, where her neighbours include ambassadors and just across the road the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The artwork above the fireplace is a Tracey Emin original and was a wedding present from Tamara's younger sister Petra Stunt . 'Now I want to breast-feed her for ever. She's had no formula and if I have to give her a bottle of milk that I pumped and I can't do it myself I have an emotional breakdown. I'm that mum stuck in traffic coming home from work and ringing my nanny begging her not to feed Sophia so I can do it when I get home.' Since the baby's birth the family make the most use of just three rooms. 'We seem to live in three rooms at most: the kitchen, where I make breakfast – that's my forte; the sitting room, to relax and watch TV; and our bedroom where Sophia also has her cot.' Of her husband she says: 'He has his opinions and tells me if I'm wrong or stupid. I get an honest answer. He's a great dad and a good husband and my best friend. He works in property, finding it, renovating and selling it on. And it's important to me that my dad really gets on with him.' With a contented marriage and a beautiful daughter, life is good for 30-year-old Tamara Ecclestone who has recently launched a brand of hair-care products called Show Beauty that's sold in Harrods and Selfridges as well as New York and Dubai. That and her charity work keep her busy, busy, busy. Tamara and her husband Jay Rutland prefer staying at home and having a few friends round for drinks in the garden (above) or to watch the football or Formula 1 in their basement cinema room . The family can relax by the indoor pool or the hot tub next to it. Backlit onyx enlivens the room . Despite living in a 57-room mansion, Tamara and her husband and daughter seem to spend their time in just three rooms: the kitchen,  the sitting room and the bedroom where Sophia also has a cot .

"Until now, filming underwater has required teams of divers and expensive underwater camera rigs - but a new iPad-controlled robot does the lot itself. The battery-powered Aquabotix Hydroview shoots in Full HD and swims independently, letting users see through its eyes with an app that works on iPads, smartphones and Windows laptops. The $4,000 machine comes with a 75-foot cable and battery pack that lets it 'swim' for three hours - its makers suggest the tiny submarine could be used to find lost keys underwater, or for underwater documentaries. Scroll down for video . The Aquabotix Hydroview shoots in Full HD and swims independently, letting users see through its eyes with an app that works on iPads, smartphones and Windows laptops . Complete with on-board LED lights for underwater, the HydroView travels at up to five knots forward and one knot in reverse while shooting video or capturing still images at depths up to 150 feet down. It can also capture information on water conditions. The Hydroview costs $4,000 - more prosaically, you can also 'explore the depths' with a camera mounted on a boat hook for just $475. The HydroView communicates wirelessly from the user’s handheld device to the HydroView’s top-side box, which is in-turn connected to the submersible via a cable tether. Tthe HydroView measures just 14.6x19x7 inches and weighs nine pounds - and the finished model shoots in Full HD, although the early demo video below is in lower definition. ‘Every kid dreams of exploring the oceans . but few of us truly experience life under the sea.

"Staring ahead with dark eyes and its mouth open wide, a haunting face lets out a silent scream - from a piece of debris from the Twin Tower attacks. Meet the Angel of 9/11, entombed within a twisted, corroded steel girder taken from the exact spot where the first airliner struck the North Tower at 8.46am on September 11 2001.

"Whether it’s a cut in a kitchen, or a serious wound on the battlefield, the number one priority for any medic is to stop the bleeding. And a new gel being developed in New York could save lives, because it can stop the flow of profuse bleeding within seconds. Made from plant polymers, VetiGel works with the body’s natural healing mechanisms to clot blood on contact. Warning: Graphic content . VetiGel - a new plant-based haemophilic polymer (pictured) under development can stop the flow of profuse bleeding almost immediately. This could save the lives of people who would otherwise bleed to death . It’s the brainchild of Joe Landolina, a bio-molecular chemical engineer and former student of the Polytechnic Institute of NYU, who set up a Brooklyn-based company called Suneris. VetiGel uses a plant-based haemophilic polymer that grabs onto blood  and 'snaps it back together to seal the wound'. To make the gel, cell walls are extracted from a plant polymer and used in a similar way to Lego Bricks. When the ‘bricks’ are applied to a wound they reassemble to form a clot. The gel changes shape and colour when it interacts with the tissue, which at first surprised the engineer. It has antimicrobial properties and, when used by experts in sterile environments, is a safe, clean way to heal a wound. Warning: Graphic content: The gel has antimicrobial properties and used by experts in sterile environments is a safe, disinfecting way to heal a wound. This video shows the research behind the gel .

When the ‘bricks’ are applied to a wound they reassemble to form a clot. It changes shape and colour when it interacts with the tissue. The gel has antimicrobial properties and disinfects a wound while it stops blood flow. ‘VetiGel is effective because it works in tandem with the body’s natural healing process, in a new way,’ Mr Landolina told Bloomberg in a video. In dusty war zones, VetiGel will most likely be used as a temporary fix to help soldiers until they receive proper medical help. 'Doctors would then remove it and treat the wound,' Mr Landolina explained. ‘Omar Ahmad, VP of Engineering at the Suneris, elaborated: ‘Let’s say there’s a soldier who is shot on the battlefield and has three minutes to live. A leading competitor can stop a bleed in five to 10 minutes - but he’s only got three. ‘You apply this [VetiGel] and not only will the bleeding stop within 15 seconds, it will stay stopped thanks to its high clot strength.’ Such technology, Mr Landolina claims, could save lives and replace 80 per cent of the wound-care market such as plasters, antiseptic gels and bandages. In dusty, dirty war zones, VetiGel will most likely be used as a temporary fix to help soldiers until they receive proper medical help. Here, soldiers carry a colleague who was shot in Iraq, for more conventional treatment . The gel will soon be used by vets to stop bleeding in animals. More testing is needed before it gets FDA approval to be used on humans. One major application could be on the battlefield. ‘Omar Ahmad, VP of Engineering at the Suneris, said: ‘Let’s say there’s a soldier who is shot on the battlefield and has three minutes to live. A leading competitor can stop a bleed in five to 10 minutes - but he’s only got three. ‘You apply this [VetiGel] and not only will the bleeding stop within 15 seconds, it will stay stopped thanks to its high clot strength.’ The company is working hard to get VetiGel to the point where it is an FDA-approved product for human use. ‘Our goal is to get this in every ambulance, every soldier’s kit bag and in every mum’s purse,’ he said, meaning that one day we could all do without plasters. ‘This means the product has to be easy to use by anybody,’ he added. VetiGel is about to be used by vets. Mr Landolina told MailOnline last year: 'For humans there are similar products available, very expensive but similar, but for animals, there is nothing that coagulates blood quickly enough. 'I have spoken to hundreds of vets and heard how in situations where for example, a spleen is bleeding, they would rather take the spleen out than risk waiting for any of the current products to work quickly enough. So Veti-Gel would be very well received in this industry.' Having performed clinical trials on lab rats, Mr Landolina said he is constantly amazed by how effective the gel is. An experiment performed on a piece of pork liver that was hooked up to a blood bag to simulate an aggressive bleed caught experts’ attention last year, because the VetiGel seals off the wound and stops the bleed in seconds.","VetiGel works with the body’s  healing mechanisms to clot blood on contact .

"A transgender teenager is finally enjoying life as a woman after defying religious protests against her sexuality. Leah Walton, 19, from Mississippi, U.S., was the victim of protests against her transition on her first day at school dressed as a woman. She was greeted at school gates by fellow students and parents wearing T-shirts with slogans such as 'You're going to hell' and 'Abomination'. But despite the continued abuse, Leah has refused to stop living as a woman. Before and after: Dylan Walton was born a boy, but realised early on in life that he wanted to be a girl. When he was around 17 years old, he started dressing as a woman (right) at school and called himself Leah . 'I was so excited to become Leah, I could hardly wait': The teenager tries on a prom dress. She was the victim of protests against her transition on her first day at school dressed as a woman . Defying the bullies: Back in the classroom, Leah had to face a lot of stares and whispers from her classmates . Leah says: 'I was so upset that they were being so ignorant and closed-minded. I felt so frightened that I took a few days off school to gather myself. 'To cope with my fear, I had to build a wall around myself for a little while, but gradually my self-confidence improved. 'I'm so grateful to my mum. She was one of my biggest supporters and helped me through those difficult few days. 'When I went back to school, some people I didn't even know were coming up to me and congratulating me. 'They said I was so brave to face the protesters as the real me.' Back in the classroom, Leah had to face a lot of stares and whispers from her classmates. Aged seven, her mother caught Leah wearing her lipstick while doing an impression of Britney Spears . She says: 'When I walked down the corridor, I could tell that a lot of people were looking at me. Some girls would even laugh and take pictures of me on their phones. 'But the bullies never had the courage to say anything to my face, and my friends were all there for me. Leah was born a boy named Dylan, but always felt unhappy in her body. At the age of seven, mum Kim Hood, 42, caught Leah wearing her lipstick, whilst doing an impression of Britney Spears. 'My mum was angry and told me that boys don't do that,' she says. 'I promised myself I'd never wear girls' clothes or make-up again.' But by age 13, Leah's feelings had escalated. With her larger frame and high-pitched voice, she didn't feel like she fitted in with the other boys. Leah Walton pictured at the age of five (right) with younger brother Cody when she was living as Dylan . Flamboyant: Dylan aged 6, a year before he started taking an interest in lipstick and women's clothes . Confused about her feelings, she came out to her family as gay. But three years later, at the age of 16, Leah made a discovery online that changed everything. She says: 'I was on YouTube when I saw the most beautiful transgendered woman I had ever seen. 'She had glamorous platinum-blonde hair extensions, and she was wearing a bodycon dress with a push-up bra. 'From that moment, I knew I had to become the woman I was always meant to be.' And a month later, Leah told her mum, who supported her decision. Leah had to attend counselling sessions, where she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. At 17, Leah started a course of hormones, including estradiol, and bought a wig. She also changed her name via deed poll. She says: 'I was so excited to become Leah, I could hardly wait. 'I was living with my grandmother at the time, and she was worried that I would get bullied, but I just didn't care.' With the help of her mother Kim Hood (centre), and the American Civil Liberties Union, an organisation that defends the civil rights of Americans, Leah persuaded the school to let her dress as a woman . Dylan had to attend counselling sessions, where he was diagnosed with gender dysphoria . Outside of school, Leah could finally embrace her true identity, but at school, she still wore baggy jeans and hoodies. During Christmas 2012, Leah wrote to her school, South Panola High School, Mississippi, asking permission to dress as a woman. Shockingly, they told her that they had never heard of transgender, and that school policy stated she had to dress for her gender. 'I was distraught,' Leah says. 'I had six months of school left, and I couldn't bear to face them in baggy jeans and a hoody. 'I just wanted to be the real me.' With the help of her mum, and the American Civil Liberties Union, a non-profit organisation that defends the civil rights of Americans, Leah managed to persuade the school to allow her to dress as a woman. She says: 'People were angry because they thought I was getting special treatment, but I told them I was just fighting for my right to express my true identity.' Pilloried: Leah was greeted at the gates of South Panola High School, Mississippi, by fellow students and parents wearing T-shirts with slogans such as 'You're going to hell' and 'Abomination' Leah, who has been living as a woman for two years, is now working at a deli and saving for gender reassignment surgery, which will cost around $25,000 (£16,000). Leah says: 'My life has been a bit of a rollercoaster, but things are finally starting to settle down. I have a job and a wonderful group of friends. 'I'm now hoping to have my surgery before I am 22. 'Looking back, I don't regret a thing. I only wish my grandmother was still alive, so that she could see how far I've come. She would be so happy to see how I faced the bullies and won. 'All of the names I was called and all of the stares don't mean anything. I'm finally the person I want to be, and no one can take that away from me.' In April this year, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed into law in Mississippi, protecting religious people from legal repercussions if they verbally condemn the lifestyle of LGBT persons. Leah says: 'I think it's crazy. I've heard of people being refused service in restaurants because of their sexuality, but it shouldn't matter who you are!' South Panola High School was approached for comment regarding Leah's treatment, but no response has been provided.","Leah Walton, 19, was born a boy, but always felt unhappy in her body .

"From ski hire to hotels and expensive snow-proof clothing, the costs involved in taking the family skiing can really stack up. Now supermarket chain Aldi has come to the rescue with a range of budget ski gear, that includes £35 jackets and £30 trousers. Indeed, so cheap is the Ski Pro range, the supermarket claims that a family of four can be completely kitted out for just £160. The range challenges the perception that winter sports are expensive, with the firm claiming to save Brits everywhere a fortune . By contrast, a single men's Blade Jacket from ski brand KJus will set you back an eye-watering £1,220, while jackets from Superdry's Snow range can cost up to £224.99. Snow trousers from the same range cost £124.99, making an entire outfit an expensive £300 more than Aldi's offering. Aldi's budget range also includes all the accessories for your time on the slope, with technical gloves priced at just £4.99 and goggles from £7.99. 'Skiing is costly, especially if it's something the whole family enjoys,' commented John Hill, editor of the Good Ski Guide. Equivalent products for winter sports from popular brand Superdry cost considerably more . The Superdry jacket, by no means the most expensive on the market, is still vastly more than the Aldi one . 'Aldi has launched a range that offers best value on the high street with comparable quality to mainstream brands.' Experienced skier Ollie Morris, 23, who visits the French Alps at least twice every winter, was impressed with the range.

Factor in the fact a thermal top costing £3.99, gloves costing 9.99 pounds and socks valued at £3.99 and mothers and fathers can hit the slopes for £54.95 each. Each child then costs £24.96  to kit out - with ski wear at £14.99, socks at £1.99, gloves at £2.99 and thermal wear costing £4.99. Even little ones can join in, with infant snowsuits starting at £9.99. 'The Aldi Specialbuys ski range takes the premium price tag out of what is considered a premium sport,' added Mr Hill. 'Whether shopping for everyday items or hobby equipment within our Specialbuys ranges, we are keen to offer our customers the opportunity to stock up for less without compromising on quality,' said Tony Baines, Joint Managing Director for Corporate Buying at Aldi.

"Tourists heading to Venice will need to budget extra for new baggage thanks to a bizarre new rule. Visitors trundling wheelie suitcases will be fined up to 500 euros, beginning in May 2015. The city's reasoning for the ban? Noise pollution on the historic canal bridges. Time for new luggage! Tourists heading to Venice are now banned from trundling wheelie bags over the historic canals . Any visitor using a rubber-wheeled suitcase will be subject to fines of up to 500 euros . Authorities say that the noise of large tour groups dragging the bags over the bridges keeps local residents awake at night, and ultimately, amounts to noise pollution. Only wheelie suitcases with silent inflated tyres, rather than rubber ones, will be permitted in the lagoon city, under the strict new regulations brought in by the council. The bizarre rule has been brought in by commissioner Vittorio Zappalorto was appointed after the city's mayor was arrested in a corruption scandal. Venetians themselves will be exempt from the regulations which are to come into operation in May next year, Il Gazzettino reported. The news follows a series of attempts to limit the impact of the 20 million tourists that visit Venice every year. This comes after a series of attempts by the city to limit the impact of tourists that visit each year . Earlier this year the city launched a campaign discouraging couples from attaching padlocks to the city's bridges as a symbol of love, claiming the old structures are too fragile to cope with the weight. Workmen this summer removed some 20,000 'love locks' from the Rialto and Accademia bridges. And last year authorities imposed a strict crackdown on water traffic. After a series of complaints about drunkenness, gondoliers are now subject to alcohol and drug tests and must use GPS devices and number plates. Venice City Council said in a statement: 'The rules respond to the needs of many residents who have complained to the authorities in recent years about serious discomfort in their homes linked to the movement of goods at times protected by legislation such as at night and in the early morning.' 'There are also numerous worrying signs of deterioration and wear to paving stones and bridges previously unharmed for hundreds of years.' City official Maurizio Dorigo admitted the rules were currently a little impractical as suitcases with inflatable wheels did not yet exist, as far as he knew. He said: 'Hopefully a company will start producing suitcases with inflatable tyres. We've got till next May. Someone will be able to design and sell them by then.'","Venice City Council passes new rule restricting use of wheelie suitcases .

"Reporter Johan-Matthias Sommarström posted this picture of a young Palestinian boy on Twitter after the boy approached him and said: 'I'm a journalist' This is the face of a young Palestinian boy who has become a picture of strength in Gaza after playing dress-up as a journalist while the ongoing conflict surrounds him. The youngster, believed to be no more than six years old, stands proud in his homemade ‘flax jacket’ and borrowed Press helmet as he poses for the camera. The image was taken by a Swedish radio journalist after the youngster approached him and said: 'I am a journalist. I am reporting on what is happening here, this is my flak jacket.’ Reporter Johan-Matthias Sommarström, who has watched the photo be shared more than 5,500 times since he posted it on Twitter yesterday, said it was a powerful example of the Palestinian child’s strong will to survive. He took the photo after the youngster approached him as he returned to his hotel following an afternoon of reporting in war-torn Gaza city. Mr Sommarström is staying with a number of international journalists who are all following the fighting between Israel and Hamas militants which broke out on July 8. He said he offered his Press hard hat, emblazoned with the word TV, after the young boy walked up to him and said: ‘I am a journalist.’ He then posted the picture on Twitter with the caption: ‘Young boy in #Gaza pretending to be a journalist with his home-made flak jacket, had to lend him my helmet.’ Mr Sommarström said: ‘For a moment he shone with pride. His friends were laughing happily and dancing around him. He got a little embarrassed and then I took the picture.’ The image has received widespread response online and has become one of the most shared pictures from Gaza since the conflict began. ‘Working in war means that you see things you do not want to see. Dead children torn beyond recognition, desperate parents, endless sorrow, destroyed homes,’ Mr Sommarström told Radio Sweden. ‘For me the picture is a powerful example of children's strong will to survive. He has seen us journalists go in and out of the hotel, he has seen that we survive. 'I think that in his pretending play he wants to be like us, someone who survives.’ The image comes just hours after  Israel and Hamas agreed to a 72-hour ceasefire in the conflict which broke out on July 8. Pictured: Thick smoke rises after an Israeli missile strike hit Gaza City on Thursday afternoon . The fighting in Gaza has so far killed more than 1,400 Palestinians and 50 Israelis . Hundreds of people have commented on the image, with many describing it as both heart-warming and heart-breaking. Richard Hoefer ‏said: 'That's sweet! Even in times of such despair, a child's positive imagination is not shut down.Please help him stay alive.' While Hannah Jermy responded: 'So powerful seeing a kid act like a kid in a war zone rather than being portrayed simply as a victim.' And @Libertypixi said: 'A poignant reminder to us all that, they are after all they've been through, still just children.

The young children were talking about the horrible injuries they had seen and how they were used to bombs when the missile landed without warning. The children in a Damascus suburb told the interviewer the horrific injuries they had seen and how they had become used to bombs moments before a shell landed centimetres behind them . The young children raise their hands and then dive to the ground as the shell explodes . The three youngsters - two boys and girl - were thrown to the ground as rubble and dust was sent flying into the air. The camera then shows two other young boys diving down and crawling away from the blast site behind them. The shocking video comes as politicians in Turkey and Iran call for a ceasefire in Syria before scheduled peace talks in January. More than 11,000 children have now been killed in the three-year Syrian civil war according to a report by The Oxford Research Group think tank. It said most were killed in explosions but some were tortured and then killed. The manner in which the children in the . amateur video, filmed by the Baynetna organization, talk about death and . explosions show how common they have become. The footage begins with one of the children telling the interviewer about the bombs he has seen. Two young boys scramble for cover away from bomb site in the rebel-held suburb of Jobar . According to a translation by Channel 4 News, the boy in the cap says: 'We were walking the demonstration when a bomb fell on us and wounded a small boy. 'He was about the size of this girl.' She then says: 'When we were at school, they used to show us lots of martyrs, one had his guts hanging out.' Moments before the blast, the boy in . the cap says: 'At first, the bombs scared us, but then we got used to . it. I saw one persons head fall off. On another, it was his hand.' The . missile then strikes just behind them and as the camera shakes, two . young boys are seen diving to the ground as rubble and dust is blasted . into the air. Fortunately all the children survived and are interviewed later inside. One little boy dives to the ground while the other runs. All the children in the video survived . Their bikes that they had been playing with moments earlier are left behind as they run for safety . One little boy who had been seen leaping to the ground said: 'I dived to the ground. I don't know how. 'Like in a swimming pool. But a stone hit my hand and my cheek hit the pavement, and then we went inside.' The boy in the cap was then asked what his mother did when she found out. He replied with a smile: 'She started to cry.' Today, . Turkey and Iran's foreign ministers called for a ceasefire in Syria . before peace talks scheduled in Geneva on January 22. Turkey's . foreign minister Ahmad Davutoglu and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad . Javad Zarif held a news conference in Tehran today. The six children were interviewed later on and asked about their escape from the blast . This little boy said he dived to the ground 'like in a swimming pool' when the shell landed close to them . Mr . Zarif said: 'All our efforts are to end the conflict and for a . ceasefire if possible, even before the Geneva 2 conference takes place.' Mr Davutoglu said: 'We should not wait for this two months' before the peace conference convenes. 'The Syrian people are in a worsening situation.' Iran and Turkey support opposing sides in the Syrian conflict, but the joint ceasefire call suggests the regional rivals are now more willing to work together. Iran, which along with Russia is the main backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has said it is prepared to take part in the Syria peace talks in Geneva if invited. The Syrian government has said it will attend the talks but will not bow to Western demands for Assad to step aside. Assad's opponents are divided over the peace talks. General Salim Idriss, who commands the rebel Free Syrian Army, said his group would not take part in them and would fight on regardless.","Group told camera they were used to bombs moments before one explodes .

"War hero: Whilst standing guard one night in May 1918, Johnson left four Germans dead and injured at least 20 others, who retreated, saving his regiment . Nearly 100 years after he single-handedly fought off a German attack and saved a comrade from capture despite suffering serious wounds, Sgt. Henry Johnson is a step closer to getting a posthumous Medal of Honor. In an unprecedented move, congress is looking at changing a law that would allow a black World War I soldier from upstate New York who saved a comrade while fighting off a German attack in France, to be honored. A number of congressmen including Chuck Hagel, the secretary of defense, has sent Congress a letter saying Sgt. Henry Johnson should receive the nation's highest military decoration for bravery in combat. The railroad porter from Albany was serving in the all-black 369th Infantry Regiment when he killed or wounded several enemy soldiers while saving a fellow soldier from capture. The president gets the final word on the medal request, which also requires passage of special legislation in Congress because Johnson's actions were more than five years ago. The current legislation specifies that heroic actions have to have taken place within five years to be considered. His men: Johnson (back row, 2nd from right) was a solider in an all-black outfit, the 369th Infantry Regiment, a New York National Guard unit based in Manhattan and known as the Harlem Hell-fighters . The stuff of legend: He almost single- highhandedly fought off his attackers armed only with a rifle and a knife, using the rifle as a club once it had run out of bullets . Remembered: Henry Johnson is displayed in the Arbor Hill neighborhood in Albany, New York. The secretary of defense has recommended awarding a posthumous Medal of Honor to the black soldier from upstate New York who saved a comrade while fighting off a German attack in France during World War I . 'Johnson should have received this recognition 95 years ago, and providing an exemption for him now is the right thing to do,' said Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat. If approved, Johnson would become the 89th black soldier to receive the Medal of Honor and just the second for heroism during World War I, according to the Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Better late thn never: It has been argued that Johnson should receive the Medal Of Honor - the nation's highest military decoration for bravery in combat . Johnson, a Virginia-born rail station porter in Albany, enlisted in the 369th Infantry Regiment, a New York National Guard unit based in Manhattan that became known as the 'Harlem Hellfighters.' With U.S. armed forces segregated at the time, the 369th was assigned to serve under French command when Johnson's outfit arrived on the front lines in early 1918. Around midnight on May 15, 1918, he and another soldier, Needham Roberts of Trenton, New Jersey, were standing guard when their position was attacked by about two dozen Germans. Both Americans were wounded, but despite his injuries the 5ft 4in Johnson fought off the attack, using his knife and rifle to kill or wound several of the enemy who were trying to drag Roberts away. Johnson's actions caused the other Germans to retreat. His actions earned him one of France's highest military medals, but historians believe rampant Jim Crow-era racism at a time when the services were segregated kept Johnson from receiving American military honors. Indeed, accounts of his actions were published in newspapers back home in Albany, as well as in Chicago and New York City. Former President Theodore Roosevelt, in a book he wrote about World War I, listed Johnson among the bravest Americans to serve in the conflict. 'Everybody knew who Henry Johnson was,' said Jack McEneny, a retired state lawmaker and Albany historian who has been advocating Johnson's case for 40 years. 'He was a major source of pride and a realization for the black community and the white community of the value of African-Americans to the loyalty of this country.' Never forget: A statue of Henry Johnson in Washington Park  in Albany, New York. It has been argued that Johnson be awarded the Medal Of Honor nearly 100 years after he single-handedly fought off a German attack . Racist past: Johnson’s legacy went unrecognized because of segregation within the armed forces at the time . After the war, Johnson moved back to Albany, where he resumed working as a porter. Plagued by his wartime injuries, he died a destitute alcoholic at age 32 at a veterans hospital Illinois in 1929. He was believed to have been buried in a pauper's grave, but his final resting place was found in Arlington National Cemetery in 2002. In 2003, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest military honor. Previous attempts to get the Medal of Honor awarded to Johnson were rejected by Pentagon officials citing insufficient contemporary military documentation of his heroics, but in 2011, Schumer's staff found such records. Local tributes: Sgt. Henry Johnson was part of the 369th Regiment, or Harlem Hellfighters - one of the most successful units in the war . Deserving of more: For his heroics, Johnson was awarded one of the French government’s highest honors, the Croix de Guerre. The still heavily segregated U.S., however, gave Johnson only a chauffeured car in New York’s victory parade in 1919 and no awards or military benefits . The U.S. Army reports from May 1918 described how Johnson fought off an enemy attack despite being wounded and outnumbered. Schumer included those documents in Johnson's Medal of Honor application. In 1991, Army Cpl. Freddie Stowers of Sandy Springs, South Carolina, became the first black soldier honored with the Medal of Honor from World War I after two congressmen resurrected his case for the nation's highest military decoration for bravery in combat. The seven black service members awarded the medal for heroics during World War II weren't honored until 1997, after historians and the defense department determined they had wrongly been denied. Johnson's story is already well-known in Albany, where there are two memorials in his honor and a street and a charter school bear his name. This year's awarding of the Medal of Honor to 24 ethnic or minority American soldiers from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars has given hope to McEneny and other advocates that Johnson will finally receive the same recognition. 'Every time another hero is honored belatedly or rediscovered long after the fact, if you're in Albany, it just gnaws at you,' the former legislator said. 'That's great, but what about Henry Johnson?'","Sgt. Henry Johnson was part of the 369th Regiment, or Harlem Hellfighters - one of the most successful units in the war .

"It was designed to be flexible and unite Android devices, but Google’s latest operating system, called Lollipop, is said to be crashing phones and tablets. People who rushed to download Android 5.0 have warned others not to upgrade, after reporting their devices have slowed down, and that some apps have broken or disappeared altogether thanks to the ‘unusable’ update. Google’s new look Android operating system was launched last month to favourable reviews and is designed be used on different devices, even powering smartwatches, TVs and a car. People who rushed to download Android 5.0 Lollipop (illustrated) have warned others not to upgrade, after reporting their devices have slowed down, repeatedly crash and that some apps have broken or disappeared altogether thanks to the ‘unusable’ update . But, since its release, owners of Android devices have taken to forums to complain that it has crippled older tablets and smartphones. The update glitch is affecting people who own Google’s range of Nexus products, including the new Nexus 6 phablet and Nexus 9 tablet, which were unveiled last month alongside Lollipop. Many have reported problems with Wi-Fi connectivity and sound quality, while it’s emerged that apps created with the Adobe Air tool have been removed from some Nexus devices and owners can’t reinstall them. One user told ZDNet that they regret downloading Lollipop, saying that their Nexus 7 tablet is ‘laggy’ and crashes frequently, while others claimed it has ‘ruined’ their tablet and made devices ‘unusable’. People have taken to Adobe’s forum to complain that installing apps built with its Air tool show an error message that reads ‘-505’. Google’s new look Android operating system was launched last to favourable reviews - alonside the Nexus 6 phablet and Nexus 9 tablet (pictured) - and is designed be used on different devices, even powering smartwatches, TVs and a car . Adobe programme manager Chris Campbell wrote that the problem has been passed to Google, suggesting the blame lies with the search giant. He said that Adobe wasn’t aware of a ‘critical’ bug before November 18 and is ‘not working with Google on a fix’. The company is, however, investigating problems in-house. ‘We're going to expand our testing and engineering will be canvassing the forum posts and bug reports for additional clues,’ Mr Campbell said. Lollipop was promised to be a redefining update by Google. The firm's latest Android operating system is designed to be flexible and to be used on different devices. It can now power a watch, TV and even a car. The new Turbo Charger combines with more detailed battery settings, which Google says will lead to longer lasting devices. The battery saver feature extends the life of device by up to 90 minutes. The support for 64-bit processing for the first time on Nexus devices is also an upgrade, with some of Google's native apps like Chrome and Gmail supporting this feature, essentially meaning they will run faster and smoother than before. Songs, photos, apps and recent searches from one Android device are immediately accessible on another. Content responds to people's touch and their voice. The operating system is designed to be more intuitive and better at multi-tasking. For example, users will be able to read an email alongside seeing their inbox. Users can adjust their settings so only notifications from certain people and apps can get through and they will appear on the lockscreen. Devices can be secured using a pin, password or pattern - or now they can be linked to a trusted device like a watch or smart lock. Lollipop is being built into Google's new devices and is available on existing Nexus 5,7 and 10 devices. A Google spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We're aware of reports that some Android users are facing issues and are looking into what might be the cause.’ Before a fix is announced, it’s suggested that people who have downloaded Lollipop should check which apps are running in the background and close any they’re not using to maximise performance. ‘If users have downloaded the Lollipop update, having been prompted to do so from their device, and it has rendered their device unusable, our customer services team is standing by to help, and we recommend they contact them on 0800 328 6081,’ Google’s spokesman said. There is also information on a number of forums that suggest people can revert back to Android 4.4 KitKat.","People who have downloaded Android 5.0 are warning others not to do so .

"A Texas university student has been shot dead by a campus police officer during a routine traffic stop. Robert Cameron Redus, 23, was killed when Corporal Chris Carter, 35, opened fire on him in the early hours of Friday morning a few blocks away from the University of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio where Redus studied, set to graduate in May. Investigators say an altercation began when Carter tried to pull Redus over for speeding and driving erratically. College shooting: Cameron Redus was killed after a campus cop shot him multiple times during a traffic stop . Under investigation: The parking lot of Redus' apartment block where he died is cordoned off by police . Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department told KSAT that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Tree House apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where Redus was a resident. Redus, known to friends by his second name Cameron, had spent the evening celebrating the end of semester with classmates. According to Pruitt, Carter tried to pull him over on Broadway for driving erratically, despite the fact that Redus was off-campus. It is not clear where Carter first tried to pull Redus over, but both vehicles drove north on Broadway until they pulled into the parking lot of the Treehouse Apartments. Once there, both got out of their cars and some kind of struggle ensued. Pruitt told My San Antonio that Carter radioed for help shortly before Redus was shot. A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Crime scene: Police investigate the street outside Cameron's apartment, where he was shot dead . Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May . Gentle: Cameron Redus, who was described by friends as not being aggressive, was shot five times by a campus cop . Mohammad Haidarasl lives directly below Redus at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between Redus and Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less than a minute later, Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' Carter has been placed on administrative leave while officers investigate the shooting. University officials describe him as having 'extensive law enforcement background.' According to records viewed by My San Antonio, Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. Devastated: Friends Sarah Davis (left) and Annie Jones (right) speak of their disbelief at the shooting of Cameron Redus . Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot . He rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his career. Officers investigating the incident haven't attempted to contact Haidrasl about what he heard, Haidrasl told My San Antonio. Back in Redus' hometown of Baytown, the promising student's mother, father, brothers and friends are struggling to understand their loss. 'We are understandably devastated by the death of our dear son Cameron and we ask for your prayers as we deal with our tragic loss. We trust that God is faithful and will see us through this most difficult time,' the victim's family said in a statement. Redus old friends from high school were shocked to hear the news. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' 'He was an honor student, dean’s list every semester, incredibly intelligent,' said Annie Jones. 'So, so, so smart. He was our co-valedictorian in high school.' A vigil has been set for 7pm on Saturday at the University of the Incarnate Word grotto. According to ABC, Redus' family has hired an attorney.","University student Cameron Redus, 23, was shot and killed by a campus police officer .

"A mother tragically died of a complication during childbirth after opting for a caesarian section that saved her newborn but cost her own life. As Karisa Bugal, 34, a mother of two, went into labour doctors discovered she was suffering a rare and dangerous condition called amniotic fluid embolism. Her unborn son's heart rate began to dip, meaning his life was at risk, prompting Mrs Bugal to elect to have a caesarian - the fastest option for his delivery. Tragic: Karisa Bugal chose to have a caesarian section to save the life of her unborn son, but in so doing sacrificed her own life. She had just enough strength to ask how much he weighed before she passed . While a delay could have saved her life, it would have cost him his. She passed away shortly after he was born, with just enough strength to ask how much he weighed as she was wheeled to intensive care. Declan Jay Bugal was born weighing a healthy 7lb 4oz. It was a day before his mother's eighth wedding anniversary. Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare and not well understood obstetric emergency where amniotic fluid, of hair, cells or other debris from the foetus gets into the mother's bloodstream and triggers an allergic reaction. Affecting between one and 12 in every 100,000 mothers during delivery, it leads to organ failure, heart and lung collapse and profuse bleeding that will not clot. Dr Kelly Gerow of the Medical Center of Aurora told KUSA: 'We don't know how to prevent it. We don't know how to keep it from happening at all.' It was Dr Gerow who explained to Mrs Bugal the grim prognosis she faced during labour. 'Her other option would have been to stay awake for her surgery, but by the time we would have put in a spinal tap or something it's possible Declan would not have made it,' the doctor said.

It describes the moment Mrs Bugal, survived by her son, her toddler daughter Mallory and her husband Wes, made her choice. 'The medical staff informed Karisa of the Embolism and the immediate danger it would pose,' it says. 'She chose to have them perform an emergency C-section so Declan could be born sacrificing her own body and ultimately her life to save his. 'Karisa was concious of Declan being born just before the Doctors were forced to take her to the ICU. She simply asked ""How big is he?""' Mr Bugal told KUSA he now faces the challenge of bringing up a newborn and toddler alone. 'How do I explain to him that his mom is gone giving birth to him? I think about that all the time,' he said. 'How do I explain when he asks where's mommy?'","Karisa Bugal suffered an amniotic fluid embolism as she was in labour .

Most of us have no idea how many calories our favourite drinks contain. In a bid to highlight the fattening effect, the Royal Society of Public Health has decided to highlight these drink-food equivalents . The survey of 2,000 adults was carried out for the Royal Society for Public Health. It found that three-quarters  of the public did not know - or wrongly guessed - the calories in a large glass of wine. Nine out of 10 had no idea what a pint of lager contained. A PINT OF LAGER – 180 CALORIES – SMALL SLICE OF CHOCOLATE CAKE . LARGE WHITE WINE (250ml) – 185 CALORIES – 4 FISH FINGERS . PINA COLADA WITH RUM – 644 CALORIES – BIG MAC BURGER . ALCOPOP – 237 CALORIES – SLICE OF PIZZA . DOUBLE VODKA AND TONIC – 143 CALORIES – CHOCOLATE CUSTARD DONUT . This is despite the fact that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol. As a result, two out of three people said they want calorie labels on alcohol. Alcoholic beverages are currently not recognised as food and are therefore exempted, under existing European legislation, from normal food labelling. Around 56 calories are contained in a unit of alcohol, which is a small glass of low-strength wine. The recommended daily calorie intake for adults is approximately 2,500 calories for men and 2,000 for women. However, as the new report points out, extra calories aren't just consumed at the time of drinking - there's the effect the day after, too, with 'carb cravings' and weaker willpower. Shirley Cramer CBE, Chief Executive of the RSPH, said: 'With 2 in 3 adults overweight or obese and given that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol, this move could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation.’ In a bid to highlight how many calories popular drinks contain, the RSPH has released a food comparison table. It reveals that a pint of lager, which contains an average of 180 calories, is roughly equivalent to a small slice of chocolate cake. A large 250ml glass of white wine is the same as four fish fingers, while an alcopop equates to a slice of pizza. A pina colada, on the other hand, packs away the same number of calories as a Big Mac. The RPSH gives exercise comparisons, too. To burn off two pints of lager would take 30 minutes of running, while two double Baileys would need an hour of cycling to whittle away. Two thirds of people polled for the survey agreed they wanted calorie labels on alcohol . At the more outrageous end of the scale, one frozen margarita would apparently take more than seven hours of sex to burn off. As part of the poll, the RSPH also conducted an experiment in a pub - to find out if displaying calories on drinks menus changed drinking behaviour. Over 80 per cent of the public did not know - or incorrectly estimated - the calorie content of a large glass of wine, which is around 160 calories. Almost 60 per cent did not know - and a further 30 per cent incorrectly estimated - the calories in a pint of lager, which is as much as 180 calories. People presented with calorie information consumed on average 400 calories less than those unaware of the calorie content of their drinks, the researchers found. The RSPH is now calling on the drinks industry and newly appointed EU Health Commissioner to introduce calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks. The European Commission says it will make a decision by December on extending nutrition labelling including calories on alcoholic products. Shirley Cramer said: ‘Calorie labelling has been successfully introduced for a wide range of food products and there is now a clear public appetite for this information to be extended to alcohol to help individuals make informed choices. Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, told BBC Breakfast: 'Calorie labelling is a great idea and we know it does help some people improve their calorie intake, but for others of us, we don't notice it, so calorie labelling is one of a number of things that can be helpful. 'Alcohol itself is quite calorific, it is almost as calorific as fat, which people don't realise. 'Sometimes you think of drinks as not being part of your calorie intake when in fact they are. There isn't anything low calorie about alcohol at all. 'If you think, if you have a couple of glasses of wine with a meal that's like having an extra course.'","Survey found 75% have no idea how many calories in a glass of wine .

"A budding young movie-maker who secretly film the unappetizing meals being served up at his elementary school has seen his results become an award-winning documentary. New York City public school student Zachary Maxwell, now 11, started filming his school lunches in the fall of 2011 because of a dispute with his parents about whether or not he should be allowed to take lunch to school. While his parents wanted him to eat the school’s lunches, which sounded appetizing on the school’s menu, Zachary wanted to prove that the menus weren't accurate. Scroll down for video . New York City public school student Zachary Maxwell started filming his school lunches to show his parents that they weren't nutritious . In the movie Zachary claims the school salads don't include the variety of ingredients that celebrity chefs such as Rachel Ray suggest they do . Find out more at yuckmovie.com . Over a six month period, Zachary sneaked a video camera into his school cafeteria and filmed his less-than-appetizing meals. With help from his father, those undercover reports were turned in a 20-minute film called ‘Yuck: A 4th Grader’s Short Documentary About School Lunch.’ ‘The city’s Department of Education says . that it’s committed to providing “delicious and nutritious meals . through their food service program.” But the lunch being served at my . school was nothing like what they were advertising on their website,’ says Zachary in the trailer for his film. The documentary has already won the budding young filmmaker, who goes by his first and middle names, several film festival awards and it is set to be screened at the Manhattan Film Festival next month. His project was almost derailed at one point after he was caught filming without his teacher¿s permission . Since the film's release, Zachary has been asked to serve as an adviser to the New York City Department of Education's Office of School Food and brings his school lunch from home . The film is highly entertaining and reveals Zachary to be a mix of guerrilla film-maker Michael Moore and healthy food crusader Jamie Oliver. In one clip Zachary talks about how the education department enlisted the help of celebrity chefs including Rachel Ray and Ellie Krieger to create appetizing healthy options, but then he shows the limp salads the school was serving which didn’t feature the ingredients the chefs had recommended. A spokesperson for the school board has . accused Zachary of doctoring footage by selectively serving himself . lunches that didn’t include certain elements.

"For many people keeping their car fit and healthy is something that generally gets forgotten until it’s time for a service. But an app could keep your vehicle ship shape by using a sensor to detect any problems with the car. Called Fixd, it will also let you know how much the repairs will cost you and what will happen if they are not addressed, such as the car's fuel efficiency decreasing. Georgia-based Fixd is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter. Their app and sensor combo can be used to determine when a car is 'sick'. The sensor attaches to an OBD-II port available on most modern cars (shown). This then connects to an app via Bluetooth that keeps the user updated on how their car is doing . The Georgia-based company’s system consists of a vehicle sensor and an app. For many people living in towns and cities, growing flowers, fruits or vegetables is out of the question. But a team of inventors from San Francisco has unveiled a device that makes it possible, via an indoor greenhouse called Niwa that can be controlled by a smartphone. By connecting their phone to the greenhouse, people will be able to grow fruit and vegetables in their homes without needing access to a garden. The indoor gadget uses a built-in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth. The glass-sided device uses special sensors to pick up these readings, which then automatically activate different parts of the machine. And the device warms up, cools down, turns on a light or waters the plants autonomously without input from the user. The sensor, which will cost £30 ($50), plugs into the On-Board Diagnosticics-II (OBD-II) port, which almost all modern cars have. Hardware within the sensor monitors the car and checks for any problems, and it then connects to the app on a smartphone via Bluetooth. The company is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter. Through the app users will see when they need an oil change, when the air filter needs replacing and so on. When attached the sensor is powered by the car, meaning it doesn’t need a battery. Multiple sensors can also be placed on different cars, with the app using a multi-vehicle feature to check up on all of them. If repairs are needed the app will show how much the cost to fix the car will be, perhaps using crowdsourcing in future to find cheaper deals. And it will also estimate how issues could affect the car. 'We want to give you confidence when dealing with repair shops,' the company writes on Kickstarter. 'We want to give you peace of mind over all the cars that you own. We want you to turn to FIXD when you are having car troubles.' The app will be available from October this year for Android, with an iPhone version due to be released in April 2015. And over the next year various features of the app, such as repair estimates and multi-vehicle control, will be rolled out. The app includes features such as telling you the status of your airbags (left) and whether the car needs an oil change. A multi-vehicle feature (right) also lets a user keep track of multiple cars at once . The £30 ($50) sensor will be available later this year, while the app will be available for Android in October and for iPhone in May 2015, with various features to be rolled out over the next year .","Georgia-based Fixd is currently seeking funding on Kickstarter .

"A teenager is set to be one of the youngest pilots ever to fly passengers on a major airline after he was offered at job with Ryanair at the age of just 19. Ryan Irwin, from Wirral, Merseyside, was offered a job with the budget carrier after qualifying as a pilot from the prestigious Oxford Aviation Academy. After he completes his training with Ryanair in September, he will fulfil a life-long dream when he finally sits at the controls in the cockpit of an international commercial passenger jet. A real high flyer: Ryan Irwin outside the Oxford Aviation Academy. At just 19 years old he is set to become one of the youngest ever commercial airline pilots after he was offered a job with budget carrier Ryanair . The sky is now quite literally the limit for the youngster, who said he is thrilled by the prospect of lying passengers to more than a thousand holiday destinations in Europe. 'It sounds clichéd but it's what I've wanted to do ever since I can remember, as young as four or five,' said Mr Irwin, a former pupil of Wirral Grammar School. 'I had model planes and pestered my parents to take me to the viewing lounge at Manchester Airport.' After qualifying from the pilot training academy in Oxford in February Mr Irwin applied for jobs straight away and soon received offers from both Ryanair and Jet2, another budget airline. 'To have the cockpit of a jet as your office is pretty exciting': A Ryanair plane takes off from Barcelona, Spain, one of more than a thousand destinations that Mr Irwin's new job could take him too . 'We were told it can take a while to get a job after graduating, so to have two job offers when you aren't expecting one was a surprise,' he said. 'Ryanair got back to me first, it was a no brainer really. 'The most exciting part will be flying a jet for the first time, and to have the cockpit of a jet as your office everyday is pretty exciting. 'It will be interesting to see what people think about my age.'","Ryan Irwin from Merseyside has just qualified from Oxford Aviation Academy .

"Female students were banned from speaking at a 'degrading' university seminar at a top London university, it has emerged. Women attending the class at Queen Mary University were also forced to walk through a 'sisters only' entrance before taking their seats at the event which was held by the university's Islamic society. The event last month forced female attendees to write down their questions for Ustadh Abu Abdillah, while male students raised their hands to be addressed by the speaker. Students at a University of Leicester seminar were segregated, with male attendees taking front row seats while female students sat yards behind them . One woman who was present at the event titled Deception of the Dunya described the experience as 'degrading'. She told the Sunday Times: 'Its not just about segregation but also about how they're treating women.' 'It's one thing to be segregated but a whole other thing being told we are not allowed to speak and men being told not to look at woman,' said the Arts student who wished to remain anonymous for fear of being attacked for her views. The devout Muslim said the experience was 'embarrassing', before adding: 'You just want to shake them and say ""Why are you being so disrespectful?""'. A spokesman for the university said: 'Segregated events are not in line with Queen Mary's values or equality policy. 'We will be raising this with our . students' union as this should extend to student society-organised . events with external speakers such as this one.' A student at the seminar held at Queen Mary University (pictured) said the experience was 'degrading' Earlier this week it was revealed female . students at the University of Leicester were forced to sit rows behind . male peers at a similar seminar where attendees directed questions to a . guest speaker from a hardline Islamist group. David Cameron weighed in on segregation at university events this week describing it as 'absolutely not the right approach' Front . row seats were reserved for male students at the Call of Duty course in . Leicester, where guest speaker Saleem Chagtai took questions on Dawah - . a word Muslims use to mean ‘preaching’ or ‘invitation to Islam’. Mr . Chagtai from the Islamic Education and Research Academy said: 'Separate . seating for men and women is not something we ever enforce. ‘It happens naturally and if Muslim women were disadvantaged they would be the first to complain.' Last week the controversy over gender segregation prompted the Prime Minister to intervene. Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m absolutely clear that there should not be segregated audiences for visiting speakers to universities in Britain. 'That is not the right approach, the guidance should say that universities should not allow this.’ Earlier this week Universities UK – the vice-chancellors’ association – backed down from guidelines it had previously given that apparently allowed campus Islamic societies to impose segregated seating at meetings. The guidelines have been withdrawn while Universities UK consults with the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the appropriate position. It is expected to be forced to back down permanently.","Female students had to write questions down at Islamic society event .

"X-Men director Bryan Singer has been accused of committing a new sexual assault against a man in his 20s in New York City last year, according to the New York Police Department. The criminal complaint was filed with the NYPD on May 9, 2014, alleging that Singer forced the man into a sexual act in New York against his will on March 23, 2013 according to Buzzfeed. However, while no charges have been filed against the well-known Hollywood director, law enforcement officials said an investigation has been launched. Allegations: Bryan Singer has been accused of committing a  sexual assault against a man in his 20s in New York City last year . It’s not the first time that the hit movie maker has faced allegations of sexual assault against boys. Two civil lawsuits alleged that Singer had sexually assaulted teenage boys – but both have recently been dropped. The first, filed in May, by an unnamed British man known as ‘John Doe 117’ claimed that Singer had drugged and sexually assaulted him in a London hotel when he was a teenager. The man withdrew the case in July 2014. The second case against Singer was filed in April by former aspiring actor Michael Egan, 31, in which he accused him of sexually abusing him during trips to Hawaii when he was 17. Accuser: Michael Egan III, dropped his lawsuit against director Bryan Singer on Wednesday . But he dropped the case on Wednesday after reportedly being unable to find a lawyer who would represent him. In 1997, a . 14-year-old extra accused Singer of asking him and other minors to film . a shower scene in the nude for the film Apt Pupil. A lawsuit was filed but dismissed for insufficient evidence. According to Singer’s Twitter feed, he was in New York and Jersey on March 23, the date the most recent assault is alleged to have taken place. He tweeted: 'Reviewing previs on way back to Montreal. Got out of NYC before the storm,' from what appears to be to be a private plane. In another tweet he was pictured outside a Denville Dairy and wrote: 'In Jersey, visiting the folks.' Tweet: On March 23, Singer tweeted 'Reviewing previs on way back to Montreal. Got out of NYC before the storm' Tweet: According to Singer's Twitter feed, he was 'In Jersey visiting the folks' on March 23 . The complaint filed against Singer is described as a ‘criminal sexual act.’ Under New York law, a ‘criminal sexual act’ usually relates to an adult having sex with someone who is underage. Singer’s lawyer, Martin Singer, told Buzzfeed: ‘Neither my client nor any of his representatives have been contacted by the NYPD, or anyone else about an alleged criminal investigation of my client. ‘My client did not engage in any criminal or inappropriate behavior with anyone in New York or elsewhere.’ He added: ‘False investigations are filed all the time and no action is taken by the authorities.’ Singer is a prolific filmmaker and has directed big budget Hollywood films which include Superman Returns and The Usual Suspects. His most recent film, X-Men: Days of Future Past, was released in May and has grossed more than $744 million worldwide.","The NYPD said a criminal complaint had been filed against Bryan Singer on May 9, 2014 .

"More than £70million of British aid to Egypt has been lost to  corruption, waste and fruitless projects. The cash was part of a £500million drive by the European Union to promote democracy and human rights in Egypt over the past seven years. In a shocking report, the European Court of Auditors said the EU had naively handed over the money with almost no checks on how it would be spent. The Luxembourg based group also found the huge figure had not helped to improve the rights of women and minorities or fight corruption. The report said there had been no improvement in the promotion of democracy under President Morsi . The ECA looked at the past five years of EU aid payments to Egypt, which amounted to more than €1 billion. The report focused on the 60 per cent of EU aid to Egypt - worth £500 million over five years - which is handed over to support its state budget. The auditors found that there was no trace of how that money had been spent. Karel Pinxten, the senior official who led the audit, said: 'There is no audit trail once the budget has been transferred. There is no way that we can check.' The audit found that large areas of the Egyptian budget are murky and military and presidential spending is not declared, according to The Times. The report also found the state holds around €4 billion of annual expenditure in secret 'special funds'. Mr Pinxten added: 'No-one knows what this money is being used for.' He added that there had been no improvement in the promotion of democracy or governance under the Muslim-led Government of President Morsi. He said: 'There was a problem with Mubarak. This problem is worsening. That is very clear.' The auditors' report - which looked at the past five years - questioned the whole policy of EU aid to Egypt . The report's authors even questioned the whole policy of EU aid to Egypt. Asked if the policy was wrong, Mr Pinxten said: 'That might be the case.' The review was also critical of the European External Action Service (EEAS) - the EU department which administers spending in Egypt. It found that it had failed to introduce conditions that would improve the country's management of its public finances. It read: 'There was some exchange of information on anti-corruption initiatives but regular calls for co-operation from both sides were not followed up by concrete actions.' The organisation also 'failed to tackle key human rights issues' after Egypt’s Arab Spring uprising, the auditors found. The report added: 'Women’s and minorities’ rights were not given sufficient attention in the review which followed, despite the critical need for urgent action to counter the tide of growing intolerance.' The report will fuel long-standing criticism over the way EU aid policy. The ECA said the EU should insist on making its aid conditional on clearly defined reforms and will encourage moves by the European Parliament to have aid to Egypt suspended. A spokesman for the European Commission said aid to Egypt had been ‘effectively suspended’ because of concerns, but criticised the report for failing to take its point of view on board. The spokesman said: ‘These programmes are there to support social and economic development but they are conditional and performance-based and that is why they have been effectively suspended since 2012. 'Due to the slow-down of reforms in Egypt and on-going problems in recent years no new Budget Support Programmes have been approved for Egypt since 2012. ‘We submitted an unprecedented set of comments to the Court of Auditors ahead of this report and regret that many of them were not taken on board.’","Report found 'no audit trail' for £500 million in EU aid given to country .

"Scotland's vote for independence could have direct implications for Australia, with perhaps the biggest one being a change to the national flag. Should Scots vote 'Yes' in today's referendum, the British flag could well lose the white cross of St Andrews which forms the base of the British Union Jack. That would mean a complete redesign of the British flag. If that happens, it's likely to spark calls for Australia to change its flag too. Scroll down for video . This is how the Australian flag would look without Scotland's cross of St Andrew . The Union Jack without the Scottish St Andrews Cross . Even if Australia was to consider change, it would likely be after both New Zealand and Fiji, which both currently also have the Union Jack in the top left corner. Both countries have Federal elections this month and key candidates have already flagged their intentions to push for change. The problem, according to the experts, is that unlike the Kiwis, Australians have not yet been able to settle on one design, despite many years of trying to find an alternative. This 1993 design by Tony Burton won a Channel 9 competition and was third in Ausflag's flag design competition in the same year . This effort by David Couzens was first pick by viewers of Channel 9 . Tony Burton, from Flags Australia, says this is his take on making the Southern Cross more prominent . Flags Australia reported that this 1994 flag design by 'Harold Scruby - is a kangaroo in Aboriginal colours. It was voted the third best in an internet poll associated with Ausflag's 1997-2000 design competition' 'If the Union Jack was to be changed from its current design, you'd take out the very foundation of the whole flag and be left with a collection of crosses on a white field - there would be some awkwardness and embarrassment about that I am sure,' said Tony Burton of Flags Australia. 'Whether other countries with the Union Jack would change their own is the question. 'But one option is to change it with black and green, the colours of the Cornish and Welsh and you would have a hybrid mix that would look simply awful.' His colleague Ralph Kelly said: 'If the UK could change its flag, which has been going around for 400 years, you'd be right in saying that would neutralise any argument that we cannot because we've had it for 100 years'. 'This would be another reason to re-examine the issue but any change would require the leadership of the Prime Minister, and the last PM to support change was Paul Keating, until he discovered the referendum.' David White from the College of Arms, the authority which administers flags for the UK and other parts of the Commonwealth, doesn't believe it will cause any problems. 'I can't see that this would have any effect on the version of the Union Flag which appears in the flag of the Commonwealth of Australia,' Mr White said. This flag (above) by franck Gentil won Ausflag's Professional Design Competition in 2000 . Alan Wright's design (above) has had plenty of support since it was unveiled in 1983 . Mr Burton added that Australia's inability to agree on a design which best defines the country is a significant issue. 'I haven't seen anything yet in the many Australian competitions, and frankly the one that stands out still is the Eureka flag - it is a very powerful flag and anyone who has been to Ballarat knows how strong a symbol it is,' he said. 'The Eureka flag means something because of its history but white stars on white bars are a nonsense, there would have to be the work done. But Tony Buton said none of the alternatives compare to the Eureka flag. He described it as 'powerful' Mr Burton believes, however, New Zealand and Fiji are likely to move quickly, with prime ministers in both countries raising the issue. 'Frank Bainimarama made a new Fijian flag one of his election promises and John Key said that if he is returned in New Zealand's election soon, that the flag question would be looked at and the Opposition Leader agrees,' added Mr Burton. For Australia to make any move, it could only happen by way of a national vote or a change to the Flag Act. Frank Bainimarama has made a new flag a key plank of his election promises leading up to Fiji's general election . New Zealanders are likely to vote on whether they want a new flag soon, as both Prime Minister John Key and Opposition counterpart Phil Goff have both thrown their support behind change. Pro-republicans have weighed into the argument too, suggesting the push by Scotland serves as a lesson for Australians to have courage in the face of change, irrespective of whether the YES vote wins or not. Academics agree that this 'once in a lifetime opportunity' will have international ramifications. 'The move to independence by Scotland is a much bigger step than Australia moving to a republic, so a yes vote success with mass celebrations is quite likely to be infectious among nationalistic movements,' Professor Gerry Simpson of Melbourne University said. 'It could well very be contagious when people recognise just how large the consequences are for Scotland.' Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull was once chairman of the Australian Republican Movement but his boss, Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) remains a staunch monarchist . However, the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) said the Scotland vote should have no bearing down under. 'There is one parallel however, that an awful scare campaign has been waged there too, as it was here during our referendum,' said ARM national director David Morris. 'We need to be having our own debate now and for the next couple of years, so there's real information out there in the general public. 'There needs to be bi-partisan support, which we don't have at the moment, but only then will we be able to have a true vote, although this winner-take-all system is still not the answer as far as I'm concerned.' David Morris of the Australian Republican Movement says the only point of comparison between the Scottish vote and Australia's 1999 republican referendum is 'an awful scare campaign' against the yes vote . ARM has confirmed that a new push has started, some 15 years after a referendum on the republic was put to the Australian people - it was lost 55 to 45 per cent. 'The question has to be right, so we are of the view that random deliberative groups should be selected to discuss the real issues,' Mr Morris said. 'If there are concerns about losing our British heritage, let's fix that into the constitution, if there is a worry about not being part of the Commonwealth, let's put it in that we still remain in it. 'We need agreement on a true head of state, someone who truly works for and represents the country.' Mr Morris also said that 'rather than look to Scotland's result we should look a close look at Ireland, a country we have very close ancestral ties with, as a great example of how presidents of a strong republic can lead and inspire and bring together a nation'. 'Times have changed, and so have we. Our place in the world is secure and we are proud of who we have become. 'We are one of the greatest nations, have one of the best democratic systems and have proved how capable we are.' The countdown is on! Crowds gather in George Square, Scotland for one of the final pro-independence rallies . University of NSW Business School professor, Richard Holden expects the uncertainty created by a win for the Yes vote will spell big changes in the Aussie dollar's value against the pound. Despite the serious nature of the Scottish vote, it hasn't stopped some taking to social media to put a humorous spin on the push for independence . Even Tony Burton agrees the identity issue needs dealing with before the flag debate is had. 'I think Australians have got to work out who we really are then if the flag measures up,' he said. There are other possible repercussions. A yes vote for Scottish independence could mean a stronger Aussie dollar against the British Pound. That boost to the currency would likely translate into fewer Brits travelling Down Under. Further, it's feared there'd be an adverse impact on resources exports and that Aussie wine sales would drop.

He said while it's difficult to predict, the Australian dollar could rise 10 to 20 per cent against the pound from its current level of about 55.7 British pence. 'The pound and the Aussie dollar are one of the world's most commonly traded currency pairs, due to our shared heritage,' he said. 'The biggest Australian exports to the UK are gold, coal, lead and alcoholic beverages, like wine - those would be the ones most likely to be affected.' A weaker pound would also make trips from Britain to Australia much more expensive and less appealing.

Is the Empire in peril? A YES supporter dressed as Star Wars character Darth Vader makes his thoughts clear . At least 620,000 Brits visit each year (second only to New Zealand) generating almost $3.5 billion for the Australian economy. Professor Holden said changes in currency values have impacted tourism flows of other countries in the past. 'When the yen has been stronger that's been associated with more tourism from Japan,' he said. 'With the US and Canada, changes in the exchange rate seem to have an impact on tourism between the two countries.' Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie said financial markets' jitters could last several years, if Scotland votes for independence. 'Essentially what Scotland will start to do is the negotiation process whereby it becomes and independent nation,' he said. 'We're talking about 300-plus years of history being un-stitched, that's not something that can happen overnight.' If the 'yes' vote gets over the line, Scotland would become independent in 2016 and it will, at least initially, keep the British pound as its currency.","Australia's flag includes the Union Jack, which is made up of the red St George's Cross, the Scottish St Andrew's Cross and the St Patrick's saltire of Ireland .

"An undocumented Harvard University student was recently granted access to re-enter the U.S. after making the desperate decision to cross the border into Mexico to see his dying mother. Film student Dario Guerrero Meneses, 21, has been stranded in mexico for weeks after his mother's passing but on Tuesday he received the happy news that U.S. Customs would be allowing him back into the country as soon as next week. 'The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service did a great thing just a few minutes ago and they granted and approved Dario's humanitarian parole visa request so he can return to America. He should be back in America in a few days,' Guerrero's lawyer, Alan Klein, told ABC News. In limbo: Dario Guerrero, center, poses with his grandparents Dario Guerrero Garrido and Crescencia Garcia Vazquez at their home in the outskirts of Mexico City, where the Harvard junior has been living since the summer because the US government has barred him from returning home . Son's duty: Dario, left, accompanied his undocumented mother, Rocio Meneses Diaz, right, to a clinic in Mexico in a last-ditch effort to find a treatment for her terminal cancer . The Harvard junior  was faced with an impossible choice this summer: his mother's life or his immigration status. Dario was brought to the US as a toddler by his undocumented parents, and was desperate to find a treatment for his terminally ill mother that he decided to take her to a clinic in Mexico without waiting for permission from US immigration officials. For Rocio Meneses Diaz, Dario's mother, the chemotherapy stopped working last spring, as did the radiation. Doctors had already removed one of her kidneys. So her son did what any computer-savvy kid might do for a dying parent — he searched online and jumped into action. Guerrero found clinics offering alternative treatments in Mexico and took his mother across the border, hoping to keep her alive. In an immigration system where even the smallest mistake can bring dire consequences, Guerrero knowingly broke a rule by leaving the US without federal authorization. 'He panicked. His dad and mom wanted him to go, and he did the best thing he thought he could do for his family,' said his lawyer Alan Klein. Guerrero had lived in the United States illegally since he was 2. His parents brought him from Mexico City to California, and they overstayed tourist visas. He breezed through school, earning a scholarship to a John Hopkins University summer school program at 13. Eventually, along with hundreds of thousands of other young immigrants, he was granted a temporary reprieve from the threat of deportation under a 2012 Obama administration order. The catch: If these immigrants ever leave the US without government approval, they lose their protected status. Guerrero was at his mother's side when she died weeks later. But now, instead of cramming for exams, the film studies major is stuck at his grandparents' house in a gang-ridden suburb of Mexico City, hoping to persuade the US government to let him come home. Real-life drama: Dario, a film major, records his surroundings with a video camera on the rooftop of his grandparents' home in the gang-controlled outskirts of Mexico City . In a phone interview with MailOnline Tuesday evening, Mr Klein revealed that the US government has just approved Dario’s humanitarian parole, clearing the way for him to return home in about a week. Klein said he has been unable to reach his client to give him the good news because his cellphone had been stolen by hostile locals in Mexico, but he is certain Dario 'will be stoked.' Guerrero will spend the next few days arranging the transportation of his mother’s body back to Long Beach for burial. According to the attorney, the 21-year-old soon will be reunited with his girlfriend, who is pregnant with the couple’s first child, and he likely will be able to return to Harvard. Klein pointed out that the Ivy League school has been very helpful and supportive of the student throughout the entire ordeal. Alan Klein explained to MailOnline that in June, Dario applied for advance parole, which is a permission for an undocumented immigrant to leave and re-enter the US, but in July his application was still pending. Dario Guerrero did not know he could expedite his request, according to Mr Klein, so when he had not heard from immigration by mid-July, he decided to go to Mexico anyway. 'My mom had a lot of ups and downs,' Dario told the Associated Press. 'The decision to actually leave was made overnight.' His lawyer, Alan Klein, told MailOnline: ‘He did what he had to do to take care of his family,’ said the lawyer, adding that as an undocumented immigrant, Dario’s mother did not have access to top-notch medical care in the US. ‘This young man is a hero,’ Klein said. ‘This kid is everything we want from someone who wants to come to the United States… he is the reason why we have the Statue of Liberty.’ Tale as old as time: Dario's parents, pictured with him as a boy, emigrated to the US when he was 2 and only told him they were undocumented when he started taking college courses . Any immigrants with pending cases need permission to go abroad, which is not difficult to get eventually, if their requests are deemed valid. But those who do not wait for sometimes slow responses are considered to have voluntarily given up their effort to remain in the US. Advocates say it should be easier for immigrants who have lived in the US for many years to get permission to travel. But no such provisions were included in last year's immigration reform bills, and they aren't expected to be included in any executive action President Barack Obama might announce later this year. Rocio Meneses Diaz died August 14 at the age of 41 at her oldest brother's house in the central state of Guanajuato. Guerrero's 16-year-old brother also was by her side. As a US-born citizen, he is allowed to travel freely. Their father, a building contractor in the US illegally, stayed behind at the family's Long Beach home with their 9-year-old sister. Guerrero says he regrets his rash decision most of all because he thinks his mother would have been happier living her final days in Southern California with her husband and children, 'but then we still had hope — and if we delayed that treatment any longer because of immigration issues, I don't think I would have been able to forgive myself.' Guerrero's parents had kept his immigration status secret for years. They came clean only when he began taking community-college engineering classes while still in high school, and the Social Security number his parents submitted bounced back. Before her death, Guerrero's mom opened up about the past and her reasons for leaving Mexico: Her father had been kidnapped twice; her father-in-law and other relatives faced extortion; armed thieves broke into her clothing and jewelry store, holding a knife to her stomach. Guerrero recorded her stories and her struggle with kidney cancer, hoping to turn it into a documentary back at school. Instead, he's passing time in a room next to a garage just big enough to fit his twin bed and bureau. A picture of his mother and a single rose hang above the bed. His grandparents rent out the nearest bathroom during weekends for a pop-up street market. Guerrero sees his cousins after they get off work, and 'writes poetry and stuff' at night. Former Harvard lecturer Eoin Cannon, who taught history to Guerrero,  described him as 'one of the most thoughtful and creative and original students that I had the pleasure of teaching,' and 'an exceptional writer.' Guerrero tackled homelessness in a student film, and later co-produced A Dream Deferred - a documentary about other immigrants like himself at Harvard. Impossible choice: Guerrero could have waited for a special authorization to travel abroad with his mother, but the process was taking a long time - the one thing his dying parent did not have . All in vain: Mrs Meneses Diaz, seen in a picture behind Dario, passed away in August, and when her son tried to re-enter the US, he was turned back . 'He's as American as anyone I know,' Cannon said. 'The law needs to sort of recognize that and have a mechanism for accounting for that ... For the law not to be able to handle his kind of case is hurting America.' Dario's harrowing tale has drawn media attention on both sides of the US-Mexico border. The Spanish-language Noticias Telemundo aired a segment about the Harvard student's ordeal, which included an emotional interview with the Harvard junior. Guerrero says it's been liberating to have no term-paper deadlines to worry about, but the lack of a routine keeps him edgy. He watches his back when he ventures outside. Cartels have moved in, extorting neighborhood businesses. Weeks ago, a relative was mugged and shot in the stomach. Harvard has been supportive, granting him leave and helping him find sympathetic ears in Washington, including Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat. Guerrero now talks about when he'll return, not if. But when asked what's hardest about being stuck in Mexico, he loses his bravado and his voice drops to a whisper: 'That I don't have a mom anymore.' Asked about what might happen to Dario upon his return to the US, Alan Klein said he does not believe the high-achieving student with a spotless record and a baby on the way would face deportation, especially with congressional midterm elections right around the corner. Mr Klein pointed out that in Dario’s case, immigration officials did do the right thing.","Dario Guerrero Meneses, 21, a film major at Harvard, has been living in crime-ridden Mexico City suburb since the summer .

"A Pasadena City College professor who's made a name for himself as a male feminist has had an epic online breakdown and admitted to having an affair with a 23-year-old. Hugo Schwyzer let loose in an hour-long Twitter tirade Friday following revelations in early August that the 46-year-old married father-of-two was sexting 27-year-old porn star Christina Parreira. After news broke about Schwyzer's affair, he took a self-imposed hiatus from social media. It was broken on Friday in a major way, when he began tweeting, almost non-stop, for an hour. 'Breathtakingly cocky': Professor Hugo Schwyzer admitted to being an academic fraud and a bad feminist during an hour-long Twitter rant . Younger woman: Porn professional Christina Parreira exchanged 'sexts' with porn professor Schwyzer which eventually found their way online and triggered Schwyzer's manic meltdown . The focus of the vitriol spouted during the meltdown was Schwyzer himself. Labeling himself a 'hypocrite', Schwyzer listed the ways in which he had betrayed his students, readers and family. More than 100 tweets detail infidelity, a fraudulent career in feminist studies and mental illness. Schwyzer had already put many feminist groups offside after admitting having inappropriate relationships with many of his students when he first began teaching at Pasadena Community College. Tweet storm: Hugo Schwyzer typed tweet after tweet in a Twitter tirade about his own hypocrisy . Schwyzer began his tweet-fest by telling his followers he was in the midst of a manic episode. He says he suffers from bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. He referred to himself as a 'breathtakingly cocky fraud,' and said it was time for the truth to out. He wrote, 'So the real story you all missed is that I talked my way into teaching women's studies on the basis of 2 undergrad courses only.' The professor, whose area of expertise is . actually 'British medieval church history,' admitted to never having . published an academic article on feminism. His work for sites such as The Atlantic and Jezebel, was, he said, a way of getting attention, and that while he loved his students, 'I loved the attention more and I was f***ing awesome at getting it.' 'I appropriated the language of redemption, I knew which buttons to push, I used sex and charm and whiteness and it usually worked.' Porn professor: Schwyzer built a career as a male feminist, writing in national newspapers and online, and appearing on TV, but now admits that he manipulated women to get attention . Schwyzer told his Twitter fans that the same week an article he wrote condemning age-disparate relationships was published in the Atlantic, he was sleeping with a 23-year-old and sexting a 27-year-old. 'I'm a monstrous hypocrite,' he wrote. 'You can denounce me now. I'm out of feminism, not because I don't believe in it, but because I'm such a p***poor example of it all.' The Twitter diatribe ended when Schwyzer wrote that he was giving his laptop and Twitter password to a family member and staying offline. Twitter jail: Many of Schwyzer's Twitter followers advised him to stop typing, but there was no stemming the flow, though he has now handed over his computer and password to a family member . Schwyzer said he will take medical leave from his tenure position at Pasadena Community College following the revelations about his infidelity, to deal with his mental illnesses and repair his marriage. 'I’ve put myself on medical leave, but I . haven’t broken a single academic rule,' Schwyzer told the New York Daily News. 'My penis is all . over the internet but I haven’t broken the university’s code of . conduct.' Screen shots of Schwyzer's texts to a porn actress, identified as Christina Parreira, began surfacing early this month. Parreira said Schwyzer divulged fantasies about participating in a threesome with Perriera and porn actor James Deen - in front of the students of his infamous Humanities 3 class, known as 'Navigating Porn'. Big man on campus: Schwyzer has said he will not teach any classes on gender or sexuality in the future but will focus on his area of expertise, 'British medieval church history' 'I will never teach women's studies or gender studies again. If I can get well and beat this, I will teach my Western Civ courses,' promised Schwyer. Though he has taken leave of Twitter for the time being, Schwyzer managed to give an interview today to the Daily Beast. When asked about his motivations, he said, 'For me the motivation was not to get these girls into bed. Sex is only the exclamation point on what you really want. What I am addicted to is affirmation and validation from women... What mattered to me is that they had me on a pedestal, that they thought about me. That is the honest truth.' Pasadena City College spokesman Juan Gutierrez said last week that he was unaware of Schwyzer’s plan to take medical leave. 'We have not received any direct indication that professor Schwyzer will not be at PCC in the fall,' Gutierrez told the Pasadena Star News. 'Should professor Schwyzer indicate that he is in need of any support from the college regarding this situation or health issues, we will extend that support in any way possible.'","California professor Hugo Schwyzer tweeted almost non-stop for an hour, admitting to being a fraud and a hypocrite .

"When Lay's announced that it would be launching a chocolate-covered potato chip, the reception was divided. But now that the limited-edition snack has gone on sale, Femail has had a chance to put it to the test.

The five bags distributed across the team disappeared in a heartbeat - despite containing 800 calories each. Sweet AND salty: Lay's milk chocolate-covered potato chips have proved a unanimous hit on team Femail . Reporter Margot Peppers reflected on this fact afterwards, calling them 'very, very addictive. 'They were the perfect balance of sweet and salty,' she continued. 'Although the chocolate was . pretty rich. I couldn’t stop eating them!'

"Light skin in Europeans stems from a gene mutation from a single person who lived 10,000 years ago. This is according to a new U.S. study that claims the colour is due to an ancient ancestor who lived somewhere between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Scientists made the discovery after identifying a key gene that contributes to lighter skin colour in Europeans. Light skin in Europeans stems from a gene mutation from a single person who lived 10,000 years ago, according to research at Penn State University . In earlier research, Keith Cheng from Penn State College of Medicine reported that one amino acid difference in the gene SLC24A5 is a key contributor to the skin colour difference between Europeans and West Africans. ‘The mutation in SLC24A5 changes just one building block in the protein, and contributes about a third of the visually striking differences in skin tone between peoples of African and European ancestry,’ he said. He added the lighter skin colour may have provided an advantage due to the better creation of vitamin D from sunlight in the dark northern latitudes. Building on this research, Professor Victor Canfield worked with Professor Cheng to study DNA sequence differences across the globe. The mutation in gene SLC24A5 changes just one building block in the protein, and contributes about a third of the visually striking differences in skin tone between peoples of African and European ancestry . They studied segments of genetic code that have a mutation and are located closely on the same chromosome and are often inherited together. The a mutation, called A111T, is found in virtually every one of European ancestry. A111T is also found in populations in the Middle East and Indian subcontinent, but not in high numbers in Africans. Penn State College of Medicine's Keith Cheng identified a key gene that contributes to lighter skin colour in Europeans and differs from West Africans . They discovered that all individuals from the Middle East, North Africa, East Africa and South India who carry the A111T mutation share traces of the ancestral genetic code. According to the researchers, this indicates that all existing instances of this mutation originate from the same person. The pattern of people with this lighter skin colour mutation suggests that the A111T mutation occurred somewhere between the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. ‘This means that Middle Easterners and South Indians, which includes most inhabitants of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, share significant ancestry,’ Professor Cheng said. This mutated segment of DNA was itself created from a combination of two other mutated segments commonly found in Eastern Asians - traditionally defined as Chinese, Japanese and Korean. ‘The coincidence of this interesting form of evidence of shared ancestry of East Asians with Europeans, within this tiny chromosomal region, is exciting,’ said Professor Cheng. ‘The combining of segments occurred after the ancestors of East Asians and Europeans split geographically more than 50,000 years ago; the A111T mutation occurred afterward.’ Professor Cheng now plans to look at more genetic samples to better understand what genes play the most important role in East Asian skin colour. Newly released genomes from around a dozen early inhabitants of Europe suggest that the continent was once a melting pot in which brown-eyed farmers encountered blue-eyed hunter-gatherers. A report in Nature claims that present-day Europeans have ancestry from three groups in various combinations: . These three groups were identified from the genomes of 8,000-year-old hunter-gatherers - one man from Luxembourg and seven individuals from Sweden - as well as the genome of a 7,500-year-old woman from Germany. The study was led by the University of Tübingen in Germany. The research suggests that the individuals from Luxembourg and Spain probably had dark-skin and blue eyes. The German woman, meanwhile, had brown eyes and lighter skin, and was related to Middle Eastern groups. Both the Luxembourg hunter-gatherer and the German farmer had a gene that breaks down saliva - and a feature that may have came about due to agricultural life. However, neither of them had the ability to digest the sugar lactose, found in milk. The trait originally emerged in the Middle East after the domestication of cattle and later spread to Europe. Previous  studies suggested that Europeans today largely descended from Middle Eastern farmers.","Study focused on DNA differences across globe with the A111T mutation .

"Children who are given anti-racism lessons in school are more likely to be intolerant outside the classroom, a major study found yesterday. It said accusing white pupils of racism causes animosity, and discussing sensitive ethnic concerns such as honour killings paints minority group children in a bad light. The survey said children who live in mixed neighbourhoods are often free of hostility towards other racial groups. Counter-productive: A Dutch study has found children who are given anti-racism lessons in school are more likely to be intolerant outside the classroom . But it found that ‘when more attention in class is being paid to the multicultural society, the liberalising effect of positive contact in class on youngsters’ xenophobic attitude decreases’. The project carried out in the Netherlands comes at a time of controversy over the place of multiculturalism – which blames Britain for historic racism and demands the encouragement of minority cultures – in the national curriculum and teaching in British schools. Education Secretary Michael  Gove has been under fire from Left-wing academics over plans to stop teaching teenagers about topics such as ‘the wide cultural, social and ethnic diversity of Britain from the Middle Ages to the twentieth century and how this has helped shape Britain’s identity’. Instead, in future pupils will be taught much more British history. The study, published in the European Sociological Review, was based on a survey of 1,444 pupils aged 14 and 15 in ten schools in the city of Nijmegen. Education Secretary Michael  Gove has come under fire from Left-wing academics over plans to stop teaching teenagers about multicultural topics . The teenagers, drawn from different class and racial backgrounds, and with differing academic abilities, were questioned on their attitudes to those from different ethnic backgrounds and about multicultural teaching in their schools. It said boys tended to be more intolerant of other groups than girls, and intolerance was greatest among those with strong religious or ethnic identity, among those from Turkish or Moroccan backgrounds, and those with the lowest educational achievements. But it said the teaching of multiculturalism had an ‘unexpected negative effect’. It added: ‘The impact of positive inter- ethnic contact in class disappears  or even reverses when multiculturalism is more emphasised during  lessons. Discussing discrimination and the customs and habits of  other cultures during lessons affects the youngsters’ xenophobic attitudes indirectly.’ The report added that bad feelings among minority groups could be generated by discussion of topics such as honour killings or female  circumcision. Animosity could also be caused by ‘a one-sided offender- victim approach to racism’. The findings echo the views of Bradford head teacher Ray Honeyford, who was driven from his job nearly 30 years ago over his claim that multicultural teaching was harming pupils. Mr Honeyford said that pupil performance was hindered by ‘the notion of the multi-racial curriculum urged by the authorities, and of making colour and race significant, high-profile issues in the classroom’. Patricia Morgan, an author on  the family and education, said  yesterday: ‘If you rub children’s noses in their supposed racism, they resent it. ‘Pupils are being accused of things they haven’t thought or done. Multiculturalism attempts to manipulate children’s thoughts, beliefs and emotions, it amounts to indoctrination, and it doesn’t work. It is counter-productive. ‘This study shows that when people try to manipulate children’s minds, it bounces back on them.’","Dutch study finds discussing sensitive ethnic concerns can be counter-productive .

"These surreal photographs are instantly familiar to any fan of Star Wars - they show the landscape of Tatooine, where Luke Skywalker grew up in the sci-fi blockbuster. But the pictures were not captured when the series was being filmed in the 1970s, but in fact date back just a few weeks. The sets which director George Lucas used to create his epic vision are still standing in the deserts of Tunisia, where they have been a focus of pilgrimage for Star Wars obsessives for decades. Scroll down for the original trailer . Iconic: This house was the home of Luke Skywalker on Tatooine in the Star Wars films . Still standing: The sets are visible in Tunisian desert nearly four decades after the first film was filmed . Futuristic: These vapourisers were featured in the film and have never been removed from the desert . Photographer and artist Ra Di Martino made it her mission to find the Tatooine sets after researching the sites where major blockbusters were filmed. Using just Google Maps as a guide, she ventured into the Chott el Djerid to find the abandoned set. Much of the former Tatooine has been swallowed up by the desert and now lies buried in the sand. However, that part which remains above ground has been preserved by the hot and dry climate, making it almost identical to when it appeared in the 1977 film. Pilgrimage: Photographer Ra Di Martino found the Tatooine set by searching on Google Maps . Inhospitable: In the Star Wars films, Tatooine is a scorching planet warmed by two suns - making the unforgiving Tunisian desert the perfect place to film . Remote: Filmmakers never got round to removing the set from the uninhabited Chott el Djerid region . Surprise: Ms Di Martino said she was taken aback by the intensity of the response to her pictures . 'When I realised some film Star Wars film props were left, I thought they would make for some very powerful images,' Ms Di Martino said. 'So I decided to go to Tunisia and eventually found these three locations in very different conditions. 'I was so happy to have found the ruins, they are fascinating but it can be a very eerie experience seeing them, especially if you are alone. I have great childhood memories of the films. Derelict: Swathes of the set have been destroyed by the advance of the desert . Poignant: The abandoned sets have been standing in the desert for several decades .

"A high school teacher from Portland says he was fired because of his religious beliefs and pro-life views. Math teacher Bill Diss had been out of the classroom since March after he was put on paid administrative leave after a teaching career spanning 11 years. He has now been formally fired by Portland Public Schools but believes his termination was a long time coming after making his anti-abortionist views known. Scroll down for video... Fired: High school teacher Bill Diss claims he was fired because of his stance against abortion. Troubles began in 2007 when he publicly protested against a new Planned Parenthood building . On the day he was told to leave the school in March of this year, Mr Diss was apparently given just a few minutes to collect his things and was escorted from school premises by police, . He described himself as a teacher with great reviews before 2007, but he told KATU things took a dramatic shift after the Planned Parenthood protest. Mr Diss publicly opposed the construction of a new Planned Parenthood headquarters building in the northeast of the city. 'The review I got in 2010, in every single area, were very negative comments,' says Mr Diss. 'I was marked down in a whole bunch of areas. I was even marked down for how my classroom looked.' He doesn't believe he was doing his job poorly but that school leaders deliberately took issue with how he did things because they disagreed with his pro-life stance. The Portland School Board approved his firing by a 6-1 vote. Mr Diss says he is now considering taking legal action against the school. Something changed: Bill Diss described himself as a teacher with great reviews before 2007, but says things took a dramatic shift after the Planned Parenthood protest . Although the School District wouldn't comment on why Mr Diss was ultimately fired, they = did release a statement: . 'Mr. Diss has said his termination was based on his religious beliefs and his right to free speech. That is not the case. The school district takes discipline of all employees seriously.  Mr. Diss’s conduct and performance led to his removal from the classroom and termination. State law protects an employee’s privacy and does not allow the school district to discuss personnel matters in detail.' Former students told KGW-TV Diss is known for sharing his anti-abortion views at school. 'He doesn’t do it a lot, but students do make fun of him for being against it and everything,' junior Ty’sha Harrell said. When he does talk about it, he does have really good views and everything, sometimes he goes too deep into it. He brings religion into it.' Benson High School: Mr Diss was put on administrative leave in March and was formally fired by Portland Public Schools at a board hearing earlier this week. He  doesn't believe he was doing his job poorly . In one suspension letter provided to The Oregonian, school officials accused him of trying to block students from attending the Planned Parenthood program because of his religious beliefs and told them to 'shut (their) mouths.' Mr Diss was reprimanded by the district in September 2012 after he refused to allow employees of teenage pregnancy prevention initiative to speak to students because the employees were from Planned Parenthood. The teacher had been a longtime critic against the organization, and had often helped bring dozens of pro-life protestors to school board meetings. At the November hearing, multiple administrators testified that Mr Diss was often rude to students and had a pattern of behavior that was damaging to his relationships with students and co-workers. It was revealed Mr Diss had intimidated and harassed students along with other staff, although he denies the claims that he ever disrespected students. 'I don't think so,' he says. 'I would certainly get after students. I mean, I'm their teacher. It's kind of interesting because administrators before 2007 wrote that I'm very respectful to students. All of a sudden, it just changed.' Mr Diss says there are still ways to appeal his firing within the district. If those attempts fail, he may consider legal action.","School says math teacher was fired because of his 'conduct and performance'

"The British public are overwhelmingly in favour of clawing back a wide range of powers from Brussels. And a clear majority say that we should refuse to sign any new EU treaty until that happens. According to an exclusive poll for the Daily Mail, more than two-thirds believe the European Union has become over-mighty and want the Prime Minister to start repatriating powers on everything from immigration and human rights to employment law and fishing policy. Click here for a breakdown of the poll results . Food for thought: The British public are overwhelmingly in favour of clawing back a wide range of powers from Brussels, according to an exclusive poll for the Daily Mail . Among Tory voters, almost 90 per cent want repatriation, with 60 per cent believing negotiations on the issue should begin immediately. And across supporters of all parties, a mere 13 per cent share the view of Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg that Brussels does not have too much power and that reform is unnecessary. There is also broad support for a referendum on Britain’s continuing membership of the EU, with those in favour outnumbering opponents by more than two to one. Worryingly for Mr Cameron, most of those polled believe the 81 Eurosceptic MPs who rebelled in the Commons this week are ‘more in tune with Tory voters’ than the Prime Minister. Three-quarters said rebel MPs were right to defy his three-line whip. Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that he must ‘work harder’ to persuade his backbenchers he is on their side. The Daily Mail has learned that he has ordered every Whitehall department to draw up a list of powers to be grabbed back from Brussels. But rebel Tories said the poll findings showed Mr Cameron had to move further and faster. Philip Davies said public pressure for a referendum was becoming ‘unstoppable’. He added: ‘This poll confirms that the European issue is not going to go away. The voting public are massively unhappy about the damage the EU is doing to the economy and our country. ‘The Prime Minister says now is not the time to talk about Europe because of the need to fix the economy. But the public see the two things going hand in hand - we cannot fix the economy until we get out of the claws of Brussels, which is bleeding us dry. ‘The Prime Minister needs to reflect that feeling and go to Brussels and say that unless they start giving us back some meaningful powers then this week’s vote in the Commons will come to be seen as the first step on a path to us leaving the EU.’ In a sign of the Coalition tensions over the issue, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from Brussels. ‘That simply isn’t on the cards,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t work, it’s not possible.' Despite Mr Clegg’s opposition to the idea, the Harris Interactive survey found that 68 per cent of Lib Dem voters polled also want to see Brussels cut down to size. Not moving fast enough? Mr Cameron, pictured speaking with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has ordered every Whitehall department to draw up a list of powers to be grabbed back from Brussels . Tory Peter Bone said the time had come for the Prime Minister to face down his Coalition partners. ‘The fact that people are coming to see the Prime Minister as out of touch should worry him. 'There is always a danger that Prime Ministers become detached from what the public think. But in this case the real problem is that we are hogtied by the Lib Dems. ‘We cannot have a party that commands only eight per cent support in the polls having a veto on bringing powers back from Brussels.’ The poll findings came as it emerged that Mr Cameron has ordered ‘urgent’ work to draw up a comprehensive blueprint that he can take to Brussels if eurozone countries seek a major change in the treaties which govern the EU. A well-placed source told the Mail that the PM wants this work to be completed ‘very rapidly on what is the best way of maximising our national advantage’. Senior officials say Mr Cameron is prepared to threaten to hold a referendum to get his way. Coalition tensions: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from Brussels . The Prime Minister opened a two-front war on Brussels yesterday, launching a broadside at the European Commission for making ‘daily attacks’ on the City of London. He said work has begun to examine the balance of powers between London and Brussels - a pledge contained in the coalition agreement. Senior sources say the work on repatriation of powers has gone much wider than previously admitted. Ministers have previously conceded only that employment laws and fisheries policy are under the spotlight. The project being coordinated by the Foreign Office includes every single government department. They have all been asked to draw up details of the ‘risks and opportunities that could arise if there is a renegotiation of treaties’. The blueprint will also cover the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines much of the European Convention on Human Rights - which has led the courts to make controversial rulings in favour of foreign prisoners in deportation cases. Senior officials expect there to be a minor revision of the treaties in December - but they believe making major demands at that point would endanger the Euro and the British economy with it. That is bound to disappoint Tory Eurosceptics and the public. But senior sources say a major treaty revision will be necessary as early as next year, with a full-blown inter-governmental conference to draw up a new set of rules to recognise the changed relationship between those inside and outside the eurozone. By KIRSTY WALKER . Ladies man? Just 43 per cent of women say that they approve of the Prime Minister, pictured with his wife Samantha . David Cameron’s support among women is slipping away, with just 43 per cent saying that they approve of the Prime Minister. The Harris Interactive survey for the Daily Mail has revealed a growing divide between the sexes, with 54 per cent of men saying that Mr Cameron is doing a good job.

"One of the world’s rarest orchids has been discovered by British botanists on a volcanic island in the Atlantic. Professor Richard Bateman and Dr Paula Rudall, experts from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, found the green-flowered plant on a wind-swept mountain ridge they compared to a scene from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lost World. There were only 250 plants of the unique species on the island of Sao Jorge in the Portuguese Azores, making the newly named Hochstetter Butterfly Orchid the rarest in Europe. Rare: This shows details of the flowers of Hochstetter's Butterfly-orchid, a newly recognized and exceptionally rare orchid recently discovered . Incredibly, on their return to Britain the scientists realised that another botanist had first seen the orchid 175 years ago - but had never realised what he had discovered. Browsing the library at Kew Gardens, they realised that a German explorer, 20-year-old Karl Hochstetter, found the plant when he visited the Azores, 850 miles off the Portuguese coast, in 1838. Professor Bateman said: ‘Hochstetter collected just one specimen and dried it. ‘He gave it to his father, the world-renowned botanist Christian Ferdinand Hochstetter, who totally misunderstood both the specimen and what its significance was.’ Hochstetter Snr confused the orchid with a closely related species, accurately drawing the plant in his 1844 book on the islands but mislabelling it. Professor Bateman added: ‘He confused specimens. The real problem was that the father, a very experienced botanist, never visited the island. ‘He never saw these plants living - he just saw a squashed specimen. ‘He messed up completely in describing this orchid and it disappeared from everyone’s view for the last 170-odd years.’ The botanist added: ‘This remarkable species languished unrecognised for all that time.’ The British botanists and their Azores-based colleague Monica Moura , who have published their work in the journal PeerJ, debated whether to publicise the discovery at all. ‘One concern was that plant collectors would seek this orchid out and even dig it out,’ said Professor Bateman. ‘But we decided there was a real need to make people aware of this so conservation work can be carried out.’ Orchid: Each plant could be worth a substantial sum to collectors. Tropical orchids pictured here at Kew Gardens, London . Each plant - although not as colourful or vivid as tropical orchids - could be worth a substantial sum to collectors. But Prof Bateman warned that the plant would be unlikely to survive outside its natural habitat.The plant - which has been given the formal Latin name of Platanthera azorica - only lives in two volcanic craters a mile apart on a windy ridge. The team found it only grows in a narrow band between the altitudes of 950m and 1,000m.‘It likes wet, acid soil and a very humid climate,’ Prof Bateman said. ‘It is very exposed up there on that ridge and the wind really whistles through. You would have to really know what you were doing to recreate those conditions.’","Professor Richard Bateman and Dr Paula Rudall found the plant .

"When the ‘comet of the century’ ISON swung perilously close to the sun last month, scientists were left stumped as to whether it had survived. Most astronomers now believe that the comet was destroyed by solar heat with Nasa stating a 90 per cent chance of this having happened. What they believe now remains from its original 0.62 mile (1km) nucleus are 10 metre pieces of rubble. Click on the bottom right of this image to enlarge... Nasa said that it will monitor Ison for the next several weeks to see if anything has survived. Its STEREO spacecraft will be using its cameras to search for bright fragments throughout the week, while the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Honolulu, Hawaii will use its 3m wide telescope . There is, however, a 10 per cent chance of it having left behind some important fragments 100 metres in radius or larger which will be big enough to study. Nasa said that it will monitor the comet for the next few weeks. The group’s STEREO spacecraft will be using their cameras to search for bright fragments throughout the week, along with the Nasa Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) in Honolulu. Nasa's recently launched MAVEN spacecraft may try to observe ISON next week. Scroll down for videos and animation... At 6.35pm GMT on 28 November the so-called 'comet of the century' was spotted on a trajectory towards the sun before disappearing. Shortly afterwards bright lights (pictured top left) were spotted that some scientists have claimed could be the comet's nucleus . In this frame grab taken from an enhanced video made by Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft, comet ISON, left, approaches the sun on November 25 . By mid-to-late December Nasa Hubble and Chandra observatories will be performing deep outer space searches for any remnants of the comet. Spitzer will also look for ISON in early 2014. If there is nothing sizable and stable left, it will dissipate and disappear in this time, as already emitted dust leaves the vicinity. If there is still a central source of emission, even if it is very much smaller, we will see a new, much fainter coma and tail form, which currently may be overwhelmed by the dust emitted from before the disruption event. ‘I believe that we will no longer see a brilliant display of ISON,’ Gerhard Schwehm, ESA’s Head of Solar System Science Operations Division told MailOnline. Some scientists feared the delicate comet (pictured, bottom right, as it approached the sun) had already started to disintegrate, even before it grazed the 'surface' of the sun, 1.2 million kilometres away . Comet ISON headed towards the centre of our Solar System in Novermber passing within 1.2 million miles of the Sun’s surface. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun. Its average speed in July was 55,405mph. It continued to accelerate steadily until November when it whipped around the Sun at an astonishing 425,000mph. Early data analysis suggested Comet ISON’s size to be around three miles in diameter. Most astronomers now believe that the comet was destroyed by solar heat with Nasa stating a 90 per cent probability of this having happened. What they believe remains now is a small pieces of rubble, around 10 metres in radius. There is, however a 10 per cent change of . it having left behind some important fragments 100m radius or larger . which will be big enough to study. ‘If one looks at the pre and post perihelion observations by ESA’s Solar and Heliospheric Observatory the comet must have disintegrated. ‘The display it shows after closest approach to the sun, shows dust that was released pre-perihelion and a lot of fresh material that must have been set free during the close passage at the sun.’ If previous sun grazing comets are any guides, there may be a sizeable piece of comet nucleus left. At this point, though, scientists are waiting for a variety of telescopes to make observations before the status of Comet ISON can be confirmed. What remains of Comet ISON appears to brighten and spread out, then fade. The disappearance of a strong central brightness condensation after perihelion is telling, the comet is clearly fainter and more diffuse going out than going in, but it continues to shine. The spread out light is likely due to dust emitted in the few hours before perihelion going around the sun. Here, Comet ISON is shown entering the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right of this image . ISON, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century', was visible to the naked eye in November . ‘The fan-shape of the tail is a great example how the dust now moves on slightly different trajectories as compared to the nucleus,’ added Dr Schwehm. ‘Small dust grains experience radiation pressure and therefore see a reduced gravitational attraction by the Sun (both forces act radially) and depending upon the material and size the radiation pressure force varies. ‘For submicron highly absorbing grains and porous grains, this force can be even larger than the gravity and they are blown away from the sun. A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths . ‘As the brightness fades, I believe the source is gone. Perhaps there is a fairly big junk left, but depleted of volatiles. These are really difficult to detect.’ The comet was believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar system, which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets. For whatever reason, Ison was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull. By the time ISON slingshot around the sun, it was be moving at 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph). ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1, which indicates when it was discovered.

"A friend of Aaron Hernandez appeared in a surveillance video with a towel that was found near the body of a man the former New England Patriots star is accused of murdering in 2013, a defense attorney said on Tuesday. Defense attorney James Sultan asked North Attleboro police officer John Grim about footage taken at a gas station and convenience store hours before the body of semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's Massachusetts house. 'Are you aware that there is video surveillance footage ... taken at about 2am on June 17, 2013, showing Carlos Ortiz with a white towel around his neck?' he asked during cross-examination of Grim, who said he was unaware of it. Scroll down for video . Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez listens during his murder trial at the Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Tuesday . Prosecutors say Ortiz was one of two friends who were with Hernandez when they picked up Lloyd at his Boston home on June 17, 2013, and drove him to the industrial area where his body was found later that day. Ortiz and the other friend, Ernest Wallace, have also been charged in Lloyd's slaying and will be tried separately. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Investigators have testified they found a white towel on the ground near Lloyd's bullet-riddled body, which was discovered by a teenage jogger. Other items found near the body included a Boston Red Sox baseball hat, a marijuana cigarette known as a blunt and several empty shell casings from a .45-caliber handgun. Sultan said the towel seen in the video was the one found near Lloyd's body. Lloyd, 27, had been dating Shaneah Jenkins, the sister of Hernandez's fiancée, at the time. Jenkins has testified that the two men were in the early stages of a friendship and smoked marijuana together. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was arrested on murder and firearms charges. The team cut him hours later. An image from surveillance cameras was shown in court of Aaron Hernandez dismantling his cell phone while sitting inside his lawyer's car in May 2013 . If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Hernandez will face a second trial later this year on charges he killed two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. The jury on Tuesday also was shown surveillance video of Hernandez dismantling his cell phone a day after Lloyd's murder. His fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, was in court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Tuesday where she sat behind Hernandez. He mouthed 'I love you' to her as she walked in, Fox reported. Veteran Detective Michael Elliot, from the North Attleboro Police Department, testified on Tuesday that after Hernandez was questioned on June 18, he watched on the police CCTV as the pro-football player broke up the phone. Last Friday, Judge Susan Garsh said she'd allow the jury to see video of Hernandez sitting in a lawyer's car outside the North Attleboro, Massachusetts, police station the day after the killing. The defense had fought to prevent the video tape being admitted to evidence but the judge said that Hernandez had no expectation of privacy while sitting in a public parking lot. Prosecutors said it shows Hernandez dismantling his phone, getting a new phone from the lawyer and using it to call a co-defendant. Prosecutors claim that Hernandez was seen using the phone and calling co-defendant Ernest Wallace, in a deliberate attempt to assist him. Judge Garsh said on Friday that the jury would not be told where the phone came from, just that it didn't belong to Hernandez. The technician who installed Hernandez's home theater and security system also took the stand on Tuesday. Mark Archambault said that when he was installing the six cameras in May 2013, Hernandez asked how to turn off the camera in the basement because he didn't want his girlfriend to see him hanging out with his friends. Jurors were also shown a number of evidence photos on Tuesday - including a shell casing found in a dumpster at the Enterprise car rental where Hernandez had hired a vehicle on the night Lloyd was shot and killed. Last week, Hernandez's 25-year-old fiancée Shayanna Jenkins was granted immunity in the trial - a move likely made so that prosecutors can call her to testify. The grant of immunity may mean that the football player's girlfriend will not be able to invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if she takes the witness stand. Prosecutors have said Jenkins lied to a grand jury dozens of times including when she said she didn't know what she did with a box she took from the basement of their home. They say it contained possible evidence leading to Mr Lloyd's killer. Jenkins has pleaded not guilty to perjury. Jenkins still lives in Hernandez's North Attleboro mansion with their two-year-old daughter.","Hernandez is accused in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fiancée's sister .

'On Tuesday and Wednesday they just sat in the trees or on the ground, hardly moving or eating.' Mr Landman described various theories put forward to explain the bizarre scenes at the zoo, with some suggesting the baboons may have spotted a predator - either a real one or an image of one on a visitor's t-shirt - or felt the rumblings of an earthquake. Baffled: Zoologists told Dutch news outlets they have failed to hit on an explanation for the animals' strange behaviour . The zoologist admitted he was yet to hear an explanation that 'holds water'. 'The craziest suggestion was that it was caused by a UFO,' Mr Landman said. Baboons at the zoo, who were all born in captivity, have behaved this way four times in the past 20 years, the team at Emmen Dierenpark said. Theories: The baboons at the zoo have been sitting motionless in trees or on the ground at the zoo . Traumatised: The team at the zoo consulted outside experts, but they have so far failed to shed any light on the mystery . Threat: Some suggested the 112 baboons at the zoo could have been startled by an unseen predator . But their activity has not been observed among any baboons anywhere else, either in captivity or in the wild, according to a report in the Huffington Post. Mr Landman said the animals have been observed acting disconcerted if they come across a predator in the wild - but nothing on the scale of the behaviour displayed by the creatures at the Dutch zoo this week. Experts consulted by staff at Emmen Dierenpark have so far failed to shed any light on the mystery, but the animals have shown signs of returning to normal. Some of the baboons managed to eat some small pieces of apple, and all were given pellets to provide them with vital vitamins and minerals.

"Carved from rare wood with a 23-carat gold lion motif, the world's most expensive surfboard is worth $1.3 million. The beautiful board named The Rampant was created by New Zealand-based surfboard designer Roy Stuart - who has more than 20 years of experience behind him. At 3.2m long, the board is made with timber from Paulownia - a tree native to Asia - and has a gold lion painted on with a red resin outline. New Zealand-based designer Roy Stuart has created a $1.3 million surfboard - the world's most expensive . Carved from rare wood with a 23-carat gold lion motif, Stuart said aesthetic appeal wasn't at the forefront of his mind when designing it . But its aesthetic appeal was not Stuart's main consideration, he strove to make sure it had sound engineering. The bottom of the board has a unique tunnel fin crafted from kahikatea wood - a tree native to New Zealand. Combined with the tunnel fin is a polycarbonate fin, which gives the board rapid acceleration, and a single concave shape from nose to tail vastly improves balance. 'We begin by modelling a prospective surfboard based on what we want it to do - how big must the hull be to accomplish its task?,' the 53-year-old's website said. A single concave shape from nose to tail (left) helps improve balance, and the blue and tunnel fin aid acceleration (right) The bottom of the board has a unique tunnel fine crafted from kahikatea wood - a tree native to New Zealand as well as a polycarbonate fin . 'How will lower wave frequencies be handled, and how fast will we go? 'This process is devoid of any aesthetic considerations, it’s pure engineering. 'Later, we work to maintain the engineering integrity of the design while making it look like something you want in the middle of your living room, or on the roof of your car.' Stuart said the expensive price tag reflected his years of experience as a surfboard designer and the quality product one would receive at the end. '[The] Rampant is so visually striking many people think it might be designed for artistic appeal alone,' he said. 'High price is a consequence of the ultimate design and performance of a lifetime. 'Life is short, get the best if you can - price is just a number but the experience is forever.'","The Rampant surfboard was designed by New Zealand-based Roy Stuart .

"A spooky snail with a transparent shell has been discovered within Croatia's deepest cave. The tiny creature has been declared a news species and lives in one of the 20 deepest cave systems in the world; Lukina Jama–Trojama in Croatia. The newly discovered species - Zospeum tholussum - belongs to a genus of minute air-breathing land snails that cannot see to find their way around and are considered to be true eutroglobionts that only live in dark, underground caves. A spooky snail with a transparent shell has been discovered within Croatia's deepest cave. It cannot see and is thought to only live in dark, underground caves . The fragile snail has a beautifully shaped dome-like translucent shell. Scientists from Goethe University, Frankfurt and the Biospeleological Society in Croatia, found just one living specimen during the expedition, the findings of which were published in the journal Subterranean Biology. The animal was found at the remarkable depth of 980 metres, in an unnamed chamber full of rocks and sand with a small stream running through it. The newly discovered species - Zospeum tholussum - belongs to a genus of minute air-breathing land snails. Here you can see its incredible transparent shell and body . All known species from the cave-dwelling genus Zospeum possess a limited ability to move. Their preference of a muddy habitat and the fact that they are usually located near the drainage system of the cave, in a close proximity to running water, suggests these animals are not immobile. Scientists think that dispersal is achieved by snails travelling via water or hitching a ride on larger mammals. This is a 3-D model of the Lukina Jama-Trojama cave system in Croatia that shows where snail shells were collected as well as where the living creature was found . The Lukina Jama–Trojama is the deepest cave system in Croatia and is known for its extraordinary vertical shape, long pits and great depth of  minus 1,392 metres. From an ecological point of view this cave system is extremely interesting for having three microclimatic layers: an icy part that forms its entrance with a temperature of about 1°C, a middle part with temperatures up to 2°C and bottom part with a temperature of 4°C. These unusual living conditions make the cave extremely interesting for scientists from a biodiversity point of view.","Scientists from Goethe University, Frankfurt and the Biospeleological Society in Croatia discovered the rare transparent mollusc .

"Proposal: Diesel drivers could face a charge of £10 when driving through central London from 2020 . Drivers of diesel cars face financial penalties to curb air pollution in city centres. Under plans drawn up by London Mayor Boris Johnson, nearly all diesel vehicle drivers would be hit by a £10 charge to drive into Central London, while other cities are considering introducing low-emission zones to crack down on diesel fumes. Mr Johnson will also lobby the Government to raise road tax on diesel cars to encourage motorists to switch to cleaner vehicles. Elsewhere, Labour is planning a network of low-emission zones that would force older diesel vehicles out of many cities. Sheffield, Leicester, Bradford, Birmingham, Bristol and 15 other cities are considering bringing in the zones to cope with poor air quality. The changes in London, which would come into effect in 2020, would mean diesel drivers would have to pay an additional £10 to drive into London’s ‘ultra low emission zone’. The area will have the same boundaries as the Congestion Charge zone, and only diesel vehicles that meet the Euro 6 emissions standard will be exempt from the charge. Petrol cars registered before 2006 will also have to pay. The threat of heavy fines for breaches of air pollution rules, set by the European Commission, have driven the new initiatives to cut diesel fumes. The commission launched legal proceedings against Britain in February. Scroll down for video . Plans: The proposed scheme  by London Mayor Boris Johnson is part of a bid to combat air pollution in cities . Findings released in February revealed the most polluted roads in central London, with Oxford Street, Park Lane and Buckingham Palace being among the polluted hotspots in the capital . The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs admitted that London, Birmingham and Leeds would be exposed to dangerous air pollution from vehicle exhausts until the 2030s unless tougher action was taken. Matthew Pencharz, Mr Johnson’s environment adviser, told The Times: ‘We want to see an unwinding of incentives that have driven people to diesel. ‘Euro engine standards on emissions have not delivered the savings expected, meaning we now have a legacy of a generation of dirty diesels.’","Plans by Mayor Boris Johnson could see diesel drivers hit with £10 charge .

"In her former life as a party planner, some said her advice verged on the blindingly obvious. But now she has reinvented herself as a fitness instructor, Pippa Middleton’s keep-fit tips are more unusual. The 31-year-old has advised her followers to feast on beetroot and invest in a pair of padded Lycra shorts to achieve her toned physique. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton (pictured left and right in London) has advised her followers to feast on beetroot and invest in a pair of padded Lycra shorts to achieve her toned physique .

She even shared her favourite healthy recipe, a ‘pre-dinner canapé of beetroot fritters topped with cream cheese and smoked salmon’, which she said comes in at just 47 calories each. Writing in her new monthly column in Waitrose Weekend Magazine, she said she has recently developed a passion for cycling that has helped keep her famous toned behind in perfect shape. Miss Middleton – who was dubbed Her Royal Hotness ever since she appeared as a bridesmaid at her sister’s wedding to the Duke of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011 – even shared four ‘strength work’ exercises to help her fans keep up in the saddle. The 31-year-old said she has recently developed a passion for cycling that has helped keep her famous toned behind in perfect shape . And she has put her new found athleticism to good use. In June, she completed a 3,000 charity bike race across the United States along with her brother James. She admitted she initially found the sport ‘intimidating’ as her experience before that was limited to ‘winding along country lanes on a dusty old mountain bike, most likely en route to a pub lunch’. But with the right preparation and equipment, she was soon hooked: ‘With a basic fitness level, I found you can get bike fit in a matter of months with a combination of core Pilates exercises, spin classes and time on the road in the evenings or at weekends on quieter off-road routes.’ Pippa Middleton gives out some keep-fit tips . Pippa Middleton said of her new passion: . ‘Cycling uses muscles differently from the way in which they’re used in other sports I enjoy, like running. 'I had to retrain my body with core exercises and explosive moves to get bike fit.’ JUMP SQUAT . Builds lower body power . Drop down into a squat, feet hip-width apart (A). Press through your heels to jump into the air (B). Land in the squat position to reset. Do three sets of 10 jumps. FRONT PLANK . Great for core strength . Start in a push-up position and lower yourself down onto your forearms. Brace your abs, squeeze your glutes and hold for 30 seconds. Do three sets. GLUTE PLANK . Fires the glutes – the powerhouse for cyclists. Start in a front plank position with your abs engaged (A). Lift and lower one leg at a time (B), keeping your hips level. DO three sets of 10. PLANK ROTATION . Strengthens obliques . Start in a side plank on your left forearm, feet stacked, right arm up (A). Rotate it under the body (B), keeping your hips up. Repeat for 10 and swich sides. Do three sets of 20. Miss Middleton advised her disciples to be ‘minimalist’ with their kit, but added: ‘In terms of bike essentials, it’s all about making your experience more enjoyable. ‘In my case that meant getting a gel-padded seat and cushioned Lycra shorts, gloves, a bike computer to gauge speed, lights, hi-vis jacket and some good glasses to protect eyes from stones.’ Pippa Middleton (pictured running in a triathlon in 2011) has even shared her favourite healthy recipe, a ‘pre-dinner canapé of beetroot fritters topped with cream cheese and smoked salmon’ Advising her readers to ‘use real food for energy rather than relying on sugary bars’, she revealed her secret beetroot . She added: ‘With this in mind, my chosen food this month is beetroot, which is great for energy because new science suggests it opens up the blood vessels, increasing blood flow to muscles.’ In 2012, Miss Middleton’s party planning book Celebrate was ridiculed for including elementary advice on how to play conkers and how to create a Halloween ghost using a white sheet and a bamboo cane.","Pippa Middleton advises eating beetroot to help achieve toned physique .

"One volunteer is the proud of owner of what is thought to be the first tattoo etched by a machine (pictured) - a perfect circle on his forearm . Some people perceive tattoos to be a unique work of art on the skin, etched by skilled artists . But now a group of students have modified a 3D printer to prove that robots can tattoo humans too. One volunteer is the proud of owner of what is thought to be the first tattoo etched by a machine – a perfect circle on his forearm. A group of three French design students modified a MarkerBot 3D printer as part of a challenge set by France's Cultural Ministry, which challenged people to remix images and sounds in the public domain. The event was hosted by ENSCI les Ateliers, a famous design school in Paris and the students set about creating tattoos from a bank of images. Pierre Emm, Piotr Widelka and Johan Da Silveira had eight hours to make use of their digital materials and managed to hack the printer so that it could draw a perfect circle on skin, using a normal pen. They chose the circle to demonstrate the precision of the technology as however good a human tattoo artist is, circles are incredibly difficult to draw accurately. Despite the official challenge being over, the students were determined to create their tattooing machine for real. They borrowed a manual tattoo-machine from an amateur tattooist and practiced getting the robot to etch the design on artificial silicone skin. Scroll down for video . Raw material: A group of three French design students modified a MarkerBot 3D printer (pictured) as part of a challenge set by France's Cultural Ministry, which challenged people to remix images and sounds in the public domain to create something new . Going further: The students managed to get the machine to draw a perfect circle on a volunteer's arm in ink from a Biro within one afternoon, but then decided to continue to modify the printer, installing a tattoo gun (pictured) so the robot could permanently ink a volunteer . ‘The big difficulty was to repeat the same exercise on a curved surface and on a material that has much more flexibility than silicone,’ Mr Emm told NPR. The students explored different methods of holding the skin taut where the tattoo was planned, including a metal ring and elastic bands, but finally settled on a tube with an open area where the skin was to be marked. They did not find it hard to find a brave volunteer eager to gain the accolade of having the first robot tattoo. The Instuctables.com website documented the process in detail and has published the instructions to help people transform their own 3D printers into robotic tattooing machines.

"Researchers in Africa have discovered a huge population of 'unusually large' chimps who feast on leopards and giant snails in what is being described as the continent's 'last untouched wilderness'. The previously unknown 'mega-culture' was found in the heart of the Bili-Uele forest in the Democratic Republic of Congo by researchers, who trekked thousands of miles dodging armed police and militia to get there. And they were stunned to see the chimps eating leopard and huge African snails, whose shells they pound open on rocks. Scientists have discovered a huge mega-culture of chimps in Congo that feast on big cats and giant snails. Regular chimps, pictured, mainly eat fruit . Cleve Hicks, a primatologist based at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig, Germany, said in The Guardian: 'This is one of the few places left on Earth with a huge continuous population of chimps. 'We estimate many thousands of individuals, perhaps tens of thousands.' Unique customs and behaviour across a vast area of 19,000sq miles were recorded by a series of motion-activated cameras. Gangs of males were seen patrolling their territory and mothers showed their young how to use tools to eat swarming insects. The camera traps also revealed an extraordinary range of other forest dwellers, including forest elephants, olive baboons, spotted hyena as well as red river and giant forest hogs, crested guinea fowl and aardvark. Target: Researchers laid down a series of cameras to monitor the chimps' behaviour and recorded them devouring a leopard such as this . 'We saw incredible amounts of wildlife on our camera traps, but we did not catch a single film of a human,' said Hicks. 'It remains one of the last untouched wildernesses in Africa.' One camera even recorded its own destruction as it came under attack from a leopard, but all two dozen cameras were nearly lost when poachers invaded the area and burned the researchers' camp. Only a swift two-day rescue mission retrieved the footage. Hicks's team first identified the existence of the Bili-Uele chimps in 2007 but their new survey, published this week in the journal Biological Conservation, reveals a vast, thriving mega-culture. Elsewhere in Africa, human damage has fragmented the continent's chimp population from many millions to just a few hundred thousand over the last century. Mission: The researchers trekked thousands of miles to reach the population, dodging armed police and militia in the troubled country . However, while the chimp numbers have apparently remained stable, the numbers of forest elephants have crashed by half due to poaching. The slaughter, to feed the highly lucrative illegal ivory trade, mirrors the bloody picture across central Africa, where two-thirds of all forest elephants have been killed in the last decade. The researchers fear increasing incursions into the virgin forest will draw in more hunters seeking to feed the bush meat trade in the Congo basin, that targets chimps and other animals. Hicks said the Bili-Uele forest is in need of urgent help: 'It is one of the last great expanses of pristine African wilderness,' he said. 'This is one of the few places on Earth with a huge, continuous population of chimps'","The 'mega-culture' of chimps also like eating giant snails whose shells they pound open on rocks .

"A Russian porn star broke both her legs as she escaped two thugs who brutally raped and assaulted her after luring her to their flat with a business deal. The 22-year-old adult actress had entered the flat after being invited by the two men to discuss a possible new production, but was attacked and jumped out of a window to get away.

"Prince William has flown off on a hunting trip days before taking part in a high-profile campaign to highlight poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Accompanied by his brother, Prince Harry, the second in line to the throne flew out to Spain on Thursday to shoot wild boar and stag at an estate in rural Cordoba owned by one of the wealthiest men in Britain, the Duke of Westminster. The princes are frequent visitors to Finca La Garganta, which is one of the largest and most exclusive hunting estates in western Europe. Prince William has been shooting boar on a private estate in Cordoba, Spain. Here he is engaging in the pastime at Sandringham in December 2005 . The estate is owned by the Duke of Westminster, pictured here shooting in November 2006 . None of the animals they shoot are protected species, but the timing of the trip is unfortunate given William’s participation in next week’s high-profile Government-hosted conference on the illegal wildlife trade. Kensington Palace officials have been privately and publicly pushing his role as one of the most important he has undertaken since leaving the military last year. The future king is due to attend a symposium at London Zoo on Wednesday as well as a reception at the Natural History Museum, followed by the conference itself a day later at Lancaster House along with his father, Prince Charles. Holiday: The Duke of Cambridge has been shooting boar and stags at an estate in Spain . The conference has been organised to highlight the sickening rise in poaching of animals such as rhino and elephant and the way the international community can respond to this. According to reports, William and Harry flew into Seville separately on Thursday before leaving for the estate with four male friends, one girl and some Scotland Yard protection officers. The 37,000-hectare property is teeming with wildlife including wild boar and stag which William and Harry, both crack shots, are said to be keen to bag. The brothers try to go shooting on the estate together at least once a year and the Duke of Westminster, who is William’s godfather, instructs his staff to lay on every conceivable luxury. Brothers: William was joined by Prince Harry on the trip to the Duke of Westminster's estate . Beaters and packs of dogs are brought in to ensure that the princes do not return home without several ‘kills’ to their name. On a previous visit they were said to have bagged a staggering 740 partridge in a single day. It is understood that William’s wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, and their son, Prince George, remained at home after their a luxury holiday in the Caribbean last week. She has joined the party in previous years. The royals are staying in a ten-bedroom villa, one of three luxurious hunting lodges. A Kensington Palace spokesman last night declined to talk about the trip, but said: ‘The Duke of Cambridge has for many years been a passionate advocate for endangered wildlife and has campaigned tirelessly to help stop the illegal poaching of rhino horn and elephant tusk. ‘His track record in this area speaks for itself.’","William and brother Harry are at country estate in Cordoba, southern Spain .

"'Maths' and 'mesmerising' aren’t words you often hear in the same sentence. But these dancing shapes, created by student Dave Whyte, could change your view on the beauty hidden in numbers. Mr Whyte’s GIFs have been swirling, bouncing and twisting their way around the internet for a number of years – but his latest creations are the most spellbinding yet. The Dublin-based student began a Tumblr called Bees & Bombs in 2011 on which he published his own quirky GIFs drawing inspiration from films. But then he stumbled on an open source programming language called Processing, which is designed to help people create images and animations. 'I was initially inspired by http://dvdp.tumblr.com/, I was absolutely blown away when I discovered his work first,' Mr Whyte told MailOnline. 'My first geometric GIFS were shameless imitations of his.' Using his background in mathematics and physics, Mr Whyte began exploring something known as motion geometry to create fascinating shapes. In this series, his minimalistic use of shapes and colour draw attention to motion, symmetry and ordered patterns. Processing is an open source language designed to help people create images and animations. It was initially created to serve as a software sketchbook and to teach computer programming fundamentals using images. But the software has now evolved. Today, it is used by artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who to create animations and test out their prototype designs. From a hexagon wave, to moving coloured cubes and rainbow spirals, each of the student's designs reveal structured rules drawn from equations. Mr Whyte is keen to share his methods and frequently posts source code and tips to help other artists on Twitter. 'My process is basically that I come up with a fully-formed idea and try to get it into GIF form before I've forgotten it,' said Mr Whyte. 'After a quick sketch in pen (and sometimes a bit of trigonometry) I code the GIF the programming language Processing.' He is now focusing more on his artistic side of his work, using maths to create designs that are both beautiful and hypnotising. The designer claims to be able to see his animation before he creates them. He then makes changes to colour, timing and measurements during the production process. 'I can see the GIF format itself dying in the future: it was standardised in the 80s and feels like it,' said Mr Whyte. 'For most uses you end up with very big files or very low quality. But it's so widely supported so it'll be a while before it's gone. 'But as far as people making short little abstract animations, I can't see any reason why they'd ever stop, even if we need to switch to a more modern format.' More animations can be seen on Mr Whyte’s Tumblr blog, which archives his work to date.","The animations were created by Dublin-based student Dave Whyte .

"Scandal: Motorists are facing huge increases in residential parking prices . Drivers are being hit with a ‘green’ tax of up to £391 a year as part of  sky-high charges simply to park in their own streets. The fees – which grade cars according to their carbon dioxide emissions – come as motorists across the country face rises of up to 400 per cent for their annual permit. Councils are also raising millions by ramping up pay-and-display charges and visitor permit prices above the rate of inflation, a survey revealed. Additionally, the hours during which drivers must pay are being extended in some areas to include evenings, Sundays and bank holidays. More than half of local authorities have raised charges in the past year, by an average of nearly 50 per cent. Edmund King, of the AA, said: ‘Raising parking charges is another attack on the motorist, who is already suffering record fuel and insurance prices.’ A survey found 57 of 96 councils had increased their charges or extended charging hours. Of the 46 which set out their higher charges, the average increase was 44 per cent. The green tax affects drivers in Islington, North London. It means those with a standard family car pay £109 a year – itself an increase from £85 last year. But more polluting cars are charged up to £391 a year, up from £200 last year. The charges apply regardless of how many miles the car is driven – meaning someone who drives a ‘greener’ car more often could pay less despite emitting more carbon dioxide. In Barnet, North London, the cost of visitors’ permits has risen by 300 per cent to £4 per car per day, and residents’ permits by 150 per cent from £40 to £100 per car. Driven to rip-off residents: Woking Council has hit motorists with a 400 per cent rise for the cost of a parking permit . Mother of three Millie Parker, 41, . from Barnet, said: ‘I can’t believe that I have to pay £100 a year to . park outside my own house.’ She revealed how she had to pay £32 so eight . friends could park for her daughter Scarlett’s birthday party. Last . year the cost was £8. ‘How do they justify such a huge . increase? If I have three other mums around for a coffee, I have to pay . £12 for three visitors’ vouchers,’ she told the Sunday Times. ‘It’s . definitely a way for the council to raise money, because there were . enough spaces under the old prices.’ In Woking, Surrey, a resident’s . permit now costs £50 a year, up from £10, a 400 per cent increase. Barnet, North London Visitor’s permits £1 per car to £4 per car 300% increase Resident’s permits £40 per car to £100 per car 150% increase . Tunbridge Wells, Kent Resident’s £20 to £40 100% increase . Woking, Surrey Resident’s £10 to £50 400% increase . Rugby, Warwickshire Pay and display 40p per hour to £1per hour 150% increase . Cambridge Resident’s permit £41 to £76 85% increase . Islington, North London Resident’s permit £85 to £109 . Bexley, south east London Resident’s £70 to £100 40% increase . Havering, Essex Residents £13.20 to £20 52% increase . Bedfordshire Pay and Display 50p to £1 for two hours 100% increase . Manchester City Centre Pay and Display £2.20 to £2.70 per hour 22% increase . Next year, Middlesbrough council will . start charging residents to park on their own street for the first time, . with each permit costing £20. In August, Westminster council . announced charges for parking in the London borough on Sundays. Motorists will also face pay-and-display charges until 8.30pm instead of . 6.30pm. Councils are supposed to set fees to . cover the costs of enforcing the restrictions, but are accused of . raising charges to make a profit. They face a High Court challenge by . campaigners, who are demanding the charges be cut. An RAC Foundation . report found councils may be acting illegally. Barnet Council said: ‘We have held . down the prices of residents’ parking for several years, but . circumstances dictate that we have to bring them in line with other . London boroughs.’ Peter Box of the Local Government . Association defended the charges. He said: ‘Money raised from parking is . retained locally for funding things like street lighting, road . maintenance and parking enforcement. Motorists who pay for parking . benefit from the things it pays for.’ Pricey: Barnet Council has slapped a 300 per cent increase on visitor's permits . Expense: A resident's permit in Barnet, pictured, costs £100 per year . Residents are being hit with a ‘green’ tax as part of sky-high charges for parking permits. To park outside their own homes, people in Islington, North London, pay according to the carbon dioxide emissions from their vehicle.

The charges apply regardless of how many miles the car is driven - meaning someone who drives a ‘greener’ car more often could pay less despite emitting more carbon dioxide.

"The woman at the center of the latest sex scandal to hit shamed Anthony Weiner has admitted that Bill and Hillary Clinton may be ‘embarrassed’ by her secret affair with the New York mayoral candidate. Weiner’s wife Huma Abedin is one of Hillary Clinton’s closest aides and has been described as a ‘second daughter’ to the former Secretary of State and her husband – while former President Clinton officiated over the Weiners’ marriage in July 2010. And Sydney Leathers, 23, a political science student who had a lengthy furtive online affair with Weiner, 48, last year, told MailOnline exclusively: ‘I have a feeling they don't like me too much right now, because obviously Bill Clinton married them and Huma works with Hillary very closely, so I'm sure it’s embarrassing.’ Weiner has so far insisted he will not step down from the mayoral race, and when asked if the Democrats should ask him to leave the party, Sydney replied: ‘I feel that most Democrats, especially Democrat women, do not want to be connected to someone like that. ‘Nancy Pelosi’s already spoken out . and I don’t think he should be representing the party, I’ll say that. I . do feel he’s a bad representation of the party. I do feel he’s sexist . and he doesn’t even realize it, he’s a sexist pig.’ Scroll down for video . Bill and Hill won't be happy: Sydney Leathers says her affair with Anthony Weiner will have 'embarrassed' them . 'Close aide: Weiner’s wife Huma Abedin, far left, is one of . Hillary Clinton’s closest aides and has been described as a ‘second . daughter’ to the former Secretary of State and her husband, pictured together, right . Last . night, a source who had worked closely with the Clintons told . MailOnline: ‘The fact is that Bill and Hillary don’t like Anthony – but . they love Huma, they adore her. She’s extremely loyal, capable and she’s . been with Hillary forever. ‘But there are now serious doubts as to why Huma would possibly put herself through this and what the benefits would be. ‘If . the Clintons phone Huma and say ‘it’s time, you have to protect . yourself’, Anthony will have to drop out of the campaign, and he will . have to drop this public flagellation – he’ll have no choice.’ Sydney, . who has spared no detail in discussing her affair with Weiner and his . obsession with her feet – as well as his fantasises about renting her a condo . in Chicago – added that she was certain that Huma was away with Hillary . during most of the times she spoke to the politician at his marital . home. She said: ‘I’m . assuming that Huma was away traveling with Hillary Clinton. I just . would assume that he wouldn’t do that while she was there. He would just . go right into his fantasy.’ The . Clintons are so close to Huma that they hosted a garden party for her . wedding with more than 300 people at their Washington D.C home in 2010, with a massive . buffet of Mideastern food and a sign with the couple's wedding date, . ""7-10-10,"" near the pool. 'I have one daughter,' said former President Clinton as he gave Huma a hug, 'But if I had a second daughter, it would Huma.' The . striking brunette, who last week stunned onlookers as she spoke out to say she would be standing by her husband amid his latest sex scandal, has been been working as Hillary's right hand since . 1996, and has been by her side through the Senate and presidential campaigns and . move to the State Department. She is also linked by many to join Hillary on a potential 2016 campaign to bid for the White House. Happily ever after - not quite: Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abdein on their wedding day on July 10, 2010 . Proud parents: Anthony Weiner and wife Huma Abdein are parents to a 16-month-old son called Jordan . Giving a speech at the party, Hillary told the crowd that it was 'love at first sight' for Weiner. And a report at the time told how the . Clintons encouraged the match between the Muslim beauty who grew up in . Saudi Arabia and the Jewish Democrat from New York City. The couple . represented, Bill said in his toast, what he wanted 'the future of the . world to be'. However, the source said: ‘Their silence now is an expression of their support for Huma, but not for Anthony.’ Like Huma, Hillary Clinton stood by her man after revelations about his sexual relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky emerged in 1998. Weiner's campaign has referred to the Clinton scandal to convince Democrats that voters can still support the mayoral candidate despite his indiscretions. And the source told MailOnline: 'The contrast between the Bill and Hillary situation to this is that it concerned a Presidency, it was prior to the midterm elections and there were a lot of policy issues on the line. 'This was a presidency that had made a serious difference on all sorts of issues, there were matters facing the country at stake, there was an incentive for Hillary to stand by her man. 'By contrast here, he's not in office and the future of the city is not at risk. As much as there is so much positive about Huma, it's not like anyone needs her to be First Lady of New York. She's already being subjected to a Senate inquiry over work payment, it's all above board and she has a right to earn a living, but you do have people now asking questions. 'hopefully this won't be an issue for Hillary, Huma should have a right to be part of any campaign she runs.' Yesterday, . Huma was visited by her mother Saleha Mahmood Abedin at her New York . home, while Weiner was seen taking their 16-month-old son Jordan out for . a walk. When asked why . she thought why Weiner wants to be mayor so badly, Sydney said: ‘I know he has a . certainly amount of money from campaign funds and that he basically had . to use it or lose it so to speak. So it was like, ‘well, might as well . run even if I’m not going to win. I’ve got all of this money to spend’ and it just gets him more attention.’ Crushingly, . Sydney said Weiner never mentioned his wife during their liaison, and . admitted that she had pondered whether their sex life was not so great, . adding ‘I would think a happily married man probably wouldn’t do that. I . would want to think so anyway. ‘It . was almost as if he wanted to pretend of that part of his life wasn’t . really happening. I never asked about her, I didn’t think that was . appropriate. Stand by your man: Huma Abedin addresses a news conference just hours after it was revealed he had been having an online affair with Sydney Leathers. She pledged to stay with her husband . Support: Saleha Mahmood Abedin arriving to Huma Abedin apartment to support her daughter in New York . ‘He never told . me he wanted to leave her, but he did hint at the fact there were some . problems or some problems with her family regarding the first scandal . and just embarrassment. I knew that everyone was upset by the first . scandal. ‘He never said he . felt bad, absolutely not. I think he feels bad when he gets caught or . feels Huma’s wrath, but I don’t think he cares at all other than that.' Interestingly, . Sydney said she believes that Weiner may get a kick out of his sexting . scandals being made public, adding: ‘I have wondered that. He may . secretly like the attention, like people knowing he can get all of these . women to talk to him. He said in a press conference he couldn’t even . remember the exact number of women he had been talking to since he . resigned from congress. ‘It . kind of felt like he was bragging to me. I do think he gets a sexual . kick out of being in the middle of this. I think he likes the attention, . I think he’s kind of an ego maniac.’ Confessing . that she feels ‘very sorry’ for Huma, Sydney sniffed: ‘I feel bad, but . then again, I’m not the one who’s married to her. Anthony should feel . much worse than I do, I think anyway. Close: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured with Huma Abdein in March 2011, has said she considers her to be like a daughter . No mention: Crushingly, . Sydney said Weiner never mentioned his wife during their liaison . ‘I . would just say I’m sorry that she’s hurt. I‘m, sorry she’s . embarrassed. If I could take it back, I would, but I can’t, so the only . thing I can do now is just to apologize. ‘She’s very beautiful, I think she’s too good for him, I really do. That’s what baffles me about them staying together. ‘I . think she seems to be a very classy sophisticated woman. He’s sleazy, a . liar, not someone that you would think a woman like that would want to . be married to, in my mind. And hugely dishonest, to say the least.’","Bill and Hillary Clinton consider Huma Abedin to be a 'second daughter'

"A ban on pupils’ packed lunches to help prop up the ‘economically bust’ school dinners system is being called for by  Government food advisers. Restaurateurs Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent argue that this would save parents £2billion a year which could then be ploughed into school canteens. And they believe that, if they cannot convince ministers to ban packed lunches, schools should police what parents give their children and confiscate unhealthy items such as sweets and fizzy drinks – although they admit it would be an uphill task. Preparations: Cooking lessons at school will be compulsory for children aged seven to 14 from September . Anti-obesity drive: Leon fast food chain founders John Vincent (left) and Henry Dimbleby (right) want pupils to be banned from bringing in packed lunches or leaving the premises at lunchtime . Mr Dimbleby said one headmaster said he had ‘other battles to fight’ when he suggested banning unhealthy snacks. The system would rely on revamped school meals to tempt children more than ‘institutional’ meat and two veg and processed food. Mr Dimbleby and Mr Vincent, who own the Leon chain of restaurants, began surveying school meals last year.

During tours of school canteens, they . were pleased to find no sign of Turkey Twizzlers - famously criticised . by Mr Oliver eight years ago - and said the meals have improved over the . past decade. But former Eton pupil Mr Dimbleby told the Sunday Times: ‘There’s still too much processed food in school canteens. Some of the meals I ate were a bit institutional - meat and two veg.’ The duo added that the Government cannot afford to invest the £60billion required to rescue the school dinner system - and that parents will have to foot the bill to solve the problem.

"A new study has found arsenic could help cut breast cancer deaths . It is notoriously poisonous but arsenic may help cut the number of deaths from breast cancer, research suggests. A new study carried out in Chile has linked the chemical element with a 50 per cent drop in breast cancer deaths. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, hailed their findings 'astonishing', indicating further trials could pave the way for new treatments. The study focused on a region in the South American country where residents had been inadvertently exposed to high levels of arsenic - a naturally occurring element found in many minerals. Instead of noting a rise in death rates, researchers found breast cancer deaths were cut in half during the period coinciding with high arsenic exposure. The effect was more pronounced among women under the age of 60, with mortality reduced in this group by 70 per cent. Lead author, professor Allan Smith, said: 'What we found was astonishing. 'We've been studying the long-term effects of arsenic in this population for many years, focusing on increased disease and mortality attributed to the historical exposure to arsenic in this population.' In 1958, the northern Chilean city of Antofagasta switched to a geothermal water source originating in the Andes mountains. Years later, it was discovered that the water sources contained more than 800 micrograms per litre of arsenic - 80 times higher than the levels recommended by the World Health Organisation. An arsenic removal plant was installed in 1970 after some residents began to show the toxic effects from exposure. As part of the study, researchers at the Stanford Cancer Institute found human breast cancer cells grown in the lab are killed by arsenic. And normal breast cells were also found to be more resistant to the chemical. The medicinal use of arsenic is not entirely new. A new study carried out in Chile has linked the chemical element with a 50 per cent drop in breast cancer deaths. The disease is pictured under the microscope .

Arsenic trioxide was approved in 2000 by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., as an effective treatment for a rare type of leukaemia. So should the chemical be used to treat breast cancer? Professor Smith said: 'Not yet. We do not know if the treatment will work, but carefully designed clinical trials should take place as soon as possible based on this new evidence.' The team of scientists are in the process of designing clinical trials, in which some advanced breast cancer patients would be given arsenic treatment. The study was published in the open-access journal EBioMedicine.","Study in north Chile found chemical is linked to 50 per cent drop in deaths .

"The ‘cowboy’ parking scandal deepened last night as official figures showed that nearly 100 private firms are applying to buy drivers’ personal details from the DVLA. The government quango, which holds details of all registered vehicle keepers in the UK, was accused of generating millions from the lucrative private parking business by selling information about innocent motorists to dozens of companies. Critics even alleged the agency had broken data protection laws by divulging details of motorists’ names and addresses to ‘rogue firms’, who pursue people mercilessly over unpaid parking fines. Quango: The DVLA (based in Swansea, pictured) has been accused of generating millions from lucrative private parking business by selling information about innocent motorists to dozens of companies . According to the DVLA’s own figures, it received 1,898,000 electronic requests for personal information from 26 parking enforcement companies in 2012/13. By last year, 2013/14, this had soared to an astonishing 2,430,000 electronic applications for drivers’ details from 68 firms. And the figure is set to rise still further with the number of companies who will make such requests during 2014/15 predicted to be 92. Campaigners say that unless the Government cracks down on cowboy parking firms, the number of firms making personal information data requests about drivers will exceed 100 in 2015/2016. etails on the firms seeking information are set out in a DVLA document called ‘Who DVLA shares data with’. It shows how dozens of parking firms, apparently attracted by the huge profits on offer, are seeking private information about motorists who allegedly owe  them fines. Last year the DVLA – or Driving and . Vehicle Licensing Agency – collected £6.7million from parking firms . seeking personal details. Millions of names and addresses were sold . at £2.50 a time, often to firms that levy parking charges on drivers . using privately-owned car parks at NHS hospitals, supermarkets, shopping . centres and even tourist attractions. The rise in the number of parking . companies seeking drivers’ details from the DVLA follows the ban on . clamping, which came into force in October 2012, and a change in the law . which allows parking operators to pursue motorists for the payment of . tickets rather than having to identify the driver at the time. The 2,430,000 requests for driver information last year represents a ten-fold rise from the 272,000 made in 2006/7. In addition, a further 10.2million records were passed on to local authorities and other official bodies such as the police and government departments last year. The data is contained in the DVLA’s own publication, ‘Release of information from DVLA’s registers’. Opinion: Retired Scotland Yard Superintendent Bernie Gravett said the DVLA should not be selling people's data to these 'dodgy companies' Professor Stephen Glaister, of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘The DVLA says it will only share data with those who show “reasonable cause” for having it. ‘But when you annually dish out nearly 2.5million records to parking companies – not to mention millions more to councils, insurance firms and finance businesses – how many checks is the agency able to make to ensure those getting our private information are using it responsibly and being fair to the motorists they’re trying to penalise?’ He added: ‘Just because we have seen the back of clamping we shouldn’t think this is the end of parking disputes on private land. The official data suggests more and more parking companies are turning to ticketing. ‘Ministers will say personal data will . only be sold to those firms that can show “reasonable cause” and are . members of a government-recognised trade association. 'What we have always argued for is complete regulation of this currently unregulated area. Companies need to be held to official account whether they are part of a trade body or not.’ Tory MP Michael Ellis, who in 2011 supported the ban on private wheel clampers and sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said he has ‘grave concerns’ about how the DVLA is selling drivers’ details. ‘These rogue parking firms are making the lives of innocent motorists a misery,’ he said. ‘The DVLA has a lot of serious questions to answer. It appears the trade in people’s private information is getting out of control.’ Retired Scotland Yard Superintendent . Bernie Gravett said: ‘You can only release personal data for lawful . purposes. In my view, the pursuit of dubious parking fines, dodgy . companies using quasi-official forms and threats does not amount to . lawful purposes. ‘The Data Protection Act is there to . protect your data and the DVLA should be beyond reproach in protecting . it. It [the DVLA] should not be selling it to these companies.’ 'These rogue parking firms are making the lives of innocent motorists a misery. The DVLA has a lot of serious questions to answer. It appears the trade in people's private information is getting out of control' Michael Ellis, Tory MP . The DVLA says on its website that it manages ‘a vast amount of data to help keep Britain’s motorists moving safely and legally’. It adds: ‘In addition to providing information to the police and local authorities, the properly controlled release of DVLA data to third parties offers a host of practical motoring benefits … DVLA will only release information when it is lawful and fair to do so.’ A DVLA spokesman said: ‘We take our responsibility to protect information seriously … information is only provided under strict controls to parking firms who meet the standards set by an appropriate Accredited Trade Association and are compliant with its Code of Practice.’ He added: ‘If … a company does not meet the necessary standards, we will investigate. If the allegations are proven we will stop the release of keeper information to them.’","Critics alleged agency had divulged details of motorists to 'rogue firms'

"Klu Klux Klan members may have infiltrated groups supporting Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, it can be disclosed. Supporters for Darren Wilson have removed a photograph from their Facebook page in which activist group Anonymous claim to identify three members of the Ku Klux Klan. Anonymous seized two of the Ku Klux Klan’s twitter accounts yesterday after the Klan distributed fliers threatening the use of ‘lethal force’ should violence erupt in the wake of Ferguson Grand Jury’s decision on whether to indict Wilson. Now, as part of Anon Cop Watch, the group has circulated numerous photographs ‘unhooding’ Klan members. Among them is one showing 13 members of the St Louis Klan. It is set shown alongside an image of a rally held in support of Darren Wilson rally in which, they claim, three Klan members feature prominently. Scroll down for video .

There is no suggestion than any KKK presence was known to organisers . Out in the open: The full picture of the KKK group posted by the Anonymous group. Tensions: Michael Brown (left) was shot dead in August by officer Darren Wilson (right) in Ferguson, Missouri, sparking massive protests over the death. A grand jury is deciding whether to indict him . One of them appears to be Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Missouri and the man behind the recent fliers. It is just the latest escalation of the racial tensions that were ignited this summer when officer Wilson shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown, 18. Protesters adopted the slogan ‘Hands Up Don’t Shoot’ - a reference to witness accounts claiming that Brown had his hands up when Wilson let off his fatal volley on August 9. Less than two minutes elapsed between Wilson, 28, stopping Brown and friend, Dorian Johnson, as they walked down the middle of Canfield Road which snakes down from the main drag of West Florissant, and shooting Brown dead. In the three months since that day Ferguson has been riven by violence, protest, gunfire and looting. Brown’s own parents have consistently distanced themselves from the violence that saw protesters and police clash as battle lines were drawn near the scene of the shooting across night after night of riots. But, with the Ferguson Grand Jury expected to deliver its verdict on whether or not to indict Wilson on a murder charge this week, the FBI have described violent civil unrest as ‘inevitable.’ Tensions: Demonstrations are already taking place in Ferguson, Missouri, with calls for Darren Wilson to be indicted by the grand jury, which meets again on Friday, over the killing of Michael Brown . Flashpoint: Ferguson is expecting more demonstrations when the grand jury ends it deliberations . Divide: Although most demonstrations have been pro-Michael Brown some, such as this woman's protest, have been in support of Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown to death . Governor Jay Nixon’s decision to declare a State of Emergency and activated the National Guard on Monday was seen by many as confirmation that a decision from the Grand Jury is imminent. And prosecutor Bob McCulloch has always maintained that a verdict would be reached by mid to late November. But leaks reported by the St Louis Dispatch, which suggest that the officer will not be indicted, have only heightened the likelihood of violent reprisal. As MailOnline reported, ‘militant resistance group’ the Black Rebels has boasted of being ‘war ready,’ and stockpiling high caliber ammunition. While the Ku Klux Klan leaflets distributed in Ferguson and the surrounding towns suggest a similar readiness for violence.","Activist group Anonymous claim to have identified Frank Ancona, Imperial Wizard of the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK .

Miss Del Rey's attacker emerges half way through the footage, throwing her to the bed and slamming her face into the pillows. As Miss Del Rey struggles to shake off him off, the man twists her arm round behind her back causing her to cry out, before pinning her down with his hand clamped over her open mouth, then forcing himself upon her. As he stalks away, Miss Del Rey can be seen crumpled on the floor, her eyes streaming with tears.

Incidentally, there were rumors of a fling between Miss Del Rey and Mr Manson, real name Brian Warner, in 2012, after they were allegedly spotted spending time together in a hotel in Berlin, Germany. And speaking to Complex Magazine earlier this year, the two-time Grammy nominee let her fans in on the sort of relationships she was drawn to. 'I like a physical love.

"A 19-year-old college student is facing the terrifying prospect of possibly losing her hands and feet after being found unconscious and suffering from extreme hypothermia on the porch of a Duluth, Minnesota, home. Alyssa Jo Lommel was found by passersby Saturday morning after spending the night outside in subzero temperatures. Duluth police say Lommel was at Regions Hospital in St. Paul Monday. Her condition was described as ’stable critical.’ Scroll down for video . Frozen: Alyssa Jo Lommel, 19, was found unconscious by passersby after spending nine hours outside in subzero temperatures . Lommel was dropped off by her friends outside her home in Duluth, Minnesota, after a night of drinking, but she somehow ended up on the porch of her neighbors' house . Frigid weather: Temperatures in Duluth had dipped to -16 to -18, with a -36 wind chill Friday night into Saturday . Police say Lommel, a sophomore at the University of Minnesota Duluth, was found unconscious on the porch of her neighbor's house just after 9.30am Saturday. She had been dropped off at her home in Duluth at about midnight after reportedly spending a night with friends doing tequila shots. Lommel's parents, Jay and Teri Lommel of St. Cloud, told the St. Cloud Times their daughter suffered significant damage to her hands and feet and could lose one or more of them. Temperatures in Duluth had dipped to -16 to -18, with a -36 wind chill Friday night into Saturday. The student's mother, Teri Lommel, described her daughter's condition as 'very much a wait-and-see thing.' 'We are hopeful that her body will heal itself,' she told SC Times. Dangerous condition: Alyssa Jo suffered severe injuries to her hands and feet from exposure, and her parents say doctors are fighting to save her limbs from amputation . The parents have set up a page on the site CaringBridge.org offering updates on Alyssa Jo's condition. Mrs Lommel wrote Tuesday afternoon that doctors have been testing the circulation in her limbs in order to reduce swelling and hopefully avoid amputation. The 19-year-old has already undergone surgery to restore blood flow to one of her arms, and she may require skin grafts to repair the damage to her extremities. The Lommels also posted a note on the site thanking the couple who spotted their daughter lying on the porch. ‘We owe Alyssa’s life to you two. Our family cannot be grateful enough that you happened to see her,’ the missive read. ‘She could not have survived much longer out in the elements. You two will forever be in our hearts and prayers and we cannot thank you enough for what you did.’ On Friday, Miss Lommel, a sophomore majoring in psychology and sociology, posted a message on her Twitter account that said, 'tequila shots tonight.' It has since been removed. According to Minneapolis Star Tribune citing a police report, the 19-year-old got home from work at around 5.30pm and had a bagel for dinner. Party girl: Police say Lommel attended a party where she and her friends played a drinking game and she consumed at least 10 tequila shots . Premonition: Friday afternoon, Alyssa Jo tweeted that she was planning to have tequila shots that night . At around 10.30pm, she and a roommate went to a friend's house, where they played a drinking game with cards called 'ride the bus.' The report states that the underage girl lost several rounds and had to take shots. Police reported finding a Twitter message on Lommel's account stating: 'Yum Yum 10th shot of tequila,' Grand Forks Herald reported. Her roommate told police that Lommel had been taking medication for an unspecified illness every day. At around 11pm, the sophmore was picked up by her friends, who drove her home and dropped her off outside her front door at 810 Woodland Avenue, but left without waiting for her to go inside. Alyssa Jo's companions later told investigators that the 19-year-old was tipsy but not intoxicated to the point of falling down. She was said to have her keys and cell phone in her possession. Two of Lommel's roommates returned home a few hours later without noticing that the girl was not there. Neither reported hearing knocks on the door. Then at around 9.30am the following morning, Ellen Johnson and her boyfriend, Sam Salo, were driving down the street when she spotted a woman lying on a porch and called police, Duluth News Tribune reported. Officers who responded to the scene at 808 Woodland Avenue discovered Alyssa Jo lying unconsious on her right side. Touch and go: Alyssa Jo's parents, Teri and Jay Lommel (pictured) have set up an online journal offering updates on their daughter's condition, which her mother described as 'wait-and-see' She was wearing a coat and UGG boots, but no gloves, and her hands were three times their normal size, with skin split from palm to finger. Officers followed Lommel's tracks in the snow around the house, showing that the college student made her way to the unheated garage, where she likely sought refuge from the cold for a while, fell down and then crawled back to the porch. The house stood empty that night since its occupants, members of UMD women's basketball team, were out on the road. The UMD released a statement urging students to be careful in extremely cold weather, dress in layers, travel in groups and let people know when planning to go out.","Alyssa Jo Lommel, sophomore at University of Minnesota, is in 'stable critical' condition after spending nine hours unconscious on neighbors' porch .

"There was disappointment for motorists today as fuel duty was frozen rather than reduced, but good news for owners of Reliant Robins, which are now classed as classic cars exempt from road tax. Chancellor George Osborne announced that the planned September fuel duty rise will not take place, but he resisted calls to cut duty - to the disappointment of campaign and motoring groups. The AA said the freeze on duty, for a fourth year, was 'very welcome relief for UK drivers'. Scroll down for video . Expense: There was disappointment for motorists today as fuel duty was frozen rather than reduced leaving British car owners paying the highest proportion of tax in Europe . However, AA president Edmund King went on: 'The freeze still leaves the squeeze on families and businesses that rely on four wheels to function and prosper. 'Now that we know, from official figures, that inflation-hit earnings are effectively at 2002 levels and car use is struggling to revive, perhaps a short-term cut in fuel duty would have got the UK properly mobile again.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'The good news is that fuel duty has now been frozen since March 2011. The bad news is that the UK's 37 million drivers still pay the highest proportion of petrol and diesel tax in Europe. 'The Treasury's own analysis shows cuts to duty would boost the nation's economic output. 'Yet the stubbornly high pump prices mean transport costs remain a real concern for the record 18 million people who rely on a car to get to work. 'For those offered low paid employment . there is a real question mark over whether they can afford to take it . up with travel still so expensive.'

Under earlier rules only cars built before January 1 1973 were exempt from vehicle excise duty. But Mr Osborne said a new 40-year rule would be introduced from April 1 2014, meaning newer models will now be exempt. It includes the Reliant Robin, Austin Allegro and MGB V, and could see their market value rise as a result.

But he added: 'The drip, drip of funding does not address the £10 billion road maintenance backlog that councils themselves have identified. It is also disappointing that this money has to be bid for. This creates a bureaucratic burden and means not all councils and drivers will see the benefits.' The Chancellor also said that the two per cent increase in company car tax would be extended to 2017 and 2018, but there would be an increase in discounts for ultra-low emission vehicles and there will be a reduction in the rate of fuel duty for ethanol.","The planned September fuel duty rise will not take place, says Chancellor .

"Homeowners who fitted solar panels will soon be left out of pocket according to a leaked document which reveals the government is planning to slash the amount of money it pays for generating renewable energy. In an embarrassing slip-up, the Energy Savings Trust charity accidentally published confidential details of proposals to cut renewable energy payments by more than 50 per cent. It would mean the amount the average household receives for generating solar energy would fall from £1,190 to £640. Cuts: Homeowners with solar roof panels will see the amount of money they are paid by the government slashed by 50 per cent according to a leaked document . Government energy ministers are expected to announce the cuts in Parliament on Monday. Earlier . week Climate Change minister Greg Barker said he believed that tariffs . paid by government needed to reflect the falling cost of solar . technology. Climate change minister Greg barker said tariffs need to reflect the falling cost of solar technology . According to the leaked document the new . tariffs could be brought in as early as December 8 and would see . payments fall from the current 43.3p per kilowatt hour to just 21p for surplus electricity fed back into the national grid. The . Energy Savings Trust quickly withdrew the document but not before the . news had spread causing widespread concern amongst homeowners and . companies which install solar panels. A . spokesman for the charity said: 'We’ve been working on a draft consumer . guidance document in relation to the Fast Track Review of Feed in . Tariffs for Solar PV to pre-empt the Government consultation which is . expected next week. 'Preparing . advice on a potential announcement was the responsible thing to do as . the leading consumer advice body in this area. Unfortunately, due to a . technical error this document was made available for search.' Industry . experts believe that if the new tariffs are introduced it could put . dozens of firms out of business and cost as many as 25,000 jobs. They also point out it will effectively discourage people from adopting solar and other renewable energy technologies. Homeowners . with cash to spare can pay for solar equipment themselves and receive . up to £1,000 a year from the government subsidy and electricity savings. Those . unable to cover the cost of the equipment upfront can sign up with . solar technology firms and effectively rent out their rooftops so the . companies pay for the panels and the benefits are split. Solar . businesses are now calling on energy ministers to reconsider Monday's . scheduled announcement, in which they are expected to confirm the leak. Slip up: The document was leaked after a 'technical error' on the Energy Savings Trust website . Shaun Taylor, managing director of Buckinghamshire-based SolarTech, posted on the ClickGreen website: 'If this leak proves accurate then the Government will be condemning tens of thousands of residents in social housing to continued fuel poverty as there is no way that 'free PV' schemes will now be financially viable. 'The impact on employment will also be enormous as the industry had forecast 20,000 to 30,000 jobs would be created in this sector. 'If the Government's plan was to add to unemployment, close businesses, leave thousands in fuel poverty and miss our European Carbon Reduction Targets then job done! Let’s hope that this leak doesn’t turn out to be accurate and drown the industry.'

"The manager of an Iowa fast food restaurant has lost her job after a customer posted pictures of the woman making food in the kitchen barefoot and sweating. The Des Moines Register reports that 31-year-old Melinda Halvorsen was fired from the Taco John's restaurant in Charles City in August after Danielle Tiesmessen posted the picture to Facebook. Tiesmessen says she was in Charles City Taco John's when she saw Halvorsen enter the food preparation area with no shoes, gloves or uniform. Food prep nightmare: A customer took this photo of the manager of a Charles City Taco John's preparing food while barefoot and allegedly sweaty . 'This is in Charles City Iowa Taco John’s!! This woman was preparing food with bare feet, no uniform, her bra and chest hanging out all over the place, she was pouring sweat, wiping it off with her hands and not washing them. 'I asked for the manager — she WAS the manager!! She was extremely rude because I was upset with her appearance and behavior,' Tiesmessen posted along with the picture. According to the Des Moines Register, Halvorsen, a team leader who was employed at the restaurant for five years, had mowed the grass outside the franchise prior to entering the restaurant. She was apparently preparing food for herself and some friends when Tiesmessen spotted her. After the franchise owner Linda Johnson reviewed security footage of the incident, Halvorsen was fired for her conduct, which violated company policy as well as state health regulations. She also failed to pay for the food she prepared for herself and her friends. Halvorsen recently lost her appeal to collect unemployment benefits because officials ruled she violated health codes and hurt the restaurant's business. Barefoot in the kitchen: Charles City Taco John's franchisee Linda Johnson says her business has suffered after the picture of Halvorsen went viral . Taco John's is a fast food restaurant chain that serves Mexican inspired food (what the company has trademarked as 'West-Mex') in 25 states around the central and north central section of the United States. Franchisee Johnson says business has declined more than 25 per cent since the August 8 incident and that her franchise agreement with Taco John's could be in jeopardy because of Halvorsen's conduct. Tiesmessen's photo quickly went viral around the Midwest, garnering media attention and more than 1,000 negative comments about Taco John's. The picture appears to have been removed from the Taco John's site where it was initially posted.","A team leader at a Taco John's has been fired for preparing food while barefoot and sweating .

"Mattel has pulled its Barbie book titled I Can Be a Computer Engineer, after it triggered outrage over the 'sexist' and 'patronizing' message it sends to young girls. The $4 book, which was published by Random House and is aimed at three to seven-year-olds, was labeled 'misogynistic' by parents for its plot line, which sees Barbie - supposedly a computer engineer - make several technical blunders before turning to her male friends for help. Mattel has  apologized for the book in a post on the Barbie Facebook page, saying: 'The portrayal of Barbie in this specific story doesn’t reflect the Brand’s vision for what Barbie stands for. We believe girls should be empowered to understand that anything is possible and believe they live in a world without limits. Sexist? A Barbie book entitled I Can Be a Computer Engineer (pictured) sees the famous blonde doll make a number of technical blunders before getting her male friends to fix them all . 'We apologize that this book didn't reflect that belief. All Barbie titles moving forward will be written to inspire girl's imaginations and portray an empowered Barbie character.' The book, written by author Susan Marenco and sold on Amazon since 2013, opens with Barbie 'hard at work' on her laptop, as she explains to her sister Skipper: 'I'm only creating the design ideas. I'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a real game!' One irate reviewer wrote on Amazon: 'Literally six sentences into the story, and already Barbie can NOT do it. 'She immediately admits she doesn't know how to actually do computer engineering, and like a Disney princess, needs a white knight to rescue her.' Wheel in the men: Barbie, while 'hard at work' on her laptop,  explains to her sister Skipper (pictured), 'I'm only creating the design ideas. I'll need Steven's and Brian's help to turn it into a real game!' The next scene sees Barbie get hit with a 'weird' virus on her laptop, before borrowing her sister's computer to finish her work, only to inadvertently infect hers too. Having lost all of Skipper's 'unsaved' homework and music files, Barbie announces she is sorry, but she has to 'run off to school now.' Skipper 'playfully hits Barbie with a pillow,' and Barbie heads to school for a computer lesson from her glamorous female computer teacher. But alas, things don't start looking up until she turns to her two male friends for help. Pillow fight: The next scene sees Barbie (right) get hit with a 'weird' virus on her laptop, before borrowing Skipper's (left) computer to finish her work, only to inadvertently infect hers too . Speed is of the essence: Despite taking a computer lesson as school, things don't start looking up until Barbie enlists the help of two male friends (pictured) who can fix the issue 'faster' 'It will go faster if Brian and I help,' suggests Steven, before he and Brian fix the virus and retrieve all of Skipper's files. Barbie then heads home to 'surprise' her sister with the good news. 'You are just too cool Barbie! You fixed my computer and saved my homework!' Skipper exclaims. Reviewer Rachel Appel points out: 'Barbie takes 100per cent of the credit for fixing something to which she contributed nothing.' She adds: 'I work as a software engineer, which is a male dominated field. 'It is exactly these stereotypes and portrayals of girls like the one in this book that are the driving force behind the lack of girls wanting to enter these lucrative technology fields.' Steven saves the day: The book, written by author Susan Marenco, was published in June 2013 by Random House and is aimed at three to seven-year-olds . Sister act: In one of the final plot-twists, Barbie seemingly takes all the credit for fixing Skipper's laptop, despite Brian and Steven actually doing all the work . Another reviewer, also a computer engineer, writes: 'As the father of two daughters who are both in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields, my only recommendation for this book would be to set it on fire.' The only customer to defend the book, wrote: 'All you feminists in uproar over Barbie asking for her male friends' help in this book don't even fit the profile for buying a Barbie book. 'It's called free speech! Not every woman is just as competent as some men in certain areas and vice versa.' One female computer programmer by the name of Kathleen Tuite, based in Santa Cruz, California, set up a comical blog entitled Feminist Hacker Barbie, which invites users to re-write pages from the book.

Old friends: Pope Francis greets Queen Letizia with a warm smile in Rome this morning . Queen Letizia bowed as she greeted Pope Francis on the second day of the Second International Conference on Nutrition . This is not the first time that these two have met, in fact Queen Letizia's first Royal engagement was a trip to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican in June . The royal had been invited to speak at the Second International Conference on Nutrition, by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation in whose headquarters the event was held. She spoke to an audience of politicians and VIP representatives from 190 countries around the world on the second day of the conference. The Pope also spoke and demanded that more be done about the distribution of the world's bounty for the poor and hungry. He told the conference that access to food is a basic human right that shouldn't be subject to market speculation and quests for profit. Ahead of today's event, the Spanish royal couple had met with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment, Isabel Garcia Tejerina. Since Felipe ascended to the throne in June, the couple have visited eight different countries together - and Italy twice.

"The Army private charged with sending U.S secrets to the website WikiLeaks had a history of suicidal thoughts and aloof behavior that outweighed a psychiatrist's opinion that he posed no risk to himself, two former counselors testified Sunday. Army Staff Sergeant Ryan Jordan and Marine Master Sergeant Craig Blenis testified on the sixth day of a pre-trial hearing for Private First Class Bradley Manning at Fort Meade, near Baltimore, Maryland. The hearing is to determine whether Manning's nine months in pre-trial confinement at the Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Virginia, were so punishing that the judge should dismiss all charges. His turn on the stand: Bradley Manning seen arriving at a courthouse at military base Fort Meade, Maryland before testifying about the treatment he received during his two-years in prison . Accused: Bradley Manning, 24, is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in American history . The 24-year-old intelligence analyst is accused of sending hundreds of thousands of classified documents to the secret-spilling website in 2009 and 2010. Military judge Colonel Denise Lind recessed the hearing until Wednesday. It's scheduled to run through December 12. The counselors, both of whom worked in the brig, sat on a board that recommended to the brig commander that Manning remain in maximum custody and on either injury-prevention or suicide-risk status -- conditions that kept him confined to his cell 23 hours a day, sometimes with no clothing. Jordan said under cross-examination by defense attorney David Coombs that besides the mental-health report, he considered evidence that Manning had contemplated suicide after his arrest in Iraq in May 2010. The evidence included a noose Manning had fashioned from a bedsheet while confined in Kuwait, and a written statement he made upon arrival at Quantico in July 2010 that he was 'always planning and never acting' on suicidal impulses. In cuffs: Wikileaks suspect Bradley Manning, centre, is escorted from his hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland . Jordan acknowledged Manning had been a polite, courteous and nearly trouble-free detainee at Quantico. ‘Wouldn't his past six months of performance be an indicator of his potential for future behavior?’ Coombs asked. But Jordan maintained that Manning's unwillingness to converse with him and other brig staff was a warning sign he was at risk of self-harm. Jordan said he considered the opinion of the brig psychiatrist, Navy Capt. William Hocter, that Manning was no longer at risk of self-harm. But Jordan said the weight he gave to Hocter's views was tempered by the fact that another detainee had recently killed himself after his custody status was reduced on Hocter's advice. 'I would consider it, but I would always consider it with care, sir,' he told Coombs. Blenis, who spent more time with Manning, said Manning chose not to speak most of the time except for short, yes-or-no answers. He said Manning spurned his offers to play chess or work brain teasers by arrogantly responding, 'They're a little below my level.' ‘I've got a person not communicating with me that's sitting in his cell, not doing anything,’ Blenis said. He said he supported the brig commander's decision in March 2011 to strip Manning of all clothing at night and place him on suicide watch after Manning told another staffer that if he really wanted to kill himself, he could use the elastic waistband on his underwear. ‘If someone tells me they're going to shoot themselves in the face, I'm not going to give them a gun,’ Blenis said. Turning the guns: The young soldier's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning . Defence: In this courtroom sketch, Bradley Manning, second from left, sits as his attorney, David E. Coombs, demands that the investigating officer, Lt Colonel Paul Almanza, recuse himself from the case . Later Sunday, the defense showed an approximately 12-minute video clip of Blenis talking with Manning through the bars of his cell about the detainee's frustration with his situation in January 2011. ‘Every day that passes by I'm getting increasingly frustrated,’ Manning told him. Manning was moved in April 2011 to pre-trial confinement at Fort Leavenworth, Kan. He's been held there in medium custody since then. Earlier Sunday, the military judge said Manning's trial, previously set to begin February 4, would be pushed back to sometime in March due to lengthy pre-trial proceedings. Manning is charged with 22 offenses, including aiding the enemy, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

"A detective with Arizona's state police force has been left with no option but to resign after discovering that she was living in the country illegally having been brought to the U.S. from Mexico by her family at a young age. Former detective, Carmen Figueroa, had always been told by her family that she was born in the U.S., even though she was actually born in Sinaloa, Mexico, Department of Public Safety spokesman Bart Graves said on Wednesday. Figueroa's status was discovered when the State Department processed a passport application submitted by her brother, who is serving in the U.S. military. Arizona's state police agency detective Carmen Figueroa was forced to resign from her post following the discovery that she was in the United States illegally after being brought from Mexico at a young age . Figueroa, 42, resigned on Monday but would have been fired if she hadn't stepped down, Graves said. A criminal investigation continues. Arizona law requires sworn police officers to be U.S. citizens, and Graves said the state police agency would have terminated her for fraud and misrepresentation for ‘not meeting the qualifications.’ Figueroa worked in southern Arizona and was with the department for 10 years, most of that time as a Tucson-based Highway Patrol officer. She became a criminal investigations detective in 2010. ‘She told us she was always under the impression through her mother that she was born in this country, and she did not really find out until this summer... that she was an illegal alien through, I believe, a confrontation with her mother,’ said Graves. Figueroa ‘had an exemplary record’ and the circumstances of her departure don't put any investigations or prosecutions at risk, Graves said. Efforts to reach Figueroa for comment were not immediately successful. Calls to a Tucson-area phone listed under her name were not answered, and Graves said he did not know whether she has an attorney. He said the Department of Public Safety was informed of Figueroa's status on August 22, and she was placed on administrative leave with pay on September 4. ‘It was pretty clear as it went up the chain (of command) that she would be terminated,’ he said. According to Graves, Figueroa previously worked for the federal Bureau of Prisons as a secretary and for the Pima County court system as a secretary and an officer. When Figueroa was hired to the state police force, she submitted a birth certificate from Texas and a driver's license and high school diploma from California, Graves said. There was nothing suspicious at the time about the documents, but Graves declined to discuss whether authorities now question the legitimacy of any of the papers. However, he said, ‘we are absolutely having in-depth discussions right now to prevent this from happening again.’","Carmen Figueroa had always been told by her family that she was born in the U.S.

"Mixed blessing: This wrenching pictures shows Josh holding his newborn son Logan for the first and last time . A 24-year-old Utah college student died on Friday after living just long enough to hold his newborn son before slipping into a sudden coma from which he’d never wake up. Brigham Young University student and Mormon seminary teacher Josh Robison fell ill just hours after holding his son Logan for the first time and then suddenly lost consciousness.

Robison . and his wife of 18 months, Erica, were excited to embark on their new . life as parents when Josh came down with flu-like symptoms while . spending the Thanksgiving holiday with his parents in Fillmore, Utah. Doctors eventually discovered he was suffering from a treatable staph infection, according to KSL.com. ‘It took a few days until they traced that to a valve in his heart,’ said Josh’s grieving mother Jodi Robison.

"An astronaut uploaded photos taken outside Earth's orbit of a 'supermoon' to Twitter Sunday. Oleg Artemyev, a Russian astronaut currently stationed inside the International Space Station, shared the photos of a 'moonset' - which capture the moon passing the Earth, Sky reported. The 'supermoon' is set to accompany this year's Perseid meteor shower, one of the most anticipated events on the skywatcher's calendar. Given a dark, clear sky in a normal year, it is common to see more than 100 of the meteors an hour during the second week in August. But this year the Perseids have a bright shining rival. On Sunday, two days before the meteor shower reaches its peak, the moon will become full. It has already been seen overhead in China, Australia and New Zealand. Beautiful: The 'supermoon' was seen right outside the Earth's atmosphere . Out of this world: Russian astronaut Oleg Artemyev captured the photos of the 'supermoon' Far out: Artemyev is currently stationed at the International Space Station . Hiding! Just a hint of the 'supermoon' is seen behind Earth . The 'supermoon' appeared on top of a Bleinheim, New Zealand church on Sunday . By the moonlight: The 'supermoon' sits over buildings in Hong Kong on August 10, 2014 . Magic in the moonlight: The supermoon is seen over Wanda, Australia on August 10, 2014 . Coincidentally, it will also have reached the point in its orbit that is closest to the Earth, known as 'perigee.' The supermoon will be up to 14% bigger and 30% brighter than other full moons during the year. On one level, this is bad news, according to Dr Bill Cooke from Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office. 'Lunar glare wipes out the black-velvety backdrop required to see faint meteors, and sharply reduces counts,' he said. Brightening up: The weathercock of the church of Saints Peter and Paul is pictured in front of the moon in the village of Klein-Auheim near Hanau in Germany . The debris stream left by comet Swift-Tuttle produces the Perseids . Lunar lady: The moon is seen as it rises over a statue by Harriet A. Ketcham titled 'Victory' in the statehouse complex in Des Moines, Iowa . Between two horns: The moon appears behind a Spanish fighting bull in Puerto de Santa Maria, Spain. The phenomenon, which scientists call a perigee moon, occurs when the moon is near the horizon and appears larger and brighter than other full moons . But all is not lost. The debris stream left by comet Swift-Tuttle, which produces the Perseids, is wide, so the shooting stars could make an appearance well before the moon becomes full. Dr Cooke added that the Perseids were also 'rich in fireballs as bright as Jupiter or Venus' that would remain visible despite the moon's glare. A study conducted by his team since 2008 has shown the Perseids to be the undisputed 'fireball champion' of meteor showers. Arizona: Men play on a climbing structure at Riverview Park in Mesa while the moon rises August 9, 2014, a day before the supermoon is to appear . Bright sight: Visitors look at an illuminated park from a new viewing platform in the 'Garden Park' in Bad Zwischenahn, Germany as a nearly full  moon is seen behind . Sparks fly: Sparks from fireworks in front of the moon during the Pyro Games competition in Magdeburg, Germany, where pyrotechnician compete against each other for the best rocket show . ""We see more fireballs from Swift-Tuttle than any other parent comet,"" said Dr Cooke. Tony Markham, director of the Society for Popular Astronomy's meteor section, also urged skywatchers to stay optimistic. ""The Perseids are rich in bright meteors and so many Perseids will still be seen despite the moonlit sky background,"" he wrote on the SPA's website. ""You can minimise the effect of the moonlight by observing with your back to the moon - possibly viewing the Cassiopeia/Cepheus/Ursa Minor area. ""If possible, keep the moon hidden behind trees or a nearby building."" He pointed out that at this time of year the moon is relatively close to the horizon, leaving much of the sky dark. Lunar flight: A plane is silhouetted against the moon as it is seen from Kalchreuth, Germany, 08 August 2014 . An LAX bound passenger airplane drops the wheels as it crosses the moon two days before the Full Moon and Super Moon passing over Whittier, California, on its final approach to the Los Angeles Airport, on Friday,  August 8, 2014 . Mr Markham also suggested looking at an area of sky 20 to 30 degrees away from the Perseid radiant - the spot near the constellation of Perseus that the meteors appear to fly out from. Every 133 years, comet Swift-Tuttle swings through the inner Solar System leaving behind a trail of dust. When the Earth passes through, the dust cloud particles hit the atmosphere at 140,000 mph and burn up in streaking flashes of light, creating the spectacle known as the Perseids. The best time to see the meteors is between Saturday and Wednesday, with activity peaking on Tuesday. An unusually bright full ""supermoon"" was also seen on July 12, and another is due to appear on September 9. But the supermoon of Sunday promises to be the most dramatic since this is when the moon will be at its closest point to the Earth all year. At perigee, the moon is around 31,000 miles closer than when it is furthest away from the Earth. Supermoons occur relatively often, every 13 months and 18 days, but are not always noticed because of clouds or poor weather.","Oleg Artemyev, a Russian astronaut currently stationed inside the International Space Station, shared images of the 'supermoon' on Twitter .

"Britain was facing a new multi-billion-pound bill to prop up the euro last night as the single currency teetered on the brink of collapse. Efforts by France and Germany to thrash out a rescue deal descended into chaos as a meeting of EU finance ministers scheduled for today was cancelled at the 11th hour because of lack of progress. More than £18billion was wiped off the value of shares in London in just 20 minutes when EU officials also warned that a separate make-or-break leaders’ summit today in Brussels would also fail to end the crisis. Today Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the amount of money available for a bail-out needed to increase to prevent the collapse of Greece's economy and further damage to the eurozone. Merkel said she sees no 'better alternative' to the efforts being made to protect the euro and added: 'If the euro fails, Europe fails.' David Cameron will tell the leaders' summit today that a bigger bailout fund, help for banks and support for Greece is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe . The International Monetary Fund, to which Britain is a major contributor, made clear it is prepared to step in and boost the eurozone bailout fund. That would leave British taxpayers to carry the can for those countries in the eurozone which have failed to solve their problems. George Osborne said IMF funds should not be a substitute for a 'big bazooka' deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order . Tory MPs warned that any attempt to increase Britain’s contribution would trigger a mutiny to make Monday’s rebellion on Europe, in which 81 defied the Prime Minister, look like ‘a children’s tea party’. Chancellor George Osborne has said IMF funds should not be a substitute for a ‘big bazooka’ deal by those in the single currency to get their own house in order. Britain has already forked out around £12billion to bail out Ireland, Greece and Portugal through the IMF, the EU and in direct loans. In Downing Street and the Treasury there was fury at the failure of Britain’s European partners to get their act together. David Cameron will tell the leaders’ summit today that a bigger bailout fund, help for banks and support for Greece is necessary to avoid economic catastrophe. A senior Whitehall source said yesterday: . ‘At some point they need to get around a table and sort this out. There . is still quite a lot to do. To say it is a mess would be a good . description of where we are.’ To add to the chaos, Silvio Berlusconi’s . Italian government had looked to be on the brink of collapse yesterday, . after his coalition partners initially refused to make the cuts in . spending they had been told were necessary to prevent Europe’s fourth . largest economy going belly up. A deal was eventually struck late last night, although there was scepticism over whether it would be sufficient to stave off further trouble. British diplomats warned it could take weeks to finalise plans to bolster the firepower of the £383billion eurozone rescue fund to £870billion – the amount experts say is needed to ensure the survival of the single currency if Italy, Greece, Portugal and Ireland default on their debts. Former chancellor Norman Lamont warned today of 'great dangers' with the possibility of a 'haircut' - a cut in value of a debt - for Greece. Important? Members of the European Parliament attend a debate on the state of play of the negotiations of the European Council concerning the economic crisis . Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There's a very important aspect of this and that is something called credit default swaps - the insurance policies that are taken out to safeguard people, insure people, against default by sovereign authorities like Greece. 'One of the dangers of the haircut that is being proposed is that a severe haircut will cause a credit event and will trigger credit default swaps and will therefore affect banks who hold those credit default swaps. 'That is one of the great dangers.' He added: 'I think the market has got very definite expectations about the haircut, the amount of money required to recapitalise the banks, and they are very focused on the amount of money for the bailout fund.' Lord Lamont also claimed some countries would fail to ever become 'fully competitive' in the future. He said: 'I hope that they will manage to satisfy the markets and buy some time. 'I personally think the long-term future of the euro will be argued about for some time to come because the strains there are so immense I don't believe that the southern Mediterranean countries in the long run can ever really become fully competitive.' Credit ratings issued by Moodys a week ago . Riot police battle protesters fighting anti-austerity measures in Athens, Greece last week as the nation battles to get its economy under control . British taxpayers could be hit indirectly, as eurozone officials indicated that the IMF could host a new fund to extend loans to governments at risk. Britain will have to pay 4.5 per cent of any IMF contribution. ‘The IMF has indicated that they are considering it,’ one eurozone official said. ‘The IMF is a possibility – they could be one of the investors, they could be the host of this fund.’ Talks on the plan are now under way between the eurozone and the IMF’s French chief Christine Lagarde. Treasury officials said they would fight any IMF involvement if it let Germany, France and the other members of the single currency off the hook. One said: ‘There should be adequate resources for the bailout fund but IMF loans  shouldn’t be a substitute for action from the eurozone.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It’s totally unacceptable. It’s going to be no good  the Government bragging that we’re not contributing to a euro bailout when we are going to be contributing by the back door through the IMF. ‘If George Osborne comes to the Commons to increase Britain’s contribution to the IMF, it will make Monday’s night’s rebellion look like a children’s tea party. ‘We didn’t join the euro because we knew it would be a disaster. There’s no way the British taxpayer should be bailing them out. They should get their own house in order.’ David Cameron is due in Brussels today for a summit of all 27 EU leaders before a meeting of only eurozone leaders, at which an outline solution may be thrashed out. But the cancellation of the finance ministers’ meeting means there is no prospect at all of completing the detailed number-crunching necessary to calm the markets. The FTSE 100 index rose as high as 5548 in early trading in London yesterday but crashed as low as 5466 after the finance ministers’ meeting was cancelled. Nearly 70 points – or around £18billion – was lost in a matter of minutes before the FTSE clawed back some of the rout to close down 22.52 at 5525.54. Shares across Europe and in the United States were also on the slide. Will Hedden, a trader at IG Index in London, said the cancellation of the finance ministers’ meeting ‘sent shivers through world markets’. By HUGO DUNCAN . The Bank of England yesterday dismissed chaotic efforts to save the eurozone from financial meltdown as a temporary solution to the region’s woes. Governor Sir Mervyn King said long-term issues such as towering levels of debt and structurally weak economies still needed to be tackled. ‘The aim of the measures to be introduced over the next few days is to create a year or possibly two years’ breathing space,’ he said. ‘The underlying problems still have to be resolved.’ It came as a grand plan to solve the escalating debt crisis was thrown into doubt after today’s meeting of European finance ministers was cancelled. Debt delay: Sir Mervyn King said the 'grand plan' to solve the crisis was only a temporary solution . The ruling coalition in Italy, led by Silvio Berlusconi, also appeared to be in danger of collapse as it struggles to cut its debts and boost economic growth. European leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will still meet in Brussels. But the postponement of the finance ministers summit – due to be attended by George Osborne – suggested that a ‘big bazooka’ deal remains elusive. King said the crisis in the eurozone, and slowdown in the global economy, was deeply damaging to the UK economy and its efforts to rebalance away from debt-fuelled domestic spending to exports and investment. ‘The international picture is highly relevant because going through a rebalancing, we are not looking to domestic consumption to try for a recovery, we are looking at exports,’ King told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee. ‘And the world economy had actually become quite encouraging, then the situation changed.’ The euro and stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic dived on fears that plans to save the single area bloc from catastrophe will unravel. Leaders are at loggerheads over two key elements of the plan –reducing Greece’s massive debts to save it from collapse and boosting the firepower of the bailout fund. ‘It is a real mess once again,’ said a euro official. Europe has broadly agreed that the weakest banks in the region need to raise nearly £100bn of extra funds to shield them from the crisis. But negotiations to increase the size of the £383bn war chest designed to protect countries like Italy and Spain from a Greek-style meltdown are in the balance. Banks and other private investors are also resisting plans to increase their losses – or the ‘haircut’ – on Greek debt from 21pc to as much as 60pc .","Efforts to thrash out a rescue deal in chaos after meeting with finance ministers cancelled .

"A mother is refusing to send her son to primary school after teachers threatened him with isolation because he got his hair cut like Arsenal star Olivier Giroud. Nine year-old Danny Purdy saved up £7 of his own pocket money to get a style like that of his favourite Gunner. But his mum Sarah said he came back from school in tears after a telling off from his teachers at Brooklands Middle School in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Nine year-old Danny Purdy (pictured with his mother, Sarah) saved up £7 of his own pocket money to get the style like his favourite Gunner, Olivier Giroud (right) She says she was told Danny would have to stay in isolation until his hair is 'rectified'. Mrs Purdy, 33, a trainee nurse said: 'My son came home from school in tears saying the school told him he was not allowed in. 'I spoke to them and they told me he could, but he would be put in an exclusion room away from all other children until his hair is sorted. 'All he wanted was a little confidence, and it was amazing how something as simple as a haircut did that for him, Brooklands school have taken that away from him.' Danny has been off school since last Friday after his mum took him in and was told he would be placed immediately into isolation. She has now asked the school for materials so she can tutor Danny from home until the row is resolved. Mrs Purdy said: 'We genuinely didn't think a haircut like Danny's was breaking the rules. 'As long as children wear their school uniforms correctly and work hard at school, I really don't see what the problem is. 'I most certainly won't stand by and watch them make my son feel like an outcast and exclude him from lessons. 'I always thought we think with our brains and not our hair, but clearly not.' But headteacher Steven Harrington-Williams has defended the school's stance and said they had held an assembly on uniform policy prior to the cut. He said: 'What happened was he came into school with a large portion of his hair shaved almost to the scalp while the rest was long. 'We don't expect that sort of haircut in the school. We would have placed him in the reflection area where he would have done something. Danny's mother said that he came home in tears after being told off about his haircut by teachers at his Leighton Buzzard school . The headmaster of Brooklands Middle School (pictured) has defended the action taken over the hair cut . 'The other thing that's distressing is that on the morning back from holidays, I gave a message to the whole school in what was acceptable in terms of appearance. 'We have a school policy on haircuts and unfortunately, I, as headteacher of the school, have to abide by those standards.' It is not the first time Brooklands School have been accused of being too strict in regards to its uniform policy. In October, one parent was left 'disgusted' with staff after his eight-year-old grandson was isolated in a reflection room for having one tramline shaved in his hair. He said: 'The head teacher made an example of him and put him in a reflection room to do his work by himself and one teacher for the whole day. 'They told his mum he had to shave his whole head or wait for the bit to grow back before he returned to school. 'His mum is disgusted and so am I, How can he be treated like that?' Mrs Purdy, who is also mum to five-year-old Maisie, said she has been told by the school to shave all of her son's hair off. She added that the uniform policy only bans 'extreme haircuts' but she does not think Danny's fell into that category. The single mum said: 'I don't see this as being extreme. What I have said to the head is that what some people see as acceptable others see as inappropriate. 'I suggested to him he needs to put a picture in the uniform policy of what is acceptable because how should we know. 'A lot of kids have their hair cut like that and they haven't been taken out of class. 'The school told me over the phone that it would be offensive to poorer children who couldn't afford to have their hair cut like that. 'They want me to shave it off. It would make him look like a thug and it is punishing him for doing nothing wrong. It is so detrimental to his educational needs. 'He is a major football fan and this is a way of expressing himself. Children should be encouraged to be individual not punished.' French international Giroud has become a fans favourite since joining the Gunners in 2012 and was on the score sheet as they beat Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday.

"If it seems you are permanently single while everyone else around you is in a relationship, blame your DNA. Scientists have identified a ‘singleton gene’, and found that those who have it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others. It is thought that by lowering levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships. This could make it harder to form them in the first place - or lead to break-up after break-up. Scroll down for video . Researchers in Beijing say some people are born with a 'singleton gene' that makes them bad at relationships (stock image shown). Those with it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others . The scientists from Peking University in Beijing tested hair samples from almost 600 Chinese university students to analyse a gene called 5-HTA1, which comes in two different versions. Those with the ‘G’ version were much more likely to be single than those with the ‘C’ version. Some 60 per cent were not in a relationship - compared to 50 per cent of those in the c group. Women are increasingly putting their husband's career before their own, a controversial separate study of Harvard Business School graduates has found. It canvassed more than 25,000 male and female students, and found 40 per cent of Generation X and 'boomer' women said their spouses' careers took priority over theirs. The researchers also said only about 20 per cent of them had planned on their careers taking a back seat when they graduated. They concluded that while women had good intentions when they graduated, they ultimately ended up being held back by their partners. Importantly, the link couldn’t be explained by other factors that influence relationships, including appearance and wealth. The key to the findings seems to be the role of the 5-HTA1 gene in the brain. Those with the ‘G’, or singleton, version make less serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood and happiness. It was already known that people with the ‘G’ allele, or version, find it more difficult to get close to others. Plus, they are more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers said: ‘As pessimism and neuroticism are detrimental to the formation, quality and stability of relationships, this connection between the G allele and psychological disorders might decrease carriers’ dating opportunities or lead to romantic relationship failure.’ The researchers said that students may have more free time and freedom to form relationships than others. And at other times of life, other factors, such as pressure from parents to marry, may be much more influential. Despite this, they concluded that their study provides ‘evidence for genetic contribution to social relationships in certain contexts’. Other scientists said that while genes will inevitably influence relationships, their role in most cases will be small. Hair samples from almost 600 Chinese students were tested by scientists. Those with the ‘G’ version of the 5-HTA1 gene were much more likely to be single than those with the ‘C’ version. It suggests some people struggle to date and maintain relationships (stock image shown) than others . Dr Pam Spurr, a relationship expert, said that we don’t have to let our genes rule our lives. She said: ‘I know that our genetic heritage determines some of our behaviour but we always have choice. ‘If someone’s difficulties with dating are flagged up to them, I believe they can learn to interact in a way that will make them more successful in meeting somebody. ‘I feel quite optimistic about that.’ Professor Tim Spector, an expert in the role of genes from King’s College London, questioned how strong the research was. However, studies show that our odds of getting married and staying married and our number of sexual partners are all influenced by our DNA. Despite this, genes are not the be all and end all. Simple evidence for this comes from looking at identical twins. They are usually attracted to the same type of person initially, but end up settling down with very different mates.","Researchers in Beijing say some people are born with a 'singleton gene'

"A 50-year-old man tested negative for Ebola in New York City on Thursday evening. The man, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, was taken by ambulance to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan to undergo tests for the deadly virus. The man had returned from Mali in West Africa this weekend and attended the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn on Monday with alleged flu-like symptoms but was sent home.The man called 911 on Thursday morning saying his condition had worsened and was rushed to Bellevue Hospital. He will continue to have further tests despite having a negative diagnosis. A man in his fifties was reportedly sent home from the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn (pictured) on Wednesday after returning from West Africa and reporting flu-like symptoms . 'Because in early Ebola Virus Disease initial tests may be negative, the patient will have further Ebola tests in the coming days to confirm today’s negative result,' the Health Department said in a statement Thursday evening, reports CBS. It is unclear if he was asked about his recent trip to West Africa when sent home on Monday or offered information that he had traveled to Mali. Interfaith Medical Center provided a statement to MailOnline on Thursday. 'This morning, the New York City Department of Health notified Interfaith Medical Center that an individual was seen on Monday, November 17th by his private physician in the physician’s private office located on the hospital’s campus and that the individual was taken today to Bellevue,' it read. 'Interfaith has put in place all policies, procedures and protocols required by the New York City and State Departments of Health for all New York hospitals to protect patients and staff and has been following up with Bellevue and appropriate authorities as warranted in these circumstances.' On Thursday, the man reportedly called 911 and after an emergency responder was alerted that the man had recently been in West Africa, New York City's Ebola precautions were implemented. He was being cared for at Bellevue Hospital where his test results are pending. A statement from the New York Department of Health said: 'An individual who came to the United States from Mali, a country with limited Ebola transmission, was taken to HHC Bellevue hospital Center today. Dr. Craig Spencer, center, who was the first Ebola patient in New York City, is escorted by New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to a news conference at New York's Bellevue Hospital, on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2014.

But according to a WHO update this week, in Mali there have been six reported cases of Ebola of which five people have died. On Wednesday, the Health Department confirmed that a woman, who recently returned from Guinea and dropped dead in a New York salon with blood pouring from her nose and mouth, did not have Ebola. Last week, Dr Craig Spencer was declared free of Ebola at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus while treating patients in Guinea. He was the first, and only, case of Ebola to date in New York City.","Man, 50, being isolated at Bellevue Hospital tests negative for Evola .

Speaking after the match to Mail Online the fourth-in-line to the throne candidly admitted that the last decade had been an 'emotional roller coaster' but said that he was hugely proud of what they had achieved. Scroll down for video . Doing his bit: Prince Harry played in a $1m polo match in the Middle East to raise funds for his charity Sentebale today . Harry confessed that when Sentebale had started off he and his team were 'pretending we knew what we were doing' and mistakes had been made. Indeed in 2008 the charity almost went bust, despite raising millions from the proceeds of a television documentary and a star-studded Princess Diana memorial concert. There were repeated and damaging claims that too much money was being wasted in setting up the charity's African operation and too little being given to needy projects on the ground. He was playing in the Sentebale Polo Cup, which his team won, at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club . The fourth-in-line (second right) to the throne was in the Sentebale Huntsman Team along with Abdulla Ben Desmal (left),  Malcolm Borwick (second left) and Saeed Bin Drai (right) The prince told Mail Online: 'It started really really small....a very small group of us saying we’re not going to use the funds for other people, it’s going to be all for the kids and pretending we knew what we were doing. 'Ten years down the line we have made a couple of mistakes and in turn learned from our mistakes and now we know that actually, by speaking to the core problem, which in this case is the children themselves.... you get a really good taste of whether you’re achieving it or not. 'The great thing about Lesotho is that because it’s so small, you know that if you’re doing it wrong, it’s highly visible. And if you’re doing it right, you start to see the change.' He said he was hugely proud of what the charity had achieved, pictured with Delfina Blaquier . Prince Harry, Chairman of Sentebale Philip Green and Sir Jackie Stewart ahead of the Sentebale Polo Cup match at the Ghantoot Racing & Polo Club in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates . He admitted the charity was 'quite a hard sell for a lot of people'. 'It's a very small country that no one knows about, surrounded by South Africa, a landlocked country and I think that combined with us thinking that we knew what we were doing right, it evolved and it changed for the better,' he said. 'We realised our mistakes and we were willing to change it by speaking to the kids on the ground. 'What I’d like to think is that Sentebale has brought everyone together to work for one great cause.' He added: 'It’s been an emotional rollercoaster but we’ve come out on top and all I’ve ever wanted to do was raise enough money to make a difference for Lesotho.' Harry was speaking at the Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club where he was playing in the Sentebale Polo Cup, which his team won. He plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately this weekend to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit. He admitted the charity was 'quite a hard sell for a lot of people' as many have not heard of the country . Among the celebrities attending the event were Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell, seen in public for the first time since she announced her engagement to Formula 1 Red Bull boss Christian Horner, who is in the country for the Grand Prix. She coyly declined to show off her engagement ring, saying it 'wasn't cool' but was happy to chat about Harry, whom she said she has known since the age of ten. She said: 'I have met Prince Harry a few times. I've seen him since he was about ten. I have seen him grow up. It is brilliant what he is doing with his life . It's all for a good cause. I think he is a great ambassador for showing people that we care and he's got great spirit and heart. I think he's brilliant. We are looking forward to seeing him in action.' He plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi this weekend to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit . Sentebale - which means forget me not and was chosen in memory of the prince's late mother - supports children in Lesotho, a tiny, poverty-stricken kingdom in southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. Harry has spent the last thee days in Oman on a semi-official royal visit at the personal invitation of the country's Sultan. Earlier yesterday he visited a mosque for the first time on the final day of a whirlwind tour of Oman. The prince was given a tour of the breathtaking Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in the capital Muscat, which can accommodate up to 20,000 worshippers at any one time. Promise: The prince pledged to help children in the AIDS-ridden southern African kingdom of Lesotho . Learning curve: Harry said he has learned a lot during his time at the helm of the charity . Dressed in a smart blue suit, Harry slipped off his shoes in accordance with religious custom as he was given a tour of the spectacular marble-floored complex. The Mosque was a gift to the nation of Oman from its present ruler, His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, to mark the 30th year of his reign. Built from 300,000 tonnes of Indian sandstone, the main musalla – or prayer hall - has a central dome rising to a height of 164 feet (50 metres) above the floor. The mosque also boasts the world's second largest hand-woven carpet, made from a single piece of cloth containing 1.7 billion knots and weighing 21 tonnes. The building's majestic Swarovski crystal chandelier, which hangs above the praying hall, is equally impressive. Weighing in at eight tonnes, it is a staggering 45 feet tall and has 1,122 lights inside that take two days to change, twice a year. His visit, which was unannounced, caused waves of excitement among a group of schoolchildren who squealed with delight each time he walked past and jumped in front of the prince to pose for spur-of-the-moment selfies.

"It was thought that only planets have rings, but now an asteroid has proved experts wrong. A rocky body orbiting the sun between Saturn and Uranus is girdled by two rings, scientists have learned. Previously only giant gas planets, most famously Saturn, were thought to possess bands made up of dust, rocks and ice. Totally surprising: An asteroid orbiting the sun between Saturn and Uranus (illustrated) is girdled by two rings, scientists have learned. It is the first time that such a small celestial body with rings has been observed . The ringed space rock, called Chariklo, was originally located in the Kuiper Belt, which is a circling group of icy dwarf planets and comets at the edge of the solar system. At some point it was thrown out of the belt and now exists as the largest member of a group of objects known as the Centaurs, which are small solar system bodies with a an elliptical axis between two outer planets. Astronomers stumbled across the rings while using several telescopes to observe Chariklo, which has a diameter of 155miles (250km). ‘We were not even looking for rings, because they had never been observed around small objects like Chariklo, so it is a totally surprising discovery,’ said Dr Uffe Graw Jorgensen, from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. The discovery has shocked experts as previously only giant gas planets, most famously Saturn, were thought to possess rings made up of dust, rocks and ice. An image of Saturn taken by Nasa's Cassini spacecraft is pictured . ‘We could even determine incredible details about the rings. There are two separate thin rings, which are comprised of ice particles and pebbles. ‘The two rings are only three and seven kilometres wide (two and five miles) and no more than a few hundred metres thick. ‘There are eight miles between the centres of the two rings and there is a nine kilometre (five mile) wide gap between them. ‘They have been measured at a distance of two billion kilometres with an accuracy of plus/minus a few hundred metres. It is really impressive.’ The discovery is reported in the latest edition of the journal Nature.","Astronomers at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, spotted the ringed asteroid .

"A mother has been charged with felony child abuse of her  14-month-old son after she violently jammed his ears with Q-tips. Jenna Schumacher, of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, allegedly caused her son's ears to bleed and left holes in his ear drums which could lead to lasting hearing problems. The mother reportedly told investigators that she harmed her little boy because her partner left her and she 'can’t stand to look at (the child) because he looks so similar to his father'. Scroll down for video . Jenna Schumacher, of Wisconsin, allegedly caused her son's ears to bleed and left holes in his ear drums which could lead to lasting damage . The 26-year-old faces up to 40 years in prison if she is found guilty of the abuse and $100,000 in fines. The alleged abuse was discovered on November 5 at Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin when Schumacher brought her son to see a doctor over his ear injuries. The criminal complaint said doctors found no medical reason for the ear injuries, but discovered a piece of a cotton swab in the boy's ear. Last Friday, Schumacher again took her child to Children's Hospital and denied putting anything in his ears. However hospital video footage revealed that the 26-year-old was shoving cotton swabs and her fingers into her son's ears. On the tape, the mom was seen violently forcing the Q-tip repeatedly into the child's ears as he struggled and cried, according to WITI. She initially denied her actions, then admitted that she was violent towards the child because he looked like his father, according to investigators. MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke on Thursday. He told WTVR: 'It turns my stomach. It sickens me. It makes you shudder to think someone would take a blunt object and shove it into your ear canal. It sends chills up your spine.' The abuse was uncovered at the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin after authorities set up surveillance cameras to watch the little boy's room .","Jenna Schumacher, of Wisconsin, allegedly caused her son's ears to bleed and left holes in his ear drums .

"Children are known for their brutal honesty and it's thanks to an innocent but tactless comment from her young son that a mother lost 13 stone. Mother-of-two Agnieszka Roguska, 32, from Bristol, tipped the scales at 23st and was flabbergasted when her eight-year-old, Oliver, asked her why she was so fat. It was thanks to his question that she decided to 'get a grip' and ditch her diet of crisps, chips and super-sized meals. Scroll down for video . Fat fighter: Agnieszka managed to drop from 23st (left) to 10st (right) in just 12 months . Oliver asked Agnieszka why her belly was so much bigger than other mothers. Until that moment, she hadn't realised how out of control her weight had got. Now, just one year later, Agnieszka has dropped down to a healthy 10st, after following a strict diet and a regular exercise routine. Agnieszka said: 'I remembered facing this same situation when I was a child as my mum was bigger than other mums were. 'When I was a teenager, I remember other mums looking pretty and wearing nice clothes when my mum was hiding in the house from others with her weight problem. Agnieszka (left with Oliver before she lost weight, and right, together today) began to over eat when he was in Neonatal Intensive care and her diet got worse after her divorce . Before: Agnieszka used to live on diet of crisps, chips and super-sized meals . 'At that time I promised myself that I would never be like my mum. I wanted to be that pretty mum in nice clothes that he could be proud of.' Agnieszka's weight rose to 23st after she prematurely gave birth to Oliver just 27 weeks - more than three months early. Little Oliver remained in a neonatal intensive care unit for months where Agnieska relied on quick snacks between visits. Shortly after Oliver returned home, Agnieszka's marriage broke down and she began comfort eating, gorging on super-sized meals and fatty snacks. Full-time mother Agnieska, now divorced, explained: 'Oliver's prognosis was not good and his stay in NICU took a huge emotional toll upon me. 'I did not have the time or the capacity to think or look after myself and that is when I began to put the weight on. 'When my son was aged one my relationship with his father broke down. Facing the end of my marriage was also extremely stressful and my weight continued to increase.' But after Oliver confronted her Agnieszka lost 13st in just 12 months using the Cambridge Weight Plan. She swapped her high fat, high calorie comfort foods and large portions for a strict diet, often using shakes, bars and soups to replace meals. Agnieszka has now been crowned slimmer of the year by Cambridge Weight Plan after she beat off more than 2,000 competitors for the accolade and is determined to stay slim and fit.","Agnieszka Roguska put on weight when son was born premature .

"A 26-year-old California college student from a broken home has put up an ad on Craigslist looking to rent a loving family for the holidays. Jackie Turner, of Rocklin, wrote in her touching notice: 'I am looking to rent a mom and dad who can give me attention and make me feel like the light of their life just for a couple of days because I really need it.’ Turner, who is estranged from her biological parents, offered prospective candidates willing to play the roles of her parents $8 an hour for their services. Scroll down for video . Changing from her past: Jackie, 26, posted an ad on Craigslist seeking to rent a family for the holidays at $8 an hour. She has since received dozens of responses from people willing to take her in for free . Online plea: Turner, of Rocklin, wrote in her notice: 'I am looking to rent a mom and dad who can give me attention and make me feel like the light of their life just for a couple of days because I really need it' ‘I've never felt the touch of my Mom hugging me and holding me,’ she told News10.’ I don't know what it's like to look in my dad's eyes and feel love instead of hatred.’ Looking at the jovial, straight-A student from William Jessup University, it is hard to imagine the strife she had seen in her 26 years. Rough start: Turner had been physically and sexually abused as a child and in her teens led a life on the streets, which eventually resulted in an arrest on a grand theft charge . Turner has been physically, sexually and emotionally abused since she was a little girl. To escape the violence at home, Turner spent years living on the streets where she had picked up a drug habit and found herself in a gang. Jackie was eventually arrested for grand theft and served nearly a year behind bars - an outcome that marked a turning point in her life. Upon her release in 2010, Jackie decided to go to a religious camp for troubled teens called Christian Encounter Ministries. Three years later, Turner is a presidential scholar at William Jessup boasting a 4.0 GPA. She also plays soccer on the school team. Despite her successes, Jackie says she still has a deep void inside her that she feels only a family could fill – even if it's only a rented one. ‘My biological parents aren't here, and it's kept this hole inside of me,’ Turner said. So Turner came up with the idea to lease a family for the holiday season so she could have someone who would listen to her and cry with her - no strings attached. Dozens of families have responded to the heart-breaking plea, offering to take Turner in free of charge. New life: Turner went to a Christian camp (left) and later enrolled in William Jessup University (right), where she is now a presidential scholar with a 4.0 GPA . Student athlete: Besides her academic triumphs, Turner also plays soccer on the school team and helps teach kids martial arts . Turner's bold decision to go public with her pain and longing for a family also struck a chord with other people who had suffered abuse. The college student has been receiving emails from men and women openly discussing their childhood traumas. ‘People are out there with the same heart inside of them,’ she said. ‘Some of them with a greater drive then mine.’ Jackie is now hoping to arrange a meeting for all the people who have answered her ad so that no one would be alone this holiday season.","Jackie Turner wrote in her ad she would be willing to pay $8 per hour for a family to sit with her and listen .

His wife raps: ‘It’s the biggest decision of his life, he’s going to quit his job and come work with his wife.’ The family also reveal that he has had a vasectomy and boast about a small role he played in Iron Man Three. The video also updates friends, family and internet viewers on the children. While Lola won a triathlon this year, Penn Charles is taking a hip-hop class. Penn also announces that he has given up his job as a news anchor on the television network, WNCN .

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, left, allowed his children to design his Christmas card on an iPad this year . This quirky family weren’t the only ones to release a Christmas video this year. Last week, West Yorkshire Police released a version of Silent Night – with the opening lyrics ‘Silent night, crimes to fight’ – as their annual greeting. Several traditional paper cards also caused a stir this year. Naturally, the Kardashians annual card raised a few eyebrows when Bruce Jenner was featured in it inside a glass tube. Elsewhere, Kelly Clarkson this year tweeted a bizarre Christmas card photo on Twitter with her family wrapped in decorations while gazing sideways at Father Christmas. In UK politics, Nick Clegg allowed his children to design his Christmas card with his wife, Miriam, on an iPad. As a result, he ended up with a Santa hat on, while his wife was sporting some reindeer ears and Rudolph’s red nose. Outspoken Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, meanwhile, posed for a self-mocking Christmas card in which he is holding bongos while his wife does her best impression of a ‘slut’.

"Offence: Retired lawyer Alan Pickard, 82, dumped the cross in a pond after it had been planted on a green in the village of Brearton, North Yorkshire, by the local church for lent . A retired lawyer was so offended when his local church placed a wooden cross in the village green for Lent that he threw it into a duck pond in anger. The five feet cross was placed on the small green in the upmarket village of Brearton, near Harrogate, North Yorkshire, for the duration of the Christian festival. But retired lawyer Alan Pickard, 82, took exception to the 'arrogance' of St. John the Baptist Church, tearing the cross down and dumping it in the water. Mr Pickard even admitted that he had considered dressing the cross as fictional character Worzel Gummidge. After retrieving the cross from the pond, an angry parishioner and her husband sent a round-robin email to the residents of . the village to hold a referendum on the cross's future. To their shock the culprit owned up in a reply, saying that he thought the 'proper place for . this artefact is within the church precincts'. His message read: 'I might have dressed the bit of wood . up as Worzel Gummidge, but chose instead to pitch it into the pond and . if it is replaced will continue to pitch it into the pond.' The village has a population of around 140 residents and 44 responded . to the e-mail. While six people said they did object to the cross's position on the green, 21 residents said they did not. When a second email was distributed revealing the results of the survey, Mr Pickard sent another curt reply, reading: 'If the cross appears on the . green again it will end up in the pond again.' Arrogant: Mr Pickard dragged the cross (pictured in the grounds of St. John the Baptist Church) into a nearby duck pond, later accusing the church of 'arrogance' He added: 'I do not accept the . validity of this voting process and I will not yield to the obvious . arrogance of the church.' The cross has now been planted in the church yard, much to the pensioner's delight, but he said that if it reappears he 'would be . right back down there'. Speaking at his home in Brearton, Mr Pickard said: 'I have said all I have . to say to the village committee. Upset: Village resident Jeremy Rhodes, who witnessed the cross being dragged back up to the church by a parishioner, said that the issue had caused 'a great deal of upset in the village' 'I might speak at some point but now is . not the time. I have nothing to say at this moment.' Jeremy Rhodes, 55, a resident of the village, noticed two parishioners retrieving the religious symbol from the pond after it is understood to have disappeared last Wednesday. Mr Rhodes, who works in the gas and oil industry, said: 'I was driving back to the village when I saw a parishioner really struggling to carry the cross over the village green. 'I stopped her and she said that someone had thrown it into the pond. We were both quite dismayed.' He said the issue had caused a 'great deal of upset in the village' and that Mr Pickard should have spoken to the local vicar if he took umbrage to the positioning of the cross. Josephine Johnston, 85, who has lived in the village of Brearton for 35 years, described Mr Pickard's actions as 'sacrilege'. Mrs Johnston added: 'I think it was terrible that it was thrown into the pond. It amounts to hooliganism. Mr Pickard should have approached the church warden instead. 'Mr Pickard said he was going to dump it if it happened again. He has no legal right, it is not his property. He was a judge but he is behaving like a hooligan. 'I am on the church committee and I think the cross will stay in the church yard now. 'This is the first year the cross has been planted to mark lent. It made a brief appearance one Easter Sunday, but this is the first year it has been on the green for any amount of time. No return: Mr Pickard said that if the cross reappears he 'would be right back down there' 'Of course every one has their opinions but Mr Pickard could have could about this in a different way.' Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I just think it’s absolutely ludicrous, all this fuss over a cross. 'I am not religious, but it doesn’t bother me if someone wants to plant a cross on the green. What I do think is that the gentleman should have gone about it in a different way.'","Alan Pickard, 82, said the 'artefact' should be kept within church grounds .

"Planets in solar systems that have two suns - similar to the fictional Tatooine planet from the film Star Wars - have more potential for supporting alien life than planets with single suns, according to an astronomy student. Joni Clark from New Mexico State University simulated various types of systems including binary - systems with two suns - to test whether the planets within these systems were more or less capable of being habitable. She discovered that in binary systems, the gravitational pull of the two suns orbiting around each other reduces the threat to those planets from solar winds, for example, increasing the chance of life surviving and water sources forming. An artist's impression of Kepler-35 b - a planet that orbits around a pair of sun-size stars. The discovery of Kepler-35b and another twin sun planet, Kepler-34 b, was announced in January 2012. Planets in solar systems that have two suns - similar to the fictional Tatooine planet from the movie Star Wars - have more potential for supporting life than planets with single suns, claims an astronomy student . A binary system is a system of two objects in space - traditionally stars - which are so close that their respective gravitational pulls causes them to orbit around each other. They do this because they orbit around a central mass that keeps them in a fixed position. Binary suns and star systems are featured heavily in the Star Wars in the system in which the planet Tatooine is located. In the Discovery program Alien Planet, the planet Darwin IV orbits a binary system. In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the planet Magrathea orbits a binary system. In Escape To Witch Mountain and Return From Witch Mountain, Tony and Tia's home planet orbits two suns. In Star Trek Voyager, there is a system with two suns and in Doctor Who, Gallifrey -the home planet of the Time Lords- has two suns in its planetary system. Clark told Space.com: '[The stars] calm each other down. 'It's like a really good marriage. They vent to each other, and they're not focused on anything else. 'They slow each other down and that causes increased magnetic protection of the planets.' After modeling a variety of systems, Clark, along with astrophysicist Paul Mason from the University of Texas concluded that stars 80 per cent as big as the sun, if close enough together, could increase the chances of being able to sustain life. An example of an existing planet in a binary system is the Kepler-35 b - a planet that orbits around a pair of sun-size stars. The discovery of Kepler-35b and another twin sun planet, Kepler-34 b, was announced in January 2012. Another binary system is the Kepler-47 system. It is a star system with at least two planets in orbit around the pair of stars located 5,000 light-years away from Earth. When the suns in a binary system occupy a similar mass they orbit each other in a way that reduces the amount of solar wind they create. Solar wind is a stream of charged particles released from the upper atmosphere of a sun. It is mostly made up of electrons and protons and this stream of particles can vary in temperature and speed. The particles escape a sun's gravitational pull because of their high kinetic energy and the high temperature of the plasma around the sun - called the corona. This diagram shows the Kepler-47 system. Kepler-47 is a binary star system with at least two planets in orbit around the pair of stars located about 5,000 light-years away from Earth. This image shows a habitable zone in which planets that may support life could reside. Clark's study found that the habitable zone in binary systems is 40 per cent larger than in single-star systems . If the suns are similarly matched . their speed and temperature is more regulated. This reduces how many . particles escape which in turn leads to less solar wind. Clark's stars also need to fully orbit one another within 10 to 30 days . to extend the wider habitable zone - dubbed the 'Goldilocks Zone'. The planets within . these binary systems would still die out at a similar rate to those . within single-starred systems, yet the 'habitable zone' increases by . around 40 per cent. However, Clark claims that if they drift too far apart, this puts a . significant gravitational strain on the orbiting planets within that . system. Clark's findings were reported in Astrobiology Magazine, a web-based publication sponsored by the NASA astrobiology program. She also found that some 'p-type' planets - planets that orbit both stars within the same binary system were hit with 0.7 percent less flux from solar winds than Earth is currently exposed to in our single-star system. Although this level of flu depends on the planets' position within their binary solar system. Planets that only orbit one of the . suns in a binary system are more at risk, and in cases where the two . suns are too far apart or greatly differ in mass to create a synchronised movement, the planet orbiting the second sun can be hit . with double the amount of solar flux it gets hit . with. This is because these planets . are more prone to be tidally locked in one position, usually with one side permanently turned . toward its sun.This side then receives the full brunt of any solar flux. In binary systems, like the artist's impression pictured, its more likely that rocky planets with water sources can form because they're not at as much risk from solar assaults, compared to planets in systems with single stars. This means such planets could house alien life . Planets that orbit the first sun in a binary system, though, behave in the same way planets do in a single star system. In binary systems its more likely that rocky planets with water sources can form because they're not as much risk from solar assaults, compared to planets in systems with single stars. Living conditions on these planets would vary because of cloud cover. Planets with high cloud cover would be insulated and protected from ultraviolet radiation. 'It also leaves the potential open for smaller planets that have less magnetic field protection to remain habitable because in a sense they don't have to protect themselves from as much as they would in a single star case,' continued Clark.","Astronomy student Joni Clark created simulations of a variety of so-called binary systems - solar systems with two suns - to see how far habitable zones within them could spread .
This is because the two suns orbit each other and create a safe zone which reduces the threat to those planets from solar winds .
This gives those planets within such binary systems more potential to be habitable than those in single sun set-ups ."
"A 13-year-old girl who was declared brain dead after undergoing a routine operation to have her tonsils removed is to be taken off life support - against the wishes of her family. Jahi McMath suffered complications and went into cardiac arrest at Children's Hospital Oakland in Northern California following the procedure to cure her sleep apnea on December 9. Now the head of the pediatrics department has told the family that Jahi will be taken off life support because she has been declared dead under California law, KTVU reported. 'We didn't want her to be removed from life support but the decision is out of our hands because it's been declared a legal death,' Omari Sealey, McMath's uncle, said. Loss: Jahi McMath, 13, suffered cardiac arrest after having her tonsils out and has been declared brain dead. The hospital will now switch off her life support, even though her family does not want to . Under California law, to declare someone legally brain dead, two doctors must declare it at least three hours apart. Before the doctors gave their decision to the family, Jahi's heartbroken mother Nailah Winkfield said she had felt that the hospital was pressuring her into switching off her daughter's life support so that they could re-use the bed. 'They . just have a social worker follow me around all day long asking me ""Do . you have any other family that needs to see her?"" like trying to put a . rush on it,' Winkfield told ABC 7, breaking down. Chatman had added to the Oakland Tribune that . as long as her daughter's heart was beating, they wanted to keep her in the hospital, . even if it means spending Christmas in there. 'As long as she has a pulse, we want her on life support,' Sealey said. 'We want her to come home for Christmas. We want to give her presents. We want a chance for a Christmas miracle.' Apprehensive: Jahi was nervous about undergoing surgery but her mother assured her she'd be fine. As she was recovering, she was bleeding from the mouth and nose and suffered cardiac arrest . Beloved: Jahi's mother Nailah Winkfield has said that she believes God will 'spark her brain awake' The tragedy unfolded after Jahi went to the hospital for the routine surgery, even though she did not want to. Her uncle said she had told her mother 'something bad is going to happen to me'. The child's mother Nailah Winkfield and . grandmother Sandra Chatman say hospital staff failed to provide adequate . care and attention to the clearly ailing patient. She underwent the surgery but as she was recovering she started to bleed from her nose and mouth. 'My daughter had actual clots sliding out of her mouth and they gave me a cup and said, ""Here, catch them with the cup so we can measure them,""' Winkfield told ABC 7. Chatman, herself a surgical nurse, said nursing staff did not react until she began screaming for help. 'I was the last one to see Jahi,' said . Chatman. 'I said, ""Somebody help my baby please!"" And they came in and . starting working on her. The next thing I know, the doctor said, ""Oh no, . she doesn't have a heart rate anymore.""' Investigation: Oakland Children's Hospital has said it will investigate what happened after the surgery . 'There was a lack of urgency,' Jahi McMath's uncle Omari Sealey said. 'It's shock, it's disbelief. You never think something like this will happen to you.' Jahi went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated. She spent the following day, Tuesday, on a ventilator, but by 2am on Wednesday doctors said she had swelling in her brain, and on Thursday, she was declared legally brain-dead, according to the Oakland Tribune. Spokesperson for Oakland Children's . Hospital said in a statement: 'We're very sad about this outcome, about . what's happened to her, but at this point I have no information on the . details of the surgery.

"Nasa's probes have seen the 'edge' of our solar system for the first time - and it's completely different from what scientists thought. Our solar system is flying through space more slowly than we thought - and Nasa's IBEX - Interstellar Boundary Explorer - has found it doesn't have a 'bow shock', an area of gas or plasma that shields our solar system as it hurtles though space . ‘The sonic boom made by a jet breaking the sound barrier is an earthly example of a bow shock,’ says Dr. David McComas, principal investigator of the IBEX mission. The IBEX spacecraft has revealed a 'missing' boundary at the edge of our solar system . Our solar system doesn't move quickly enough to generate a 'bow shock' - the galactic equivalent of a 'sonic boom' The IBEX spacecraft has revealed that our solar system is not travelling quite as quickly as previously estimated . ‘As the jet reaches supersonic speeds, . the air ahead of it can’t get out of the way fast enough. Once the . aircraft hits the speed of sound, the interaction changes . instantaneously, resulting in a shock wave.' But our solar system isn't moving fast enough to generate a space version of a  'sonic boom'. For about a quarter of a century, researchers believed that the heliosphere moved through the interstellar medium at a speed fast enough to form a bow shock. IBEX data have shown that the heliosphere actually moves through the local interstellar cloud at about 52,000 miles per hour, roughly 7,000 miles per hour slower than previously thought -- slow enough to create more of a bow ‘wave’ than a shock. ‘While bow shocks certainly exist ahead of many other stars, we’re finding that our Sun’s interaction doesn’t reach the critical threshold to form a shock, so a wave is a more accurate depiction of what’s happening ahead of our heliosphere -- much like the wave made by the bow of a boat as it glides through the water,’ says McComas. For nearly a quarter of a century, scientists believed a 'bow shock' formed a sheath around our solar system, between the point where the solar wind ends and intergalactic space begins . The discovery, by the agency's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ship, gives the most complete glimpse yet of what lies beyond our solar system . Another influence is the magnetic pressure in the interstellar medium. IBEX data, as well as earlier Voyager observations, show that the magnetic field is stronger in the interstellar medium requiring even faster speeds to produce a bow shock. Combined, both factors now point to the conclusion that a bow shock is highly unlikely. The IBEX team combined its data with analytical calculations and modeling and simulations to determine the conditions necessary for creating a bow shock. Two independent global models -- one from a group in Huntsville, Ala., and another from Moscow -- correlated with the analytical findings. ‘It’s too early to say exactly what this new data means for our heliosphere. Decades of research have explored scenarios that included a bow shock. That research now has to be redone using the latest data,’ says McComas. ‘Already, we know there are likely implications for how galactic cosmic rays propagate around and enter the solar system, which is relevant for human space travel.’ IBEX has already detected particles from outside our solar system entering from interstellar space. The discovery, by the agency's . Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ship, gives the most complete . glimpse yet of what lies beyond our solar system. Researchers . are confident the new measurements will offer clues about how and where . our solar system formed, the forces that physically shape it, and the . history of other stars in the Milky Way. Flying through space: Nasa scientists have discovered atoms including helium, hydrogen, oxygen and neon  blowing into our solar system on the interstellar wind . Nasa's Ulysses spacecraft detected interstellar neutral helium more than a decade ago. But now, Earth-orbiting IBEX has observed three other types of atom including hydrogen, oxygen and neon - the raw material for the formation of new stars, planets and even human beings. These interstellar atoms . are the by-products of older stars, which  blow through in the so-called interstellar wind. Researchers found 74 oxygen . atoms for every 20 neon atoms in the interstellar wind. In our own . solar system, there are 111 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms. Blowing in: Researchers found 74 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms in the interstellar wind. In our own solar system, there are 111 oxygen atoms for every 20 neon atoms . While the big bang initially created hydrogen and . helium, only the supernovae explosions at the end of a star’s life can . spread the heavier elements of oxygen and neon through the galaxy. With the new research scientists may now be able to map how our . galaxy evolved and changed over time. 'In the beginning . there was only hydrogen and helium,' Eberhard Moebius, a . University of New Hampshire professor and IBEX team member at Los Alamos, said. 'These two elements formed the first . stars. When those stars collapsed and died, they spewed their material, . including new elements created through the process of nuclear fusion, . out into space. 'We can tell a lot about the evolution of our universe . and perhaps gain insight into other galaxies and planetary systems by . analysing these particles.' The IBEX images have been able to provide . researchers with more information about our galactic neighborhood and . raise some pressing questions about it. Detecting clues: The discovery, by Nasa's Interstella Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ship, gives the most complete glimpse yet of what lies beyond our solar system . Route: IBEX orbits the Earth and picks up atoms that have spread through the galaxy . 'Our solar system is different than the . space right outside it, suggesting two possibilities,' David . McComas, IBEX principal investigator, at the Southwest Research . Institute in San Antonio, said. 'Either the solar system evolved in a . separate, more oxygen-rich part of the galaxy than where we currently . reside, or a great deal of critical, life-giving oxygen lies trapped in . interstellar dust grains or ices, unable to move freely throughout . space.' Scientists now want . to use the new research to help discover what makes up the local . interstellar medium - the boundary region that separates the far reaches . of our galaxy from our heliosphere. This sphere shields our solar system from dangerous cosmic radiation hailing from interstellar space. To do this they measured the amount of pressure the interstellar wind has on the heliosphere. 'Measuring the pressure on our heliosphere from . the material in the galaxy and from the magnetic fields out there will . help determine the size and shape of our solar system as it travels . through the galaxy,' Eric Christian, IBEX mission scientist, at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md, said. The IBEX team also found that the interstellar wind was blowing around 7,000mph slower than previously measured.","Solar system 'travelling more slowly than thought'

"Ty Herndon has come out as gay. The country star, 52, revealed he has had a partner for the past five years during an interview with Entertainment Tonight which airs on Thursday evening. Ty said that he hid his sexuality because he did not believe he could succeed as a gay man in the industry. Scroll down for video . 'I am an out, proud, and happy gay man': Ty Herndon has come out as gay in an interview with Entertainment Tonight . When asked by Nischelle Turner what the biggest lie he has told himself is, in reference to his hit song, the singer said: ‘That I couldn't be gay and be in country music. ‘I've dreamed about being in country music since I was six years old and it's my life, it’s what I do, it's who I am and I went to great lengths to cover up that fact to be a country star. And today I get to tell the world I am an out, proud, and happy gay man.’ The Living In A Moment hit-maker also gushed about his long-term partner, who People reports is named Matt. Visit ET for the full interview. Lies he told himself: The country star didn't believe that he could be successful as a gay man in the industry. He is pictured here in 2007 with Dolly Parton (R) and the late Dottie Rambo . ‘I have an awesome relationship that I've been in for a good number of years. I love him very much and he loves me,’ he said. And Ty is looking forward to the future with his partner, admitting he hopes they will get married one day. ‘I’m kind of hoping he asks me right after this interview, but we’ll see,’ he said. Ty has been married twice before – to two women – and said they ‘absolutely’ knew about his sexuality. Protecting his career: The now 52-year-old has two ex-wives, including Renee Posey (who he is pictured with in 1998), and says they 'absolutely' knew about his sexuality . The crooner said that ‘luckily’ he tied the knot with ‘some really amazing young ladies’. Entertainment Tonight reports that he added: ‘I had a lot of people around me that I trusted at a time and I was like, “Hey, you know this about me but the world doesn't. So I'm gonna need to call on your services for a little while.” ‘It was unfortunate that I had to do that, but I felt that's what I had to do to have my career. Standing on some pretty solid legs today, so I get to tell my truth today.’ Ty was first rumoured to be gay in 1995 when he was arrested for allegedly exposing himself to a male undercover police officer in a park.

"Bill Cosby slammed rape allegations made against him in 2005, saying he had become a target because of his celebrity, newly surfaced audio has revealed. The comedian spoke to The National Enquirer in 2005 shortly after one of his accusers, lawyer Tamara Green, said he had drugged and sexually abused her in the 1970s. 'Nobody ever wishes for a situation [like this],' he said in the  interview, which has now been shared by RadarOnline. 'Nobody ever really wishes for that.' He added that nobody would want to put their loved ones in a situation that could 'cause great emotional stress'. Scroll down for audio . Fighting back: In newly surfaced audio from a 2005 interview, Bill Cosby (pictured in New York City in 2005) hits back at the media for 'unfairly' accusing him of lawyering up following rape allegations . After Green's allegations, the media accused him of surrounding himself with a 'humongous amount of lawyers', he said. 'That's unfair,' he continued, defiantly. 'I guess that a celebrity trying to protect him or herself is not supposed to use every ounce of protection. But this is all about celebrity, period!' He repeated that he felt targeted because of his fame, saying, 'the celebrity should know better'. Green came forward again this week to speak out about the assault she suffered at the hands of the comedian, now 77. She claims that she an aspiring actress in the 1970s when she met Cosby, who promised to set her up with work connections. But before she could meet any, she fell ill with the flu. Accuser: He was interviewed shortly after Tamara Green, pictured this week, accused him of rape . He insisted on seeing her to give her something for the illness, she said. He gave her pills that made her unable to control her body and he sexually assaulted her, she said. She joined a growing number of women accusing Cosby of drugging them before sexually assaulting them, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson. Dickinson told 'Entertainment Tonight' that Cosby had given her red wine and a pill when they were together in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room in 1982. When she woke up the next morning, 'I wasn't wearing my pajamas and I remembered before I passed out I had been sexually assaulted by this man.' Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, called Dickinson's charges 'false and outlandish' and said she was merely 'seeking publicity to bolster her fading career'. The alleged assaults stretch from the 1960s until around 10 years ago, when Temple University employee Andrea Constand accused him of sexually assaulting her. No criminal charges were brought in that case but she took him to civil court and ended up settling before she - and 13 other women - could testify about the alleged abuse they had suffered. This time around, unlike in 2005, Cosby has spoken little about the accusations. Earlier this month, after one woman had already spoken out, the Associated Press asked Cosby about the accusations as an interviewer spoke to him about an art exhibition he is part of. Chilling: Former model Janice Dickinson claimed in an interview on Tuesday evening, pictured, how he drugged her with a pill and wine and raped her in 1982. The next day she was in a lot of pain, she said . Staying quiet: In an interview with AP earlier this month, Cosby (pictured with his wife) refused to comment on recent allegations that he had assaulted women. He later asked AP to cut out that part of the interview . Cosby declined to comment, saying: 'We don't answer that.' In recent days,  AP went back through the full video of the November 6 interview and decided to publish Cosby's full reaction to questions about the claims. It emerged that, at the end of the interview, Cosby asked the team not to use the section where he was asked about the accusations. 'And I would appreciate it if it was scuttled,' he said. But the interview was on the record. The AP had made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time. Following the accusations, Netflix announced that they were postponing a stand-up comedy special featuring Cosby and NBC said it was scrapping plans for his proposed pilot. TV Land has also pulled reruns of 'The Cosby Show'. See below for audio .","Audio from a National Enquirer interview shows Bill Cosby saying no one would wish for allegations to come out that could hurt their family .

Settled in: While here, she married Pjetero Gojcevic, who was born in Yugoslavia but moved here 40 years ago, and the couple had three kids, including Migena, 6, pictured . Precetaj . became concerned about two weeks ago, when at her regular six-month . check in with the deportation department she was fitted with a GPS ankle . bracelet. But the mother-of-three was convinced ICE wouldn't deport a . woman whose three kids are American-born. 'That is strange they put an ankle . bracelet on a mom with three kids,' Johnson said, referring to the low . risk of her fleeing. 'Then the day before her scheduled flight they said . ""You're flying out tomorrow, here's your information."" They didn't want . the bad press. 'I . think they wanted it to look as natural as possible because they . understood how egregious this case is. It just doesn't make sense.' Now, the authorities will be forced to collect Precetaj from her home and take her into custody. At midday Tuesday, she was pictured there, with her family surrounding her awaiting ICE officers. Precetaj . and her children were crying as they hugged by the Christmas tree, and . the woman's mother-in-law was asking what would become of her if her . daughter was sent home. Other relatives, including a cousin, were . visibly upset at the heartbreaking situation the family has been thrown . into. Hugs: Precetaj has not decided, if she is in fact deported, whether to take the kids, who have never been to Albania, with her . Review: The mother's case will be reviewed . 'They will jail . her for one to three weeks, however long it takes to organize another . flight,' Johnson told MailOnline. 'Then border guards will drive her to . the airport and take off her ankle bracelet like she's a mass murderer . or a terrorist going to Guantanamo.' In the meantime, Johnson and the family are working desperately for someone in Washington D.C. to interject. 'We need somebody in the White House, connected to ICE, to say ""stop this immediately. This is wrong."" If someone in DC hears about this, that is our best chance. Her story just hasn't been heard.' Understandably, Precetaj is beside herself, and is still trying to work out if she will take her children, who are enrolled in school and have never been to Albania, with her. Her husband works as a cook at restaurant in Detroit and said he can't afford to raise the children on his own. 'She is an emotional mess,' Johnson explained. Deportation: Precetaj was informed Monday that she had to report at Deport's McNamara terminal at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday as per the above order . Empty: But the terminal, pictured, was empty at 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, as the mother-of-three defied the order by staying home . 'What she has been told by numerous people was that they don't deport women with three US citizen children and that is exactly what they're doing. 'She is crying all the time, trying to work out who she can take and who she can't. She's going back to Albania and that is not a good place to bring a 6-year-old girl, particularly.' He added: 'It happened in one day, she has no idea what to do.' Gojcevic told the Detroit Free Press Monday night the family was 'hoping for a miracle.' 'Let her stay with her children and raise them in a country that they know,' he said. 'She loves this country.'","Cile Precetaj, 40, of Detroit, Michigan, was ordered to report for deportation at Detroit Metro Airport at 10:30 a.m. today for a flight back to Albania .

"The teenager behind a Washington state school shooting last month that left five people dead 'turned dark' the week before he opened fire, texting friends and family threats and messages about his own funeral, and writing to one girl: 'Bang bang I'm dead.' Moments before Jaylen Fryberg, 15, shot his fellow students - all friends - on October 24 in the Marysville Pilchuck High School cafeteria, he texted more than a dozen relatives, describing what he wanted to wear at his funeral and who should get his personal possessions, a detective's search warrant affidavit has revealed. The boy asked relatives to apologize to the families of his friends 'who get caught up in the (expletive) tomorrow' - referring to the day after the shooting. He also sent texts in the days leading up to the shooting to a female friend saying she will regret not talking to him and that he has 'set a date' for his funeral. Scroll down for video . Killer: Five teenagers, including the perpetrator, were killedat Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington on October 24 when popular freshman student Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) opened fire at a group of friends . Lured: Jaylen Fryberg texted his five closest friends saying to meet him in the cafeteria where he shot them. A detective's search warrant affidavit has now revealed the ominous texts he sent in the lead up to the shooting . The popular teen - who was named a prince on the school's homecoming court one week before the killing spree - fatally shot four friends he had invited to lunch and wounded a fifth teen before killing himself. The victims were Gia Soriano, Zoe Galasso and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, all 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15. All were shot in the head. Nate Hatch, 14, was shot in the jaw and is recovering. Andrew Fryberg and Hatch are the shooter's cousins. Investigators have found no evidence to support a rumor that students had expressed concerns about Jaylen Fryberg to school authorities before the shooting, police spokeswoman Shari Ireton said Wednesday. The Daily Herald of Everett obtained the Everett police detective's affidavit, which provided details of the boy's last text messages, but not their full contents. The detective had been seeking a judge's permission to examine the boy's cellphone. Multiple agencies are investigating the shooting and are sifting through hundreds of text messages and social media posts. Emergency: A sheriff's vehicle sits parked in the driveway of Marysville Pilchuck High School on the day of the shooting . Victims: Gia Soriano, left, and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, both 14, died days after the attack from gun wounds . Horrific: The shooter's cousin Andrew Fryberg , 15, (left) was killed, as was girlfriend Zoe Galasso, 14 (right). Reports suggest the shooter was upset over Galasso . Only survivor: Nate Hatch was the only member of the group to recover from his injuries . While the boy had publicly posted some angry messages on social media starting in late July, his posts otherwise were 'pretty normal,' the detective wrote. The change began October 18. Detectives learned that he had been upset by something that happened between him and a 15-year-old identified in the affidavit only by her initials and described as a 'close friend.' Investigators know what happened between the two but decided against including specifics in the search warrant documents to protect her identity, court papers said. Previous reports have suggested he was upset over 14-year-old victim Zoe Galasso, who had recently started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg. The shooter's Twitter feed was full of vague, anguished postings, like 'It won't last ... It'll never last,' and 'I should have listened. ... You were right ... The whole time you were right.' On October 18, Fryberg texted: 'Ohk (sic) well don't bother coming to my funeral.' The girl stopped responding and ignored other text messages. On October 22, the boy texted: 'I set the date. Hopefully you regret not talking to me', 'You have no idea what I'm talking about. But you will,' and 'Bang bang I'm dead.' When the friend asked Fryberg to stop, he replied: 'No. You don't care. I don't care.' When she stopped responding, Fryberg tried to reach her through another friend. The morning of October 24, Fryberg used Facebook to send that friend a picture of a gun sitting between his legs, court papers said. Respect: Flowers, newspapers and written tributes are seen pinned outside Marysville-Pilchuck High School . He told the friend to have the girl 'call me before I do this.' That message was sent minutes before the shooting started. The detective met with two of Fryberg's uncles the day of the shooting, the Daily Herald reported. One man said he and 13 other relatives received a text from the boy minutes before the gunfire. The message was titled: 'My Funeral (expletive).' Detectives later searched the boy's room. 'My hope was that we could find a note or something that would help explain what happened,' the detective wrote. 'Nothing of evidentiary value was located in Jaylen's room.'","Jaylen Fryberg, 15, shot and killed four students at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington on October 24 .

"Arrested: Gabriel Harris, was arrested at the restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida . The wife of a man whose sad mugshot captured media attention this week is claiming police used excessive force against her husband after they went to a Taco Bell drive-through on bikes. Gabriel Harris, was arrested at the restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, just after 3am on Sunday. According to his arrest report, Harris was intoxicated when he got into an altercation at the drive-through after staff refused to take his order because he was not in a car. But his wife Sarah Haliburton says the pair had not been drinking and that police were unnecessarily brutal. She said officers pushed the 33-year-old into his bicycle and slammed his head onto the concrete, reports the Daytona Beach News Journal. She said her husband's glasses were bent and ended up on the ground next to his blood. Harris, she said, has had constant headaches since the altercation at the weekend and she is preparing papers to file a complaint about the officer's behavior and actions. She also says she believes the restaurant discriminated against the pair because they were on bikes. 'It was discrimination,' Haliburton said. 'We don't choose to drive a vehicle. The bicycles are our vehicles.' According to his arrest report, Harris was intoxicated when he got into an altercation at the drive-through after staff refused to take his order because he was not in a car. Filmed: Wife Sarah Haliburton says police were unnecessarily brutal and said the officers pushed her husband into his bicycle, slammed his head onto the concrete . 'Violent': She said the 33-year-old's glasses were bent and ended up on the ground next to his blood (pictured) 'They had two tacos ready and they said they would give it to us for free if we leave,' Haliburton said. 'I told them I want my complete order and that we would pay for it.' In a 9-1-1 call employees can be heard in the background saying the pair were shaking and trying to open a window. They are also heard saying the couple were taking pictures of the employees with a phone and they refused to leave when asked, according to the caller to 9-1-1. Police found Harris on a bicycle by the menu speaker, reports The Daytona Beach News-Journal. When police arrived they asked Harris to leave, but then spotted a red Swiss Army knife on his belt loop and tried to reach for it. Scene: Harris was arrested at this Taco Bell restaurant in New Smyrna Beach, Florida, just after 3am on Sunday . Harris then grabbed the officer's wrist and was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed. Haliburton said she does not understand why the officer tried to grab Harris' Swiss Army pocketknife attached to his pants by a carabiner clip because Harris did not act threateningly. Police say he suffered a scraped forehead as a result of the scuffle. Harris was booked into jail and charged with resisting arrest with violence. He was later released on $1,000 bond. Sunday's incident is Harris' second arrest in the past four months. He was arrested for resisting an officer without violence in early August, reports the Miami Herald.","Gabriel Harris, 33, was arrested at Taco Bell drive-through in Florida .

"Ruby Holt spent most of her 100 years on a farm in rural Tennessee, picking cotton and raising four children. She never had the time or money to go to a beach. That finally changed this month, just a few weeks shy of Holt's 101st birthday. Thanks to a partnership between the assisted living center where Holt lives and an organization that grants wishes to the elderly, Holt got to see the ocean for the first time during an all-expenses-paid trip to the Gulf of Mexico. Scroll down for video . First dip: Ruby Holt saw the ocean for the first time after being granted a birthday wish by a charity. The 100-year-old has never traveled to the beach, spending her life working on a Tennessee farm . Enjoying the waves: Ruby Holt, 100, was pictured enjoying the waves for the first time after being granted her wish to see the ocean . Mother-of-four: Hardworking Mrs Holt spent her life on a Tennessee farm and was never able to get to the beach for a vacation. She revealed she had never seen the sea to support workers at her home who decided to take action . Holt laughed and grinned as cool Gulf waters hit her feet for the first time, and she walked across the white sand with the help of aides from the home. She said she'd never seen anything as big as the ocean. But in the November chill she kept saying over and over: 'It's cold'. 'I've heard people talk about it and how wonderful it was and wanted to see it, but I never had the opportunity to do so,' Holt said. The trip was made possible by Brookdale Senior Living Solutions, where Holt lives in Columbia, Tennessee, and the Wish of a Lifetime organization. Prior to the trip she told the Colombia Daily Herald she and her husband were just too busy to take a vacation to the beach. 'There was always something to do,' She said. 'We didn’t travel much.' 'I am thrilled to death over it. I know I will enjoy it.' Mark Davis, executive director of Brookdale's Sterling House, said two workers filled out the application for Holt after learning she'd never seen the ocean and wanted to go. 'They did a water gun fight out in the courtyard during the summer and water got brought up, the beach, and that's what she told the girls, that she had never been,' he said. First-time: Ruby Holt spent most of her 100 years on a farm in rural Tennessee, picking cotton and raising four children. She never had the time or money to go to a beach but was finally granted her wish to see the sea ahead of her 101st birthday next month . Sea-view: Mrs Holt had only seen pictures of the ocean and said people told her it was 'wonderful' before her visit this month . Sunset stroll: Mrs Holt enjoyed a day on the beach courtesy of a Tennessee charity. Her assisted living center also held a party for her celebrating her beach first on Thursday night . Debbie Surgeon and Tracy Marcy helped fill out the application, and Holt's wish was granted in early November and arrangements were made for her to stay in the Perdido Beach Resort. The trip was planned as soon as possible because Holt turns 101 on December 13. 'When we got to the room yesterday she was just pointing out the ocean and, you know, her facial expressions and ... she was just speechless,' Davis said. Holt said her farming family never was able to afford a trip to the coast, and she's left Tennessee only once before. Holt said she was always too busy on the farm or working in a shirt factory to travel. The trip to the Alabama coast was her farthest venture ever from her native Giles County, about 400 miles north of the Gulf. Using a donated motorized wheelchair, which had fat tires to roll over sand, Holt stood up at the edge of the water with the help of Surgeon and Marcy. Wish granted: Mrs Holt enjoyed her first day out at the seaside just weeks before her 101st birthday . Emotional: Mrs Holt laughed and grinned as she watched the waves for the first time on the dream trip to the Gulf of Mexico . Support: Workers at Mrs Holt's home run by Brookdale Senior Living Solutions in Columbia, Tennessee, and the Wish of a Lifetime organization gave physical and emotional support to Mrs Holt on the visit . Beach bound! Mrs Holt laughed when her toes first hit the water but quickly felt the chill and was supported and taken back inside . Young at heart: Mrs Holt laughed and smiled on her first visit to the beach in 100 years . 'We got you, hon,' Surgeon said. 'We're not going to let you fall'. Holt cackled when she stood in the water but tired quickly. And with the temperature around 50 degrees, she was ready to wrap up in a blanket and head back inside. 'We don't have nothing like this in Giles County,' Holt said.","Ruby Holt, 100, was taken to see the ocean for the first time this month ahead of her 101st birthday .

"Jane Shannon, the mother of precocious pageant star . Honey Boo Boo, regularly makes headlines for all the wrong reasons and . now her relationship history is being scrutinised. According to The National Enquirer the larger-than-life character, who shot to fame on TLC'S Toddlers & Tiaras and currently stars in the spin-off series Here Come Honey Boo Boo, has had four daughters by four different men - one of which she cannot identity. The three men the 33-year-old grandmother can name have all served time in prison for crimes including sexual exploitation, arson and burglary. Finding fame: She now stars in the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo along with her family . Honey Boo Boo, whose real name is Alana Thompson, was fathered by David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, 40, who currently lives with the family at their home McIntyre, Georgia. In 1998, he was sen­tenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper. Meanwhile her eldest sister, 17-year-old Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon - who gave birth recently - didn't know her father, David Dunn, 34, until he was released from prison work detail. When she was four he was sent to  court for a child support hearing and in 1995 he returned to prison when he was sentenced for stealing a handgun and again in 1998 for stealing cartons of cigarettes. Class act: June Shannon, Honey Boo Boo's mother, . was arrested in 2008 for theft and contempt of court. Her mug shot . (above) just days after she and partner David Thompson (right) were accused . of child abuse . David Dunn, the fa­ther of June’s daughter Anna  was sentenced for stealing a handgun in 1995 and again in 1998 for stealing ciga­rettes (left) while Michael Anthony Ford (right), father of June's 15-year-old daughter Jessica served more than two years . in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the Internet . He told  The National Enquirer: 'Anna looks just like me. They want­ed me to sign away my rights to . Anna, but I refused. 'I don’t know who my own daddy is, and I always want . Anna to know who her father is. But June won’t let me see her.' The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 15-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, is Michael Anthony Ford, 35, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant. In 2005 he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the Internet putting him on the sex offender registry. He was also charged with passing bad checks and for shoplifting at a Walmart where he worked. According to Ford he has paid around $300 a month in child support for years but is still denied access to he daughter and has only met with her five times. The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 12-year-old sister Laury is said to be unkown and a source told The National Enquirer: 'There are all kinds of family stories about who Lau­ryn’s dad is. I don’t think June even knows who it is. 'We’re convinced June never got married . to any of her kids’ fathers because she gets child support and welfare . payments for each of those kids.' Despite her unorthodox life­style, June’s father, Marvin Shannon, says he’s proud of his daughter and tunes into the show every week. Honey Boo Boo’s mom June, 33, has also had run-ins with the law. Court records show she served time for cashing bad checks in 1998 and for stealing $3,300 from a safe in a McDon­ald’s she was managing in McDonough, Ga., in 2004, although those charges were later dismissed. Go-Go Juice: Honey Boo Boo shot to fame early this year after her mother was seen giving her a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull on an episode of Toddlers & Tiaras . Crazy: Once she had consumed the Juice, she was seen spinning around on the floor, her energy heightened . A mugshot of her surfaced this month as well as details of her arrest which took place in Henry . County, Georgia. According to Starcasm, . there are also additional court reports which show that the . mother-of-three was the defendant in two child support cases around the . same time, which may explain the theft charges, though it is not . entirely clear. It . came just days after learning that child services made an unannounced . visit to her and husband Mike Thompson's family home in rural McIntrye, Georgia in March of this year. The coupon queen, as she is . commonly referred to, was arrested in a location that is more than . halfway to Atlanta when measured from her current home, suggesting that . she may have been trying to escape police. The family were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, according to The National Enquirer. A . source told the magazine that authorities who made the visit 'found . reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for . June convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'. The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mr Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner. The family now star in their . own spin-off reality series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has also . showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, adopt a pet pig named Glitzy, . attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen . packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using . discount coupons. The source added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbours.' The . initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after . filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It . attracted 2.2million viewers. Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a . mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the . family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing . for dollars in a bar. Lewd: June was seen in the debut episode of her new reality series, grinding up against a young man . Stealing the limelight: June (left) has arguably become more of a focus in the reality show than her beauty pageant star daughter (right). The pair were seen on CNN earlier this month promoting the new TLC show . The video, which can still be . found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a . darkened room, dancing atop of table as coloured lights flash around . her. June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one. The . 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after . having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly . referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own. June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an . unlabelled bottle. Within seconds, the change was apparent and the . pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and . spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in . right now!' Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol. Describing how . the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and . play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.' June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series. During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit. She . has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her . shop using discount coupons and take Alana to their local food auction, . June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be . sugary donuts. She has . also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', labeling it 'better . than sex' in a teaser for tonight's new episode of the reality series. The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continued: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'","June Shannon, who shot to fame on TLC's Toddlers & Tiaras has four daughters by four different men .

"The atmosphere on Mars was once thicker, warmer and wetter than it is today until it was damaged in a 'catastrophic collision' with a planet the size of Pluto, scientists claim. Data collected by Nasa's Curiosity rover suggests the Red Planet's atmosphere once had more oxygen in it than Earth, giving serious weight to the theory it could have previously harboured alien life. Yet a major upheaval, thought to have been caused when a Pluto-sized planet collided into Mars billions of years ago, created a shift in gases that led to the atmosphere around it to shrink. Scroll down for video . Craft: This shows a self-portrait taken by the NASA rover Curiosity in Gale Crater on Mars. Measurements of the Martian air by the rover found it is mostly made of carbon dioxide with traces of other gases . Theory: There was interest in what may have existed in the past on Mars, after Curiosity found that much of the planet's atmosphere has been lost over time, suggesting it was once warmer . A team of Nasa scientists claim that a change in the ratio of two different kinds of argon gas is evidence that the atmosphere has been stripped away. Nasa's Dr Chris Webster said: 'As Mars became a planet and its magma ocean solidified, catastrophic . outgassing occurred while volatiles were delivered by impact of comets . and other smaller bodies. 'Solar wind, and the . possible impact by a Pluto-sized body is thought to have stripped much . of the initial early atmosphere from the planet, and since then the . atmosphere has developed as a balance between volcanic injection and . loss to space.' The Nasa scientists were investigating the atmosphere after one of their telescopes on Earth had detected a surprising and mysterious amount of . methane in three regions in the Martian western hemisphere. This presence of methane could have suggested there was some form of life living on the planet. Yet the Curiosity rover did not find any . methane, which has disappointed those who believe microbes may still . linger there. On Earth, methane is mainly a . by-product of life - from animal digestion and decaying plants - and the . gas can also be produced by non-biological processes. Disappointment: Last year, the Curiosity team reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site, and since then, the rover has taken several more air samples .

But last year, the Curiosity team . reported no definitive whiff of methane near the landing site, and since . then, the rover has taken several more air samples. There are also plans to sniff the . atmosphere during a drive to the Mount Sharp mountain. And in the . autumn NASA is set to launch a Mars-orbiting spacecraft aimed at solving . the methane mystery. Called Maven, the craft will target . the Martian atmosphere. Scientists want to know if it actually exists, . determine the abundance and whether that varies by year or location. 'The fact that it’s turned out to be . pretty much disproven - it’s not a surprise, but a disappointment . perhaps,' planetary scientist Adrian Brown of the SETI Institute in California, told . Wired magazine. 'The fact that (life today) has turned out to be pretty much disproven - it’s not a surprise, but a disappointment perhaps' Adrian Brown, planetary scientist . The Curiosity found the air is made . mostly of carbon dioxide. This closely matched what the twin Viking . landers detected in the late 1970s and what scientists have gleaned from . Martian meteorites. And there was also interest in what . may have existed in the past on Mars, after Curiosity found that much of . the planet’s atmosphere has been lost over time, suggesting it was once . warmer. This would have been more conducive to . liquid water flowing on the surface - and potentially even life . existing on the planet, reported Wired. Mars' atmosphere is overwhelmingly . dominated by carbon dioxide, unlike Earth's air, which is a mix of . nitrogen and oxygen. However, there was still a small surprise. Results: The nuclear-powered, six-wheel rover set down in an ancient crater near the Martian equator almost a year ago . Viking found nitrogen to be the second . most abundant gas in the Martian air, but Curiosity's measurements . revealed a nearly equal abundance of nitrogen and argon, a stable noble . gas. Mission scientists are puzzled, but suspect it might have to do with the different tools used to sample the atmosphere. ‘It's more or less an interesting . observation’ but doesn't change the notion that Mars lost most of its . original atmosphere to space, transforming the planet into a cold . desert, said Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, who is . in charge of Curiosity's air sampling experiments.

"At just 27-years-old, Jack Johnson has had a remarkable hockey career. The Coulmbus Blue Jackets defenseman, who previously played for the Los Angeles Kings, was selected third  in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft, played for Team USA in the 2010 Olympics, and has earned a staggering $23million during his career. And now all that money, and some more, is gone - because of his parents. Scroll down for video . Down and out: NHL star Jack Johnson has had his $30million fortune squandered by his parents, who he trusted with his money . Lush life: Johnson's parents spent money on cars, travel and a new home . Family: Johnson with his parents, Tina and Jack Sr., courtesy of ESPN . After parting with his agent in 2008, Johnson, who attended University of Michigan but has little financial knowledge, turned control of his money over to his parents. Then, in 2011,Johnson signed a power of attorney that granted his mother full control of his finances shortly before signing a $30.5million contract with the Kings. That is when things started to go horribly wrong. According to The Columbus Dispatch, Tina Johnson, Jack's mother, borrowed at least $15 million in her son’s name against his future earnings. What's more, she borrowed from nonconventional lenders and defaulted on the loans. The loans included one from Iowa Congressman Rodney L. Blum for $2million, with an interest rate of 12 percent, and one from Pro Player Funding for $3 million, with an interest rate of 24 percent. Now, Jack has been sued repeatedly for $6million in loan repayments after his parents splurged on cars, a home in Manhattan Beach, California, along with $800,00 in upgrades, and travel. He has also been forced to declare bankruptcy. 'Jack would ask [his parents] questions: ""What’s this? What are these guys calling about?"",' a source told the paper.

"Tragic: Ralph Knowles, 5, and his sister Sharon Knowles, 7, who died in their backyard swimming pool . Two young siblings reported missing on New York's Long Island have been found dead. The fully clothed bodies of Ralph Knowles, 5, and Sharon Knowles, 7, were pulled from the black waters of a neighbor's pool in 50-degree temperatures on Sunday, police said. Authorities received a 911 call at about 3.30pm from a mother reporting that her children had disappeared from their home in Central Islip, said Detective Sgt. Edward Fandrey of the Suffolk County police homicide squad. While searching the neighborhood, an . officer spotted a shoe floating in a next-door neighbor's above ground . pool, which was uncovered and contained blackish water, Fandrey said. Officers . jumped into the 4-foot-deep pool and discovered the unconscious bodies . of Ralph and Sharon . The brother and sister were taken to Southside . Hospital, where efforts to resuscitate them failed, Fandrey said. The pool is surrounded by a deck. The pool and deck are both are sunken into the ground and surrounded by a low, wooden fence. Fandrey said the pool's owner had been cited by the town for improper fencing. 'The . exposed side of the stockade fence was facing out, instead of the . smooth side,' he said, adding that the slats made it easier to climb . over the shared fence. Tragedy: This is the black water pool where the bodies of a young brother and sister were found in 50-degree weather on Sunday . The owner was cited by county code officials for not putting sufficient barriers around the pool . Distraught: Mother Tia Knowles pictured at a friend's home . Telephone calls to numbers listed for the addresses of the victims and the pool's owner went unanswered Sunday night. The home where the children lived is owned by a nonprofit that provides housing to homeless families, Newsday reported. The children's uncle, Henry Valentine, . 32, of Jamaica, Queens, told the newspaper that the childrens' mother, . whom he identified as Tia Knowles, was 'devastated.' 'She's not doing good at all,' he said. About ten people die from unintentional drowning every day in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, two of the victims are children aged 14 or younger. Drowning is the fifth leading cause of deaths from unintentional injury in the United States, the CDC said. For every child who dies from drowning, another  five need to receive emergency hospital treatment for their injuries, according to the agency.","Ralph Knowles, 5, and Sharon Knowles, 7, found dead in Long Island .

"A new Tinder style app allows travellers to connect all over the globe, without having ever met in person. Tripr allows tourists and backpackers to maximise the social side of their trips, by introducing them to people who will be in the same place, at the same time -  before they even get there. 'With Tripr, planning a trip becomes more about 'who' than it is about 'where' and 'when', CEO and Founder of Tripr, Nicolas Green, told MailOnline Travel. Scroll down for video . 'Planning a trip becomes more about 'who' than it is about 'where' and 'when', says Triper CEO, Nicolas Green . 'You can also see where your friends are going. No more fomo and much more social travelling. You'll never hear about a friend that was in the same city of you and you had no idea, ever again.' First, users create a profile, entering in information about their itinerary, the name of the city they'll be visiting or an attraction or event they're heading for. Then they  enter their preferences about who they'd like to meet up with, and can start anonymously swiping through potential travel buddies. If two users 'like' each other - a connection is made, via Facebook. 'We chose to use Facebook for a few reasons,' Green said. 'First, it makes the initial sign-up significantly quicker; it also provides a degree of authentication that we would not be able to offer at this stage; and we are able to show how people are connected via different degrees of separation.' Users can anonymously swipe through potential travel buddies and make connection . 'We are aiming to fundamentally change the way that people travel,' says Green. 'At the moment, who a traveller can meet is limited to where they stay, what they do and chance. This drastically reduces the number of people that a traveller can meet.' The app has drawn comparisons to dating app Tinder, but Green says there's a lot more on offer with Tripr. 'We have seen a lot of people that are using Tinder to meet new people on their travels but have been put off by the more 'sexual' nature of app. Travellers can match with locals, which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip . 'The other problem that they experience is that they often get 'matched' after they have already left. With Tripr you can connect well in advance. No more missed connections. 'The other bonus of Tripr is that you can match with locals, which is great for local advice like places to stay or things to do on your trip. People may well use Tripr for travel dating but we want it to be so much more. We want people to connect with like minded travellers regardless of sex.' And what of the potential dangers of meeting up with strangers? 'The advantage with Tripr is that for 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree connections, the user can see how they are connected,' says Green. 'This offers a degree of safety because the user can then ask the mutual friend for a reference on any new potential travel friend. The anonymous nature of the swiping also means that if you 'X' a user, they will not be able to contact you. You can only contact another tripr user if you both approve each other.' Users  enter information such as they will be travelling and preferences about who they'd like to meet . 'The argument for its safety can be put like this; you could meet a stranger at a bar on your travels (degree of risk) or you could connect with them (potentially months in advance) on Tripr and get to know them, get a reference from a mutual friend and make sure they are who they say they are, long before you actually meet them in person. 'Lastly, all our users login via Facebook ands this provides an extra degree of user verification.' The app was initially aimed at students, but Green hopes it will appeal to 'a new generation of backpacker' and eventually  to all travelers. Tripr is available for iOS devices through Apple's app store.","New travel app allows backpackers to arrange to meet up all over the globe .

"A couple of decades ago my late husband Bruce, then chief executive of a TV company, and I, were dining with a group of television executives. When Bruce momentarily left the table the man on my right — successful, educated, middle-aged — leered at me, groped my knee and announced: ‘If ever you get bored with the old man you know where to come.’ I swatted him off like an irritating fly, told him sharply to get lost and pointedly ignored him for the rest of the evening. The man who goosed me was irksome, clearly drunk and daft enough not to recognise the implications of making an improper suggestion to his boss’s wife. 'Women in Britain today are both privileged, high-achieving and in my view, quite capable of standing up for ourselves', says Kathy . However, I would argue that his fumble and ill-judged remark – although marking him out as boorish and stupid – didn’t make him sexist. To have made a fuss would have been to exaggerate my sense of grievance and, more pertinently, to demean women who had proper cause for complaint. That is why this week I found myself bridling at the comments of United Nations special rapporteur Rashida Manjoo, a South African expert on human rights looking at violence against women in the UK, who had the temerity to accuse Britain of being more sexist than any other country in the world, due to our ‘boys’ club sexist culture’. I have to take issue with her on many levels; not least because women in Britain today are both privileged, high-achieving and in my view, quite capable of standing up for ourselves. Indeed, not only are we shattering glass ceilings, we are also usurping men in top jobs and dominating many professions. British women are in the ascendancy. They do not need patronising initiatives on sexism. For the fact is, women in the UK today have never had it so good. Statistics from the Higher Education Authority revealed last year around 20 universities in the country had twice as many female undergraduates as male. Women students out-numbered men on many courses, most notably in veterinary science, medicine and education. Last autumn, the total of male students enrolling for university fell, while women were a third more likely to take degree than their male counterparts. The proportion of women directors among the FTSE 100 companies rose to almost a quarter this year and this figure is set to grow. 'Today, I would suggest, women do not just have parity with men, actually we now have the advantage over them' So the facts disprove Ms Manjoo’s contention: women are, in fact, the dominant sex in contemporary Britain. Despite this, the cry of feminists deriding our ‘sexist’ culture has never been louder. Thanks to the po-faced ministrations of the sisterhood, we inhabit a dull, androgynous and increasingly humourless society in which men feel constrained from telling mother-in-law jokes for fear of being labelled a misogynist, and balk at complimenting women on their appearance in case they are cast as sex pests. In Ms Majoo’s sterile, politically-correct world, men who wolf-whistle at women are part of an ‘ingrained sexist culture’. I’m sure I will rankle the feminists when I say that, as a mother of two grown-up sons, I’m heartily grateful for the odd whistle of approbation. Neither do I feel demeaned by men who are civil enough to open doors for me, proffer their seats on trains or even comment favourably on my appearance. As I mentioned before, my husband Bruce, who died in 2000, was Australian. The Aussies have a long and ignoble tradition of making jokes at the expense of women. I’ll cite an example to give you a flavour: How many men does it take to open a beer? None. It should be opened by the time she brings it. Yes, of course it is crass, but should the enlightened West be bothering to expend its energy and resources fighting such harmless sexism, when there are bigger battles to be won on behalf of genuinely oppressed women? In the UK, the Equality Act has enshrined in the law the notion of equal rights for women in the  work place. Today, I would suggest, women do not just have parity with men, actually we now have the advantage over them. And yet we have reached the point where the sexes are no longer permitted to celebrate their different skills and inherent aptitudes. Kathy argues that when she was drunkenly groped by a male friend at a dinner party: 'his fumble and ill-judged remark - although marking him out as boorish and stupid - didn't make him sexist' In some quarters, men and women are being melded into an amorphous mass.It is now heresy to suggest that women have greater emotional intelligence, kindness or empathy than men; that they are more adept at home-making and more skilled at raising children. The title ‘housewife’ has become pejorative. Twenty-seven years ago I abandoned a well-paid and prestigious career in television — I was features editor on TV AM — to be a full-time mum. I had not intended to relinquish work and, had employed a nanny to look after my first-born so I could race back to the studio, untrammelled, so I imagined, by guilt or regret, to pursue my career. But I had not reckoned with the sheer distress I felt at leaving my year-old baby in the care of someone else. I managed to work for 11 months, but I was so racked with sorrow and yearning, in the end I gave up to look after my son then remained a full-time mum when my second was born. When I met Baroness Thatcher at a reception and admitted sheepishly I was ‘just a mum’. She responded crisply that there was no ‘just’ about motherhood: raising the next generation was, she insisted, the most worthy and laudable of occupations. And it is this simple but self-evident truth that strident feminists overlook when they inveigh against sexism and campaign so blindly for equal opportunities. We women have infiltrated every area of . professional life, and of course must celebrate our freedom to take jobs . in which we can fulfil our potential . We women have infiltrated every area of professional life, and of course must celebrate our freedom to take jobs in which we can fulfil our potential. But in the clamour for equality — to have equal numbers of female sports presenters and comediennes on TV and radio panel shows for example –— we have also overlooked the truism that men are actually better suited for some jobs than women. The opposite is also true. Ms Manjoo shared her preliminary findings and asked: ‘Have I seen this level of sexist culture in other countries? It hasn’t been so in-your-face in other countries. I haven’t seen that so pervasively in other countries.’ Yet in her South Africa homeland, one woman, on average, is murdered by her partner every eight hours. There is a danger, too, in glibly blaming every ill on sexism. Ms Majoo attributes ‘the easy availability of porn’ to it. But I dispute this. Porn in my view has much more to do with our overly liberal society — for which women, quite as much men, are responsible — and the availability of technology to access it. So I argue for a better sense of proportion, and for a degree of levity to be injected into the debate. We Brits are celebrated for our humour. It is up to each one of us to decide whether we are offended or not: by saucy seaside postcard cartoons, by mother-in-law gags, by wolf whistles; even by crass and illiberal Antipodean jokes. And we should save our energy for the real battles and reserve our outrage and energies for women in oppressive regimes the world over who genuinely warrant our help.

"Britain's welfare budget is to be capped at around £120billion-a-year to stop the benefits bill ballooning out of control. Chancellor George Osborne wants to limit the total amount the state spends on handouts, with ministers forced to face a Commons vote if costs spiral. Only pensions and Jobseekers Allowance will be excluded, meaning a raft of payments including pensioner benefits, income support, maternity pay and most housing benefit could be in the firing line. Scroll down for video . Britain's bill for pensions and benefits is forecast to hit £167billion by 2016-17 . Mr Osborne argues that under Labour spending on benefits was 'out of control', with the number of people who have never worked doubling in a decade. He wants to use the new cap on total welfare spending to keep a tighter grip on the nation’s finances, so that future Chancellors do not allow benefits to rise when times are good. The Office for Budget Responsibility will set a forecast for each of the next five years. If the government is going to breach the cap, the Work and Pensions Secretary will be summoned to the Commons to explain what action, if any, they plan to take before facing a vote. Mr Osborne told MPs: 'Britain should always be proud of having a welfare system that helps those most in need. 'But never again should we allow its costs to spiral out of control and its incentives to become so distorted that it pays not to work. 'In future, any government that wants to spend more on benefits will: have to be honest with the public about the costs, need the approval of Parliament, and will be held to account by this permanent cap on welfare.' The move is designed to challenge the Labour party to match the Tories’ tough approach to benefits. But . it has proved controversial because it will include most benefits . within the control of ministers, except Jobseekers Allowance or the . state pension. Mr Osborne insists he will not cut pensions 'for those who’ve worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say, housing benefit for young people had got out of control'. Jobseekers Allowance will not be included, because it rises and falls in line with the state of the economy. Mr Osborne argues that the government has a 'responsibility to taxpayers' to control spending on welfare and in turn Parliament has 'a responsibility to the country to hold the government to account for it'. Housing benefit, Disability Living Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance make up the biggest expenditure on beneifts . Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said pensioner benefits including free TV licences, bus passes and help with heating bills would be included in the cap. Are you better off after today's Budget? Are you better off after today's Budget? Now share your opinion . He warned existing protections for a raft of benefits would have to ‘disappear’ once the government sets a limit on the £100billion welfare bill. In December Mr Cameron admitted that maternity and paternity pay for new parents would be included in a new cap on welfare spending. The cost of the benefits, which are paid to mothers and fathers who take time off work to look after their children, is set to exceed £2.5billion a year within four years as more parents take them up. Housing benefit is the single biggest cost for the taxpayer, totalling £23.8billion in 2013-14. Disability Living Allowance costs £13.8billion, Employment and Support Allowance £9.6billion and Attendance Allowance £5.6billion. The bill for Income Support is £3.3billion, carer's allowance £2.1billion and maternity pay £2.4billion. Winter fuel payments cost £2.2billion, and TV licences for the over-75s £604million.","At the start of a Parliament the OBR will forecast welfare spending .

"Low-cost American airline JetBlue is the latest in a string of budget carriers to add fees to checked baggage and squeeze seats even closer together in order to boost profit. The airline said it will create three ticket classes beginning in the first half of 2015, and only the top two include at least one free checked bag. Checked bag fees emerged in 2008, when airlines needed money to cover rising fuel costs. In the first six months of this year, U.S. airlines raised $1.7bn (£1bn) from bag fees. Extra costs: Budget airline JetBlue is the latest major US airline to charge passengers to check in bags . JetBlue's decision will leave Southwest as the only major US airline to let all passengers check a bag free. And needless to say, passengers are not happy. Some complained that JetBlue was sacrificing perks that helped the airline win customer-satisfaction awards year after year. 'Airline tickets are already expensive,' said longtime JetBlue flier Maxwell Haddad, from New York. He added that not charging for the first bag 'was an extra level of kindness or service that JetBlue offered. They seemed to value customer service above and beyond other airlines.' JetBlue declined to give prices but said adding fewer than half of their passengers check in a bag. Complaints: Unsurprisingly, customers are not happy with the prospect of paying to check in bags . The airline also will add 15 seats to its Airbus A320 planes, increasing capacity to 165 from 150, which will reduce the  average legroom to from 34.7 to 33.1 inches. The changes will begin in late 2016 and take two years to implement, say JetBlue representatives, adding that there will still be more legroom in the main cabins of bigger airlines. It's thought that the new fare classes and bag fees will generate more than $200m (around £130m) a year in operating income. Incoming CEO Robin Hayes, a former British Airways executive, said that other features such as  free wifi, snacks and no overbooking mean that the airline can add bag fees and seats without driving away customers. He said: 'I'm confident when customers get on and see the cabin and experience the product, they're going to say, ""Wow, this is actually better than what JetBlue was flying before"".' JetBlue announced the changes as it met in New York with investors, who have been pressing the company to boost revenue and profit margins.","The budget carrier is creating three ticket classes in 2015 .

"It looks like something which could be seen in the hit film Slumdog Millionaire. But these shocking images - which show garden sheds and garages transformed into dodgy homes for immigrants - are not from the slums of Mumbai. Incredibly, they are from a west London suburb. According to The Sun, the sheds in Southall have been built by rogue landlords who are cashing in on newcomers to the country. London not Mumbai: Aerial photographs in Southall, London, where almost every house has an illegally built home in the back garden containing anywhere between one and six illegal immigrants . They are completely hidden from view from the street and are a clear breach of strict planning laws. Illegal immigrants have made some of the tiny shacks their homes, some of which are highly dangerous. Rats and cockroaches roam around the units, while others have poor wiring and sanitation. Others are adorned with flat-screen TVs, power showers and central heating. Disaster zone: Rubina Ali, who acted as young Latika in the Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, inspects the ruins of the shanty she lived in at Garib Nagar slums, Mumbai, India . Sign of the times: The greeting at Southall station is a clue that the area has a large Asian community . Known as ‘Little India’, Southall is home to a huge South Asian population, one of the biggest concentrations outside India. The town has dozens of Indian restaurants and a huge Asian shopping centre. It was used as the location for hit 2002 British film Bend It Like Beckham, starring Keira Knightley and Parminda Nagra. It also boasts a royal connection - Kate Middleton’s mother Carole was born there, moving away when she was 11. However, its history contains darker patches. In . 1981 it was the scene of devastating race riots, which saw a pub burnt . down and hundreds of Asians and right-wing skinheads fighting in the . streets. Sixty police officers and 120 rioters were injured during the violence. In . 1997, meanwhile, tragedy struck when a high-speed train smashed into a . stationary freight train near the town, leaving seven dead and 139 . injured. Sukhvinder . Singh, who is originally from the Punjab in northern India, shares a . shed with three others for £500 a month in Southall Green. The Indian labourer, who arrived in . Britain on a student visa, told The Sun: 'I'm here to work. If I wanted . to study I could have stayed in India.' Sukhvinder . told how if the council raided the shed where he pays rent then there . are 'a thousand other places like this we can stay in'. He . also told how he thinks rogue landlords flout planning rules. 'You just . have to say you're building a shed for tools. Once you've got the doors . on, you can do what you like.' Another immigrant told how he had been there for nine years and had never had a visit from the council. It is believed there are 10,000 similar shacks in London and the Home Counties. Many people who live in them are cash-in-hand manual workers who pay no tax. A man claiming to be the landlord told the newspaper how he was currently building a shed at the bottom of his garden. He had built another five years earlier and charges £40 per person per week. 'It's up to you how many tenants you put in,' he said. 'I've had no problems from the council - not yet. You just say you are bulding a garage.' Planning permission is always needed if a homeowner builds or converts an outbuilding for people to live in. The Housing Act states that council officers must give 24 hours' notice before visiting properties. This means evidence of people living in the garages and sheds can easily be removed, which has led to criticism of the system by some Ealing councillors. An Ealing Council spokesman told The Sun: 'This is a growing problem across London. We wrote to the Government in July to highlight flaws in the law that mean we have to give written notice before we can enter a property, making it very hard to prove buildings are being used as accomodation.' A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authories already had a wide range of enforcement powers to clamp down on beds with sheds. The spokesman added: 'Ministers are however in discussion with local authorities on this issue.'

"Five days on, the identity of the guardian angel priest of Missouri's Highway 19 remains as mysterious as his appearance on the roadside was miraculous. Friends and family of Katie Lentz, along with rescue workers still want to thank the unidentified man whose prayers they credit with bestowing a supernatural calm as EMT's battled to cut the Illinois teen from her mangled car wreck. But with no one coming forward to claim credit, and over 70 photographs of the crash scene yielding no images of the priest, some have suggested that the divine intervention of one of the Catholic Church's most beloved modern figures could have been at work. Indeed, Carla Churchill Lentz, the mother of Katie said that her daughter's car was so twisted that rescuers said no one should have been able to survive. 'I do believe he certainly could have been an angel dressed in priest's attire because the Bible tells us there are angels among us.' Scroll Down for Video . Missouri Savior? Many had speculated online that Padre Pio who was said to be blessed with many supernatural powers during his life time was the priest who helped Katie Lentz on Highway 19 on Sunday . Some have speculated online that the priest could have been the Catholic Saint Padre Pio, who died in Italy 45 years ago. He has a huge global following, with celebrities such Sophia Loren and the Italian Andrea Bocelli devoted to the humble man from San Giovanni Rotondo. Padre Pio was said to have suffered the stigmata - the wounds of Jesus Christ on the cross - throughout his adult life and those who knew him said that he exuded a blissful smell of violets, had persuasive powers of conversion and could heal the sick. However, most remarkable of all, it is believed that Padre Pio had the gift of 'bilocation' - the ability to be in two places at once. Mangled Wreck: Emergency workers were struggling to save Katie Lentz when she was hit head-on by a drunk driver on Highway 19 near to Center, Missouri . Effort: The desperate effort to save Katie Lentz was blessed by the Catholic priest who appeared from nowhere and just as mysteriously vanished . Indeed, the man who appeared at the crash site was said by those who saw him to have an olive complexion, facial hair, a foreign accent and carried an old wooden rosary - which he prayed with while the emergency workers battled to free Katie Lentz. It is his seemingly miraculous powers that have led some of his followers to believe that the man who blessed Lentz and her rescuers was indeed, Padre Pio. Pio's real name was Francesco Forgione and he was born in 1887 to peasant farmers living near Foggia on Italy's east coast. A poor scholar, he entered a Capuchin monastery as a novice at the age of 15, already suffering from ill-health aggravated by self-imposed penances. By the age of 23, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, only for the disease miraculously to leave him. But it was when the bleeding stigmata appeared overnight on Padre Pio's body that he became a true 'celebrity'. Composite and Saint: A sketch was created from the recollections of those who were at the scene of the crash on Sunday to help jog peoples memories - while (right) Saint Toribo Romo has been suggested as the identity of the mystery priest . On October 22, 1918, he wrote to his spiritual adviser, describing how this happened to him. 'On the morning of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass, I yielded to a drowsiness similar to a sweet sleep. I was suddenly filled with great peace and abandonment which effaced everything else and caused a lull in the turmoil. All this happened in a flash. 'While this was taking place, I saw before me a mysterious person....his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. The sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. 'I thought I should die and really should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart, which was about to burst out of my chest. 'The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day."" Padre Pio's wounds continued to bleed till the end of his life, the liquid exuding a sweet smell akin to violets. The cuts refused to heal and he lost as much as a cup of blood a day. While a spokesman for the Jefferson City Diocese attempts to find the identity of the priest - some parishioners have suggest that Father Donardo 'Dandi' Bermejo is the man . While the world waits to see if indeed the guardian angel of Highway 19 is revealed, a Tucson-based artist who works for a facial recognition software firm has created a sketch which he hopes will lead to the mans identification. Sands explained in an e-mail to FOX 4 that he based the sketch on mostly on media reports. He also said he has a brother-in-law who is a priest and he just had a sense based on his experiences and the reports of what the unidentified priest may look like. It was on Sunday that Katie Lentz, a sophomore at Tulane University, was driving from her parents' Quincy, Illinois home to Jefferson City, Missouri, where she has a summer internship. Her Mercedes was hit head-on by another vehicle, driven by a drunk driver and the accident crushed Lentz's car in a mangled wreck that left her with multiple broken bones, a ruptured spleen and damaged liver. Workers from across the county battled for over an hour and a half to extricate Lentz from her car - but she was fading fast and their equipment was not heavy duty enough. It was then that she asked to pray and at that moment the priest appeared to offer his blessings to Lentz and the emergency workers. Divine Intervention: Katie Lentz was saved after emergency workers from Hannibal fire services arrived with heavy duty cutting equipment . The silver haired priest was reportedly in his 50s or 60s and was wearing black pants, a black shirt and black collar and seemingly stepped forward to answer Lentz's plea from nowhere. Raymond Reed, the New London fire chief said that it struck him as odd from the start as Highway 19 was blocked off for two miles in each direction and no one from the close-knit community recognized the man. 'We're all local people from four different towns,"" Reed said. ""We've only got one Catholic church out of three towns and it wasn't their priest.' Immediately after the 6ft tall priest gave his blessing, the emergency workers righted the car, stabilized Lentz's vital signs and cut her out once the jaws of life appeared from a neighboring town. She was put in an air ambulance and is now recovering in hospital. But when they turned to thank the priest, he was gone. Some have pointed out that Sunday just happened to be the feast of St. John Vianney, the patron saint of priests. Others have said that the mystery priest could be be Father Toribio Romo González - the patron saint of immigrants. He was killed in Mexico's Cristero War but his ghost is said to haunt highways as far north as Illinois, giving people in need water, food and even helping them with directions if they are lost. Others have pointed to the more plausible guess that the priest who stopped to help is from a neighboring town. Scene: Dozens of emergency workers battled to free Katie Lentz as she lay pinned in her Mercedes wreck on Highway 19 . Saved: Chief Raymond Reed said that the Catholic priest, now identified as Patrick Dowling, made everyone including Katie Lentz calmer before the jaw-of-life appeared from Hannibal . Some have suggested that Father Donardo 'Dandi' Bermejo, the pastor of St Mary's Catholic Church of Shelbina, Missouri could be the mystery priest. On the church website, Father Dandi posted a link to a news story of the mysterious priest, stating, 'Divine' intervention of a higher power. The Holy Spirit works through all of us. However, a spokesperson for the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City said that they had ruled Father Dandi out, because he was saying mass at the time of the crash. 'I think it's a miracle,' said New London Fire Chief Raymond Reed to KHQA. 'I would say whether it was an angel that was sent to us in the form of a priest or a priest that became our angel, I don't know. Either way, I'm good with it.' The Facebook page of Lentz's mother, Carla Church Lentz, indicates Lentz is on the mend despite suffering two broken femurs, a broken tibia and fibia, broken left wrist, nine broken ribs, a lacerated liver, ruptured spleen and bruised lung. Empty Stretch: The road was closed for a quarter of a mile either side of the crash and there were no bystanders . Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of My Life with the Saints, has a different theory. 'Most likely the priest will be identified, and people will be able to thank him,' he told The Huffington Post in an emailed message Thursday. 'If he's not found, that may mean he wants to remain anonymous. Could it have been an angel? There are similar 'angelic' stories in the lives of the saints, when a figure inexplicably appears and cannot be located afterwards. 'There are angels, of course, but we tend to ascribe to angels anonymous acts that we find incredibly loving -- when in fact human beings do incredibly loving things in hidden ways every day.' A spokesman for the Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City  said officials are trying to get to the bottom of the mystery. 'We do have several churches and parishes in the area,' diocese spokesman Deacon Dan Joyce said. 'We saw the description information and we have pictures on file of all of our priests, but we haven't heard directly from any of them.'","Illinois student Katie Lentz, 19, had been pinned inside her Mercedes for over an hour and was fading fast when she asked her rescuers to pray .

"When Taylor Swift decided to pull her music off Spotify earlier this month she said she was unhappy that listeners could stream her songs for free. Yet based on the number of streams that her massive hit Shake It Off enjoyed during the month of October, Spotify will have paid out somewhere between $280,000 and $390,000 in royalties for that one song alone. The popular music streaming service has repeatedly come in for criticism from musicians who claim that it doesn’t pay them enough for their craft. Taylor Swift's hit Shake It Off was the most streamed song on Spotify during October, but so far this year Calvin Harris takes the accolade for his song Summer which has been streamed more than 203 million times . In the wake of Swift’s departure, the company’s CEO Daniel Ek was quick to point out that Spotify had paid more than $2 billion to music labels and publishers since 2008, while illegal downloads don’t provide any revenue for artists. But Swift didn’t sound convinced when she spoke to Time about her decision. ‘I think there should be an inherent value placed on art. I didn’t see that happening, perception-wise, when I put my music on Spotify,’ she said. Now Time has carried out some rudimentary maths to get a better idea of how much artists are making from the website. Shake It Off received 43.6 million plays during October, meaning Spotify will have had to pay out between $280,000 and $390,000 . Spotify published its royalty payouts formula in 2013, including the claim that its average ‘per stream’ payout is between $0.006 and $0.0084. Those figures cover payments to labels, publishers and distributors, who then pass them on to artists and songwriters. Shake It Off, the first single from Swift’s latest album 1989, amassed an astounding 43.6 million plays on Spotify during October which means the singer - who co-wrote the song with producers Max Martin and Shellback - will be entitled to a large share of the estimated $390,000 in revenue it has generated. Swift pulled Shake If Off from the service after only seven weeks and by doing so will actually loose out on a lot of additional revenue. The most streamed song on Spotify this year is Summer by Calvin Harris. It has been streamed 203 million times since it was released in March, earning the Scottish DJ/producer somewhere between $1.2 million and $1.7 million in royalties. The biggest song of the year on Spotify is Summer by Calvin Harris which has earned somewhere between $1.2 million and $1.7 million in royalties . According to Spotify, Swift had earned $2 million off global streaming of her music in the past year, although that figure has been disputed by her record label. Nashville-based Big Machine claims it had received exactly $496,044 for domestic streaming of Swift’s music over the past 12 months. Despite Swift's skepticism, music streaming services are considered to be the future of how people consume music. Apple is reportedly set to bundle the subscription music service it bought from Beats into its iOS operating system early next year, while Google said last week that YouTube is rolling out a long-awaited paid monthly music subscription service called YouTube Music Key. According to Spotify its subscriber base has grown to 12.5 million, up from 10 million when the number was last reported in May.","Shake It Off received 43.6 million plays during October, meaning Spotify will have had to pay out between $280,000 and $390,000 .

"It's only been a few weeks since she split from her toyboy pilot lover but Carol Vorderman was all smiles as she became the first woman to be named an honorary ambassador for the Air Cadets. The former Countdown presenter, 53, was welcomed to RAF Syerston near Newark in Nottingham by Air Chief Marshal Sir Andrew Pulford. Ms Vorderman - herself a qualified private pilot - was later unveiled as the only female Group Captain Ambassador in the flying organisation’s 76- year history. Scroll down for video . New appointment: Carol Vorderman has been announced as the new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets, RAF Syerston, Nottighamshire . Looking glamorous in her RAF uniform, she laughed and joked as she spoke to several young cadets throughout the morning. Ms Vorderman, who has an MBE for her services to broadcasting, said: 'I am truly honoured to be appointed as an ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets. 'I can’t wait to meet the cadets, and the adult volunteer staff who give so much of their time to support them,' she said. 'The cadets themselves are a shining example of the best of British youngsters, standing with them on a parade square will be a great privilege. 'The Air Cadets is open to all and has squadrons all over the UK. Many are taught to fly gliders even before they get their driving licence. Putting on a brave face: It's only been a few weeks since she split from her toyboy pilot lover but Carol Vorderman was all smiles today as she was honoured . A far cry from Countdown!  Carol Vorderman . is the new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets and posed in her new uniform to celebrate the occasion . 'They have great fun with many taking part in adventure training, all kinds of sport and the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme. Lots of good engineering and technology practice even allows cadets to learn and achieve BTECs.' She also spoke of her own two children - both of whom are also keen fliers and have been part of the Air Cadets. 'I am the mother of two children who have been either part of Air Cadets or University Air Squadron and they both loved it,' she said. 'This is like coming home. I was studying for an engineering degree at Cambridge in 1978 and desperately wanted to join the RAF as a pilot, but sadly back then they wouldn’t accept women in that position, so after I graduated I went off into another life. 'I finally got my Private Pilot’s Licence last December. Things are very different now and I know a number of incredible female RAF pilots. 'The Air Cadets is an inspiring organisation for young people to join and the RAF is a unique family to be a part of. There will now be two of us at home who are part of the RAF in one way or another.' Happy to be here: Speaking  about her accolade, she said: 'I'm looking forward to getting started and working closely with the youths' Brave face: Carol and 'Duffy', as he is known to his friends, met through her charity work with the RAF and were friends for several years before embarking on a relationship in 2012 . One onlooker, whose son was among the cadets, said: 'Carol seemed delighted with the accolade and looked much younger than 53. She’s never looked better and was really enjoying herself. 'You couldn’t wipe the smile off her face and had time for all of the young cadets that wanted to meet her. Considering she’s broken up with her partner recently she seemed in great spirits. 'You think the RAF link would have reopened old wounds, but she was really bubbly. Maybe she was just putting on a brave face.' In September, Ms Vorderman called time on her relationship with with former Red Arrows squadron leader Graham Duff, who is 14 years her junior. The couple were last seen in public as they walked the red carpet at the London Palladium on September 3rd. The pair met through her charity work with the RAF and were friends for several years before embarking on a relationship in 2012. The father-of-one, known to his friends as 'Duffy', is an RAF pal of Prince William who flew fighter jets in Iraq and joined the Red Arrows in 2008. He left three years later and set up a mobile phone app business. Proud team member: Speaking about the latest recruit, Comdt Air Cadets Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty said: 'We are thrilled that Carol has agreed to be our Ambassador. Her legendary mathematics skills and enthusiasm for engineering will inspire our young people' Getting into the role: Carol has long been associated with RAF linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association . Her agent John Miles said following the split: 'It’s sad for both of them but Carol felt it had naturally run its course as relationships sometimes do. 'She decided that it would be best to bring it to an end as amicably as possible, so they separated a number of weeks ago. 'It’s difficult when any relationship ends but they have had many great times together, and nobody else is involved on either side. They remain good friends.' Ms Vorderman has been married twice before. She first tied the knot at just 24 in 1985 to Royal Navy officer Chris Mather, but the marriage only lasted a year. She then got hitched in 1990 to management consultant Patrick King with whom she had a daughter Katie, 22, and son Cameron, 17, but the pair broke up ten years later. Ms Vorderman gained her Private Pilot Licence (PPL) in December 2013 and her night rating in March 2014, and is continuing with higher level pilot qualifications ahead of a planned solo flight around the world in 2015. She has long been associated with RAF-linked charities including the Royal Air Forces Association, the RAF Benevolent Fund and the Bomber Command Memorial committee. Moving on: Speaking about the relationship, Carol's agent said: 'It's sad for both of them but Carol felt it had naturally run its course as relationships sometimes do' She even led the Salute Area in Green Park in London when the Queen unveiled the RAF Bomber Command memorial in June 2012. Her two children were both members of the Combined Cadet Force at school, and Carol’s daughter Katie holds an Officer Cadet rank within the Cambridge University Air Squadron. Katie will now have to salute her mum when they meet in uniform. Commandant Air Cadets Air Commodore Dawn McCafferty said: 'We are thrilled that Carol has agreed to be our ambassador. 'Her legendary mathematics skills and enthusiasm for engineering, combined with her new-found aviation expertise, will inspire our young people and promote the air cadet experience to new audiences.'","Ms Vorderman, 53, is new Ambassador for the RAF Air Cadets in London .

"She may be recognisable across the globe as the face of the 'Chinese Girl' but Monika Pon has revealed she made no money from being in one of the most famous artworks ever. Vladimir Tretchikoff's piece is one of the most reproduced art prints in the world and is expected to sell for up to £500,000 when it goes under the hammer next month. However, despite earning the artist a fortune, Ms Pon said she was paid a tiny sum to sit for Tretchikoff and made nothing from its huge sales. Scroll down for video . The Chinese Girl made artist Vladimir Tretchikoff very rich and was one of the most popular paintings of the 20th Century but Monika Pon, right, said she made no money from its enormous popularity . Her face has appeared on everything from mugs to wallpaper, as well as various pieces of Chinese Girl paraphernalia. The South African, whose parents emigrated from China, told The Observer said: 'I've got no money from the painting. 'I was so stupid, so young. What did I know about business.' Tretchikoff approached Ms Pon, who lives in Johannesburg, when she was 17 and working in her uncle’s laundry in Cape Town in the early 1950s. He told Ms Pon, who was known locally for her beauty, that he wanted to paint her and despite being nervous, she said she felt she could not say no. He gave her £6 for six weeks of sittings in front of his art students. The original artwork was sold to a woman in Chicago and Tretchikoff claimed to have sold half a million large-format reproductions of the painting across the world. Ms Pon, who is now in her 80s, was only revealed to be the Green Lady in 2011. She recalled how she was told she was beautiful by friends and family but never felt pretty because, living in Apartheid-era South Africa, she was often subjected to racist remarks. She described Tretchikoff, who died in 2006, as 'handsome and attractive' and that he made her laugh. She enjoyed sitting for him but was less than happy with the end result. Ms Pon said in 2011: 'To be honest, I didn’t like that green face. I thought it made me look ill.’ She went on to marry and divorce commercial traveller Pon Su-Suan and have five children. She has been with the same partner for the past 40 years. Monika Sing-Lee, 17, was renowned for her beauty and Vladimir Tretchikoff asked her to sit for him . Meanwhile . Tretchikoff made millions selling cheap reproductions of his work directly to the public and although he was loathed by the critics, his art remained perennially popular. While . acknowledging he painted an early version of the picture in Cape Town, . Tretchikoff claimed it had been destroyed by vandals and maintained . until his death in 2006 that his model came from the U.S. Experts think that he concealed its true origin through misguided fear of being sued for a portion of its earnings. She said in 2011 : ‘I’m not boasting but it was my portrait that made Tretchikoff . rich. The Chinese Girl was the best thing that ever happened to me in my . not-so-nice life.’ The painting will be auctioned at Bonhams in London in March by the original buyer's granddaughter. It is also touring New York and Johannesburg. In his autobiography Pigeon's Luck, Tretchikoff wrote: 'In painting Chinese Girl I had a lot of experience to . draw on. My mind and soul went into this painting, and perhaps there . lies the explanation for its success. Somehow perhaps I caught the . essence of Chinese womanhood.' Giles Peppiatt, director of South . African Art at Bonhams, said: 'The iridescent hues of Chinese . Girl reflect Tretchikoff's experimentation with the possibilities of . his colour palette: the green-blue patina-like effect of the sitter's . face is uncanny, heightening the red of her lips and framed by her . lustrous dark hair.' Tretchikoff biographer Boris Gorelik said the painting is 'one of the most important pop culture icons in Britain and the Commonwealth in the 1950s to early 1960s. 'Today, even prints of the ""Green Lady"" in mint condition, which went for a couple of pounds in . their day, change hands for hundreds of pounds.'","Monika Pon said she was given £6 for six weeks of sittings in Johannesburg .

"Insider: Astor family heir Alexandra Aldrich, pictured, has revealed the juicy details of growing up within Rokeby - the prominent clan's 43-room Hudson River manor . An Astor family heir has revealed the juicy details of growing up within Rokeby - the prominent clan's 43-room Hudson River manor - and it was more grumbling tummies than gold-plated china. Many assumed the Aldrich family, the 10th generation of Astor heirs, were eccentric hippies living off trust funds but, according to a fascinating new memoir by one of its own, the money had run out. 'I lived a double life,' Alexandra Aldrich says. 'Our poverty was the big secret.' William B. Astor Sr. married into the 420-acre estate in 1818. But, by the time Aldrich was running down its hallways, she says 'the Astor money that had supported generations of aristocrats, ill-equipped to earn or invest, (was) gone.' The front of the house was a facade, where Aldrich's uncle told tours of people a spiel about the Astor family's 200-year history. But, behind the scenes, the home was crumbling. Aldrich and her parents shared three cramped rooms on the third floor. 'I always longed to be rescued,' Aldrich, whose book 'The Astor Orphan' is released on Tuesday, told The New York Post. She described how she envied the 'simple ranch, prefab houses' of the middle class. 'I wanted to live like them,' she says. The home she grew up in, built in 1815, was added to by every new owner and came to represent the classic 'American Gothic style.' Her ancestor William B. Astor became 'the richest man in America' with his successful trading of products such as furs, pianos and real estate. Ironic: The massive home she grew up in came to typify the American Gothic Style, but Aldrich says she came to envy middle class homes . The next generation divided into city and country Astors - the New York Astor line prospered but the country side of the clan did not fare so well. William B. Astor Sr.'s oldest daughter, Emily, passed away in childbirth and her daughter, Margaret, died of pneumonia at an early age. When her husband died two years later, their eight children, aged four to 14, became the 'Astor orphans.' Among them were 'Uncle Willie,' 'Uncle Archie' and 'Uncle Lewis.' 'These . free-spirited Astor orphans left us, their descendents, our legacy: the . house, its history, and contents, and a sense of entitlement and . superiority,' Aldrich writes in the memoir, according to The Post. Memoir: Astor Orphans by Alexandra Aldrich tells of life inside the family's Hudson River mansion . But . after Margaret's death in 1963 Rokeby began to decline and through the . 1980s, when Aldrich was a young girl, the estate continued to fall into . ruin, partly because it was owned jointly by three decedents. 'Joint ownership brought out the worst in everyone,' Aldrich says. 'Everyone had different views of what should happen to Rokeby.' It also suffered without the 25-strong staff it once had dedicated to its upkeep. Aldrich told The Post the house was divided with where you lived reflecting your status. Her uncle and his family lived in a spacious apartment on the first floor while she, her father Ricky, and his Polish artist wife were banished to the servant's quarters. She says 'the lonely squalor of the third floor' was startlingly contrasted to the grandeur of the rest of the property and she  'felt ashamed each time I climbed the stairs.' Rich: William B. Astor Sr., pictured, married into the 420-acre estate in 1818 and made his fortune selling fur and real estate . Often they didn't have the cash to buy food and bartered with neighbors to survive, she revealed. 'I enjoyed keeping the myth alive that I lived in a mansion,' Aldrich says. 'I didn’t want to bring anyone home and show them that I really live on the third floor and the front of the house is a museum.' After boarding school, she moved to Poland then returned to Brooklyn in 1998 where she converted to Orthodox Judaism and she and her husband had a son, Shlomo. But in 2005, she and her son returned to her ancestral home and lived there for six years. She says it remains 'dirty and rundown' to outsiders but has drastically improved since she was a young girl. Her father, now in his 70s, still lives in an 18-by-11-foot room that hasn't changed a bit, according to The Post. But she says, whatever it's condition, her family will never sell the grandiose property. 'It's part of our identities, part of who we are.'","Many assumed the Aldrich family, the 10th generation of Astor heirs, were eccentric hippies living off trust funds but, in fact, the money had run out .

"Urban Outfitters' latest t-shirt has created a stir for all the wrong reasons, as the sign on the front looks uncomfortably similar to a gang symbol. The Vanguard Pitchfork t-shirt looks similar to a gang sign for the the Chicago-based Gangster Disciples that began in the 1960s. Urban Outfitters prides itself on its edgy clothing but it may have crossed the line with this t-shirt. Tasteless: Urban Outfitters' new t-shirt, left, bears a striking resemblance to Gangster Disciples' symbol . Sinister: The Gangster Disciples have terrorised residents in Chicago since the 1960s . Outrage: Urban Outfitters has not commented on its t-shirt but it is no longer available to buy from their website . As a major urban gang, the Gangster Disciples are thought to be responsible for many murders in Chicago. US website All Voices has already called for Urban Outfitters to 'pull the offending shirt'. Only last week, Senator Mark Kirk called for all 18,000 members of the gang to be arrested: 'I think it’s completely within the capability of the United States government to crush a major urban gang,' he told a news conference. Police estimate that as many as 100 of the 392 homicide victims last year were connected to the Gangster Disciples. The origins of the Gangster Disciples go back to the 1960s, and it became a major force under the leadership of Larry Hoover in the 1970s. By January this year, the homicide rate spiked to 43 - making the city even more dangerous than when mobster Al Capone ruled the streets. Two alleged members who have been . charged with the murder of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old schoolgirl . who was gunned down in Chicago in January - just a week after she performed at . President Obama's inaugural events. Police said gang members were at the park where Hadiya was killed but that she was not a gang member. It is not clear whether Urban Outfitters knowingly invoked the symbol of the gang or whether it was an unwitting mistake. Either way it could cause them a lot of trouble. Rapper Rick Ross was forced to cancel several concert dates after the Gangster Disciples threatened to crash two North Carolina shows in retaliation for him allegedly using the gang's logo for his mixtape 'Black Bar Mitzvah'. Murdered: Baby Jonylah Watkins was shot as she sat on her father, Jonathan's lap in March. She survived a separate shooting of her mother Judy when she was still in the womb . Tragic: Oscar-winner Jennifer Hudson lost three members of her family, including her nephew, Julian, in a triple homicide by a Gangster Disciples member in 2008 . No one from the company was available to comment. However, it was no longer possible to purchase the t-shirt on the website today. On the website it is simply described as: 'A perfectly soft tee topped with a ""Fork"" graphic'.","Urban Outfitters has caused outrage with its Vanguard Pitchfork t-shirt .

"Just a fifth of Americans believe that . humans evolved naturally over millions of years, while the vast majority . believe that God had a hand in the evolution of humans, according to . new research. According to a YouGov poll, 21 per cent of U.S. citizens believe that 'human beings evolved from less advanced life forms over millions of years, and God did not directly guide this process'. Meanwhile, 79 per cent of those polled said they either believe God played a part in our existence (the largest sector at 62 per cent) or were not sure (17 per cent). Believers: The number of people who believe in pure evolution is on the rise in the U.S. but those who think God played a part still account for the vast majority - 62 per cent . A quarter of the 1,000 people . polled said they believed mankind evolved from more primitive life forms . but that 'God guided the process'. And a further 37 per cent said they believe that 'God created human beings in their present form within the last ten thousand years'. The findings in fact show a trend towards a greater proportion of Americans believing in the theory of evolution, as opposed to the theory of creationism. Eight years ago, the same poll found that only 13 per cent of Americans believed they evolved without the guidance of God; that figure rose to 15 per cent in 2008. According to the research and consulting organisation, the upward trend is also likely to continue, since young people tend to lean more towards the theory of evolution than older generations. On the rise: The YouGov poll shows that since 2004 the trend towards believing in pure evolution has been steadily rising, in part because young people tend more to lean towards this belief . In the latest survey, 31 per cent of 18-29-year-olds said they believed God played no part in their evolution. In schools, however, the nation remains divided on how to teach children of mankind's evolution. The YouGov researchers asked a second . question concerning creationism (the religious belief that the universe . was created by a supernatural force) and intelligent design, a form of . creationism that argues against natural selection, attributing evolution . instead to an intelligent cause. The poll found that 40 per cent favour teaching creationism and intelligent design, while 32 per cent opposed such teachings, and 29 per cent were not sure. Not surprisingly, the vast majority (83 . per cent) of those describing themselves as atheist were opposed to the . idea, while those who cited a religion were far more likely to support . it, particularly Mormons (76 per cent), Protestants (52 per cent) and . Roman Catholics (42 per cent). Evolution or creationism?: A declining number of Americans polled believe human beings in their present form are created by God, but what about Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, pictured attending the World War Z premiere last month in Berlin? In the political arena, the survey found that 57 per cent of Republicans favoured teaching creationism and intelligent design in public schools, versus just 30 per cent among Democrats. Meanwhile, just five per cent of Republicans supported the theory of a natural, Godless, evolution. The findings show a remarkable shift in beliefs in the U.S. since a renowned Tennessee court case 88 years ago, which charged school teacher John Scopes with teaching evolution, which was at the time against the law in the state. Divided nation: In schools, 40 per cent of those polled favoured the teaching of creationism - greater than the number who believed God created all human beings in their present form . Scopes lost the trial, according to YouGov, but the case raised the profile and support for the argument to teach evolution in schools.

"They are yet more proof of the red planet's wet past. The European Space Agency today released an astonishing series of pictures showing the remnants of a huge river than once ran across Mars. Taken by the ESA’s Mars Express, they show Reull Vallis, the 'river-like structure' is believed to . have formed when running water flowed in the distant martian past. This computer-generated image of a river-like feature in the Reull Vallis region of Mars was created using data from the Mars Express spacecraft . The images were taken from data collected in the Reull Vallis region of Mars, shown here . It . cut a steep-sided channel through the Promethei Terra Highlands . before running on towards the floor of the vast Hellas basin. This astonishing structure, which stretches for almost 900 mile (1500 km) across the martian landscape, is flanked by numerous tributaries, one of which can be clearly seen cutting in to the main valley towards the upper (north) side. Experts say the images show a 'striking resemblance . to the morphology found in regions on Earth affected by glaciation'. 'For . example, we can see circular step-like structures on the inner walls of . the sediment-filled crater in the foreground of the second perspective . view,' ESA said. Planetary scientists think that these may represent former high . water or glacial levels, before ice and water sublimated or evaporated . away in stages at various times. The new Mars Express image below shows a region of Reull Vallis at a point where the channel is almost 4 miles (7km) wide and 1,000 feet (300m) deep. The sides of Reull Vallis are particularly sharp and steep in these images, ESA said, with parallel longitudinal features covering the floor of the channel itself. The river-like channel is 7 km wide, and a depth of around 300m. It is believed to have been formed by flowing water, which cut through highland terrain and formed smooth plains. This colour-coded overhead view reveals the depth of the craters and river beds . These structures are believed to be . caused by the passage of loose debris and ice during the ‘Amazonian’ period (which continues to this day) due to glacial flow along the . channel. The structures . were formed long after it was originally carved by liquid water during . the Hesperian period, which is believed to have ended between 3.5 . billion and 1.8 billion years ago. Similar lineated structures, believed to be rich in ice, can also be found in many of the surrounding craters. The Mars Express craft was also able to produce this 3D image of the area thanks to its twin cameras .

"Theft: Kathy Lette had her high-tech car stolen . When best-selling author Kathy Lette spotted that her sporty black BMW was missing, it took a few moments for the truth to dawn. ‘At first I thought I must have got tipsy the night before and left the car at a pal’s place,’ she says. ‘But a quick mental reconnoitre later, I realised that no, it was just missing. Stolen.’ For Kathy, the author of The Boy Who Fell To Earth and Mad Cows, the shock of losing her car was followed by a further surprise. First, she learned from the police that this was not an ordinary car theft but ‘car hacking’ — a worrying new sort of crime which sees thieves use a hand-held electronic device to exploit a glitch in the ‘keyless’ ignition systems used in most top-end vehicles. Over the past few years, tens of thousands of wealthy owners of keyless BMWs, Range Rovers and Audis have become victims. ‘No one had told me that keyless cars were vulnerable,’ says Kathy. ‘I’m also upset about the things I lost which were in the boot — a laptop, a passport and the only outline draft of my next novel. And you can’t get that back on insurance.’ Kathy’s car — like all recent BMWs — didn’t come with a traditional ignition key, but with a plastic fob containing a computer chip and security code. When the fob is placed in a slot on the dashboard, the code is detected by the car’s central computer, allowing the driver to start the engine at the press of a button. In some models, you don’t even have to put the fob into the dashboard slot: simply having it in your pocket or handbag will do the trick. Keyless cars are supposed to be convenient and more secure. In practice, though, they are anything but. Last month, police in London’s Kensington and Chelsea warned owners that their keyless ignition systems were vulnerable to theft. Scroll down for video . Soon to be a thing of the past? Traditional keys are fading in to obscurity as cars become more sophisticated . And the problem isn’t confined to the smarter London postcards. Across the country, insurers and car organisations are saying that electronic systems designed to protect our vehicles are just not good enough. So how did this happen? How did sophisticated, supposedly foolproof technology turn out to be so vulnerable? The irony is that for some years vehicles had actually been getting harder for thieves to steal. Back in the Eighties and early Nineties, anyone could break into a car within seconds. Some thieves would slide a coat hanger inside a door window, hook it onto the door’s locking mechanism and yank upwards, opening the door. Others would use a tennis ball pricked with a hole to blow air into the lock, which forced the lock button inside to pop up. It's a doddle: In the Eighties and early Nineties, anyone could break into a car within seconds . Once inside the car, it was relatively simple to ‘hot wire’ the engine by ripping out wires from underneath the dashboard and touching them together to bypass the ignition key. Security was so lax that car theft became a mini pandemic in the Eighties. There was even a new word for it: ‘twocking’, or taking without the owner’s consent. After coming under pressure from consumer groups and insurers, from the mid-Nineties, manufacturers started to make their cars more secure. Improved lock design meant it was no longer possible to unlock a car door with a piece of wire or by jamming a screwdriver into the lock and turning. And it became far harder to hot wire an engine by fiddling around with wires under the dashboard. Cars would automatically lock or trigger alarms if any attempt was made to hot wire them. Ignition keys also began to come with built-in computer chips, making them harder to copy. Turning a key in the lock wasn’t enough — the car had to detect the chip in the fob before the engine would start. But manufacturers didn’t stop there. As cars became more complex, an increasing amount of work was handed over to the onboard computer hidden under the vehicle’s bonnet. These computers don’t just control and monitor the engine, brakes, lights and air conditioning, they also control the locks. And that’s where the problems began. ‘As car manufacturers press on with new technology, the thieves are close behind them,’ says Ian Crowder of the AA. ‘That’s because there is such a ready market for stolen cars. A third of all stolen cars are never returned to their owners.’ For enterprising criminals, it didn’t take long to find a way of exploiting the technology of keyless cars. When you buy a car fitted with this technology, you are issued with a keyless ignition fob programmed by the manufacturer with a unique 40-digit code. Place the fob on the dashboard, or just climb into the car with it, and the car’s onboard computer will detect the code. If it matches the one in its memory, the driver is allowed to start the car. However, the computer is capable of doing more than just checking the code. It can also re-progamme a blank fob with a new code. Simple no more: Cars such as the Renault Laguna II now come with electronic smart cards to replace keys . And here is where the trouble begins. For just £20, car thieves can buy a blank key fob and a hand-held box that plugs into the ‘on-board diagnostic port’ — a socket linked to the computer which is usually found next to the passenger side footwell. The hand-held box tells the computer to reprogramme the blank fob with a new code. It takes only a few seconds to create a fob that can be used in the car again and again. These boxes are available on the internet and were designed so that garages and locksmiths could create replacement fobs for owners whose own sets had been lost or stolen. But they are also easily available to thieves. Thieves still have to get inside the cars, of course. Some do it the old-fashioned way by smashing a window. Others lurk close to a car as it parks and use a radio-scrambling device — again, easily bought on the internet — to stop the car locking when a driver presses the remote control button. After the driver walks away, unaware that he has left his car unlocked, the thieves can climb in, reprogramme the security system … and drive off. Steve Launchbury of the Thatcham Research Centre, which works on security and safety for the motor insurance industry, says: ‘The scale of keyless theft is certainly on the increase. ‘The devices they use are available on the internet via search engines, auction sites or, in some cases, direct from unscrupulous locksmiths and manufacturers. ‘Most vehicle brands are potentially at risk because these devices are widespread.’ The Metropolitan Police estimate that half of all car thefts involve keyless hacking. The Association of Chief Police Officers says BMW and Mercedes — two major users of keyless ignitions — are the third and fourth most stolen cars in the UK, behind Ford and Vauxhall, even though there are fewer of them and they are more likely to be kept safe in garages than cheaper cars. The risk was highlighted this year by so-called ‘ethical hackers’ — engineers looking for technical weaknesses — who breached security systems by a similar route, to warn manufacturers and the public about the dangers. Desirable: High-end cars like the Range Rover come with ever-cleverer ignitions - but owners should be careful . Using a home-made gadget costing just £12, they demonstrated to a conference in Singapore how it was possible to take over a car’s onboard controllers and switch on lights, activate the brakes and operate the locks and engine. It shouldn’t be beyond manufacturers to fix this. Car computers could be tweaked to make it harder to reprogramme a fob without the owner’s consent. However, that would make it more expensive to replace lost keys. For now, the onus is on owners to protect their vehicles. Police and the AA say drivers of keyless cars should invest in an old-fashioned steel crook lock that hooks around the steering wheel or pedals and costs from £30. These locks were popular in the Eighties and Nineties, but have fallen out of favour in recent years. ‘You can have all the technology in the world, but when a thief is faced with a piece of locked steel it means the theft will take more time and it reduces the risk of the car being stolen,’ says Ian Crowder of the AA. As for Kathy Lette, she’s not willing to forgive and forget just yet. ‘I hope that the thieves get endless parking tickets, flat tyres and cracked windscreens,’ she says. ‘Do you have any idea how many millions of words I had to write to be able to buy that car?’","Best-selling author Kathy Lette's sporty black BMW became latest victim .

"A star system containing two potentially habitable Earth-like planets is being targeted by scientists searching for extra-terrestrial intelligence. In the coming months, astronomers will turn an array of radio telescope dishes towards Kepler-62, a star smaller and dimmer than the Sun about 1,000 light years away in the constellation Lyra. A pair of so-called 'super-Earths' have been detected within the 'habitable zone' of the star, the orbital region where temperatures are just warm enough to allow bodies of surface water such as oceans and lakes. Nasa's Kepler launched in 2009 with the purpose of hunting for Earth-like planets. It discovered a planetary system last April featuring Earth-size planets in a 'habitable zone.' Kepler-62f, pictured right on this illustration, is 1.4 times the size of Earth, while Kepler-62e, pictured bottom left, is estimated to be 1.6 times larger . Nasa’s Kepler mission has discovered . two new planetary systems that include three super-Earth-size planets in . the 'habitable zone,' the range of distance from a star where the . surface temperature of an orbiting planet might be suitable for liquid . water. The Kepler-62 system has five planets; 62b, 62c, 62d, 62e and 62f. The Kepler-69 system has two planets; 69b and 69c. Kepler-62e, 62f and 69c are the super-Earth-size planets. Two of the planets, named Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f, are rocky or made mostly of ice, and are believed to be the most likely to be Earth 'doubles'. Although no-one knows what the planets are made of, they are believed to be rocky. One, Kepler-62f, is thought to have a radius about 1.4 times greater than the Earth's. The other, Kepler-62e, is estimated to be 1.6 times larger. The planets' parent star is around two billion years older than the Sun, raising the possibility of intelligent life more advanced than it is on Earth. Both will be priority targets in a new Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (Seti) programme focusing on habitable zone worlds. They were discovered by Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which has so far detected almost 3,000 candidate planets outside the Solar System. A fifth of these are believed to be 'super-Earths' between 1.25 and twice the size of the Earth. Scientists at the Centre for Seti Research in the US are listening in for radio signals from the stars that display signs of technology and intelligence. The search is being conducted from the Allen Telescope Array, a collection of small six-metre wide dishes in the Cascade Mountains of northern California. The array, launched in 2007 with 42 dishes, will ultimately comprise 350 receivers operating round the clock. 'Our surveys improve on previous, generally narrow band Seti by covering the radio frequency range where Earth's atmosphere is most transparent, including many frequencies never before observed,' said Dr Gerry Harp, director of the Centre for Seti Research. 'We expect to complete a meaningful survey of these stars in less than one year. Be sure to check back soon.' Dr Jon Jenkins, a member of the Seti Institute team based at Nasa's Ames Research Centre in California, whose Kepler-62 data is reported in the journal Science, said: ""These discoveries move us farther down the road to discovering planets similar to Earth. 'While we don't know if Kepler-62e and f are rocky or whether they have liquid water pooling on their surfaces, their existence shows that the incidence of small worlds in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars is high. Kepler-62 and the Solar System: The diagram compares the planets of the inner solar system to Kepler-62, a five-planet system about 1,200 light years from Earth in the constellation Lyra discovered last April. Until now, these were the closest planets to Earth, in terms of size . 'Thus we can look forward to the discovery and detailed characterisation of Earth's cousins in the years and decades to come by future missions and telescopes.' The research suggests that both planets are solid and likely to have mostly dry rocky surfaces or be ocean-covered water worlds. Three other planets close to the size of the Earth are also thought to be orbiting Kepler-62, but not in the habitable zone.Two planets found around a distant star have been described as the most similar to Earth yet discovered. The planets in the newly found Kepler 62 system are made of rock and ice, and researchers believe they could contain water. Kepler-62e and Kepler-62d are among five new planets found within the 'habitable' zone of a Sun-like star. Signs of life? Kepler-62f, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star smaller and cooler than the sun, located about 1,200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-62f orbits its host star every 267 days and is roughly 40 percent larger than Earth. The artist's concept depicts Kepler-69c, a super-Earth-size planet in the habitable zone of a star like our sun, located about 2,700 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. Kepler-69c is 70 percent larger than the size of Earth, and is the smallest yet found to orbit in the habitable zone of a sun-like star . Artist's concept of Kepler-62e, located about 1,200 light years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. Kepler-62e orbits its host star every 122 days and is roughly 60 percent larger than Earth in size. Scientists do not know if Kepler-62e is a waterworld or if it has a solid surface . Announcing the discovery physicist Professor Justin Crepp said: 'From what we can tell, from their radius and orbital period, these are the most similar objects to Earth that we have found yet.' They were identified by data from the Kepler mission launched in 2009 to identify extrasolar planets. It has so far resulted in several dozen of some 3,000 'Kepler Objects of Interest' having been studied in detail but of those the 'five-planet system' is the most important. Crepp noticed a faint dot near Kepler-62 a year ago, leading to months of detailed study to confirm the planet interpretation. The discovery was made by astrophysicists at the University of Notre Dame. The findings were published in Science magazine. Researchers use fluctuations in the brightness of a star to identify the presence of a potential planet whose transit periodically dims the light of the star. Crepp uses large ground-based telescopes to image the host star and analyzes the system to make sure other astronomical phenomena, such as nearby eclipsing binary stars, are not causing the fluctuation, a common 'false positive' encountered in the research. 'What really helped is that this star has five planets,' he said. 'You can mimic one planet with another event, but when you have five of them and they're all periodic, that helps to put the nail in the coffin. 'It's hard to make that kind of signature with anything else that you can dream up.' The Kepler space observatory, named . after the 17th century German astronomer Johannes Kepler, was launched . on 7 March 2009 to survey a portion of the Milky Way for Earth-size . planets that could harbour life. The research team used data from . Nasa's Kepler space telescope, which simultaneously and continuously . measures the brightness of more than 150,000 stars every 30 minutes. When . a planet candidate transits, or passes, in front of the star from the . spacecraft's vantage point, a percentage of light from the star is . blocked. This causes a dip in the brightness of the starlight that reveals the transiting planet's size relative to its star. The size of the star must be known in order to measure the planet's size accurately. To . learn more about the properties of the stars, scientists . examined sound waves generated by the boiling motion beneath the surface . of the star. They . probe the interior structure of stars just as geologists use . seismic waves generated by earthquakes to probe the interior structure . of Earth. The science is called asteroseismology. The sound waves travel into the star and bring information back up to the surface. The waves cause oscillations that Kepler observes as a rapid flickering of the star's brightness. Like bells in a steeple, small stars ring at high tones while larger stars boom in lower tones. The barely discernible, high-frequency oscillations in the brightness of small stars are the most difficult to measure. This is why most objects previously subjected to asteroseismic analysis are larger than the sun.","Discovery of five new planets made by Nasa's Kepler telescope .

"Silver could be a precious weapon in the fight against antibiotic resistance. Scientists have shown that giving tiny amounts of silver at the same time as antibiotics makes the drugs up to a thousand times more effective. The finding comes in the wake of warnings by Britain’s top doctor that the rise of drug-resistant superbugs could trigger an ‘apocalyptic scenario’ in which even routine operations such as hip surgery become deadly because we have run out of antibiotics. Giving tiny amounts of silver at the same time as antibiotics makes the drugs up to a thousand times more effective . Professor Dame Sally Davies said that unless urgent action is taken, the ‘ticking timebomb’ of growing antibiotic resistance could leave millions vulnerable to untreatable bugs within a generation. U.S. researcher Dr Jim Collins said: ‘The number of antibiotic resistant strains in our hospitals and communities is growing and is growing dramatically and has been for some time. ‘And this development is accompanied by a drop in new antibiotics being developed and approved. ‘We are taking a different approach. Instead of trying to develop a completely new antibiotic, we are trying to enhance the ones we already have.’ In experiments on mice, the Boston University researchers found that giving silver with antibiotics made them between ten and a thousand times better at fighting infections. In some cases, bugs classed as antibiotic resistant became treatable. Britain's top doctor warned the rise of drug-resistant superbugs (pictured) could trigger an 'apocalyptic scenario' in which routine operations become deadly . Although silver has long been known to have anti-bacterial properties, if used alone, it has to be given in such high amounts that it can be poisonous to the body. The experiments suggest it will be safe to use it in very small amounts with existing antibiotics. The drugs could be laced with silver or covered in a fine coating of the precious metal and used to tackle dangerous stomach bugs, urinary tract infections or hard-to-treat films of bacteria that coat catheters. The research, detailed in the journal Science Translational Medicine, also worked out how silver helps kill bugs. The metal makes bacteria more ‘leaky’, allowing antibiotics to get inside them and kill them. Plus, it boosts production of dangerous oxygen molecules that aid and abet the death.","Silver could be used to help fight antibiotic resistance .

There are plenty of forgotten women out there not so lucky.' She believes there will soon be a 'social revolution' as the so-called 'Generation X' of post-War baby boomers seek more work . Miss Frostrup said today's over 50s are an 'affluent, active, culturally ravenous bunch'. She added: 'Today companies may scorn and shed our skills, but soon there'll be internships for mature adults returning to the job market. Mark my words, it's nothing short of a social revolution – the veneration of youth superseded by the fiscal punch of thriving mid-lifers.' In the past, Miss Frostrup, who has two children with her human rights lawyer husband Jason McCue, has claimed ageism is 'rife' in television and once said Radio 4's flagship current affairs programme Today is 'run by a bunch of misogynists'. In her latest intervention, she said: 'Ageism remains the last frontier of acceptable discrimination, tolerated in almost every walk of life. 'Being 50 and above, the greatest challenge comes not from your own mind and body, but from a society where entrenched attitudes have failed to keep pace with fast-extending life spans. 'A pioneer group since we were christened Generation X, we've led the advance guard on social change from feminism to racism, sexism to civil liberties, and we won't let slumbering stereotypes lie. 'We're not in with the in-crowd – we are the in-crowd.'","Mariella Frostrup said ageism is 'last frontier of acceptable discrimination'

"Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere more than a billion years before the Earth, scientists believe. An examination of meteorites and rocks on the planet suggests that oxygen was affecting the Martian surface four billion years ago. On Earth, oxygen did not build up to appreciable quantities in the atmosphere for at least another 1,500 million years. By using the Spirit Rover to examine the meteorites and rocks on Mars' surface, scientists were able to determine that oxygen was affecting the Martian surface four billion years ago, one billion years before Earth . Scientists compared Martian meteorites that have crashed onto the Earth and data from rocks examined by the American space agency Nasa's Spirit rover. Differences in their composition can best be explained by an abundance of oxygen early in Martian history. Spirit was exploring a very ancient part of Mars containing rocks more than 3,700 million years old. The rocks bear the hallmarks of early . exposure to oxygen before being 'recycled' - drawn into shallow regions . of the planet's interior and then spewed out in volcanic eruptions. Volcanic . Martian meteorites, on the other hand, originate from deeper within the . planet where they would be less affected by oxygen. Martian meteorites travel to Earth after being flung into space by massive eruptions or impacts. Scientists compared Martian meteorites that have crashed onto the Earth and data from rocks on Mars . The new research, published in the journal Nature, has implications for the possibility of past life on Mars. On . early Earth, the atmosphere was gradually filled with free oxygen by . photosynthesising microbes. Scientists call this the Great Oxygenation . Event (GOE). The link between oxygen and life on Mars is less certain. Oxygen could have been produced biologically, or by a chemical reaction in the atmosphere. Lead . scientist Professor Bernard Wood, from Oxford University, said: 'The . implication is that Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere at a time, about . 4,000 million years ago, well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen on . Earth around 2,500 million years ago. 'As oxidation is what gives Mars its . distinctive colour, it is likely that the 'red planet' was wet, warm and . rusty billions of years before Earth's atmosphere became oxygen rich.' In . May, scientists revealed that they had recently discovered pebbles on . Mars, showing that a stream has flowed on the planet - and giving more . weight to the theory that it was once able to support life. On early Earth, the atmosphere was gradually filled with free oxygen by photosynthesising microbes in a process called the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE). The rounded pebbles were found by the team from Nasa's Curiosity rover mission and published in journal Science. Pebbles are only formed when they are carried through water over long distances, according to researchers. It is the first time that evidence of sustained water flows on Mars has been uncovered. The discovery of pebbles came just before an announcement eight days ago that powerful evidence that water good enough to drink had been found by Opportunity, one of Nasa’s aging rover vehicles. Evidence of water of Mars has been indicated by a succession of discoveries on Mars but until now they have all suggested flows of sulphuric acid. This is the first time water has been found in a form that is likely to be drinkable. The discovery boosts the chances that one of life’s most important building blocks was once present  on the planet, and might even still be there. Launched: 7 July 2003Landed on Mars: 25 January 2004Planned mission length: 90 daysActual mission length: Nine years and countingStatus: ActiveWhat has it found? The first evidence of drinkable or neutral water was discovered on Mars by Opportunity in June 2013. Previous assumptions had been that all liquid on Mars was sulphuric acid. The presence of water means that Mars is capable of supporting some kind of life-form. Launched: 26 November 2011Landed on Mars: 6 August 2012Planned mission length: Two yearsActual mission length: IndefiniteStatus: ActiveWhat has it found? Curiosity streamed the first ever live video from the surface of Mars. And in May, Curiousity uncovered pebbles on the planet's surface, showing for the first time ever that a stream or a sustained water flow  inhabited the planet close to two billion years ago. As rounded pebbles are only formed after being carried through water over long distances, the evidence of flowing water is indisputable.","Rocks examined by Nasa's Spirit Rover suggest oxygen affected Mars' surface four billion years ago, more than a billion years before Earth .

"A father who was racially abused and beaten on a tram packed with hundreds of passengers has told how not a single person came to his aid as he was attacked. Manchester United fan Prakash Patel, 56, was on his way home from a match at Old Trafford with his daughter Devyani when a group of men boarded the tram and began hurling racist slurs at him. When he pleaded with them to 'behave', they began repeatedly punching Mr Patel in the face and head. The bank officer, from New Moston, who was left with two black eyes and concussion after the shock attack, said fellow passengers on board the tram at Trafford Bar just 'stood and watched'. Attack: Prakash Patel, 56, was racially abused then punched in the face repeatedly while on a tram in Manchester with his daughter . Distressed: Mr Patel said the tram was packed with hundreds of passengers, yet not one stepped in to come to his aid . He has spoken out about his ordeal in January in the hope that a witness may come forward to help police convict his attackers. 'We had been to the Fulham match at Old Trafford. We go as often as we can because we are big fans, we've been going for 25 years and never had any trouble,' said Mr Patel, who has lived in Manchester for 31 years. 'There were more than 200 people just in our carriage, it was so packed you couldn't move. 'About six men or seven men came on to the tram and started making indecentracist comments. 'Myself and my daughter felt distressed and very uncomfortable about this so I said ""just behave"". 'I said it again ""please behave"" and that's when it started,' he said. 'How can this happen?': Mr Patel said only his 21-year-old daughter came to his aid while he was being attacked on the tram . 'There was one in front of me and one behind me both punching me in my face and on the back of the head. 'They were hitting me in the face, the eyes, the head. 'After two punches I think I blacked out but the carriage was so full that I was unconscious while standing up. Nobody did anything or said anything, they all just stood and watched us. 'I managed to lean against the side of the tram while they got out. 'They told me ""If you want finish this get off the tram"" before they got off calmly at the G-MEX stop,' said the football fan, who added that his daughter was the only one who came to his aid during the attack. 'She managed to push one of the men off and then the other stopped. It seemed like the other passengers just wanted the drama,' he said. 'We stayed on until Piccadilly and then got a taxi home. My face was bruised and swollen and we went to hospital. I had concussion and I needed a CT scan and was off work for two weeks.' Mr Patel said his wife Vasanti, a teacher, also had to take time off work to look after him. 'Now I can't walk outside on my own and I will never go on public transport again and I will only ever watch Manchester United in a box, never again will I sit in the stands. I lost 3kg in the two weeks after the attack.' He said he would consider leaving Britain in the wake of the attack were it not for the fact that his family is so well established here. Victim Prakash Patel . 'Perhaps if it had been two groups of men fighting each other I could understand but this was two young men attacking an older man and his young daughter. How can this happen? 'At first I wouldn't talk to anyone about what had happened but now I want people to know - and I want witnesses to come forward so justice can be done,' Mr Patel said. His daughter Devyani, 21, said her father was no longer the 'happy, confident' dad he used to be since the savage attack. 'I was screaming at them to stop,' said the estate agent, who lives at home with her parents. 'There was a passenger between my dad and the attacker in front of him and I was between my dad and the man behind him so they were punching him over people's heads. 'Nobody did anything or said anything. I was trying to pull them off my dad and shouting at them to get off. 'The one facing me was just staring at me with these cold, evil eyes. Nobody else intervened. I am tiny and I'm a woman, I don't understand why nobody did anything. I was just being his daughter,' she said. Distressed: Devyani Patel, 21, said her father is no longer the 'happy' and 'confident' man he was before the savage attack . 'Afterwards, when the men got off, one man came up, said he was a witness and gave me his number. 'But where was he when it was all happening? That's what hurts the most - that nobody did anything, nobody said anything. I have lost my faith in society. Prakash Patel's daughter Devyani . 'Later at the police station, they showed us the CCTV footage. You can't see the men but you can see all those passengers watching, it sent a shiver down my spine when I saw that. Some of them were actually jumping up to get a better view. It was like they thought we were actors on Coronation Street or something. 'Since the assault I have had a lot of support on Facebook and Twitter, that has restored my faith a little bit - they are calling my dad a hero which he is. 'No daughter should ever have to see their father being hit like that. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. He has always been a happy, jolly confident father to me and this has changed that. The attack happened at Trafford Bar after Manchester United's FA Cup fourth round clash with Fulham on January 26. The first offender is described as white, in his mid to late 20s, about 5ft 8in tall, with brown eyes and tanned skin. He was wearing a blue woollen hat with a snowflake design. The second man was also white, in his mid to late 20s and said to be of a heavy build. He was wearing a light coloured hat. Both men had local accents. Police are now appealing to anyone with information to come forward in an effort to identify the offenders. Anyone with information should call police on 0161 856 9168 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","Prakash Patel, 56, attacked while on a tram in Manchester with his daughter .

"A mysterious ocean 'blob' has been recorded by a deep-sea remote-controlled underwater camera. The creature looks like nothing seen before, with speculators suggesting it is everything from a jellyfish to the remains of a whale placenta. While, at a quick glance, the description of a jellyfish makes sense, the creature has organs and appendages never spotted on a jellyfish before. Meanwhile it could be a whale placenta, but if that is the case then the hexagonal shapes on the skin are a mystery. Identified: The mysterious creature has been revealed to be a deep sea jellyfish . Objects within: The creature is a rarely studied jelly fish known as Deepstaria Enigmatica . Unusual: The hexagonal markings on the creature implied the creature was not a jellyfish . Solved: The blob is a Deepstaria Enigmatica - a jelly fish which grows to approximately 60cm in width . If it is a jellyfish, it might be a Stygiomedusa Gigantea. This type of jellyfish - which can grow up to six metres in length - has only been spotted 114 times in 110 years, so details on it are scant. But again, the appendages get in the way. Another suggestion is Deepstaria Enigmatica, another rarely-studied jellyfish, which like most of its kind is colourless. However it has reported to have a brown stomach, with one description saying the passages to the stomach are 'somewhat irregular-edged, forming a reticulate network'. This might explain the hexagonal markings on the top of the creature - but again, what are the organs doing there? Those markings lead one commentator on the website Snopes - which tries to debunk or confirm rumours - to suggest this is simply nothing more than a fishing net. But again, the appendages get in the way. Another mystery - a man-made one, this time - is exactly where this video was filmed. It was added to YouTube on April 27 this year, and appears to have been filmed two days earlier, but the poster did not leave any other details about the sighting. Bizarre: The creature had many bizarre appendages which have now been explained as testicles . Wrong: YouTube commentators suggested it may be a whale placenta . Other strange organs kept viewers scratching their heads but the mystery has now been solved .","YouTube video leaves commentators baffled .

"Six men accused of raping a 39-year-old tourist and beating her husband with sticks during a cycling holiday in India have appeared in court. The suspects, who police say are local farmers, were arrested yesterday and have been charged with gang rape. The attack comes just three months after the gang rape and fatal beating of a student in Delhi that sparked protests across India. Campaigners said women in the country are becoming more vulnerable as 'the men have gone totally berserk.' Scroll down for video . Arrested: Five of the six men charged with the gang rape of a Swiss tourist are presented by the Madhya Pradesh police personnel dressed in black hoods with eye holes cut out .

Police said all six suspects are aged between 20 and 25 and belong to a local tribe. They have been remanded in custody and are due back in court tomorrow. The Swiss couple told police that the woman was raped by seven or eight men, but that it was dark and they could not be . sure of the exact number. They said the man was beaten and tied to a tree while his wife was sexually assaulted. It is the latest in a string of violent sex attacks in India that has shocked the subcontinent. One 23-year-old was raped and tortured . in December, and a 29-year-old who was grabbed from a bus in and gang . raped in Amritsar by six men in January. Campaigners are concerned at the . growing vulnerability of women in India despite assurances from the . Government that they will tackle abuse. Ranjana Kumari of the Centre for Social . Research think tank said 127 cases of rape have been registered in Delhi since the fatal assault on the student. She told The Telegraph: 'It is absolutely shocking and speaks volumes on how Indian society is . treating women. 'The men have gone totally berserk. We're feeling . frustrated and in despair. What must we do to change their mentality?' The attack on the Swiss couple has . also highlighted concerns about the rise in attacks on foreign women and . those out with husbands or male friends. The husband and wife had set up camp at a village near Datia town, in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, when up to eight men burst into their tent. The . pack of men pounced on the couple, beating them with wooden sticks . before overpowering the man and gang-raping his wife, the husband . claimed. An Indian security official looks over the site where a Swiss woman was allegedly raped by eight men .

Police allege the six attacked the woman and her male companion on the bus as the couple returned home after watching Life Of Pi on December 16. The woman was repeatedly raped and tortured with a metal bar. The couple were also severely beaten before being thrown onto a road. The woman died of internal injuries in a Singapore hospital two weeks later. In January a woman was travelling to her in-laws' home in Punjab when she was allegedly snatched and driven to a district bordering Amritsar, the Sikh holy city. Five men joined the driver and conductor, who had taken her by motorbike to an unknown address, and took turns to rape the 29-year-old. They dumped her near her in-laws' village the next morning where she told relatives of her ordeal, police said. Six men were arrested and a seventh was on the run from police, officers said. A 14-year-old schoolgirl was put on life support in hospital after being brutally gang-raped in rural India in late January. Police had failed to make any arrests since the horrific attack in the Jalandhar district of Punjab ten days after the attack. An Indian boy has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a security guard who allegedly told the child off for trying to rape an 11-year-old girl.
