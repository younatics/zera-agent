"(CNN) -- A new night proved not to be a major hindrance to the Emmys. According to the Los Angles Times, Monday night's NBC telecast of the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards saw a slight dip in viewership, with 15.6 million tuning in. Last year's CBS show, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, was Emmy's most watched ceremony since 2005, with 17.8 million total viewers. Yet even with the decline the show still won its time slot. TV By The Numbers reports that the Emmys garnered a 4.2 rating in the coveted 18-49 demographic. That made it NBC's most successful Monday night programming in the past two years, excluding the Olympics. 5 buzzworthy moments of the 2014 Emmy Awards .

"(CNN) -- Fifty days of fighting. Thousands of rocket attacks and airstrikes. And a number of failed cease-fire agreements. That all appeared to come to an end on Tuesday, when Israel and Hamas militants agreed to an open-ended truce -- and talks. Here's what you need to know about the Egyptian-negotiated agreement that appears to have halted the fighting between Israelis and Hamas militants. Who gets what? During the fighting, both sides have repeatedly made the same demands: Israel called for the demilitarization of Gaza, and Hamas called for an end to the Israeli and Egyptian blockade of Gaza -- by land, sea and air -- that began in 2007. As part of the negotiated truce, Israel has agreed to ""ease"" the blockade, opening border crossings to allow humanitarian aid and construction materials into Gaza, a senior Egyptian government official with knowledge of the agreement told CNN. As part of easing the blockade, Israel will also extend the fishing limit off the coast of Gaza to six miles, the official said. Both sides agree to return to Cairo for further, indirect talks -- as Israel and Hamas refuse to meet face to face. If the ceasefire holds, the two sides have agreed to begin talks four weeks from now on a broader range of issues, including the Israeli release of Palestinians -- primarily Hamas members -- arrested during the conflict and the construction of a seaport in Gaza, according to published reports in state-run media. The talks will also address Israel's demand for the demilitarization of Gaza. Winner? While Hamas spokesman Fawhi Barhoum declared before a cheering crowd in Gaza that the truce was ""a day of victories for our people,"" there is little sign that either side got what it wanted. The agreement between Israel and the Palestinians broke no new ground. In fact, the truce -- by all accounts -- looks a lot like one agreed to in 2012 to end fighting between Israel and Hamas militants. In that agreement, Israel agreed to ease restrictions to allow for humanitarian aid and construction materials with an agreement to engage in talks aimed at easing economic hardships in Gaza. ""It's very similar. There is some moderate easing of the blockade of Gaza as Hamas and most Palestinians really wanted. But the big easing has been pushed off to the future,"" said Peter Beinart, a contributing editor for the National Journal and The Atlantic. ""And demilitarization of Gaza, which is what Israel said it really wanted, has also been kicked down the road into the future."" According to Beinart, who has long covered the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: ""After all this terrible, terrible bloodshed and trauma on both sides, it looks like we are back to where we were at the beginning."" What was the cost? The cost can be measured in lives lost, but also in the economic and political fallout. More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the conflict. The United Nations estimates that more than 70% were civilians. Sixty-seven Israelis -- 64 of them soldiers -- have been killed, the United Nations reports. A foreign worker in Israel was killed as well. The fighting displaced more than 500,000 Palestinians, according to the United Nations, and left thousands of homes damaged. It's not exactly clear how much money the fighting cost both sides, but observers have put the number in the billions of dollars. Given the toll the conflict has taken, there is also likely to be some kind of political fallout. The popularity of Hamas has been on the decline since it took control of the Palestinian Parliament in 2006. Given the length and toll of this conflict, there is a question of whether Palestinians will hold Hamas accountable for it. At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity took a severe hit -- going from a high of 82% to 38%, according to The Times of Israel, which cited a poll this week by Israel's Channel 2. What's next? That depends on who's doing the talking. If the ceasefire holds, and the negotiators go back to Cairo, the fact that Israel and Hamas do not talk to one another may prove problematic in trying to bring Israelis together with Palestinian factions. In any talks, Palestinians are likely to include a demand that Egypt lift its blockade of Gaza dating back to 2007. Egypt, just like Israel, tightened restrictions on Gaza's borders after Hamas won political control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority. Who's who in Hamas .

"(CNN) -- One of the unintended consequences of the Arab revolutions has become evident in Israel, where a surge in the number of refugees from Africa has created new tensions in a country with no shortage of practical and ethical dilemmas. In the face of the new challenge, a number of Israeli politicians have sunk to the occasion, exploiting raw emotions and fueling a display of violence that should shame Israelis. To be sure, Israel is not the first nation whose handling of illegal immigration deserves criticism. But the anti-immigrant riot that took place in a Tel Aviv neighborhood on May 23 should rise as a rallying cry for Israelis who believe their country should shine as a ""light unto the nations."" Since Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was overthrown last year, Egypt's Sinai Peninsula, the border between the two countries, has become a mostly lawless land where Bedouin gangs freely traffic in, among other things, human beings. Migrants who come mostly from Sudan and Eritrea have chosen Israel as their destination because it is one of the most prosperous states in the region and because it offers some protection for refugees. Despite the protests of right-wing politicians and of some sectors of the population, Israel has so far refrained from forcing the vast majority of refugees to return to their native countries. Many countries keep asylum-seekers in prison-like camps under indefinite detention. Israel is building a detention facility where refugees would remain while their cases are processed. But until now, they have been receiving visas that allow them to live anywhere in the country. Still, they live in limbo without a right to work legally. Unlike other countries that have returned refugees to their nation of origin or pushed them back to the state from which they crossed the border, Israel, a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, has done neither. But the situation is becoming untenable and pressure for deportations is growing. Government figures say about 60,000 African migrants now reside in Israel, double the figure from 2010, with between 2,000 and 3,000 more arriving each month. The numbers are enormous for a country the size of Israel. It is roughly equal to the number of illegal immigrants found, for example, in Australia, a country 350 times the size and triple the population of Israel. Israel is hardly the first place to experience anti-immigrant riots. And anti-immigrant sentiment there is part of a wave sweeping the globe. As in most places where illegal immigration has suddenly increased, much resentment has come from the poor who see the unfamiliar new arrivals settling in their midst, view the newcomers as a threat to their livelihoods and are highly sensitive to reports of criminal activity. Eritrean and Sudanese refugees have been arrested in a number of rape and stabbing of cases in Tel Aviv, but there is no evidence that the crime rate among them is higher than in the rest of the population. That, however, has not stopped Interior Minister Eli Yishai from tarring migrants as criminals and suggesting that most should be summarily deported. The country's leaders should seek to calm tensions and find a humane solution to a growing human problem. But responsible, statesman-like behavior is apparently too much to ask. When the residents of the south Tel Aviv neighborhood of Hatikva held a protest last week, one member of parliament, Miri Regev, referred to Sudanese ""infiltrators"" as ""a cancer,"" stoking the inexcusable outbreak of violence. (She later apologized for using the term ""cancer"".) Another member of parliament, Danny Danon, turned up the rhetoric, shouting ""Expulsion now!"" and calling the migrants ""a plague."" While some Israelis expressed sympathy for the protesters, many lashed out against the shocking display of intolerance in Tel Aviv, of all places, a city known for its open-mindedness. Although no one was seriously injured and the police intervened, arresting 17 people, the language and the behavior would be unacceptable anywhere, but in Israel more than anywhere. Reuven Rivlin, speaker of the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, characterized the event as reminiscent of the early days of World War II, saying the words ""remind me of the hate speech aimed against the Jewish people."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared ""there is no place for the statements and actions which we saw last night."" The day after the riot, Israelis held a vigil against racism in front of the prime minister's residence. But the reaction on the political scene was not uniformly conciliatory, with new calls for deportations and more irresponsible and inflammatory language from some political leaders. Israel faces a serious moral and practical dilemma. And although the problem has unique aspects because it is occurring in Israel, it is a quandary familiar to every country that has faced a large inflow of refugees and migrant workers. In Israel's case, the prospect that the stream of refugees could grow into a flood raises the added specter that it could transform the Jewish character of the state. Despite Netanyahu's claim, that is not an imminent danger. But the question also tugs, urgently, at another aspect of the country's identity. Israel, after all, was founded as the nation-state of the Jewish people; a people that saw millions of its numbers murdered while other countries closed their doors during World War II and at other times in history. Israel has not dealt with its refugees more harshly than most countries, despite the exaggerated claims about the events in Tel Aviv. But that is not a good enough standard. Israelis need to deal fairly and humanely with the refugees. Israelis are building a barrier at the Sinai border, which should cut down on the smugglers' cruel traffic in human beings. Israel should formalize and legalize the status of a portion of the migrants and work with international agencies to find homes in third countries for others. In the meantime, it's a good time for Israelis of all stripes to look at their own history and send a strong message to politicians who seem to have forgotten not only the country's claim to high ethical standards, but an admonition from an ancient text, from Exodus, recently cited by a hospital manager writing about the serious medical needs of African migrants. ""Do not oppress the stranger among us. You know how it feels to be strangers, for you, too, were strangers in Egypt.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A video released by an Israeli human rights organization shows what the group describes as a 9-year-old Palestinian boy being assaulted by two border police officers in the West Bank city of Hebron. The footage, released by B'tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, shows the boy walking on pavement outside a building when a uniformed police officer runs up to him and grabs him by an arm, causing him to lose his balance and pulling him along the ground for a few feet. The police officer, who is holding a rifle in one hand, asks the boy, ""Why are you making trouble?"" according to B'tselem. Seconds later, a second police officer, also carrying a rifle, walks up to the boy, kicks him, turns around and walks off without speaking. At that, the first policeman releases the boy, who runs out of the frame. In response to the video, Israeli border police issued a statement saying, ""The Border Police denounces the policemen's behaviour, which contrasts the values of the force. It is important to note that this is a rare incident which does not represent the actions of the Border Police in Israel. The Border Police commander instructed on setting up a team to investigate the incident immediately and its conclusions are due in the coming days."" B'tselem says on its website that the video was shot by a volunteer in B'tselem's camera distribution project from inside his home near the Tomb of the Patriarchs. It says he began to shoot the video when he saw the officer hiding behind a wall. The boy was identified by his father, Amer Burqan, as Abdel-Rahman Burqan. It was a ""very sad and disgusting attack,"" the elder Burqan told CNN. ""You don't expect such unethical behavior from an officer who considers himself to be providing security and law and order."" ""This is animalistic and vicious behavior,"" he said about the video, two minutes of which were posted on youtube.com. The posting says the video was shot June 29. An investigation should be opened into the incident, said Sarit Michaeli, a spokeswoman for B'tselem. ""From the video evidence and from evidence collected from the child, it's obvious the border police officer was basically waiting for him and grabbed him and another border police officer came and kicked the child,"" she said. ""The child denies attacking or harassing the border police officer. Regardless, this is irrelevant as far as B'tsalem is concerned, because this kind of behavior is absolutely prohibited regardless of the circumstance."" She continued, ""This kind of violence by border police officers, by official members of the Israeli security forces is outrageous and not allowed. B'tsalem is going to complain with the department of police investigations in the Ministry of Justice, which is a relevant government investigative body of allegations against the border police."" Michaeli said the boy had been treated similarly before. ""A month ago he was attacked by border police officers on his way back from school,"" she said. The incident occurred a few days after a team of human rights lawyers published a report funded by the British government that accuses Israel of violating international law in its treatment of Palestinian child detainees. It was written after a week-long visit last September by the delegation to Israel and the West Bank. The report accuses Israel of treating Palestinian and Israeli children differently -- Israelis must be at least 14 before they can be sent to jail; Palestinians must be 12. Israeli children generally have a legal right to have their parents present during questioning; Palestinians do not, it says. An Israeli child can be held no more than two days without being granted access to a lawyer; a Palestinian child can be held 90 days, it says. ""It may be that much of the reluctance to treat Palestinian children in conformity with international norms stems from a belief, which was advanced to us by a military prosecutor, that every Palestinian child is a 'potential terrorist,' the report says. ""Such a stance seems to us to be the starting point of a spiral of injustice, and one which only Israel, as the Occupying Power in the West Bank, can reverse."" The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Mark Regev, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told ""The Age"" newspaper of Melbourne, Australia, that Israel was studying the report's proposals. ""The report acknowledges that Israel has made improvements and they have praised us for that,"" Regev said. ""You have countless acts of violence, including deadly violence, perpetrated by minors -- Israel is acting because of a vacuum created by a lack of action from the Palestinian leadership and by the exploitation of minors by the extremist groups.""","Video: ""Why are you making trouble?"" border officer asks wailing boy .

"(CNN) -- Could motorsports become a major industry in football-obsessed Nigeria? It will be if one Nigerian businessman has his way. London-based entrepreneur Ribi Adeshokan has entered his country into the lavish and highly-competitive world of car racing and has ambitious plans to drive African motorsport and build a multi-million dollar racing industry on the continent. Called Nigeria Racing Eagle (NRE), the team says it hopes to compete at major motor racing events over the next few months, including the FIA GT3 series and sports car endurance races. ""My philosophy is whatever I want to do, I go for the best,"" Adeshokan, team principal and owner of NRE said Monday, moments after unveiling a green and silver Audi R8 LMS as the team's car at the Africa Village, a London Olympics exhibition site designed to highlight the continent's cultural, artistic and sport assets. Adeshokan says his team will proudly ""fly the flag of Africa,"" being the first Nigerian racing team to represent the continent at world motorsports. ""The idea of a racing team called Nigeria Racing Eagle is to use African drivers and gradually develop African mechanics and engineers,"" he says. ""In the motorsport community I've been asked so many times, 'oh what if they are no good,' or 'you might be, maybe, the last on the grid,' and I say 'yes, I don't care, let's be the last on the grid but we are developing, we are growing,' so that's our main goal for this project."" See also: EasyJet founder to launch low-cost airline in Africa . An engineer by training, Adeshokan's association with motorsport first started as a hobby in early 2000. But he soon turned his passion into business and in 2007 he set up a racing company called GRC Motorsport. Adeshokan initially put together a racing side to compete as ""Team Nigeria"" at the World Cup of Motorsport. But right before he was about to realize his dream, the World Cup series went bankrupt. Determined Adeshokan devoted further time and money to create NRE. He says his business venture has been solely financed by himself and a few friends who had faith in his vision. ""The biggest challenge is people believing in my dream,"" he says. ""I found out that people struggle to understand and most people never can imagine that motorsport can come to Africa or to Nigeria."" Adeshokan, who recently appointed veteran British motorsport executive John Wickham as team manager, says that right now there is a ""50-50"" chance for NRE to be ready for the GT3 race in Moscow in early September. Yet, for Adeshokan and his team, competing at the international motorsport arena is only one part of their goal. ""One of the key pillars of this project is not just about putting together a racing team -- it's about introducing motorsport to West Africa and that means we have to create circuits, we have to create series and, most importantly, we have to create drivers,"" says Sam Collins, NRE's lead driver. As a result, GRC is looking to develop a racing championship in Nigeria and is also setting up a domestic academy to develop young drivers and prepare them to compete at the global stage. It has also teamed up with Tiger Racing, a UK-based sports car manufacturer, to create a development center to train young mechanics and engineers in the West African country. More from Marketplace Africa: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . In addition, Adeshokan says he's partnered with local authorities in Lagos to develop a ""Monaco-style"" circuit on the streets of the city's marina to host an international motorsport grand prix. ""That one to me is so exciting,"" says Adeshokan, adding that motorsport presents Nigeria with a huge business, marketing and networking potential that can create career opportunities for the country's youth and also attract foreign investors. ""Motorsport is the richest sport in the world -- it's a multi-billion dollar economy, so why don't we also tap into it."" Collins says that apart from South Africa, where there is a ""reasonably good domestic scene of mostly white drivers,"" and some racing events held in Morocco, ""there's not really any motorsport in Africa."" ""We want to prove to the rest of Africa that this is a major sport and to be honest everybody knows, Nigerian, West African men love their cars."" Adeshokan believes Nigerians can emulate the successful example of British cycling -- which has become an international tour de force in recent years-- and dominate the world of motorsport in the future. ""In 10 years I'd be incredibly disappointed if we didn't have a Formula One driver and I'd be very disappointed if we didn't have a Formula One driver who is winning races,"" added Collins.","Nigeria Racing Eagle will soon compete at major car racing events, founders say .

"(CNN) -- With one of his first jokes at the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards, host Seth Meyers cut to the chase: . ""MTV aired the Video Music Awards last night. That's right, MTV still has an award for music videos even though they no longer show music videos,"" he said. ""That's like network TV holding an awards show and giving all the trophies to cable and Netflix. That would be crazy. Why would they do that?"" There was loud laughter in the auditorium -- knowing laughter, because that's what the Emmys have resembled in recent years: an awards show on network TV celebrating cable TV. During this year's awards telecast, though, viewers could almost see the tug-of-war -- as the networks pulled off some surprising wins and Netflix found itself shut out of the major categories. In fact, Monday's telecast felt at times like an elaborate commercial for network TV, interrupted ever so briefly by an actual commercial that Netflix paid to air during the first of the three hours. It was a reminder that the answer to the question ""What's the future of television?"" is ""all of the above."" When it was all over, the cable channel AMC, home to ""Breaking Bad,"" had picked up five Emmy statues, but so had CBS, the broadest of the broadcast networks. One of CBS's five was awarded to Julianna Margulies, star of ""The Good Wife,"" in the lead actress in a drama category. On stage, she thanked ""our writers who never cease to amaze me with 22 episodes a year"" -- a jab at cable series that tend to have much shorter seasons. Another network series, ABC's ""Modern Family,"" came away with three wins, including the outstanding comedy award for the fifth year in a row. Television critics expressed disappointment on Twitter -- partly because there were newer, edgier nominees like Netflix's ""Orange is the New Black"" and HBO's ""Silicon Valley"" that deserved the prize. ""Even for the Emmys, this is some hardcore repetition,"" NPR's Linda Holmes wrote on Twitter. But ABC was understandably thrilled by all the recognition for the sitcom. ""Someone forgot to tell the voters that the networks weren't supposed to win anything,"" opined Slate's Willa Paskin. For viewers, of course, there's hardly any network-cable tension at all. These days, TV fans barely distinguish between ABC and AMC and Amazon, and they don't have to, thanks to newfangled set-top boxes and streaming video websites. Case in point: On Monday, I watched an old episode of NBC's ""Friday Night Lights"" on Netflix, then the Emmys red carpet on the cable channel E!, and then the actual awards show on NBC. Furthermore, all of the companies that own broadcast networks also own lucrative cable channels, and in many cases the same companies also license shows to streaming services like Netflix. Still, there is palpable tension within the television industry: Some broadcast executives resent the fact that long stretches of the Emmys -- which they take turns televising -- amount to celebrations of cable. The executives also point out that there are big differences between the business models of broadcast and cable, and in many ways, that favors cable. All of this raises a question that gets re-asked every year: Can a broadcast series like ""Downton Abbey,"" on PBS, really compete with ""True Detective,"" on HBO, or ""Breaking Bad""? On Monday, the answer was yes, with an asterisk. Indeed, Margulies' best actress win -- her second win in the category -- was all the more notable because ""The Good Wife"" was not even nominated for best drama. Backstage after the telecast, Margulies said she felt very strongly that her award was ""for the whole team,"" for the whole show. Other network wins included Allison Janney for her supporting actress role in the new CBS comedy ""Mom"" and Jim Parsons for his lead actor role in ""The Big Bang Theory."" PBS's ""Sherlock"" earned three statues, as well. There was something of an underdog spirit to these wins -- underscored by the joke Meyers made upon introducing Stephen Colbert, the Comedy Central late-night star who will succeed David Letterman on CBS next year. ""He's being demoted from cable to network TV,"" Meyers quipped. Later in the evening, Colbert won the variety series Emmy for his ""Colbert Report."" Next year, his old cable and new network shows could compete with one another in the category. But broadcast, cable, HBO, Netflix -- viewers don't care where the show comes from, as long as the show's worth watching. And the lines between all the different versions of TV will continue to blur.","Host Seth Meyers joked about network TV celebrating cable shows .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel's prime minister will visit the United States in March, officials said Sunday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will attend the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington, Israeli government officials said. AIPAC is a major force in U.S. politics, making significant campaign donations and drawing top administration and congressional leaders to its conventions. Netanyahu also spoke at AIPAC's annual conference last year. This year's trip comes amid mounting tensions between Israel and Iran over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Speculation is swirling in Washington about whether Israel may preemptively bomb Iran in an effort to slow its nuclear program. The head of Israel's intelligence agency was just in Washington for meetings with intelligence officials and some members of Congress, according to Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-California, and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who mentioned the meetings during a hearing this past week. When the head of the Mossad visited Washington last week, it was to hear what steps the United States might take against Iran, and to gauge what the United States would do if Israel were to strike Iran on its own, a congressional source told CNN. At a policy conference in Israel last week, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak repeated his government's concerns that Iran's preparations for the development of a nuclear weapon are entering their final stages and will soon ""enter the immunity zone from which the Iranian regime will be able to complete the program without any effective intervention."" On Sunday, Barak appointed a new commander of the Israeli Air Force. Gen. Amir Eshel, currently head of the Israeli military's planning directorate, will replace current chief Maj. Gen. Ido Nehushtan in April. CNN's Guy Azriel, Pam Benson, Suzanne Kelly and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","Israel's prime minister will attend an AIPAC conference in Washington .

"(CNN) -- In what has been described as a humanitarian gesture, the Israeli government on Thursday handed over the remains of 91 Palestinians killed in attacks against Israeli targets over the past four decades. The remains, which had been interred in numbered graves by Israel, began arriving in the West Bank and Gaza early Thursday, the Palestinian Authority-controlled WAFA news agency reported. The remains of 79 Palestinians were delivered to the seat of the Palestinian government in Ramallah, West Bank, where Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas presided over an official military ceremony. The 79 caskets, wrapped with the Palestinian flag, were carried by the Palestinian presidential guard into the main square of the presidential compound. Abbas, family members of those killed and other honorees stood by as 21-gun salutes were fired. Abbas laid a wreath on the caskets, and a formal prayer was given by the former mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Mohammed Hussein. The ceremony was broadcast on Palestinian television. The remaining 12 bodies were to be delivered to families in Gaza. Among the returned will be the remains of seven Palestinians involved in a 1975 attack against The Savoy hotel in Tel Aviv. Those remains, along with some that are unidentified, will be buried in the Ramallah military cemetery. Some families were demanding DNA testing to verify the identities of the remains. The return of the remains was meant as a ""confidence-building measure to help get the peace process back on track."" said Mark Regev, an Israeli government spokesman. ""Israel is ready for the immediate resumption of peace talks without any preconditions whatsoever,"" he said in a statement. The return was harshly criticized by some in Israel, who compared it to last year's exchange of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups on the Gaza border captured Shalit in 2006. Meir Indor, chairman of Almagor, the Israeli association of terror victims, told CNN that releasing the remains would only serve ""for the continuation (of) terror."" ""Beyond our personal feelings, it is devastating to see the hard murderers that were released last year under the Shalit deal becoming a building block in the Palestinian campaign of propaganda and (being) glorified as freedom fighters,"" Indor said. ""The Palestinian society must show disapproval of their actions. This is another stage in the making of terrorist theology."" Most Israelis consider the remains to be those of terrorists, but many Palestinians view the men as martyrs in the decades-old struggle to establish a Palestinian state. Fatima Abdul Karim of the Jerusalem Legal Aid and Human Rights Center, which helps Palestinian family members find missing relatives, called it ""a very special and historic moment."" While the release of the remains is good news, she noted that hundreds of Palestinians remain missing. ""It is a success, but that is not the end of the story,"" Abdul Karim said. ""There are stories that are still being unraveled."" Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization's central committee and a senior Palestinian negotiator, noted in comments to CNN that although 91 sets of remains were received, ""we did not receive all of them, and it is with great bitterness that we received their remains."" He said many Palestinians were hoping prisoners still alive in Israeli jails would also be released. ""To keep human bodies in cemeteries ... in graves that (have) no names,"" only numbers, he said, ""just shows how ugly the Israeli occupation is."" Ahmad al-Bouz was shocked and surprised to learn the remains of his brother Nasser were being returned by Israel. For 23 years, the family has not known what happened to him. ""All these years, we believed he was missing,"" al-Bouz said. ""We have consulted every human rights organization, but to no avail."" He said his family asked the Israeli government about his brother in the past, but was told no information was available. He said his family is still seeking information and will examine the body and conduct DNA testing on the remains. Ghazi Jarwan, the father of a Palestinian militant killed while participating in a 2003 Tel Aviv attack that killed five Israelis, described the return of his son's remains as cause for celebration. ""I am happy, because I am proud of my son and consider this a national wedding for my son,"" he said.","A formal military ceremony is held at the Palestinian Authority compound .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- For Israelis waking up to their newspapers this past Sunday, the front pages offered a shocking and repulsive sight. Photographs of ultra-orthodox children donning yellow stars and striped prison uniforms reminiscent of the Holocaust stared back at them. The arresting images were taken at a Saturday night rally in Jerusalem staged by a radical ultra-orthodox sect to protest what their members claimed was incitement against their community by the media and the Israeli government. The protest, which drew widespread condemnation from all corners of the country, is the latest development in an increasingly acrimonious conflict between members of Israel's ultra-orthodox community, known as the Haredim, against the Jewish Israeli mainstream. In recent weeks many Israelis have been waging a high-profile public campaign against attempts by some in the ultra-orthodox community to enforce a strict form of gender segregation and rules of modesty on females outside of their community. In cities with larger ultra-orthodox populations this has played out in public buses and in some stores with with Haredi men insisting on strict separation between men and women. In some neighborhoods, billboards with images of women have been defaced -- leading some advertisers to stop using photographs of women in their campaigns. The issue hit critical mass, however, with the story of eight-year-old Israeli girl Naama Margolese. In a nationally televised news report, the bespectacled and pony-tailed schoolgirl broke down in tears and expressed terror at the prospect of walking several hundred yards to her school in the mixed community of Beit Shemesh for fear of being spat on and cursed at by ultra-orthodox neighbors who thought Margolese and her mother were not dressed modestly enough. The broadcast sparked a wave of criticism and prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to speak out against the segregation of women, referring to it as ""an unacceptable phenomenon that goes against the values of Judaism and democracy."" Several thousands Israelis rallied in Beith Shemesh the next week demanding the government do more to curb the influence of ultra-orthodox elements whom they accused of being a Taliban-like minority. Ultra-orthodox leaders have warned warn that their community should not be judged based on the actions of a radical few, and contend that the conflict with other parts of Israeli society is overblown. ""The Haredi community accepts the will of the secular community to live their lives in their neighborhoods as they wish,"" says Rabbi Shmuel Poppenheim of the Eda Haredit sect. ""I do not want to impose myself on the secular public."" But the Israeli mainstream's divide with the ultra-orthodox community goes much deeper than issues of gender segregation. The Haredim, who make up approximately 10% of the country according to government figures, are the fastest growing segment of the population and constitute a powerful voting block in Israel's coalition government. They have used this power to maintain government subsidies for working-age men to study the Torah full-time and protect the ability for ultra-orthodox Israelis to win easy exemptions from compulsory military service. These arrangements have prompted a growing sense of resentment and anger among other Israelis, says author and columnist Bradley Burston. ""What people are thinking is that this is absolutely unsustainable,"" says Burston. ""They can't go on providing these kinds of subsidies for this kind of lifestyle, especially if it seems that the same people you are subsidizing are going to turn on you and turn on Jews everywhere because they don't like their behavior."" While the tensions between the ultra-orthodox and other Israelis are not likely to result in a major schism anytime soon, Burston believes the Haredi community needs to do a better job at integrating into Israeli society. If not, he says, the schism could become a major crisis for Israel in the years ahead.","Tensions increasing between Israel's ultra-orthodox community and Israeli mainstream .

"(CareerBuilder) -- Looking for the best time of the year to get a promotion? According to data collected and analyzed by LinkedIn, January, June and July are the most popular months for U.S. workers to receive promotions. Globally, January, July and September are the top three. ""It is not surprising that promotions tend to occur around these times,"" says Roy Cohen, a career coach and author of ""The Wall Street Professional's Survival Guide."" ""In the U.S., promotions usually happen around new budget cycles and after holidays. January represents the start of a new calendar year and when performance evaluations are typically conducted. Some companies begin their new budget cycles in June or July, thus promotions occur in these months."" The worldwide tendency to promote in January can likewise be attributed to the turning of the calendar, marking a time of new beginnings. But while promotions in June and July in America may be due primarily to mid-year evaluations and fiscal calendars, many other countries have a special consideration. ""July represents the time before much of the world takes the month of August off for holiday, so decisions are made prior to vacation. And September is when they return,"" Cohen notes. Other good times for promotions . The LinkedIn study also revealed that while certain months had a higher percentage of promotions compared to others, advancement is becoming less concentrated. For example, during the 1990s, 22 percent of promotions occurred in January, but in the most recent decade that figure decreased to 16 percent. ""There are two types of promotions to consider. One is a promotion that fills a vacancy in a hierarchy. This can occur at any time that the vacancy occurs. For example, an editor retires and someone is promoted to fill the position,"" says John P. Millikin, a professor in the management department at Arizona State University's W. P. Carey School of Business in Tempe, Ariz., and a former vice president of human resources at Motorola Inc. in Phoenix. ""The other type of promotion is a step up in a hierarchy of jobs, such as a promotion from buyer to senior buyer. While it varies by company or industry, this usually occurs on a schedule that reflects an individual's performance evaluation period. Frequently, this would coincide with the end of a business performance period such as a fiscal year."" Besides someone's departure opening up opportunities for advancement, other situations can increase the odds for promotion at any time of the year. ""Strike when the iron is hot,"" Cohen says. ""When you introduce a new idea that will increase productivity, save money or generate revenue, you're golden. When you've successfully completed a special project, you've got their attention. Ask what new projects you can take on and how those projects will position you for expanded responsibilities."" Likewise, Cohen notes that promotions often happen when there's a spike in business because there will be a focus on adding headcount to manage the expanded activity. But are promotions out of the question when a company is having difficulty? ""Obviously, when times are tough as they are in most businesses today, you need to be sensitive to the needs of the business in asking about promotions,"" Millikin says. ""Do keep in mind, however, that tough times also present opportunities to shine. As people leave or are even laid off, showing a willingness to step up and take on additional responsibilities shows that you care about the organization."" Getting noticed . Regardless of the season, experts agree that there are things you can do throughout the year to make yourself more ""promotable"" including: . •Getting the extra training or experience needed for the position you desire. •Letting managers know that you are interested in advancement. •Asking superiors what steps they recommend to help prepare for a promotion. •Looking at the big picture to see how your actions help your manager get her job done well. •Making others aware of your contributions -- without going overboard or constantly bragging. Above all, it is critical that you are performing up to par on your current job. As Millikin notes, ""No one is going to be impressed with someone who is focusing so much on the next job that he isn't really doing the one he has well."" &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"Haifa, Israel (CNN) -- On a cool January morning, Israeli ambulances sped to the site of a simulated terrorist attack in Haifa, the country's largest port city. In keeping with the script for the long-planned civil defense exercise, emergency workers responded to a suicide car bomb with one element the country has not experienced in the dozens of real terrorist bombings over the years: this simulated attack dispersed nuclear materials, a ""dirty bomb"" laced with radioactive Cesium 137. While life went on around them in an otherwise normal day, paramedics rushed the ""victims"" to area hospitals, where doctors and nurses in protective gear moved to decontaminate and treat their injuries. Elsewhere, authorities assessed the public health effects and the psychological impact on the public of hearing the words ""nuclear"" and ""bomb"" used in the same sentence referring to an attack close to home. It was not a simulation of an atomic bomb, but of a ""radiological dispersal device,"" a much less destructive conventional weapon with some nuclear materials in the mix -- enough to spread a small amount of radiation and a great deal of panic. Nobody talked about Iran during the event. But, as with so much of what goes on in Israel these days, thoughts of how the conflict over Iran's nuclear program might ultimately unfold lurked in people's minds. For all those involved in the exercise, it was an opportunity to prepare for another one of the many disturbing scenarios that come up whenever Israelis ponder what the future may bring. Dr. Lion Poles, one of the organizers from the Ministry of Health, called it ""a hypothetical but plausible scenario."" When word came out months ago that the Israeli military was preparing the exercise code-named ""Dark Cloud"" -- the first ever drill for nuclear terrorism in the country -- authorities tried to downplay its significance. Perhaps that's why Dark Cloud received so little media attention. But Defense Minister Ehud Barak has often said that the greatest risk from Iran's nuclear program is not that Tehran will launch an atomic bomb against Israel, but that it might send a dirty bomb to explode through cargo arriving at a crowded port. After years of worrying about Iran -- and about other threats in the neighborhood -- Israelis have developed a cool and tense fatalistic attitude. Conversations with every day people show a mix of resignation, bravado, fear and a suspicion that there may not be good options. In Jerusalem, Uri Margalit, a 57-year-old salesman, says he doesn't think Israel will attack Iran, but concedes that the uncertainty of what might happen has made him and his friends nervous. ""Everybody's a little afraid,"" he admits. Others, like Hanna Ofner, are less pessimistic. ""I count on the government to do the right thing,"" she says, adding that she believes Europe and the U.S. understand just how risky a nuclear-armed Iran would be for the entire Middle East and the rest of the world. Polls show the public is divided about whether or not Israel should attack Iran to keep nuclear weapons out of its hands. Given that Iran's leaders have openly proclaimed their wish to see Israel destroyed, most Israelis believe a war will happen. Some Israelis tellingly confess they have restocked their bomb shelters with fresh water and other supplies. The January 18 radiological drill barely made the news in a country where national exercises to prepare for conventional missile attacks, in addition to biological and chemical weapons, have become routine in recent years. The need to prepare more actively became clear after the 2006 war with Lebanon's Hezbollah, when Hezbollah's rockets -- many of them made in Iran -- hit a greater portion of Israel than ever before, forcing more than 300,000 Israelis to evacuate their hometowns and sending about a million of them into bomb shelters. Lebanon was also affected: at least a million people were displaced during the 34 days of fighting. If the conflict with Iran does escalate into open warfare, the widespread expectation is that Hezbollah, a close ally of Iran, will attack Israel from Lebanon, while Hamas, another friend of Tehran, will do the same from Gaza. The U.S. believes Hezbollah alone has an arsenal of about 50,000 rockets and missiles, some capable of reaching practically all of Israel. While the radiological drill did not garner a lot of attention, there was another exercise -- one that did not happen -- which made large headlines. The U.S. and Israel has been preparing to hold their largest joint military maneuvers in the history of their alliance, a missile defense drill code-named ""Austere Challenge 12,"" in April. As military officials on both sides were busy arranging for thousands of American soldiers to deploy to Israel, word came out that the war games had been postponed. The circumstances behind the sudden change of plans remain something of a mystery, with officials offering reassurances that there is no reason for concern. For Israelis, however, one of the greatest fears is that they will be abandoned to face Iran without international support. It came as some comfort that President Obama just told Time Magazine that he ""will take every step available to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon."" Israelis hope that will be achieved without the need for war, but they believe it is a near certainty that a military operation against Iran would result in attacks against Israel by Iran's allies. Just in case, they are preparing for any conceivable scenario while carrying on with their daily lives and hoping for the best. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter . Join the conversation on Facebook .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel and Egypt have reached a prisoner swap agreement that would free a man with Israeli and U.S. citizenship whom Egypt suspected of being a spy. ""As a result of the efforts made by Israel and Egypt, and accommodated by the United States, Egypt has agreed to release Ilan Grapel,"" the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Monday. Israel denies Grapel is a spy. Israel agreed to free 25 Egyptian prisoners, including three minors, the prime minister's office said. As part of the agreement, ""Israel clarifies that the prisoners being released are not security prisoners,"" the statement said. The deal needs to be confirmed by Israel's Security Cabinet, which will meet Tuesday, the prime minister's office said. Grapel, 27, was arrested June 12 on suspicion of spying. A general in Egyptian intelligence, speaking on condition of anonymity, described 22 of the 25 to be released by Israel as ""political prisoners."" The exchange will take place within two days through the Taba border crossing. The three minors are between ages 12 and 14, he said. The general also said Israel wanted to include another prisoner in the swap, but Egypt refused. An Israeli official said Israel does not consider the Egyptian prisoners it is freeing to be ""political prisoners."" Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States was ""hopeful"" that Grapel would be released. Speaking to the media during a visit to Libya, she answered a question about reports that Grapel may be released, saying, ""We see no basis for any legal action against him."" Adel Saeed, spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor's office, said that on October 15, ""Grapel's detention was extended for 15 days for further investigations."" He is charged with espionage and incitement to burn government buildings, Saeed said. After Grapel's arrest in June, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel Radio he had no idea why Grapel was detained. Grapel was taken into custody in a five-star hotel in downtown Cairo, Saeed said. Grapel's mother said he had been staying at a $9-a-night youth hostel. Speaking to CNN from her home in New York after her son's arrest, Irene Grapel said there was ""no chance"" that Ilan was a spy. Grapel is a former paratrooper in the Israel Defense Forces. When arrested in June, he was a rising third-year student at Emory University's law school in Atlanta, school officials said. ""Law students don't have time to be spies,"" Grapel's mother said. Irene Grapel said her son traveled to Cairo in May to volunteer at St. Andrews Refugee Services, a Cairo-based nongovernmental organization. The organization's assistant director, Fiona Camera, told CNN that Grapel worked for them for four days. His mother said his work could have been what led Egyptian authorities to focus on him. ""He loves the Arab culture. He loves the Arab religion,"" she said. Grapel speaks Arabic, which he studied at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and he spent his junior year at Ben Gurion University in Israel. ""He gravitates toward Arabic-speaking students on campus so he can speak with them, simply to use the language,"" Irene Grapel said. Saeed, the general prosecutor spokesman, said in June that Grapel had participated in the Lebanon war of 2006 and was relieved of field combat duties after being injured. Investigators had been following his activities for months, Saeed said. The Israeli government allegedly sent Grapel to Egypt after the January 25 revolution to take advantage of the security vacuum by recruiting others to provide the Israelis with military and political information, Saeed said. The U.S. State Department said in June that Egyptian authorities provided the United States with ""almost immediate consular access"" to Grapel. CNN's Michael Schwartz and Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","An Egyptian general says Israel wanted another prisoner included in the swap .

"(CNN) -- When a disaster of a mega-proportion hits a city - from a terror attack to a hurricane - there are procedures in place to deal with the aftermath. Suggest that the source of a serious humanitarian crisis could lie in outer space, however, and many will assume you are talking science fiction. But one woman is on a mission to convince the world -- and especially governments and the United Nations -- to take threats such as potential asteroid strikes more seriously. Meet Nelly Ben Hayoun, Designer of Experiences at the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in California, creator of the International Space Orchestra -an orchestra composed of space scientists- and trainee astronaut. ""This isn't a Bruce Willis film, this is real life"", says the 29-year-old, from Provence, France. Speaking from SETI, Ben Hayoun rattles off statistics about space, dissects doomsday scenarios, contemplates the possibility of aliens and brings names such as Carl Sagan to Jean Baudrillard into the conversation. She has been called the 'Willy Wonka of design and science' and her latest project, Disaster Playground, is a documentary film, about scientists preparing for disasters from space that could threaten Planet Earth. Ben Hayoun speaks to illustrious space scientists from SETI, NASA's Near Earth Objects (NEO) project and Disaster and Rescue Assistance (DART) including: extra-terrestrial intelligence specialist Dr. Jill Tarter (the inspiration for Jodie Foster's character in the film Contact), and meteor shower expert Dr. Peter Jenniskens. So what do you do in the case of hazardous asteroids or a small NEO (Near Earth Object)? ANSWER from Disaster Playground: There are different mitigation techniques in place: kinetic impactor, blast defection, combination methods, gravity tractor (a spacecraft to deflect an asteroid using only its gravitational field to transmit impulse). Alternative methods: moving asteroids with lasers, focusing sun energy, changing thermal properties, electro-static pushing and reflecting white paint. Ben Hayoun investigates such real-life procedures in place to deal with the threat of an asteroid collision and how critical information would flow up the chain of command. ""Who are the people who would make the decision and what would be the basis of their decision-making?"" she asks. There are 20 people before the President is alerted and before 'the red button is pushed'. There might be something to be gained from revealing problems to the public in order to help secure funding which is a ""big difficulty"" she explains. ""Humans are more willing to support a cause if you understand the difficulties involved."" As well as the film, to be released on March 2015, she's also relying on an app, exhibitions and ""immersive experiences"" such as the one at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London as part of the Digital Design Weekend. She is determined to promote the role of women in the male-dominated space industry. Ben Hayoun recalls how she was once one of two women in a room of 1,500 people at the International Astronautical Congress. ""This is my massive fight,"" she says with gusto. ""How are these space agencies making choices on what we need? It occurred to me that the people making these decisions are men -- space science is a field which is 90% men, men men! We need women - let's face it we would come up with way smarter solutions!"" But in all seriousness, Ben Hayoun warns that efforts to find and fund ways of dealing with the asteroid threat must continue. ""It's not like I can say 'yes, we have a solution',"" she said. ""It's only going to the UN now. They are aware of their responsibility but at the moment they are just putting in place the committees."" ""Nobody knows exactly what the UN response would be and that's a real problem,"" said Ben Hayoun. WATCH: Space chat with astronaut Karen Nyberg .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities said Tuesday they detained 240 illegal migrants as part of a controversial plan to deport some of the thousands of Africans who have flooded the country illegally in recent years. Another 300 illegal migrants volunteered Tuesday to return to their country of origin, Israel's immigration ministry said. All the migrants detained Tuesday are Sudanese. ""We are sending the infiltrators, migrants, back to their homes like all countries in the West, in Europe, in the USA act when dealing with migrants,"" Interior Minister Eli Yishai said on Tuesday. ""Israel is acting according to international law and international charters dealing with infiltrators and migrants that come into the country against the law,"" he said. ""We are acting according to the same law as the United States and Europe."" The issue of illegal African migrants has been of growing concern in the country in recent months. According to government records, more than 59,000 illegal African immigrants have entered the country in recent years through its southern border with Egypt. More than 2,000 new migrants have been reported over the past month. Some residents of southern Tel Aviv neighborhoods, where there is a large concentration of Africans, have blamed their new neighbors for increasing crime and suffocating the infrastructure and public services. Some also complain the illegal immigration is changing the fabric of Israel. Several hundred Sudanese immigrants rallied Sunday in Tel Aviv, demanding refugee status. Last week, an Israeli court approved a government plan to deport 1,500 African migrants. Many Israeli refugee agencies and officials are pushing against those plans and calling on the government to allow the immigrants to stay. Yishai said Israel is treating the detained migrants ""with honor"" but must return them to their country of origin. ""We are dealing with a porous southern border opposite Africa,"" he said. ""We have to close it, and we are closing it, and everyone who comes looking for work must be returned to their country and we are doing it in an honorable way. There is a grant to help the person in the first period that he returns to his country and his home."" Most of the immigrants come from Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. Some of them have refugee status and hold temporary permits to remain in the country, but Israel does not recognize the status of most of them and says it is looking for ways to send them back to their home countries. CNN's Elise Labott and Michael Schwartz contributed to this report.","240 illegal migrants are detained and 300 others volunteer to leave .

"(CNN) -- More than 2,000 lives lost. A vast and unfolding humanitarian crisis. And the downing of a civilian airliner that shocked the world. It's hard to imagine -- but true -- that the raging conflict between Ukraine and Russia, or at least Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels, all started with a humble trade agreement. As tensions run high over a Russian aid convoy described by Western leaders as a provocative incursion, reports of direct Russian military activity inside Ukraine and Ukrainian fears of an outright invasion, it's time to look back on how we got here, and where things are headed: . How it started . While the roots of the crisis run quite deep, what's happening now began to unfold in earnest in the fall of 2013. That's when then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych scuttled a trade deal with the European Union that would have pulled the country, so recently a satellite of the Soviet Union, toward Europe in the latest twirl of a dance that has lasted centuries. Instead, Yanukovych jumped at Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to buy $15 billion in debt from his cash-strapped government and cut the price of vital natural gas to the country. Yanukovych's decision set off protests in Ukraine's more Europe-leaning west calling for the government's ouster. Security forces responded harshly, beating protesters and firing live ammunition into demonstrations, resulting in several deaths. As clashes spread, so did international anger over the situation. By late February, Yanukovych had fled to Russia, the government had fallen and a new pro-Europe government had formed to replace it. That, in turn, set off pro-Russian demonstrations in Crimea, a semi-autonomous Ukrainian republic and the location of a major Russian navy base. After thousands of Russian troops filtered into the territory -- purportedly at the invitation of Ukraine's self-exiled president -- Ukraine's regional parliament called a referendum on secession, and before you could say ""borscht,"" Crimea was part of Russia. And it's here that things turned even uglier. Pro-Russian fighters occupied government buildings in the country's east, demanding a referendum on independence. Before long, rebel forces -- believed to be supported by Russia -- had taken control of major cities in Ukraine's east. Fighting broke out between the rebel groups and Ukraine's military, fighting that continues today. In a major and likely inadvertent escalation in July, a suspected surface-to-air missile believed to have been operated by pro-Russian rebels shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, killing all 298 people aboard and hardening Western opinion, particularly in Europe, against Russia. What's happening now . Ukraine's military has been on the offensive recently against the pro-Russian forces, but those successes seem to have slowed. Russian troops remain camped along the Ukrainian border, Western leaders say. And Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that they had detained 10 Russian soldiers in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine, further evidence, Kiev says, of direct Russian involvement in the conflict. Meanwhile, the United Nations has warned of a growing humanitarian crisis sure only to get worse unless something is done to stem the fighting. What's next . A full-scale invasion is unlikely. While Putin's approval rating among Russians is sky-high, recent polling shows the Russian people aren't wild about an out-and-out invasion of Ukraine, said Robert D. Kaplan, the chief geopolitical analyst for Stratfor. ""He may be a dictator, but dictators care about public opinion as much as democrats,"" he said. But any talk of peace from Putin is likely a stalling tactic. Putin is buying time so that he can continue slipping arms and aid to help rebels recover from their recent losses, said Heather Conley, senior vice president of Europe and Eurasia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""His best option is to have a permanent frozen conflict,"" she said. Fall and winter will slow the fighting. Kaplan said the colder seasons in Ukraine mean mud and mud means a slower tempo for military operations. Just don't expect total silence, he says -- there will still be fighting. Moscow will try to squeeze Ukraine. Putin will slow the flow of crucial natural gas and goods into Ukraine, putting further pressure on Kiev's economy and war-fighting ability. ""The Russians will try everything to weaken the regime in Kiev,"" Kaplan said. The West has some soul-searching to do. Sanctions applied by the United States and Europe against Russia have so far only played into Putin's playbook, enhancing the image of an aggrieved Russia trying to shake off its detractors, Conley said. Putin's strategy of assembling a larger Russian empire has significant ramifications for Estonia and Latvia, Conley said, raising questions about just what the West will do to stop Russia if Putin chooses to further extend his reach. And what will it take to end this? Ukraine is a linchpin of Putin's plans for Russia, whether it's reassembling a historical empire or shoring up the Russian economy, Conley says. So whatever happens must support that. Kaplan says Putin can't pull back without gaining assurances that Ukraine will never become part of NATO. Ukraine, he said, needs assurances about its sovereignty and energy security.","The Ukraine conflict started with a dispute over a trade deal .
That ballooned into protests, then Russia stepped in .
Looking forward, an outright invasion seems unlikely, analysts say .
It won't be easy to unravel the complex political and economic forces tugging at Ukraine ."
"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israel declared a German poet persona non grata Sunday in an unusual move that follows a wave of fury over a controversial poem. Published in the German paper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung on Wednesday under the title ""What needs to be said,"" the poem by Gunter Grass accused Israel of planning a preemptive strike against Iran in order to ""extinguish the Iranian people."" It said Israel's ""atomic power endangers"" world peace. The poem also criticized the German government for supplying Israel with a submarine capable of sending destructive warheads ""where the existence of a single nuclear bomb is unproven."" The 84-year-old Grass, who won a Nobel Prize in literature in 1999, is now unwelcome in Israel, the government announced. The poem earned him a blaze of harsh critics that included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a statement published Thursday, Netanyahu referred to Grass' comparison between Israel and Iran as ""shameful"" and argued that it said ""little about Israel and much about Mr. Grass."" ""It is Iran, not Israel, that is a threat to the peace and security of the world"" said Netanyahu, ""It is Iran, not Israel, that threatens other states with annihilation."" Referring to Grass' past as a member of the Nazi Waffen-SS during World War II, Netanyahu said ""it is not surprising"" for the poet ""to cast the one and only Jewish state as the greatest threat to world peace and to oppose giving Israel the means to defend itself."" In an effort to quash the criticism and accusations of anti-Semitism, Grass later explained himself in an interview, saying he merely meant to point to what he considers wrongful policies of the current Israeli government led by Netanyahu. ""I criticize a policy that continues to build settlements against any U.N. resolution,"" Grass said. ""Grass' poems are an attempt to ignite the flame of hatred against the people and the state of Israel and thereby promote the idea he was publicly a part of when he wore the SS Nazi uniforms,"" Israeli Interior Minister Eli Yishai said on Sunday. ""If Grass wishes to proceed with his distorted and false creations, I suggest he does so in Iran, where he can find a supporting audience,"" Yishai added. Yishai's spokesman told CNN the travel ban against Grass was issued on the basis of an Israeli law that enables the government to deny former Nazis from entering the country. Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said on Sunday the poem is ""an expression of the cynicism of some the West's intellectuals, who, for publicity purposes and the desire to sell a few more books, are willing to sacrifice the Jewish nation a second time on the altar of crazy anti-Semites.""","Gunter Grass' poem accused Israel of wanting to ""extinguish the Iranian people""

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy inflicted havoc and heartache throughout the Northeast, hitting the Big Apple and its surrounding coastal towns hard. We have seen this kind of destruction before: I had an up-close-and personal view when Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. On August 31, 2005, I was designated commander of Joint Task Force Katrina, responsible for coordinating military relief efforts for damaged areas across the Gulf Coast. My arrival in New Orleans came after what was widely believed to be a poor performance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and its director Michael D. Brown. We learned a lot about what really works in our Katrina recovery efforts -- but New York and New Jersey seem to be ignoring those lessons. First, I would like to praise the search and rescue operations in New York and New Jersey. But they could be doing much better now that they've entered the difficult part, the recovery operation. Where is the command center? Who is in charge? Where is the National Guard? During the aftermath of Katrina, National Guard troops were positioned on every block to establish a sense of safety and source of help for the people in need. They did not leave communities till people were safe and sound. This has not happened in New York or New Jersey. Opinion: Rebuilding after Sandy is too big a risk . The National Guard has served America as both a wartime force and the first military responders in times of domestic crisis. Hundreds of times each year, the nation's governors call upon their Guard troops to respond to fires, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters. Why did New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo only call in half the New York Guard, especially when relief is still not reaching the severely affected communities? The numbers speak for themselves. During the Hurricane Katrina disaster, about 20,000 federal troops were mobilized; 20 ships, including a hospital ship, about 50,000 National Guard members and 200 helicopters assisted in the relief efforts. So far, in Sandy relief efforts, about 11,000 National Guard troops were deployed, and only two ships have assisted -- this as people still suffer. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . Instead of Doctors Without Borders providing health care to about 300 people in Queens, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Hoboken, New Jersey, why wasn't the hospital ship USNS Comfort deployed like it was in Katrina, when it cared for needy people all along the Gulf Coast? Opinion: What's next after the superstorm? People need food and medical attention. People are still without power, people are still homeless and hungry. Following a logistics model to help those hardest hit is a necessity. New York and New Jersey need to establish what is called an ""enabler"" model for recovery, which we developed during Katrina. In this approach, you go in with Guard troops and you distribute food, water and medicine, but you also pick up trash, clean out sewer pipes, clean up hospitals, hook up generators, all in order to enable people to live in their communities. Troops should stay in communities until residents get everything they need to live in their homes, or till they can be evacuated. New York City went in with food and rescue teams -- but in many cases, community volunteers were left to take up the slack. News: FEMA's answers for NY storm victims -- put them back in their homes . Some FEMA officials complain that they must drive hours every day to get to the storm victims because New York has not provided them with any living accommodations. What's needed urgently are more disaster recovery offices in every community, where FEMA representatives can stay. People can easily apply for assistance, food stamps, grants for rebuilding or get food and water. This is especially urgent in New York, as poorer communities are at their most vulnerable now, with cold weather coming on and infrastructure still damaged. Hurricane Sandy was one of the most vicious storm systems to hit the New York City area in nearly two centuries. The city seems to be treating the storm more like an inconvenience than a disaster. Katrina offered great lessons for successful recovery operations -- why didn't New York City pay attention? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré.","Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré asks why New York has ignored all the lessons learned from Katrina .
Honoré: Sandy recovery has no command center, nobody in charge and no troop presence .
After Katrina, National Guard was out in force and hospital ship was available, he says .
FEMA workers complain they have difficulty reaching Sandy storm victims, he says ."
"(CNN) -- American officials are pondering whether to strike ISIS elements in Syria to better contain the group's fearsome power, following its horrific execution of James Foley and the direct threats it has leveled against the United States. As they consider how best to confront the organization, there is good news: The United States and its friends have scored some successes against ISIS in the past month. The administration provided material support to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga and Iraqi special operations forces, and with judicious use of airstrikes enabled them to repel ISIS attacks northwest and northeast of Baghdad. The Obama administration wisely understood that these military operations are only a short-term fix. The only sustainable solution is a new Iraqi government able to rally a large majority of Iraqis across ethnic and sectarian lines to fight the Islamic State in Syria. Iraqis have come together before to contain such extremists, and they could again. Iraq's restive Sunni Arab population, furious at former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, backed ISIS in the Spring, but now Sunni Arab tribal figures in Anbar and Kirkuk, as well as some of the leaders from the urban business-political elite in Mosul and Salah ad-Din, have asked the Iraqi central government in Baghdad for help to fight the organization. Success is not assured, but the picture is brighter than a month ago. American pressure -- and tying military assistance to concrete progress toward assembling a broad-based national government -- have encouraged the hesitant Iraqis forward. The United States needs to sustain that approach. But even with progress in Iraq, the United States and its friends cannot contain the Islamic State for long when it has a vast safe zone in Syria into which its fighters can fall back to rest, regroup, and fight again. As we contemplate a response, we should consider whether any of the strategies used recently in Iraq could also be used in Syria. In Iraq, the United States identified friends willing to fight the Islamic State on the ground. The Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga were not perfect -- they are not a regular army, their command structure is at times unwieldy, and their political agendas are not always compatible with ours. However, they were clearly able to help blunt the ISIS advance, so cooperating with them was sensible. Similarly, providing far more help to moderate elements of the Syrian armed opposition makes huge sense. They are motivated and have been locked in combat against ISIS for nine months. Despite fighting an uphill battle against the well-armed regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, heavily backed by Iran and Russia, they have advanced in some regions. They share the same frustrating imperfections -- such as lack of professional discipline -- as the Peshmerga and the Iraqi military, but if they were better armed and financed, the moderate Syrian fighters could be helpful in repelling ISIS. They already did so by expelling it from northwest Syria earlier this year and the Damascus area this summer. With stronger cash flows from governments in the West and Gulf, they could also lure Syrians away from ISIS bankrolls. American airstrikes might be needed in Syria, but that would not be the most important tactic for success, nor would more material aid to the rebels be sufficient to contain the Islamic State over the long term. As in Iraq, there has to be a political angle as well. Helping a weakened al-Assad regime to consolidate its position in Damascus is not a recipe for sustainable success. The regime can't roll back the Islamic State now -- it is attracting scores of new jihadis every day. Helping al-Assad would multiply the numbers of recruits. Rather, as in Iraq, Syria needs a new government. The U.S. had hoped this would be negotiated in Geneva, where an international conference early this year aimed to find a political solution to the Syria conflict, but al-Assad rejected any serious negotiation. His Russian and Iranian allies, estimating that he could survive, and seeing no alternative, made no effort to convince the regime to do otherwise. Six months later, however, the regime's pillars of support are weaker. There are reports that the regime earlier this month executed three air force pilots who had refused to obey orders. The minority Alawite sect that has backed al-Assad is openly grumbling about heavy losses in an endless war against the moderate rebels and now the ruthless Islamic State. A publicity campaign called ""Scream of the Nation"" is under way in the Alawite heartland. Its complaint: Assad keeps his throne while our children go to their coffins. We need moderate armed opposition leaders in Syria to capitalize on this weariness by moving politically, not just militarily. As we boost aid to the moderate armed rebels, we must condition that help on their reaching out to disaffected regime supporters and developing with them a common political stance for a new, negotiated national unity government, with or without al-Assad. The al-Assad regime won't go to the table easily, and the moderate rebels will need more help -- perhaps even hardware, like more mortars and rockets to hit airfields and bases and further rattle al-Assad's war machine. Substantially boosting help to the moderate opposition would also compel Russia and Iran to rethink their blank check to al-Assad, especially if there is a better alternative route to contain ISIS. As it did with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, Iran might consider other reasonable alternatives to the current Syrian leadership. Iran won't, however, until it recognizes that al-Assad can't win and can't rally enough support to contain the Islamic State. One prominent American observer says it is folly to think that we can aid the moderate armed fighters to topple al-Assad. But toppling wasn't our goal before and shouldn't be now. We should aim to help the Syrian opposition inflict enough pain on the regime so that, despite al-Assad, the regime finally agrees to negotiate a new government whose first task will be to fight the Islamic State and eventually expel it from Syria. In Syria's brutal, three-sided war, the U.S. has no easy options. We have never controlled events there. It is also true that civil wars don't always end in happy settlements. However, our inability to steer perfectly or to guarantee the best outcome can't be an excuse to maintain our current approach.","Robert Ford: U.S. mulling strike on ISIS elements in Syria .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- It was a heart-wrenching memorial for victims of the Toulouse killings. The fact that three of them were just young children, shot in cold blood, added to the feelings of loss and despair. On the outskirts of Jerusalem, at the main Givat Shaul cemetery, ambulances delivered the coffins, as thousands came to pay their respects. ""In Toulouse and Jerusalem, in New York and Buenos Aires, Jews are standing together,"" the speaker of the Israeli parliament, Reuven Rivlin, told the mourners. ""The house of Israel weeps at these murders,"" he added. The atmosphere was acutely sad and subdued, with painful moments of intense grief. One came when the mother of a murdered toddler arrived to bid farewell to her child. Too distraught to walk, she was carried from the ambulance by the crowd. The teenaged brother of seven-year-old Miriam Monsonego -- the little girl shot at point blank range by the gunman -- captured the distress of the tragedy. ""Miriam, I have a last request, never stop crying and pray to god to give us strength to continue and give strength for our parents to overcome this most terrible time."" And as a sign of how serious the French government is taking this attack, the country's foreign minister, Alain Juppe, also made an address, vowing to protect French Jews from attack. ""Don't have any doubts about our steadfast ability to fight anti Semitism,"" he told the crowd. ""Every time a Jew is cursed, attacked or killed, the whole nation is in the crosshairs and has to react immediately."" Many Israelis, though, may not be convinced by that. France is often identified here as a place where the Jewish community is vunerable, and there is alarm at what is seen in Israel as a rising tide of anti-Semitism across Europe. ""The Jews of Europe are once again in grave danger,"" comments one opinion piece on the popular Ynetnews.com website. The article predicts an upsurge in the number of Jews abandoning Europe for Israel, calling it a ""tragic but unavoidable process: the New Europe will be a Jews-free continent."" That may be alarmist, but the dreadful killings in Toulouse, the standoff, and the emotional burials in Jerusalem, have reopened a sensitive debate.","Funeral held in Jerusalem for victims of shooting at Ozar Hatorah School in Toulouse, France .

"(CNN) -- Two Metro-North passenger trains heading in opposite directions collided during rush hour Friday evening in southwestern Connecticut, damaging both trains and leaving dozens injured -- some of them critically -- authorities said. A train heading from New Haven to New York City derailed around 6:10 p.m., hitting the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said. That caused some cars on the second train, which was destined for New Haven, to likewise leave the tracks. Gov. Dannel Malloy told reporters Friday night that five people were ""critically injured,"" one of whom was in ""very critical condition."" Two of the 26 people being treated at Bridgeport Hospital are in critical condition, said spokesman John Cappiello. St. Vincent's Medical Center, also in Bridgeport, treated 41 patients from the incident, hospital spokeswoman Lucinda Ames said. One of those was in serious condition and in intensive care, while the others mostly had minor injuries like ""you might get in a car accident."" By 9:45 p.m., 11 of the 67 who had gone to hospitals had been released. A passenger in a middle car of the New York-bound train, Chris Martin, recalled to CNN how his car went dark after the crash, then someone over the intercom ""called all the doctors up front."" He and others aboard his ""pretty full train"" were evacuated, most of them physically fine if emotionally shaken. But there were signs of injuries outside, as Martin said he personally saw eight or nine ambulances and a number of wounded people on stretchers. Brian Alvarez, who saw the wreckage, described the scene as ""pretty graphic."" ""I saw this one car and it was completely destroyed, and they were pulling people out of the car,"" Alvarez said. ""... They were all bloody."" Power was shut off along the line and service has been halted -- westbound past Bridgeport, which is about 60 miles northeast of New York City on the Long Island Sound, and eastbound beyond South Norwalk -- because of the derailment. Amtrak also announced early Friday night that it had suspended all travel between New York and Boston indefinitely after the crash. Bridgeport Mayor Bill Finch said such travel headaches could persist for weeks, because the two tracks affected by the derailment -- which are both ""shot right now"" -- may take weeks to repair. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut. Workers will need to not only remove disabled trains, but also remove the tracks, regrade the rail bed, then lay down the tracks again, according to Finch. ""This is our pipeline to New York City, and it's going to be shut down for some time,"" the mayor said. ""And it's going to cost this region a great deal of money, frankly, not just to repair it but the lost wages and the lost economy."" Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board will head the investigation into the crash. Terry Williams, a Washington-based spokesman for that agency, said a team should be on site by 9 a.m. Saturday. ""We have no reason to believe that it's anything but an accident,"" Gov. Malloy said. CNN's Morgan Winsor, Brittany Brady, Todd Sperry and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report.","NEW: NTSB officials should be on site by 9 a.m. Saturday, spokesman says .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- In an ""unprecedented"" reaction to internal Arab affairs, an Israeli official said the country is getting ready to absorb fleeing Syrian Alawites if the Bashar al-Assad regime falls. Israeli military chief of staff Benny Gantz told members of a Knesset committee that Alawites would be permitted to settle in Golan Heights, a spokesman for Knesset member Avi Dichter told CNN. The Golan is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite Israeli governmental control. It is home to 41,000 residents -- Jewish settlers, Druze and Alawites themselves. Israel seized the territory from Syria during the 1967 Israel-Arab war, and it was eventually annexed. The remark reflects the Israeli military calculus that the embattled al-Assad regime is doomed and will soon disintegrate. The regime is dominated by Alawites, a heterodox offshoot of Shiite Islam. Sunnis represent the most populous religious group in the country and the heart of the opposition against the regime. For this reason, Israel believes Alawites are most likely to flee if a new government takes over, and many will head for the Golan. So, Israeli authorities want to prepare for that eventuality. Jonathan Spyer at the Global Research in International Affairs Center in Herzliya, Israel, said Defense Minister Ehud Barak also predicted late last year, to the same parliamentary panel, the foreign affairs and defense committee, that the fall of the Syrian government is imminent. Within weeks, he said. Spyer said the notion of taking in uprooted people from a neighboring Arab country is a drastic deviation to conventional Israeli policy, which traditionally calls for Israel not to get directly involved in such situations. He said it's the ""first time Israel ever said anything of this kind."" ""It's quite strange to be honest with you in terms of Israel's more usual style, which is we don't get involved in the affairs of neighboring Arab countries,"" Spyer said. Spyer said he doesn't know on what Israel is basing its evidence. He said information he and other civilian researchers have culled indicates that the assessments are ""very premature"" ""These latest statements seem to factor in this sense, which is the Israeli military intelligence assessment that this regime is clearly on its last leg,"" Spyer said. ""Israeli talk of needing to look immediately at what's going to happen when Assad falls very soon is somewhat premature unless they know something that the rest of don't -- which is possible.""","Alawites will be allowed to settle in Golan Heights, military chief says .

"(CNN) -- It seemed like a good idea at the time: Skip the ""Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience"" -- the only major wide release this weekend and more or less review-proof -- and check out the new releases down at the local DVD store instead. Jeremy Strong and Fairuza Balk star in ""Humboldt County,"" though she doesn't hang around long. I was up for this assignment. We all know how close ""Slumdog Millionaire"" came to bypassing theatres. The film was initially bankrolled by Warner Independent, and when that boutique shingle was rolled into parent Warner Bros., some executive decided that the year's best picture should not pass Go -- skip the $200 -- and head straight to the rental chains. (Warner Bros., like CNN, is a division of Time Warner.) If it could happen to ""Slumdog,"" what other gems might be out there? I scan the shelves. ""High School Musical 3."" ""W."" ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People."" I'm a movie critic -- been there, done that. A harder look produces a handful of possibilities. I zero in on three unfamiliar titles. ""Humboldt County"" boasts the participation of former child star Fairuza Balk while the quote from Time Out New York promises ""a pleasant buzz."" ""Ghost Writer"" doesn't come with any critical endorsement, just a groaner for a tagline (""Deadline has a new meaning""), cover art that says horror-suspense, and an oddball cast: Alan Cumming, David Boreanaz, Anne Heche, Henry Thomas, Jane Lynch, Karen Black and Carrie Fisher. Intriguing. Finally, there's ""Lullaby"" (""He took her son ... now she'll take him"") starring Oscar best actress nominee Melissa Leo. With its unfashionable sepia artwork and mom-on-the-warpath scenario, this looks like a 1970s grindhouse flick. Not best picture material, I'm thinking, but then again, when did you last see a bad Melissa Leo performance? Never, I'll bet. It's a crapshoot, so to improve the odds I take all three. First up is ""Humboldt County."" It turns out this did get a theatrical release. It opened on nine screens in September and went down from there, so unless you actually live in Humboldt County, which is in far northern California, you probably missed it. And if the movie is to be believed, even if you do live there you probably still missed it, because you were otherwise engaged in farming illegal substances, gazing at the shoreline, and/or hanging out with your quirky neighbors. It's an alternative lifestyle that sneaks up on the very straight, anxious young med student Peter (Jeremy Strong). He's inducted by ""Bogart"" (Balk), but scarcely seems to notice when she disappears in the second reel, leaving him in the care of Rosie and Jack (Frances Conroy and Brad Dourif), not to mention her last boyfriend, Max (Chris Messina). In keeping with the hazy vibe of the thing, nothing much happens -- slowly. Peter misses the bus out of town, more than once. Eventually you realize days, even weeks have gone by and Bogart still hasn't returned. You wonder if Peter and Max might hook up in her absence? But that would harsh the mood. Instead things just drift by. What does the world need with another doctor anyhow -- and where's Zach Braff when you need him? So I'm underwhelmed by ""Humboldt County,"" but it's a masterpiece beside ""Ghost Writer."" Shown in festivals as ""Suffering Man's Charity"" -- possibly the worst title I've ever heard -- ""Ghost Writer"" is the story of an effete gay music teacher, John (Alan Cumming), harboring an unrequited crush on Sebastian (Boreanaz), a rampantly heterosexual drifter and aspiring novelist he has invited into his home. John gets madder and madder with Sebastian until the day he knocks him out, dresses him in a bra and panties, ties him up with fairy lights and starts swinging. It sounds horrific but it's pitched as an arch black comedy, and so incongruously staged by Alan Cumming (who also directs) that it's neither funny nor scary, except in how scarily unfunny it is. Mind you, the scene in which horny 69-year-old Karen Black makes out with Boreanaz taps a camp hysteria that puts the rest of this flaccid flick to shame. Two down. Now my hopes are riding on ""Lullaby."" I check out the Internet Movie Database and wish I hadn't: ""Lullaby"" has a user rating of 2.8 out of 10. Leo is Stephanie, a waitress who is getting hit up for money by a foreign gangster who says he has her (grown) son, a junkie. So Stephanie does what any self-respecting mom would do. She sells her car, borrows from her friends, and buys a plane ticket to South Africa to deliver the thug his ransom in person. Only the price has gone up. He gives her two hours to stump up another $2,000. Directed by Darrell Roodt and produced in South Africa, ""Lullaby"" makes no sense in any way except one: Leo's performance does. The ""Homicide"" and ""Frozen River"" actress soldiers through this thing with dogged commitment, as if she doesn't know where her next meal is coming from. If that means taking a gig shooting in the sleaziest crime neighborhood in Jo'burg, well, it's still better to play a waitress than be one. I know exactly how she feels. After all, I could be watching the Jonas Brothers right now. ""Humboldt County"" is rated R and runs 97 minutes. ""Ghost Writer"" is unrated and runs 93 minutes. ""Lullaby"" is unrated and runs 97 minutes. For a review of the Jonas Brothers' film, go to EW.com.","Some films go straight to DVD for a reason .

"(CNN) -- It's grown from selling clothes to a handful of friends inside a small dorm room to a popular fashion website featuring more than 1,000 stylish items. Admittedly, it's been quite a journey for Serah Kanyua, the co-founder of Closet49, an online marketplace that links buyers of clothes and accessories to sellers across Kenya. Launched just over a year ago, the growing website features a mix of new and used fashion items -- from custom-made pieces by young designers and boutique stores to well-preserved clothes from women looking to de-clutter their closets. ""We simply merged the idea to sell affordable fashion to people who just didn't want to pay too much,"" says Kanyua. ""And also give people an opportunity to sell off clothes they don't want anymore in their closet but are still in good condition -- and you can be able to get extra cash,"" she adds. Kanyua first began selling clothes to her friends back in 2008 while studying at the University of Nairobi. ""They would tell me, 'well, where did you get this dress from?'"" she recalls. ""I said, 'if I see something that you like then I will get it for you.' And then it suddenly became a bi-weekly thing, where they would stop by my room and select what they liked -- so that really kick-started it off."" After graduating with a marketing degree, Kanyua then decided to expand her small venture, going into business with her high school friend Irene Abagi. Using Kanyua's living room as their base, the two business partners called their shop Closet49. ""When we met the first time to try to exchange clothes and buy from each other as friends, we had, like, 49 items so we picked 49,"" says Kanyua. While the two entrepreneurs still use Kanyua's living room as a physical store twice a week, they see the biggest opportunities for growth online, where buyers can connect to sellers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Kanyua says they started with about 10 customers a month and they're now getting about 100, while last year there were some 2,500 fashion items sold through the website. ""There is huge potential in this market,"" says Kanyua. ""It is quite competitive but at same time there is huge opportunity,"" she adds. Global connections . Kenya has experienced a major IT boom over the past few years, spurred by a rapid increase in the usage of mobile phones. According to the latest data by the Communications Commission of Kenya, the number of mobile phone subscribers rose to 31.2 million in September 2013, while internet users stood at 19.1 million. The growth has the potential to revolutionize the east African country's retail sector. In recent years, several web-based marketplaces have proliferated as more and more mobile phone users turn online to buy or sell goods and services. Indeed, the widespread adoption of mobile money platforms like M-Pesa has turned Kenya into ""a global leader in mobile money transfer service,"" according to Freedom House, a U.S.-based think tank. But while websites such as Closet49 connect users and buyers within Kenya, other online marketplaces such as Soko enable small-scale artisans and producers sell their handcrafted creations not only locally but also across the world. Soko, which means marketplace in Swahili, allows jewelry makers and craftspeople to participate in the international trade. It helps them link directly with buyers from around the world, even if they don't have access to a computer or a bank account. Using a simple mobile phone, artisans can create virtual storefronts by posting their products on Soko's e-commerce website. Consumers then can buy directly from the designers, with Soko facilitating shipment and payment to the vendor. Catherine Mahugu, the Kenyan co-founder of Soko, says the site receives tens of thousands of hits per month and has helped artisans to sell thousands of products to consumers from places such as the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. ""Soko transforms the ubiquitous mobile phone into a tool for trade that expands access to economic opportunity for developing world producers of handmade goods, giving them a greater share of the profits of the global creative goods industry,"" says Mahugu. Looking ahead, the Soko team has big plans for the future. Mahugu says the e-commerce marketplace will be looking to expand its geographical footprint, scaling across East Africa and West Africa as well as piloting in India and Latin America. Back in Kanyua's home, the young entrepreneur says she hopes Closet49's annual profits will make them a million Kenyan shillings in the next two to three years -- a goal of about $12,000 in profit a year. ""It's working, you can see the growth,"" she says. ""So it's really exciting when you see all that working out,"" adds Kanyua. ""I am not denying there are no ups and downs for anyone out there who wants to start but It's really, at the end of the day, very satisfying that you are building something that you are proud of, that you are working, that you like, and then still be able to pay your bills.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities stepped up security at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport Sunday as hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists were due to arrive in the country in a ""fly-in"" campaign to protest Israel's policies in the West Bank. Some activists were barred from entering the country for refusing to promise not to engage in disorderly conduct, but Israel did allow some other activists to enter, Israeli officials said. By Sunday night, 60 activists had been refused entry at the airport, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Nine protesters were arrested for attempting to disrupt order at the airport, Rosenfeld said. He said there were 500 police officials there. Mazin Qumsiyeh, a spokesman for the ""Welcome to Palestine"" campaign, said that more than 1,000 uniformed and plain clothes security officers were at the airport, in what he called a sign of ""unprecedented Israeli hysteria and paranoia."" Authorities ""violently arrested"" the nine activists, he said. Activists who were sent home were being given a letter sarcastically thanking them for ""choosing to make Israel the object of your humanitarian concerns."" The letter says protesters could have focused on ""the Syrian regime's daily savagery against its own people,"" or the actions of Iran or Hamas, but instead ""chose to protest against Israel, the Middle East's sole democracy,"" according to a copy posted on Twitter by Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""We therefore suggest that you first solve the real problems of the region, and then come back and share with us your experience. Have a nice flight,"" the letter says. Organizers of the ""fly-in"" event said some 1,500 to 2,000 activists mainly from Europe, the United States, and Canada would board civilian flights for Israel in order to make their way to various events in Bethlehem and other West Bank cities. By Sunday night, only three activists who flew in had made it to Bethlehem from the Tel Aviv airport, they said. Another 20 had entered a few days before after crossing a land bridge between Jordan and Israel. One of the activists who made it through said 27 other people who had flown with her from Lyon, France, had been detained. The woman, a French citizen named Tanya, declined to provide her last name because she said she feared repercussions from the authorities. Activists told reporters Sunday that the event would be a success, no matter how many people participated. ""Our success is measured in terms of the media publicity the Welcome to Palestine campaign made in shedding light on the true fate of Israel's dictatorship and apartheid,"" organizer Abdel Fatah Abu Srour said. Another organizer criticized Israel's letter. ""I tell Israel they are contradicting themselves about their so-called democracy when they are deporting and detaining people who are coming to visit Palestinians,"" said Amira Mussalam. Activists said they were trying to draw attention to what they claim are prejudicial Israeli border policies that force many international visitors coming to Palestinian areas to lie about their destinations. ""We believe, like prisoners in prisons, we are entitled to receive visitors and Palestinians under Israeli occupation are also entitled to receive visitors,"" Qumsiyeh said. ""So we are entitled to get international visitors to come and visit and show solidarity with us to learn about the situation, but Israel chooses to prevent these people from coming."" On Sunday, he said a number of activists had reached the West Bank, but did not say how many. The activists who were denied entry on Sunday were from Portugal, Canada, Switzerland, France, Spain and Italy, said population and migration authority spokeswoman Sabin Hadad. Last year, organizers staged a similar event and Israel authorities detained and deported dozens of activists who entered the country. On Tuesday, Israel's public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch called activists ""provocateurs"" and told Israeli news portal Ynet that they would ""be dealt with in a determined and quick way,"" adding that ""If they arrive in Israel they will be identified, removed from the plane, their entry into Israel will be prevented and they will be moved to a detention facility until they are flown out of Israel."" To that end, Israeli officials have been in touch with airlines and provided them with lists of people who are forbidden from entering the country. ""Usually airlines don't allow these people to embark, because then they have to cover the expense of the return flight,"" said Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor. ""What we did last year is we had a list of number of people who have been banned from entering the country in the past, and others who will be banned now because they have openly declared that they will come here to disturb public order in one way or another,"" Palmor said. Palmor said arriving passengers who are denied an entrance visa have the right to appeal but could face three days in detention before their hearing. On Sunday, one activist in the United Kingdom said she was in a group of 30 passengers who were blocked from boarding a flight from Manchester to Tel Aviv. ""Israel was able to stop us, British passport-holders, and Israel has the power to extend its apartheid to other countries and borders,"" activist Norma Turner said. Qumsiyeh insists the event is entirely peaceful in nature and suggested that Israeli authorities were over-reacting. ""The Israeli internal security is paranoid and is turning the airport into a military camp. They want to arrest the activists and are calling us provocateurs and demonstrators as they always do"" Qumsiyeh said. ""The activists are coming peacefully and will visit the West Bank and help us build a community school and then they will go home with no problems, Israel is creating the problems and not us.""

"(CNN) -- Traveling in a plane soaring 2,400 meters above the ocean when the door in front of you suddenly swings open, is many things: terrifying, disturbing, dramatic. For former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark, it was also ""a bit annoying."" If it seems like the understatement of the century, then that's because you get the impression there isn't much that rattles the 63-year-old, who is now the third most powerful person at the United Nations. Back in 2005, the then-prime minister was flying along the south west coast of New Zealand when her six-seater plane hit turbulence, forcing the door to swing open. After some scrambling the rogue door was closed, and Clark -- today the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program -- landed safely, though with a badly bruised elbow. That was the ""annoying"" bit, she said. Eight years later, securely seated in the United Nations office in New York, one of the longest serving female prime ministers of all time says ""nothing"" scares her. Well, apart from a few extreme sports. ""I think I've conquered fear,"" she said. ""Except I'm not going into a parachute jump. I don't want to go into a bungee jump -- wonderful revenue earner for New Zealand tourism that it is. And I don't want to do a deep sea dive,"" she said. ""So there's three things off my list but I'll try almost anything else."" Small country, big ambition . Almost a decade before German Chancellor Angela Merkel was toasting a third consecutive term in office, Clark was on the other side of the world celebrating her own successful third election. Clark, the leader of the New Zealand Labour Party, led the country for nine years, from 1999 to 2008. That's just two years less than British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. And six years longer than recently ousted Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Since leaving politics and joining the United Nations in 2009, Clark's international profile has continued to grow -- this year Forbes' ranked her as the 21st most powerful woman in the world. ""I could not have credibly done this job [at the United Nations] if I had not had the experience of leading a small country,"" she said of New Zealand, which has a population of around 4 million. ""There's no greater accountability than having to face your own electors every three years. So I like to think this has been a preparation for this position now."" Women of the world . Clark is also the first female to head the United Nations Development Program, overseeing 8,000 staff in 177 countries, and an annual budget of $5.8 billion. Her vision is a big one: ""Eradication of poverty and tackling exclusion and inequality in our world -- and doing it in a sustainable way."" Where does one start with such an immense goal? For Clark, part of the answer lies in the empowerment of women. ""If you can't inherit the family property, if you can't borrow money, if you can't hold title to land or a rental title because you're a woman -- this isn't fair,"" she said. ""Oftentimes attitudes towards women can be the tremendous unseen barriers -- people don't see a woman doing certain jobs. I've had a lot of experience of crashing my head through glass ceilings so I know it can be done, but it's not something you do by yourself. You have to build support networks."" Force of nature . Growing up on a farm in New Zealand, Clark learned to be self-reliant from a young age -- a trait she's held throughout her career. ""We slaughtered our own meat, we grew our own vegetables. I think I come from generations of extremely resilient people who tend to survive through thick and thin,"" she said. To illustrate her point, Clark recalls meeting another head of state on the steps of New Zealand parliament one day: ""I had the keys in my hand and I said 'come along with me.' I unlocked the door to the private lift and took him up. He was astonished. Where was the army of functionaries who were opening the door pressing the lift button?"" When her party suffered a devastating defeat at the 1990 elections, Clark was down, but not out. ""I became well known in New Zealand for saying 'let's move on,'"" she said. ""Another door will open if you look for it."" And while leading the United Nations Development Program has been one of her greatest achievements, it has come with sacrifices, such as working on the other side of the world from husband Peter Davis. ""I don't necessarily want to be remembered as the most popular girl on the block,"" she said. ""I want to be remembered as the girl who made a difference.""","Helen Clark opens up about being third most powerful person at U.N.

"Abuja, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 70 members of the Islamist extremist group Boko Haram have been killed during a Nigerian military operation in the northeastern state of Borno, an Army spokesman told CNN on Friday. The military ""remains on the offensive,"" according to Brig. Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, who said the operation started Thursday and continued into the next day. Who are the world's 10 most dangerous terrorists? This wasn't the only clash between Boko Haram and Nigerian troops of late. Suspected members of the extremist group around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday (12:30 p.m. ET) attacked a military checkpoint in Damaturu, Nigeria's Joint Task Force reported in a statement. Also in northern Nigeria, Damaturu is the capital of Yobe state. Special operations troops responded, waging ""a fierce encounter with the terrorists in various parts of Damaturu ... for several hours,"" according to the Joint Task Force. By the time that fighting was over, 21 suspected Boko Haram fighters were dead, the government group reported. Three vehicles were recovered, as were assault rifles, a rocket-propelled grenade, improvised explosive devices and 709 rounds of ammunition. The military did not provide any information on its casualties. ""Law abiding citizens are enjoined to remain calm as the 3 Division Special Operation Battalion is on top of the situation,"" the Joint Task Force said, noting a 24-hour curfew was imposed throughout the state. ""Any credible information should be passed promptly to security agencies for necessary action."" Last May, President Goodluck Jonathan put three states in the region under a state of emergency, giving Nigerian forces wide latitude in fighting the group, which human rights organizations say has killed more than 3,000 people since 2009. Boko Haram, which means ""Western education is sacrilege"" in the Hausa-Fulani language, seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law across northeastern Nigeria, if not the entire country. The group has attacked various targets in the West African nation since its formation in the late 1990s, according to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, including killing and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches. Hundreds of its members, including its leader Mohammed Yusuf, died in July 2009 clashes with government forces. But the group did not stay down for long, and has remained an active and violent force in Nigeria. In August, its militants allegedly went into a mosque in Borno state and killed 44 worshipers. The group released a video boasting that it was growing stronger. Opinion: Should U.S. fear Boko Haram? CNN's Vlad Duthiers reported from Nigeria, CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- A 130-year-old photo, billed as the only authenticated picture of legendary outlaw Billy the Kid, sold for $2.3 million at a Denver auction Saturday night. The Kid reportedly paid 25 cents to have the photo taken in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The Old West Show & Auction had estimated the tintype -- an early photographic technique that used metal plates -- to bring in between $300,000 and $400,000. ""When the bidding ended, the whole room erupted in clapping and people leapt to their feet,"" said Melissa McCracken, spokeswoman for the auction. ""I've never experienced anything like this before."" The winning bidder was billionaire William Koch who founded Oxbow Carbon, with reported sales of $4 billion annually. Koch comes from a well-known family whose last name has made headlines in the past year for their political involvement. David Koch is William's twin. David and another brother, Charles, operate Koch Industries and are prominent conservative activists. Koch Industries is a large, privately owned conglomerate with interests ranging from petroleum to plastics to paper. The Denver auction started with five bidders. Within two minutes, the bids shot up to a million dollars. ""The bidding was absolutely crazy,"" McCracken said. The outlaw was born Henry McCarty but was also known as William H. Bonney and Henry Antrim. Popular history has him gunning down 21 men, but many historians say the number was closer to nine. He later died at the hands of another sheriff when he was only 21. The annual auction is known for its collection of Wild West memorabilia. Last year, it auctioned off the gun collection of Roy Rogers, ""the King of the Cowboys"" who appeared in more than 100 movies.","The winning bidder is billionaire William Koch .

"(CNN) -- ""Rising Star,"" ABC's new singing competition, hasn't exactly risen to the top. The series made its debut on Sunday with Josh Groban as the host and Ludacris, Kesha and Brad Paisley as the celebrity experts. To set itself apart from the numerous other singing competitions, ""Rising Star"" hangs its hat on its ""revolutionary"" voting method: instead of waiting until after the show is over or leaning heavily on the outlook of the judges, ""Rising Star's"" viewers can vote for contestants in real time through an app. If a contender gets a 70% approval (and the celebrity experts each have 7% of the vote), they're cleared to stick around. During Sunday's two-hour premiere, the format seemed to work well enough, except for those who had the misfortune of living on the West Coast and thus were only able to vote for contestants that didn't get enough votes from the East Coast to move on. The real glitch, according to critics, was the lackluster talent all around -- the celebrity experts lacked chemistry and the hopeful winners weren't that impressive. Variety found it to be ""generic, inept and occasionally offensive,"" not to mention ""the definition of trainwreck television."" Entertainment Weekly called it ""a joyless experiment in reality innovation"" that's saddled with a trio of celebrity experts who show ""little to no real enthusiasm for the program"" and a contestant lineup that shows little ""promise for giving 'Rising Star' a coveted slot on your Sunday night DVR."" Billboard magazine was more engrossed, falling for the opportunity to ""hold a person's fate in the music industry in my very hands (and) ... also potentially get my Facebook profile picture that I haven't changed in three years on a giant televised wall."" Yet while the voting and interactive aspect worked ""shockingly well,"" ""it's still a singing show, and that's where ABC should focus,"" Billboard critiqued, ""possibly by cutting the live pre-stage interviews and predicting a little more accurately who the at-home audience will respond to well. We really just want to see some good singers and have sole control of their fate, as promised."" Judging from the premiere ratings, ABC has room to grow with ""Rising Star."" The competition's first episode was watched by 5.1 million viewers and achieved a 1.5 rating in the desired adult demo of 18-49. At the very least, that does make ""Rising Star"" ABC's highest-rated summer debut in two years.","New singing competition ""Rising Star"" debuted Sunday on ABC .

"(CNN) -- Aquatic ""dead zones"" are a tragic illustration of human beings' negative impact on the world's oceans. They are areas so overloaded with pollutants that they have difficulty sustaining any life. The flow of fertilizers, sewage and industrial pollutants into rivers and seas has overloaded some coastal marine areas with nutrient waste such as nitrogen and phosphorus. This stimulates excessive growth of plants and algae, which use up oxygen dissolved in the water and kill off other marine life that depend on it. Globally, their numbers are increasing, with more than 530 aquatic dead zones around the world, encompassing more than 95,000 square miles, according to the World Resources Institute (WRI). Some scientists believe climate change may also be making the situation worse. But help may be at hand thanks to the development of a number of technological solutions that aim to bring the dead zones back to life. Scientists in Sweden are testing an idea to pump oxygen into the Baltic Sea -- which separates Scandinavia from mainland Europe and is the world's largest man-made dead zone -- in an attempt to revive its dying ecosystem. The Baltic region has suffered badly over the past 60 years from a rising flow of human and industrial waste. What's more, because the Baltic Sea is largely enclosed, such harmful pollutants take longer to be washed out than in open waters. ""As with all marine issues you do not see what is down there and sea bottoms are mostly neglected because in general people think there is no life,"" said Inger Naslund, from environmental group WWF Sweden. ""The effects of human behavior is many times reflected at the sea bottom and should be discussed with a louder voice."" Attempts to reduce the waste being dumped into the Baltic have so far failed to stop the growth of the dead zone, now equivalent to around one and half times the size of Denmark. The lack of progress has led a number of Baltic countries to consider technological interventions, or so-called ""geoengineering"" ideas (large-scale solutions to environmental problems), such as pumping oxygen into the water, and using chemicals to bind pollutants in sediments, in a bid to save the Baltic. The Swedish government is funding research into the feasibility of using a wind-turbine driven oxygen pump in the Baltic, following studies carried out last year by the University of Gothenburg, which looked at the effect of pumping oxygen-rich surface water to the bottom of two Swedish fjords. ""Today everyone is focused on reducing nutrient inputs to the sea in order to reduce eutrophication (the effect of excessive nutrients) in the Baltic, but by helping nature itself to deal with the phosphorus that is discharged we can create a turbo effect in the battle against eutrophication,"" said Anders Stigebrandt, of the University of Gothenburg's Department of Earth Sciences. See also: Floating turbine buoys offshore wind potential . If implemented, the Baltic Deepwater Oxygenation (Box) project would require around 100 pumping stations built around the Baltic Sea to transport oxygen deep underwater to counteract the declining amounts of oxygen and prevent the growth of the dead zone. However, not everyone is convinced by the geoengineering ideas. Professor Daniel Conley from Lund University in Sweden, says they are ""dangerous quick-fixes,"" which could have a number of ""unforeseen"" consequences and allow countries to ignore their obligations for reducing the waste they dump in the Baltic. ""It could completely change the ecology of the Sea,"" he said, adding that the oxygen-pumping plan could interfere with the reproductive successes of some fish species and cause the release of old contaminants buried underground. Conversely, it could also raise water temperatures and stimulate higher algae growth. Scientists in Sweden are also testing the use of a chloride, used in treating drinking water, to try to bind phosphorus pollutants in sediments. But writing in science journal Nature, Conley was also skeptical of the idea of using chemicals to bind pollutants. Conley says it is not yet known how long the pollutants can remain buried within sediments or whether it would even be legal to add large quantities of chemicals to the Baltic Sea. Environmental groups within the Baltic region support the research into geoengineering projects but are doubtful it can be scaled up. ""Maybe these geoengineering ideas can work in a small inlet or lake but it would cost far too much to be a solution for the whole of the Baltic Sea,"" said Naslund. See also: Australia to create marine parks . Baltic environmental group the Estonian Fund for Nature (ELF) says it does not rule out supporting geoengineering ideas like the oxygen-pumping plan but would wait to see a proper ecosystem report of any potential risks. Conley says any geoengineering idea was likely to cost millions, and in the case of oxygen-pumping, would have to continue for several decades. Such a large amount of time and money, he believes, would be better directed at reducing land-based sources of nutrients rather than at expensive and potentially harmful schemes to engineer a solution. ""The Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP), signed by all the nations surrounding the Baltic, sets targets for reducing nutrient waste levels. Sweden is now saying it wants to use geoengineering to help meet its targets. It's a politically quick solution to a very difficult problem,"" said Conley. ""These (oxygen pumping) plans are not solving the problem unless you reduce the nutrient waste being dumped in the Sea in the first place.""","""Dead zones"" lack enough oxygen to support marine life .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Tensions in Ukraine escalated sharply Thursday, with Russia embarking on new military drills near the border after Ukrainian forces said they killed five pro-Russian militants. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said Ukrainian forces killed the militants during operations to take down pro-Russian activists' roadblocks around the southeastern city of Slavyansk. The Russian response was swift. Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""if the Kiev regime has started to use the army against the population inside the country, it, beyond any doubt, is a very serious crime."" There would be ""consequences"" for those making the decisions and for relations between his and Ukraine's governments, Putin said at a media forum Thursday, according to state TV channel Russia 24. Shortly afterward, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia would conduct military drills in response, reported Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. ""We are forced to react to such a development in the situation,"" Shoigu is quoted as saying. ""Starting today, exercises of battalion tactical groups from the Southern and Western military districts will begin near the borders with Ukraine."" Ukraine issued a 48-hour deadline for Russia to explain its military drills, the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Thursday. The ministry did not say what Ukraine would do if Russia does not comply. Ukrainian acting President Oleksandr Turchynov had strong words for Moscow, accusing it of ""openly threatening"" his country with its troop buildup on Ukraine's eastern border. Kiev's security operation is intended to protect peaceful citizens, he said, but in response Russia ""coordinates and openly supports terrorist killers with weapons in their hands"" in eastern Ukraine. ""With no reason to do so, the Russian leadership allows itself to boldly interfere in the internal affairs of Ukraine,"" Turchynov said. ""Russia supports terrorism in our country at the state level."" Top U.S. officials -- including President Barack Obama -- on Thursday vowed more punitive international actions targeting Russia's economy if Moscow, in their view, continues to escalate rather than de-escalate the situation. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russia's actions ""a full-throated effort to actively sabotage the democratic process through gross external intimidation."" ""If Russia continues in this direction,"" he added, ""it will not just be a grave mistake, it will be an expensive mistake."" According to senior U.S. officials, additional U.S. sanctions against Russia could come as early as Friday. Among the targets for the new sanctions are key Putin allies, high-profile Russian oligarchs and possibly Russian institutions and companies, the officials told CNN. The new sanctions ""will be an escalation,"" said one U.S. official. More violence in eastern Ukraine . Fresh clashes Thursday only underscored the volatility of the situation, especially with a reported 40,000 Russian troops positioned near the Ukraine border. That includes the killing of the five pro-Russian militants and the destruction of three checkpoints around Slavyansk, according to the government in Kiev. A police officer was also injured, the Interior Ministry said. Meanwhile, Stella Horosheva -- a spokeswoman for the self-appointed pro-Russian mayor of Slavyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov -- said an attack at an impromptu roadway checkpoint outside the city took the life of one pro-Russian militiaman and wounded another. The pro-Russian unit at the checkpoint told CNN that armored vehicles came to the roadblock but didn't fire, with locals setting fire to tires to prevent them from passing. The unit said a sniper killed one member of the ""self-defense"" group and injured another on their way home from an overnight stint at the barricade. Ponomaryov, visiting the site, also said a sniper killed one of the pro-Russian activists. The government accused Ponomaryov of threatening to kill anyone possessing a leaflet that the Interior Ministry says asks people ""to keep the peace, ... not obey illegal orders"" and stay inside. CNN hasn't independently confirmed reports of threats against Slavyansk residents. Slavyansk isn't the only city in the eastern Donetsk region -- where some have tried to declare independence from Ukraine -- on edge. Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov accused roughly 70 attackers of trying to take weapons from a Ukrainians military unit in the town of Artemivsk. Security forces fended off the attack. There was also unrest in the eastern city of Mariupol. Turchynov announced pro-Russian protesters had been pushed out of its city hall. But one of those demonstrators, Irina Voropayeva, claimed that an assault on City Hall by what she said were extreme-right Ukrainians failed. Ukraine's Interior Ministry later stated about 30 people armed with baseball bats entered the building early Thursday demanding the occupiers. As the two groups clashed -- leaving five injured -- police tried to separate them. Five people were injured. Obama: U.S. 'teed up' to impose more sanctions . This kind of violence isn't what optimists expected over a week ago, after the United States, Russia, the European Union and Ukraine agreed to a deal that, among other things, called for illegal groups to disarm and vacate occupied buildings in return for amnesty. The situation has only deteriorated since then, as has the war of words. Speaking in Tokyo, U.S. President Barack Obama again ruled out any military solution in Ukraine but warned that the United States is ""teed up"" to impose further sanctions on Russia if it does not abide by the April 17 deal. ""There was some possibility that Russia could take the wiser course after the meetings in Geneva,"" he said. ""Instead, we continue to see militias and armed men taking over buildings, harassing folks who are disagreeing with them, and destabilizing the region, and we haven't seen Russia step up and discourage that."" Kerry sounded off against Russia later Thursday, reeling off what he called positive efforts by Ukraine's government to implement the Geneva deal while rapping Moscow for having ""refused to take a single concrete step in the right direction."" He pointed to ""peaceful protesters ... armed with grenade launchers and automatic weapons,"" self-defense group members wearing ""brand new matching military uniforms and speaking in dialects that every local knows comes from thousands of miles away"" and the reported arrests of Russian intelligence operatives in Ukraine."" Through its actions and ""propaganda,"" Moscow has attempted to undermine ""a legitimate political process with the barrel of a gun and the force of a mob that couldn't be achieved any other way,"" said Kerry. ""It is clear that only one side, one country, is keeping its word,"" he said. ""... The world, sadly, has rightly judged that Russia has put its faith in distraction, deception and destabilization."" But Russia sees things differently, saying that according to the international deal, Kiev must take responsibility for disarming the right-wing ultranationalists that Moscow blames for violence. ""We don't have any doubts that the first step must be done by the Kiev authorities,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a news conference. He accused the West of treating leaders in Kiev like ""angels"" while blaming Russia for the unrest. Putin, speaking on Russia 24, said the events unfolding in eastern Ukraine demonstrate that Moscow's decision to support the Crimean people, who voted to join Russia last month in a referendum condemned by the West, was right. ""Otherwise they would have witnessed the same events as eastern Ukraine and surely even worse,"" he said. ""So, this is another proof that we have acted correctly and on time.""

"(CNN) -- After my 7-year-old daughter's sleepover and a few hours before my 9-year-old son's play date, and just in the middle of quieting my daughter's whining about her impending piano lesson last Saturday morning, I stumbled upon ""Why Chinese Moms are Superior,"" Amy Chua's Wall Street Journal article that's created a firestorm. The article was excerpted from her new book, ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother."" Watch Amy Chua defend her methods of parenting . Chua, a second generation Chinese American, mother of two and Yale Law School professor, argues that Chinese moms churn out whip-smart kids precisely because they don't allow childhood frivolity like sleepovers or play dates, along with just about everything else that is social, fun or distracting, including TV, video games, sleepaway camp and auditioning for the school play. They also insist that their children master the violin or piano -- but only those two instruments -- be the top student in every subject with the exception of gym or drama, and receive no grade below an A. Let's be honest, Western Moms would also relish these dazzling results -- valedictorian and violin virtuosity -- but can't imagine themselves, or their kids, committing to the rigid Chinese Mom-style method to guarantee perfection.  But more importantly, Western Moms, and in particular working moms, just don't have the time, energy, or well, discipline. The ""Chinese Mom"" theory is that nothing is fun until you're good at it. And to get good at anything, you have to work hard.  ""On their own,"" Chua writes, ""Children never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences."" This is where Western parents fail, she says, by letting our kids give up too quickly. We simply don't have the fortitude or patience to push through our children's resistance. Maybe modern day parenting in America has become too permissive.  Maybe we've gotten too soft.  We coddle and cajole our children as we gently nudge them passive aggressively to do their chores and their homework. ""Will you please put your clothes away?"" ""Let's study for your spelling test now, OK?"" ""Sweetie, can you please turn off the TV and do your 15 minutes of assigned homework reading?"" Seriously, 15 minutes.  Even that's positioned as a question, not a demand. Go to any school today with a ""progressive"" philosophy and administrators proudly espouse the virtues of addressing the ""whole child"" and creating an independent, creative, empathetic individual. These are the buzz words that resonate with Western parents. It's true, we want happy, well adjusted, well rounded children who will contribute to society. We also buy into the theory that creativity, critical thinking and social skills are essential for future success. Yes, our kids need to excel at algebra, but we want them to not only learn, but to also enjoy learning in a stimulating environment where they can thrive in their own uniqueness.  Rote learning is out; individual exploration is in. Chua condemns these methods as Western foolishness. Drill and kill, practice until perfect -- this is the Chinese Mom way. ""Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America,"" Chua writes. But in our Western style of enjoying and embracing, where children always expect warm fuzzies and trophies, even if they actually stink, have we become parental enablers to laziness and mediocrity? The Western touchy-feely approach runs counter to the Chinese Mom philosophy.  Chua claims that heaping shame and ridicule on her children drives them to success.  In her world, insults motivate. Praise only comes with perfection. Weak discipline creates failure. ""You are garbage!""  Chua once screamed at her daughter Sophia. For Chinese moms, a less-than-perfect child is a disgrace to the family, a slap-in-the-face to the parents -- utter shame.  After all, Chinese moms are in the trenches, toiling for hours to ensure excellence -- anything short becomes almost pathologically personal. Western moms just don't get this.  Maybe it's because we are not as wholly entrenched.  How can we be?  We simply don't have time.  Do we want our children to succeed academically? Absolutely.  Do we encourage musical competence?  Sure. But the Western moms I know, particularly working mothers, have neither the desire nor time to run such an extreme household. After a day at the office, the last thing a working mom wants to do is come home and turn into the drill sergeant.  Getting kids to do their homework is challenging enough, but tacking on extra hours of mom-generated exercises?  Not happening. So this is why we outsource.  It's more practical and better for everyone to have our kids tutored by anyone but us: college students, teachers, or even folks at any of the multitude of educational centers that have sprouted across the country.  We're not lazy; we're just exhausted.  And during the time we do have to spend at home with our kids, we'd rather not battle. There are also soccer and baseball games to get to. I think Western moms are a little envious of at least part of the Chinese mom method. The academic excellence and tightly wound discipline and parental respect are breathtaking, if not a little frightening. But what is the end game?  Your child prodigy performing at Carnegie Hall at age 14 as Amy Chua's daughter did?  Maybe that was worth missing all of the sleepovers and play dates and summer camp, but then again, maybe not.","Mom Wendy Sachs reacts to Amy Chua's editorial on superiority of Chinese moms .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Shazadi, a mother of six, scrubs her thin steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as she can. The only way she gets water is by filling up heavy buckets from a neighborhood spigot and lugging them home. But once she gets it home she worries whether it is even safe to drink. ""We get sick two to three times per month,"" Shazadi said. ""I cannot afford bottled water."" Her seven-year-old daughter, Moazmin, smiles and waves at us. She wants to play but isn't feeling good. ""My stomach aches and gurgles,"" she said, before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital. She made clear she was not fond of the injection she is often given there. There are about 100,000 people living in this neighborhood on New Delhi's outskirts. None of them has ever had water piped into their homes. Instead the government turns on one tap three times a day. This is how the vast majority of the neighborhood gets access to water. People line up to fill their bottles and buckets, and children take showers under the flowing water. The tap juts out inches from a drain littered with garbage and sewage and clumps of bright green algae. There are a few people in the area who have installed ground water pumps, but these are illegal. Some others get their drinking water from Prakash Sahoo. He has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses. He rides his bicycle around the neighborhood every day in the baking hot sun, making five or six trips to fill a large water container strapped to the back of his bike. He is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries. ""There is no sanitation here, just so many complaints. So I thought: 'Let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people, in order to help them and make some money',"" Sahoo said. He charges 10 rupees -- about 18 cents -- per container, a price business owners but few others can afford to pay, as most in the neighborhood make less than $2 a day. Getting clean water to drink is a struggle every day of their lives. India's government has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses. The country has 18 percent of the world's population but only 4 percent of the world's renewable water sources. And demand is growing. At the same time major problems with leaks and pollution strip away the supply further. T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, an official with India's department of drinking water and sanitation, said rural India has a whole range of issues depleting its water. ""Because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water, ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation, by farmers and by industries, we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water,"" he told CNN. ""And as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants. It may be arsenic. It may be fluoride. Now we are finding nitrate, iron, and salinity. Uranium is also involved in some places."" India has put in place a national river conservation plan aimed at pollution abatement in its rivers. That plan includes interception, diversion and treatment of sewage, low-cost sanitation works on riverbanks, and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals. Authorities admit India is facing what they call ""water stress"" because of urbanization, industrialization and rising population. According to the 2011 census, the nation's per capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters, down from 1,816 cubic meters in the 2001 population count. This year an acute water shortage hit the capital, New Delhi. The city relies on other states for much of its water supply but has found itself in a tug of war to get it because other states are dealing with shortages too.

"(CNN) -- Forecasting future technology has never been easy. In the 1950s, scientists and technologists envisaged that by now the world would be free from disease, traversed by flying cars, and fueled by minerals from distant planets. Such visions, of course, have not come to pass. But then again, as recently as 10 years ago, few would have envisaged that 3D-printed food, bionic body parts and invisibility cloaks were just around the corner. So, in what areas will the next major breakthroughs occur? Keeping in mind that prediction is more of an art than a science, CNN spoke to a host of design and technology experts -- from academics to magazine editors -- in search of what might well just be the shape of things to come. The Editor . According to Marcus Fairs, editor-in-chief of influential design magazine Dezeen, the most high-impact developments over the next decade will be primarily in the areas of manufacturing and wearable technology. ""New digital design tech, 3D printing, robotics and the emerging field of 3D scanning, plus exponential leaps in manufacturing -- together, they are putting really powerful tools into the hands of individuals,"" he says. ""In the same way that laptops revolutionized personal computing two decades ago and cheap video editing software did for film, so too there will now be a revolution in manufacturing."" For Fairs, wearable technologies such as Google Glass point to another major evolution in design: the disappearance of objects altogether. ""The broader movement in design no longer asks 'is something a nice object?' but rather 'how can we get rid of this completely?'"" From wearable devices such as those being pioneered by sportswear manufacturer Nike, and Jawbone to digital tattoos and ""things that you can swallow that will check you out from inside, (such as) a project that adds an artificial organ to help the body use water more sparingly"", Fairs believes the future could well be defined by objects almost disappearing entirely. The Curator . Deyan Sudjic, the director of the Design Museum in London, controversially selected a simple website as the winning entry in the 2013 design awards. The government site GOV.UK won, he said, because of its dramatic subjugation of form beneath function: ""The overall winner this year is very interesting. It is apparently very simple, but it works beautifully. I think there is nothing more irritating than design that doesn't work."" For Sudjic, the future of design is about how well an object fulfills its function, not just its aesthetic qualities. At the same time, Sudjic believes there is a revival of interest in physical objects, noting that 2012 was the first year in two decades that saw a rise in vinyl record sales. ""I see design trying to get to grips with both the longing people have for the physical world and those other more slippery digital developments. People are still interested in tangible experience (...) You see that with the Makerbot, which is currently just making combs and shoehorns, but will soon be creating objects which are significantly more complicated."" The Designer . Ross Lovegrove, an industrial designer whose work covers aviation, transport, timepieces, consumer electronics and everything in between, says that the future of technology requires complete understanding of material structure: . ""You have to understand materials at a deep scientific or nano level. Once you get to that level and understand ... you can reconstitute anything."" Lovegrove points to the Nike Flyknits -- an ultralight shoe with a knitted construction -- as an example of how future design will draw heavily on the latest thinking in science, health and manufacturing. ""The way they are industrialized, the way they are woven. They put strength and structure where it is required. There are no aglets so they only need to be constructed with one material. They are so lightweight you hardly feel them. They promote ergonomic health in the way they adjust posture."" The Academic . Professor Miles Pennington, Head of the Innovation Design Engineering programme at the Royal College of Art in London, thinks we are on the brink of huge technological change. ""Some people believe that there are no big leaps to come, but then people said in the 18th century that man could never travel more than 40 miles per-hour."" Pennington predicts that the next decades will bear witness to significant change. ""We are within 20 years of developing an artificial brain capable of matching our own ... Material developments in the nanotech field are starting to bear fruit ... (and so is) the field of synthetic biology, which can produce artificial muscle."" Is it possible to distinguish genuine technological contenders, from those that will only ever be the realm of science fiction? Perhaps not. But Pennington suggests he will be able to ""answer that question in 50 years' time, when I have got my feet up, sipping a cup of my GM tea grown in the Antarctic, in front of a fire powered by synthetic bacteria and hovering on a comfort-pad-chair using reverse-magnetic forces whilst reading a copy of Isaac Asimov's latest novel (written by a quantum computer-cloned version of the man himself)."" In the meantime, he suggests we all sit back and enjoy the ride.","CNN spoke to a host of design and technology experts to see what future holds .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware man who spent more than 20 years on death row saw his murder conviction and death sentence reversed by the state Supreme Court Monday, according to court documents. Jermaine Wright, 41, was sentenced to death for the 1991 murder of liquor store clerk Phillip Seifert. State Supreme Court justices ruled that prosecutors withheld critical and potentially exculpatory information during the 1992 trial that violated his right to due process, entitling Wright to a retrial. The suppression of such information ""creates a reasonable probability that the verdict would have been different if the exculpatory and impeachment evidence had been disclosed,"" wrote Justice Henry Ridgely in the decision. ""Accordingly, we must reverse Wright's conviction and death sentence and remand for a new trial."" Seifert was fatally shot while working at the Hi-Way Inn, a tavern and liquor store located on Governor Printz Boulevard near Wilmington, the evening of January 14, 1991. A co-worker and customer witnessed two men entering and leaving the liquor store at the time and found Seifert slumped over the counter in a pool of blood. Wright was arrested and interrogated after police received an anonymous tip that appeared to indicate that Wright was involved in the killing, court documents said. Four of Wright's friends testified that Wright had spent the evening of the crime with them, and eyewitnesses were unable to recognize Wright as one of the men they saw enter the liquor store, but a jury still convicted the then-18-year-old defendant of first degree murder, first degree robbery, and related weapons charges. The conviction was based largely on a videotaped confession given by Wright and the testimony of a surprise witness and fellow prisoner who said that Wright admitted to him that he shot Seifert, court documents said. This is not the first reversal Wright's case has seen. In 2012, the Delaware Superior Court vacated Wright's conviction and sentence because it had ""no confidence in the outcome of the trial."" The Superior Court found that prosecutors failed to disclose information about a similar attempted robbery at a nearby liquor store less than an hour before the Hi-Way Inn robbery by suspects matching the description given by eyewitnesses. A similar weapon was also used at both locations. Additionally, it was discovered that Wright was not properly read his Miranda rights at the time of his arrest, according to the Superior Court decision. But the Supreme Court reversed that opinion and reinstated Wright's conviction and death sentence on the grounds that the information about the other robbery would not have affected the outcome given Wright's videotaped confession, court documents said. After the 2012 reinstatement of his conviction and death sentence, Wright's attorneys argued that prosecutors withheld additional critical information, particularly that the surprise witness who testified that Wright had confessed had a history of cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for reduced charges. Wright's attorneys argued that this information would have been helpful to the jury in determining the credibility of the witness's testimony. Additional testimony by a trial witness also was called into question, according to court documents. Wright's attorneys suggested that the witness may have actually committed the crime. Attorneys for Wright also argued that the main evidence for Wright's 1992 conviction, his video confession, was given when Wright was barely 18 years old, was severely sleep deprived and under the influence of heroin, court documents say. The Delaware Supreme Court found Monday that the cumulative effect of the suppression of the additional information was enough to vacate Wright's conviction and death sentence and demand a retrial. Herbert Mondros, one of Wright's attorneys, wrote in a statement: ""As the Court found, not a shred of forensic or eyewitness evidence ties Mr. Wright to the crime, and, in violation of Mr. Wright's constitutional rights, evidence was illegally suppressed in the case... [T]he only evidence against Mr. Wright was a false confession, a confession that was 'inaccurate,' and squarely contradicted by the facts of the case."" Wright remains held at the James T. Vaughn Correction Center in Smyrna, Delaware, according to a facility official. A date for retrial has not yet been set. CNN's request for comment from the Delaware Attorney General's office was not immediately returned. CNN's Lorenzo Ferrigno contributed to this report.","Jermaine Wright, 41, was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1992 .

"(CNN) -- Last week, President Obama traveled to a historic town in Kansas to offer a vision of a revived American middle class. Where Free Soilers and slaveholders had once done violent battle, where Teddy Roosevelt called for a ""New Nationalism,"" Barack Obama presented this challenge: ""(W)hat's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, secure their retirement."" This is what we all want -- Republicans as well as Democrats, liberals as well as conservatives. The issue here is bigger than just how to revive U.S. economic growth. Even during the years of economic growth from 2002 through 2007, middle-class people did not share much in the benefits of an expanding economy. It's easy to imagine that the middle class could likewise be locked out of the next economic expansion. Obama scorchingly argued that Republicans and conservatives will not deliver for the middle class. But his own program is not exactly inspiring either. The president called for higher taxes on higher earners, with the extra revenues used to increase spending on education and to invest in government infrastructure programs. But there's no reason to expect more education spending to translate into higher incomes for middle-class people. U.S. expenditure on education doubled between 1992 and 2006 without doing much for the middle class financially. What would another doubling accomplish? The U.S. already spends more on high school education than any advanced society except Switzerland and Norway, and considerably more than such egalitarian societies as Austria and Denmark. As for increasing infrastructure spending, the president is kidding himself. Smart infrastructure spending enhances productivity, which is always good. But U.S. productivity grew handsomely between 1993 and 2007. The trouble was that the benefits of that productivity increase were almost entirely captured by a hyper-affluent few. Why expect the next round of productivity increases to be shared more broadly? Realistically, the president's Kansas speech translates into a formula of higher taxes on the rich to pay for more spending on favored Democratic public-sector constituencies. But what about the much larger private-sector middle class? Does the president have anything to offer those people -- aside from the promise of a bigger government that might hire somewhat more people to enjoy the superior retirement packages offered to government workers? Short answer: No. What would a serious plan to improve middle-class incomes and opportunities look like? It would start by addressing the way in which middle-class income is drained off before it ever reaches the middle class. During the last expansion, the cost of labor to employers did rise. It's just that virtually none of that additional money flowed through to raise wages. Over this decade's expansion, the cost of employing labor rose by an average of 25%. None of this money reached employees. Every dime was intercepted by rising health care costs. For wages to rise again, health care costs must slow. We saw that happen in the 1990s: HMOs controlled health care costs, employees got raises. Health care is such an important part of the income story that you could almost stop there. Yet there's a second piece: college costs. Higher education costs have been rising more than twice as fast as inflation, faster than almost any purchase except health insurance. It was often to pay those rising costs that families accepted the home equity lines of credit and second mortgages that contributed so much to inflating the housing bubble. At the same time as reducing costs for middle-class families, actions can be taken to take to boost incomes. Over the past two decades, the U.S. has lost global market share, especially to China. One of China's most important tools has been the manipulation of its currency, which it has held artificially cheap compared with the dollar. If China tried to gain global market share by subsidizing its exports direct from the Chinese treasury, such subsidies would trigger U.S. retaliation under global trade rules. However, global trade rules do not apply to subsidies created by monetary means. Through this anomaly, the U.S. has outsourced more jobs than it would have if China's currency had moved freely, like the euro or the yen. It's time for the U.S. to reconsider its casual attitude to monetary manipulation. A more expensive yuan would slow and possibly even reverse the flow of jobs across the Pacific. If the yuan goes up, Chinese exports decline and U.S. exports rise. More work is done in the U.S., meaning more jobs, spurring a higher demand for labor and higher wages. Finally, the U.S. needs to reconsider the way it finances Medicare and the Social Security retirement system. The payroll tax has become more and more important to U.S. finances since 1980. Before the crash, payroll taxes supplied almost 40% of all federal revenues. These taxes fall heaviest on middle-income Americans. President Obama's payroll tax holiday expires at the end of this year. As we debate whether to renew the holiday, we should be debating whether we cannot finance the federal government in more creative ways, through taxes on consumption or carbon pollution, for example, rather than a tax on the first $110,000 of labor income. These are some major elements of a working program of middle-class relief. They may not do the job. But at least they start the job. The opinions expressed in this column are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Obama's Kansas speech called for middle class revival, which all parties want .

"(CNN) -- Unacceptable. Illegitimate. And against the law. That's how the Mexican government responded Sunday to new allegations of U.S. spying reported by Der Spiegel. According to the German news magazine, the National Security Agency ""systematically"" eavesdropped on the government. It hacked the public e-mail account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which was also used by Cabinet members, Der Spiegel said. The magazine quoted documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden deserves a Nobel Prize, his father says . ""This practice is unacceptable, illegitimate and against Mexican and international law,"" Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement. It added that it would push for speedy investigation. ""In a relationship between neighbors and partners, there is no room for the practices alleged to have taken place,"" the ministry said. A senior U.S. State Department official told CNN that the Mexican government reached out about the report, and that the two governments will be discussing it via diplomatic channels. The NSA said it would not ""comment publicly on every specific alleged intelligence activity, and as a matter of policy we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations. Report: U.S. intercepts French phone calls on a 'massive scale' ""As the President said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly, we've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence, so that we properly balance the legitimate security concerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy concerns that all people share,"" the agency added. In September, Mexico and Brazil summoned U.S. ambassadors after media reports that the United States had spied on their countries' presidents. A Brazilian news report described the alleged espionage, citing Glenn Greenwald, a Brazil-based journalist who similarly obtained documents from Snowden. One of the alleged NSA documents leaked to Greenwald dates from June 2012, a month before Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto was elected. In it, the candidate talks about whom he would select for his Cabinet if elected. The documents did not reference any specific communications with Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff but show the methods the NSA allegedly used to track e-mails and mobile phone communications with close advisers. ""It was very clear in the documents that they had already carried out the spying,"" Greenwald told Globo TV's Sunday night program ""Fantastico.""

"(CNN) -- Tom Wagner woke up Friday night and the plane cabin was dark. And empty. Completely empty. He looked around from his window seat near the back of the jet and wondered, ""What is going on?"" He tried the jet door. It was locked. Not knowing what else to do, he phoned his girlfriend and said, ""Debbie, you gotta call the airlines. I'm locked in the plane."" She didn't quite believe him and started laughing. ""I said I'm serious,"" Wagner explained Monday morning on CNN's ""New Day,"" chuckling about the conversation. ""She finally hung up and called the airlines."" About 30 minutes later, the door opened. Wagner, from Louisiana, was on his way to California to see his sister. The plane had a layover in Houston, Wagner said, so he took his hat off and took a nap. Apparently a very deep sleeper, he didn't wake up when the plane landed. And somehow when airline employees were doing their usual sweep of the plane, they missed him. Dozens of passengers left the plane and so did the flight crew. Wagner said he walked around the plane in the dark trying to figure out the best thing to do. He said eventually workers opened the plane doors and, startled, asked him what he was doing in there. He tried to explain calmly that he'd been left behind. After his ordeal, he's been talking about what happened. ""I talk to people, (and they say) like, man, I'd have freaked out!"" Wagner stayed in a hotel room, on the airline, before flying to California the next day. He said United gave him a $250 voucher. The flight was operated by ExpressJet, a United partner. ""ExpressJet is investigating to determine how this occurred. We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience this caused for the passenger,"" the carrier said Saturday in a written statement.

"(CNN) -- Stumped on a tough decision? New Web sites are there to help. Hunch, a site open to the public Monday, asks questions and helps people make decisions. Hunch, a site that launches for the public Monday, will consider your quandary by getting to know you, asking you a series of questions and then spitting out three decisions. Another site, Let Simon Decide, makes a similar attempt. Caterina Fake, co-founder of the photo-sharing community Flickr, says she created Hunch not because people need help with emotional decisions but because it's too tough to find smart information online. You often have to replicate someone else's research, which is a waste, she said. Tech bloggers seem to be pleased with the effort. ""For the most part, I was impressed, though it quickly became clear that Hunch isn't capable of magically making up your mind for you,"" wrote Jason Kincaid, a reporter at TechCrunch, a technology blog. He called the site ""very clean and unintimidating."" Fake spoke with CNN about decision making, her nerdy past and the power of collective knowledge. The following is an edited transcript: . CNN: Where did you get the idea for Hunch? Fake: It's a user-generated content site similar to Flickr, but the unit is not a photograph but a decision. And so it's sort of a similar thing in that way. We kind of built the system so people can contribute to it. They can ask questions on there and suggest questions. And then you sort of codify it into a decision tree. CNN: So you're answering questions about yourself? Fake: Well, there are two components. So you answer questions about yourself, and there's a little module that says things like, ""Alien abductions: real or fake?"" And what [Hunch] does is, it then puts together a profile of you, a taste profile. And then you can go into the system and ask it any question that's in the system. So it's things like, ""What HD-TV should I buy?"" or ""Where should I go to college?"" or, you know, ""Where should I eat in San Diego on a Saturday night?"" It could be just about anything. Once it kind of gets to know you, you can ask it questions, and then it gives an answer to you that it doesn't give to anyone else. CNN: What are the downsides? Fake: It depends on what the decision is. There is kind of an array of decisions that are too taste-oriented. Like, no matter how well we know you, we're not going to know that your backyard is like 25 feet by 10 feet, versus 10 feet by 10 feet [for a person looking to buy a backyard grill]. You know what I'm saying? There's no system that can get to know that. So what we try to do is narrow it down. So we ask you questions about your aesthetics or your beliefs or your politics or your demographic. CNN: What kind of decision-maker are you? Fake: It's really funny, because I think there's a mistake that's generally made with people asking about Hunch, and it's that it's solving people's emotional problems. And it's not. It's solving people's informational problems. I don't have any problems making any decisions. I've never had any problem making decisions, but when I go to Google and I'm looking for information, say, about trademarks. I have to do all this research, and somebody has already done this research. CNN: So you see Hunch as a kind of search engine, almost? Fake: No, it's not a search engine. The feel of it is nothing like a search engine. It's something new. CNN: How do you think collective knowledge online will change the way people live, or the way we interact with each other? Fake: It's like it's an amazing period in the history of the Internet just in that way. ... We know more in the collective than we do in the individual. It becomes even more amazing when you extend that out to people outside your social network. Like, I don't know anyone that has taken a yoga class in Romania. But I'm sure that if I ended up in Romania, and I wanted to sign up for a yoga class that somebody in the world would know three places to recommend me. The information is out there in a sort of disorganized fashion. ... These systems that are kind of growing up now -- and Hunch hopefully is among them -- are able to take this sort of collective knowledge and make it easy for people to use and easy for people to access. CNN: Is there anything in your background that influences your belief in this collective knowledge idea? Fake: I was a nerdy little girl. I played Dungeons and Dragons, and I had a little TRS-80 computer. It was really early on, I think it was, gosh, like 1994 when I first saw the Web, right? So I went online, and I saw these people uploading pictures of, like, their cats. And I remember there was a video cam of ... the famous coffee pot at the IBM research center that uploaded every 5 minutes to show that the coffee pot was full or empty or whatever. And so the Internet struck me as this incredible thing where anybody -- like anybody -- could publish anything, and then anybody anywhere else in the world could read it. And I never got over that. There was kind of this wonder, this sense of wonder that I had about this incredible culture of generosity on the Web -- of all these people sharing stuff with each other. I've always been so amazed by that. I love that. Like, I love that aspect of the Internet. That's the thing that always seemed like it was magic to me. CNN: What are some cool Web sites that are flying under the radar right now? Fake: Have you heard of Etsy? CNN: Yeah, is that where people buy and sell art? Fake: Yeah, it's great. I think it's gonna be like the next eBay. And I met those guys when they were really small. I've been helping those guys since it was three kids in a dorm room. I love those guys. It's one of my favorite companies. It has that same kind of ethic [as Hunch]: the power of the individual. There are like these housewives in the Midwest who had no idea they could make a living making Christmas ornaments or whatever. It's just kind of an amazing thing that can only happen on the Internet.","CNN talks with Caterina Fake, founder of a Web site that makes decisions .

"(CNN) -- The daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said Thursday that her brothers won't take King's Nobel Peace Prize and traveling Bible from her without a fight. Bernice King alleges her brothers Dexter King and Martin Luther King III want to sell the objects, and she told reporters that she won't stand by to let it happen. The slain civil rights icon's estate -- controlled by his sons -- filed a complaint in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta last week to force Bernice King to turn over the items. ""Not on my watch,"" she said at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where her father preached. And to anyone who would shake their head at yet another court battle between the King siblings, Bernice has a message: . ""I would appreciate it if you would refrain from grouping me with my brothers,"" she said. ""They are my brothers, and I do love them. But we are different people, different perspective and different positions. And that should be respected."" The complaint filed Friday says that King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but that Bernice King has ""secreted and sequestered"" the items in question. The estate wants the civil rights leader's 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and his traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term. Bernice King said Thursday that her brothers told her on January 20 that they wanted the items so they could sell them. The complaint does not mention the possibility of a sale, and CNN's attempts to contact the King brothers have been unsuccessful. ""I stand here in (my father's) stead as biological and spiritual heir to say these items should never be sold to any person ... or any institution, because they are sacred,"" she said. ""We have no right to sell our birthright, nor the birthright of (past and future) generations,"" she said. Before Obama used it during his second inauguration, the Bible was on display at The King Center in Atlanta, Bernice King told CNN Thursday. She is the center's CEO. She said she hopes to display it again, but for now is keeping it and the Nobel prize in a location she isn't disclosing. Her fight, she said, is not motivated by sibling rivalry, but by principal. And she said she hopes she and her brothers can reconcile. When a reporter asked where this would end, she answered: ""That's the same question I ask God every day."" This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy. Over the years, the siblings have sued and counter-sued one another. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use. They later agreed to a settlement and avoided a public trial. CNN's Dana Ford, Tristan Smith and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.","The civil rights leader's estate filed a complaint to force Bernice King to turn over the items .

"(CNN) -- Tuesday marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. and coalition invasion of Iraq. Ten years of conflict caused death, despair and a complete change of life for many Iraqis. Retired Army Sgt. Noah Galloway recently reflected on his time in Iraq after serving during Operation Iraqi Freedom and on what was left behind: . ""When any country invades another country there are civilians affected that aren't a part of the conflict and those are lives that need to be taken care of. We have a responsibility as humans on this planet to take care of them. Homes and lives were destroyed. I agree with a lot of Americans that we have struggles of our own in this country that need to be addressed, but even in hard times, we have a lot going for us,"" Galloway said. Now, a decade later, the casualties and hardships caused by war are still apparent among Iraqi civilians. Galloway continues, ""If we want our efforts, the lives of the soldiers given, if we want that to not have been in vain, then we have to go in after the invasion and take care of those people because this is going to affect the Iraqis as a people for decades to come."" Galloway is speaking to what he saw at the beginning of this conflict, but the needs of humanitarian aid have only grown since then. As he said, homes were destroyed and many were left with the need of extensive medical attention either from injury as a direct result of the fighting or because of the lack of proper medical care in general. One such example of the latter is Noor al-Zahra Haider, or as she's known worldwide, Baby Noor. Baby Noor was born with spina bifida, a birth defect in which the vertebrae do not form completely around the spinal cord. In 2005, a routine raid by U.S. soldiers into her home in the town of Abu Ghraib forever changed the course of her young, fragile life. It was then that Noor's grandmother boldly pleaded to the soldiers that without their help, this young child would die. Iraq newsmakers: Where are they now? The troops responded, sending word to their superiors that they needed to help this baby. And help her they did. The troops brought Noor, her father and grandmother back to Camp Liberty while planning her transport to the United States for proper care. Childspring International, an Atlanta-based Christian nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing sick children from the developing world to the United States for medical care, offered assistance in bringing Noor and her family to Atlanta for treatment at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Childsrping International also set up a fund for Baby Noor and are still taking donations through their website. There she endured several surgeries and began what would be a lifelong, uphill battle. But following threats believed to be from al Qaeda, Noor and her family were left with little choice but to return home. She is now a 7-year-old girl in a wheelchair with serious medical needs that are barely being met and at high risk of complications from a urinary tract infection that could cost Noor her life. But Noor's story is just one of many and represents the greater need for humanitarian aid to the war-ravaged region. There are organizations in Iraq meeting the needs as best as they can. One such organization is the International Medical Corps. Founded in 1984 by volunteer doctors and nurses, the International Medical Corps is a global, humanitarian, nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and relieving suffering through health care training and relief and development programs. It has been on the ground in Iraq since before the conflict began. Dr. Tariq Hasoon, national medical director for International Medical Corps Iraq, said of his involvement in this mission: ""Today, I look back at the Iraqi health system and compare it to what I knew a decade ago, and I am amazed at the progress we have made. The most remarkable advances have come in the strategy and planning and the skills of the people running the system. International Medical Corps has played a vital role in that transformation. For example, we introduced a nationwide emergency medicine strategy, which has significantly improved the survival rates of injured people in need of paramedic and emergency room care."" But Hasoon acknowledges that the work is far from complete. He said he will not rest until ""we are done with our task that began 10 years ago this week."" Another organization aiding in efforts in Iraq is the Sponsor Iraqi Children Foundation. Its work brings to light another major issue facing the country after 10 years of war: orphaned children. ""Iraq is facing an urgent humanitarian need. According to UNICEF, there are an estimated 800,000 orphans in a nation that has known 10 years of war and violence,"" said Jonathan Webb, a U.S. Army vet and chairman of the Sponsor Iraqi Children Foundation. ""Among them, there are kids who have lost parents and now work on the streets to help support themselves. We need a legacy of love for these kids who are the future of Iraq,"" said Webb. Sponsor Iraqi Children Foundation also supports a safe haven for orphans and street children which provides them with healthy food, tutoring, medical care, as well as loving and emotional support. While the official U.S. military mission in Iraq has ended, it is clear that the people of this nation are still suffering and the need for international humanitarian aid is great.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's recess appointments to a federal agency-- made without Senate confirmation-- will be reviewed by the Supreme Court, the court announced Monday. It will mark a major constitutional test of executive power. At issue is whether three people named to the National Labor Relations Board lack authority because the presidential appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a ""pro forma"" session during the 2011-12 winter holiday break. The case sets up a high-stakes Supreme Court fight between the other two branches of government. Oral arguments will be held in public session later this year or early next. Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the past have used the ""virtual Congress"" tactic to block unilateral appointments by the president when the Senate is away. A federal appeals court in January determined the NLRB ""could not lawfully act, as it did not have a quorum."" Republicans had claimed the appointments to the board created a panel that was overly pro-union, and an eventual high court ruling could invalidate hundreds of findings issued over the past two years. What the justices decide could also put in jeopardy the recess appointment of Richard Cordray, who heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a move also being challenged in a separate lawsuit. ""Allowing the president to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution's separation of powers,"" said the judges from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in their January 25 ruling. ""An interpretation of 'the recess' that permits the president to decide when the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice-and-consent requirement, giving the president free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases, whether that time be a weekend, lunch, or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction. This cannot be the law."" Justices to hear abortion-related case for review . The White House has said it believes the pending case will not affect Cordray's appointment, but did express displeasure with the appeals court's January action. ""The decision is novel and unprecedented. It contradicts 150 years of practice by Democratic and Republican administrations,"" said Jay Carney, White House press secretary. ""So we respectfully, but strongly disagree with the rulings. There have been -- according to the Congressional Research Service -- something like 280-plus intra-session recess appointments by Democratic and Republican administrations dating back to 1867. That's a long time and quite a significant precedent."" There was no immediate reaction from the White House or congressional leaders Monday to the Supreme Court's decision to intervene and offer the final legal word. Eighteen months ago, Obama had defended his moves after Senate Republicans earlier blocked giving Cordray a floor vote. ""When Congress refuses to act and as a result hurts our economy and puts people at risk, I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them,"" the president said in January 2012. ""I will not stand by while a minority in the Senate puts party ideology ahead of the people they were elected to serve."" Senate Republicans had applauded the earlier court decision. ""The D.C. Circuit Court today reaffirmed that the Constitution is not an inconvenience but the law of the land, agreeing with the owners of a family-owned business who brought the case to the court,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a written statement. Some GOP lawmakers also accused the president of flip-flopping on the issue. When he was a senator, Obama criticized then-President Bush's recess appointment of John Bolton as ambassador to the United Nations. High court poised for a week of high-stakes rulings . Cordray was named the same day as the three NLRB appointments, which gave the board a full panel for the first time in a year. Two of the members were Democrats, the other a Republican. The lawsuit was brought by Noel Canning, a family-owned Yakima, Washington, bottling company, which complained the NLRB unfairly ruled in favor of Teamsters Local 760 during contract negotiations. Company executives said the board lacked a binding quorum because the recess appointments made by Obama were not legal. ""Small-business owners throughout the country have suffered under the unabashedly pro-union decisions handed down by the NLRB,"" said Karen Harned, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business, which filed an amicus brief in the case. ""They deserve to be protected from unconstitutional acts that exacerbate the NLRB's devolution from a neutral arbiter between labor and employers to a pro-union government agency."" The issue has sharpened tensions between the White House and Congress. The nation's founders placed the power to make recess appointments in the Constitution to ensure government could operate, back when Congress did not meet year-round. Over the decades, presidents of both parties have used them for political and practical purposes. Since May 2011, Republicans have been relying on a little-known procedure to keep the chamber in session, even when it was not really conducting any business -- in order to stop the president from making those recess appointments. The legal basis comes from a 1993 Department of Justice brief saying the president should act only if the Senate is in official recess more than three days. So, party leaders had arranged for a single Republican lawmaker to show up every three days and gavel the Senate to order, wait around for a while, gavel it to a close, then leave. Legal experts have disagreed on both the tactical and timing procedures by the Senate, and whether the president has unilateral authority to override those legislative tactics. The case to be decided by the high court is Noel Canning v. NLRB (12-1115).","President Obama had appointed NLRB members during a Senate holiday break .

"(CNN)  -- ""LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean"" holds fast to the pirate code with great humor and animation, appeal for all ages and massive replayability after the main story mode is complete. The latest LEGO block video game (Disney Interactive Studios, Traveller's Tales) recounts the first three movies in the popular series and also includes the yet-to-be-released fourth film, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides."" The new movie is scheduled to debut on May 20 -- 10 days after the video game -- so you have been appropriately warned about spoilers. Each movie is broken down into five gaming levels. This outing follows the typical LEGO game style with straight platform action involving sword fights, cannons and collecting ""studs"" -- single-connection LEGO blocks. Items can be smashed into smaller LEGO block components, and then collected for points or re-formed into another item that can be used in the game. Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen. There were a few times when I couldn't see what item needed to be collected or got pushed off a narrow ledge because the five characters who were traveling with me all wanted to be in the same spot. Matt Ellison, associate producer at Traveller's Tales Games, said 70 characters can be unlocked and bought throughout the entire game. Each character has a special ability that makes it unique from others, including Captain Jack Sparrow (portrayed in the films by Johnny Depp). ""Jack's compass is really different from anything else we've done (with LEGOs),"" Ellison said. ""It will point to things Jack can find and also helps point to things to solve puzzles in the game."" Ellison said the settings are as iconic as they could be and the team tried to put the LEGO spin on the movies. Since the films' characters are so well known, he said the team wanted to make sure to include little details to help players relate to each character. For example, Captain Barbossa is often seen with an apple in his hand. And Jack's running style -- arms straight out, waving frantically -- is humorously well represented. ""A lot of time went into making sure we got Jack's running right, his character right,"" Ellison said. The game play is all about exploring the vast scenes in each level. Puzzle clues and treasure are all over the place, waiting to be discovered. ""Eight collectibles in each level and 10 ships in a bottle can be found,"" Ellison said. ""There is something always hidden to get."" While the story mode only took me about nine hours, I barely collected 40% of all the items that could be found. Using Jack's compass helps discover the missing booty, but there are also sign postings to help players find key elements in the level. Since the scenes are so big, it would be easy to get lost or frustrated without those helpers. Said Ellison: ""The exploration game play ties into the ideology of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' Plus we wanted to make a distinctive change of pace between the levels, so you are treasure hunting in one level, and then fighting foes in the next."" Even on ship levels, players will need to go up into the rigging or down into the ship's belly to find all they need to find. Ellison said each scene has to be solvable for all ages, and the game teaches you what to do and where to look as it goes along. There are lengthy story-developing ""cut scenes"" and cinematics between the levels. The humor from the movies really shines in LEGO form, which uses its blocky medium to put interesting spins on the tale. ""The humor appeals to all ages. We took the iconic movie settings and twisted them slightly to make them funnier. Plus we took the same slapstick humor from the films and just made more of it."" As I said, the fourth movie is also included, so I was worried about spoiling my future enjoyment. Ellison smiled when asked about it but assured me that no details about the story line would be ruined. ""We will have some of the same locations but none of the dialogue (LEGO characters do not speak, only grunt). We do have some of the action from the movie, but it shouldn't ruin the film for anyone,"" he said. If you remain concerned, then wait until after the movie comes out before playing the fourth level. The one drawback to the game was the two-player co-op play. As in other LEGO video games, two people in the same room can drop in and out as separate characters and solve all the puzzles. Unlike previous LEGO games, which forced the two characters to stay in the same screenshot, ""LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean"" actually splits the screen as the characters walk away from each other. However, the split in the split screen moved around in relation to where the characters were on the level. As the characters got closer to each other, the scene slowly changed back to a single screen. It was difficult to focus on what my character was doing or where it was in the split-screen action. My co-op player and I found it confusing and, at times, frustrating to figure out where we needed to go or what we needed to do unless we were on the same screen. There was never a time where a puzzle needed to be solved in split-screen mode. After a while, it just gave me a headache. While I often lamented being kept in the same screen in previous LEGO co-op versions, the split-screen action as presented is not the solution I was looking for. Once each level is completed in story mode, free play mode is unlocked, allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that couldn't be previously figured out. Those characters will also get you into previously unavailable areas. Finding all the collectibles and solving all the brain teasers will keep play going for many hours after the story mode is complete. The game is also available for the Nintendo 3DS, but there are only 16 levels, and you can use only one character during each level. Ellison said the 3DS version is tailored to the single-player experience and everything can be solved by one character. ""LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a fun spin on the blockbuster (pun intended) movies. It ramps up the humor from the films and offers plenty of action for players. Exploration is the key. Overall, the game is lots of fun despite some playability glitches. And following the adventures of Jack Sparrow ... I mean, Captain Jack Sparrow ... is worthy of any would-be pirate. ""LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean"" is now available in the U.S. and, as of Friday, in Europe. It will be released May 19 in Australia. It is available on the PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and PSP. It is rated E10+ due to cartoon violence and comic mischief. This review was done playing on the Xbox 360 in story mode, co-op mode and free play.","Game has great humor and animation, appeal for all ages, and massive replayability .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's nephew testified Thursday that he believes his uncle was murdered. T.J. Jackson, the youngest son of Jackson brother Tito, revealed his suspicion while being cross examined by an AEG Live lawyer in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial. Jurors also heard him testify about the emotional devastation caused by Michael Jackson's death. ""He was just everything,"" said T.J. Jackson, who shares guardianship of Michael Jackson's children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- with their grandmother. Michael Jackson's mother and his children contend his last concert promoter was liable for his death because it hired, retained or supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. AEG Live lawyers argue it was Jackson, not the company, who chose and controlled Dr. Murray. Their executives had no way of knowing he was giving nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to Jackson, which the coroner ruled killed the singer, the lawyers say. ""Do you believe your uncle was murdered?"" AEG Live attorney Jessica Stebbins Bina asked T.J. Jackson. ""I do,"" he answered. ""I believe it because he did tell me and the brothers that he was going to be murdered on a couple of occasions. ""He said that just because of his position he was a target."" T.J. Jackson had earlier testified that his mother, Delores Jackson, was the victim of murder 19 years ago. ""My mother was murdered for money, too, so I don't put that past anyone,"" he said. Initially it was believed that his mother, Delores Martes Jackson, who had divorced from Tito Jackson in 1993, drowned in a swimming pool, but the case was reopened, and her sons in 1995 filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against a man they accused of killing her. Three years later, the man was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. If the jury concludes AEG Live has liability in Jackson's death, then they must put a dollar figure on damages -- including the emotional toll on the children caused by the loss of their father. The oldest child, 16-year-old Prince, testified Wednesday that sister Paris, 15, ""was probably hit the hardest because she was my dad's princess."" Paris has been hospitalized since a suicide attempt earlier this month, although it is unclear whether jurors will know about it. ""The loss of my uncle has hit her at a different level and she's in a tough spot, but we're loving her and doing everything we can,"" T.J. Jackson testified Thursday . He said he was at a loss for words to describe what Paris is going through. ""It's tough, you know, it's tough."" ""She was daddy's girl,"" he said. ""My uncle was her world. My uncle gave them more love and for it to be taken away, it's been very hard for Paris, and for all of them."" Blanket, who was 7 when his father died, ""was always wrapped around his leg, very shy,"" T.J. Jackson said. ""Wherever my uncle was, Blanket was a foot away, My uncle was everything to Blanket."" ""Right now, I don't know if Blanket realizes what he lost,"" Prince said. ""He was so young. He is still growing up just like I am and he doesn't have a father to guide him."" Prince said he has ""a hard time sleeping"" since his father's death in 2009. It left him ""emotionally distant from a lot of people"" for a while, he said. He's missed sharing with his father ""the first day of going to school, having the first girlfriend, being able to drive,"" Prince testified. T.J. Jackson said Prince was Michael Jackson's ""little assistant."" ""He was very mature for his age, very smart. My uncle would prepare him for things"" by telling him about his business deals. ""He's very strong, he's very smart,"" he testified. ""He was always the smartest kid I'd ever known."" As a guardian, T.J. Jackson said he must constantly deal with paparazzi stalking the children for photographs. ""It's, just to be frank, a complete annoyance,"" he said. ""It's awful."" He suggested there should be a new law to protect celebrity children from photographers. ""I know it's making everything harder for the kids to grieve and to recover and to progress,"" he said.","NEW: ""My mother was murdered for money ... I don't put that past anyone,"" T.J.

"(CNN) -- Coming off a coup that initiated a new loop in the roller coaster of Egypt's political scene, the country's future is up in the air -- and with it, the future of the entire region. Christian Whiton, a former State Department senior adviser, calls Egypt's turmoil ""the most titanic political contest of our era."" What could lie ahead? Here, CNN experts -- some of them on the ground in Egypt -- and analysts weigh in on a handful of possibilities: . Opposition consumed by infighting . Egyptians who packed Cairo's Tahrir Square to call for the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy -- a longtime leader of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood -- had vastly different agendas. Some wanted a return to the days of ousted President Hosni Mubarak; others had supported Morsy and were disappointed by him. Going forward, don't expect the factions to work together easily, says CNN's Ian Lee, who has covered the region for years. ""Infighting is inherent in the opposition and one of the strengths of the Muslim Brotherhood is their cohesiveness. ... The opposition suffers from arrogance and ego. Each leader believes he is better than the others."" No single charismatic leader has risen to unite the opposition, Lee says. Meanwhile, the Brotherhood's unity could help it rise again. The opposition could change in time, says Whiton, as secular liberals who oppose Islamist rule come together. ""Ultimately, liberals do get organized, but it often takes time,"" he writes on CNN's GPS blog. The question is how long the country has before Egyptians take to the streets en masse rejecting the military leadership -- like what happened after Mubarak was ousted in 2011. If the military fails to draw a consensus and move the transition swiftly, it could face a revolt, says CNN producer Salma Abdelaziz in Cairo. If recent history repeats itself, the military will ""crush dissent with brute force and you have the whole fiasco all over again."" 8 issues Egypt is facing . Muslim Brotherhood pushed into 'confrontational posture' There is ""terrible tension and fear among some in Egypt today"" that the Muslim Brotherhood ""will be forced underground again and into its historic, confrontational posture with the Egyptian army,"" says Christiane Amanpour, CNN's chief international correspondent and anchor of Amanpour. The country's chief Islamist movement certainly won't 'be driven into extinction,"" says CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman, who has covered Egypt for years. ""Despite the fact that many people are fantasizing that this is the end of the Islamist movement,"" the country will continue to ""have to deal with the Brotherhood either as a political movement or underground movement,"" he says. Some Egyptians ""want to see the Brotherhood crushed,"" Wedeman says. ""It's been shoved into a corner but won't take it lying down."" That could spell armed protests by the Brotherhood and its supporters, he says. CNN's Cairo-based international correspondent Reza Sayah adds, ""Getting aggressive with the Muslim Brotherhood risks a violent backlash that could lead to further turmoil."" U.S. defers judgment on Morsy ouster . 'Last nail in the coffin' for Arab Spring . If turmoil and violence reign in Egypt, the global effects could be dramatic. ""One of the great triumphs of the Arab Spring was that it showed Islamists who were prepared to come into the political process and accept the democratic path forward rather than the violent jihadi future that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were espousing,"" Amanpour says. Morsy won a democratic election only to be deposed through non-democratic means. ""What are you going to tell Islamists: that democracy is for everybody except them?"" Amanpour asks. The coup ""could well foretell an end of the fledgling democratic experiment in the most populous Arab country which, by overthrowing its long-term dictator just a couple years ago, had inspired democracy movements around the Arab world,"" says Mohammed Ayoob of the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding, in a column for CNN. ""If the Egyptian military is allowed to get away with this unconstitutional act it may spell the end of democracy in Egypt for a long time to come;"" he says. ""It will also be the last nail in the coffin of an Arab Spring already teetering on the edge of the grave with a bloody civil war raging in Syria, brutal suppression of democracy activists in Bahrain, and near-chaos in Libya and Yemen."" Compromise, fair constitution . There is a more positive possibility if Egypt takes the right steps, experts say. ""Various political parties will need to learn to compromise,"" Lee says, and the Muslim Brotherhood needs to be engaged, not marginalized. Mohamed Kamel Amr, Egypt's acting foreign minister, told Amanpour that he has reached out to the Brotherhood to keep them in the political process. That may not be enough to quell the fury of the Muslim Brotherhood and Morsy supporters, who say that ""nothing will satisfy them short of having Morsy reinstated as president,"" Sayah says. But building a constitution in a way that shows a commitment to representing the will of the people could have a big impact, says Isobel Coleman, senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, in a CNN column. ""If Egyptians approve, through a fair and open referendum, a new constitution that reduces Islam's role, it will take the wind out of the sails not only of the Muslim Brotherhood, but of political Islam across the region."" Bread riots, water wars . Many who follow the region closely say the central question of Egypt's future is summed up by the famous Clintonian adage: ""It's the economy, stupid."" In a country grappling with poverty and unemployment, any new government that wants to maintain power needs to work quickly. If the situation worsens, ""people may rise up because the price of bread is too high and they just can't feed their families,"" Wedeman says. ""If that happens, it's utter chaos -- back to 1977 and the bread riots in Cairo. ... That's the gut worry of everyone."" Meanwhile, Egypt's quickly growing population and limited water supply ""could lead to the likelihood of water wars in the future if Nile basin countries like Ethiopia divert the flow of the Nile,"" Lee says. The country needs to restore order to the streets immediately, increasing the presence of police despite their lack of popularity, Lee says. ""It really is all about the economy and security."" Washington exerts pressure . Suspending U.S. aid ""would plunge an already bankrupt country into deeper chaos,"" Fareed Zakaria, host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" writes in a column. ""But Washington should announce that it will continue its aid for a limited period, say two months, while it determines whether the new government is in fact moving to restore genuine democracy in Egypt."" The United States should call for an end to arbitrary arrests; a constitutional process that includes ""all major voices in Egyptian life""; and elections open to all, ""including and especially the Muslim Brotherhood,"" Zakaria says. But don't expect any proactive steps from Washington, says Whiton, the former State Department adviser. The will for America and its allies to help the secularists organize, ""and the tools to do that with, both appear to be in mothballs,"" he writes, adding, ""Washington will again leave crucial matters to chance."" From hope to despair: Egypt slides into economic uncertainty, again .","Egypt's future will have a profound global impact, analysts say .
The Muslim Brotherhood won't fade out of existence, CNN experts say .
If the economy falls further, riots could follow .
Compromise and a constitution offer opportunities for stability ."
"(CNN) -- Despite a 911 operator's urgent pleas, a staffer with CPR training at an elderly living facility refused to perform the procedure on a resident who had stopped breathing. The reason for the refusal? Glenwood Gardens in Bakersfield, California, has a policy against its employees providing medical care. Lorraine Bayless, 87, died. Shocking? Does this all sound just plain wrong? Well, medical professionals, lawyers and those who work in the world of elderly independent living say it's much more complicated. While all states have so-called Good Samaritan laws aimed at protecting people against legal liability if they jump in to perform CPR on someone who needs it, few people know about the laws. And Good Samaritan laws have been fiercely challenged in courts across the country, leaving the average person unclear about just how protected they may be. ""In America where there's a lawyer behind every defibrillator, there's worry that some people have 'Am I going to get sued?'"" said Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University. Last week, shortly after Bayless' death, the family said they were satisfied with the care she received, according to KGET. ""I never said I was fine with that,"" daughter Pamela Bayless told CNN Monday before hanging up the phone. ""That was completely taken out of context, and I have no further comment."" From a ""medical ethics point of view, I think if you call 911, and 911 says, 'start CPR,' you have to do it,"" Caplan said. ""You are under an obligation to do it. You've started that process and you must follow through. ""The policy on paper may make sense,"" he said, ""but policy be damned when someone's life is at stake."" The 911 call . When Bayless collapsed in a dining room last Tuesday morning, someone at Glenwood Gardens called 911, and Bakersfield Fire Dispatcher Tracey Halvorson answered. A Glenwood Gardens employee gave the phone to a nurse who identified herself as Colleen. During the call, Halvorson tried to reason with Colleen to start CPR, and when she said her boss won't allow that, the dispatcher asked her to hand the phone to someone nearby, or anyone the nurse could flag down who was not beholden to the facility's policy. ""I understand if your boss is telling you you can't do it,"" the dispatcher said. ""But ... as a human being ... you know ... is there anybody that's willing to help this lady and not let her die?"" ""Not at this time,"" Colleen answered. In the last three minutes of the call, Halvorson said, ""OK. I don't understand why you're not willing to help this patient."" Colleen: ""I am but, I'm just saying that ..."" Dispatcher: ""OK, I'll walk you through it all. We, EMS take the liability for this, Colleen. I'm happy to help you. This is EMS protocol."" Colleen is then heard asking someone nearby to call a supervisor. ""Can you get (unintelligible) ... right away,"" Colleen said. ""I don't know where he is. But she's yelling at me and saying we have to have one of our other residents perform CPR. I'm feeling stressed and I'm not going to do that, make that call."" The nurse asked the dispatcher when the fire department would arrive. ""They're coming as quick ... they've been on the way all this time. But we can't wait. This lady is going to die,"" the dispatcher answers. Colleen replies, ""Yeah."" Glenwood Gardens' corporate owner is Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., based in Tennessee. CNN asked spokesman Matt Fontana why a nurse would be involved if the facility's policy prohibits staffers from performing medical care. ""(Colleen) was hired to be the Resident Services Director and that is the capacity in which she was serving,"" Fontana explained in an e-mail. ""Glenwood Gardens is an independent living facility which, by law, is not licensed to provide medical care to any of its residents,"" Fontana told CNN. ""We are conducting an internal review to determine all of the facts about what occurred while waiting for the paramedics, who arrived moments later,"" he wrote. ""We have communicated our deepest sympathies and condolences to this resident's family on the passing of their loved one."" Late Tuesday night, Brookdale released a statement that said it was conducting a company-wide review of its policies. ""This incident resulted from a complete misunderstanding of our practice with regards to emergency medical care for our residents,"" the statement said. 'Ethical north star' ""How could someone who is trained as a medical professional have their views so inverted by a corporate policy?"" said Dr. Joseph Fins, chief of the division of medical ethics at Weill Cornell Medical College. ""If this had happened on a city street in Manhattan, one would be governed by common morality."" The nurse at Glenwood is ""confused about where their ethical north star is,"" he said. Fins and other experts pointed to Good Samaritan laws that seek to protect well-intentioned helpers who try to save someone in danger. But there have been challenges to California's Good Samaritan law. In 2009, the state Supreme Court ruled on a case involving a woman who tried to pull a motorist from a wrecked car. The woman was accused of yanking the motorist like a ""rag doll"" and worsening the motorist's injuries. The court found that the woman was not covered under the state's Good Samaritan law, which had been in place since 1980. The law provides that ""no person who in good faith, and not for compensation, renders emergency care at the scene of an emergency shall be liable for any civil damages resulting from any act or omission."" And according to Caplan, Vermont's Good Samaritan law fines a person $100 if it's clear that they could have stepped in to perform CPR but refused. The Bakersfield Police Department told CNN that they're investigating what happened at Glenwood Gardens. Dr. Graham Nichol, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said he was shocked by what happened there. CPR doubles survival odds, he said. ""If liability was a concern,"" Nichol said. ""I would suspect there is a greater liability if someone dies."" CNN's Paul Vercammen, Miguel Marquez and Lindsey Knight contributed to this report.","Staffer at elderly living facility refuses 911 operator's request to perform CPR .

"(CNN) -- We love James Bond films for so many reasons: the handsome men and beautiful women, the cool gadgets and outrageous villains, the amazing chases and death-defying stunts. And, of course, the travel tips. Film after film, no one has given us more inspiration to travel the world than James Bond. ""We are always looking to offer the audience the 'wow' experience of something amazing and different,"" said Callum McDougall, executive producer of the upcoming ""Skyfall,"" the 23rd film in the James Bond franchise. ""I think everyone who goes to see a Bond movie expects to be impressed by the look and the locations chosen. Certainly I was when I grew up watching them, and I don't think that's changed in the last 50 years."" There are two reasons to celebrate Mr. Bond in style: Global James Bond Day was October 5, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the theatrical release of ""Dr. No,"" starring Sean Connery as Agent 007. And November 9 is the U.S. premiere of ""Skyfall,"" starring the latest Bond, Daniel Craig. In celebration of all things Bond, we give you (00)7 destinations where you can experience the world James Bond-style. Religious conversions: Renovated monastery hotels and more . Turkey . Several locations in Turkey are featured in ""Skyfall."" ""It is where East meets West, and the colors and vibrancy of Istanbul provided us with a great backdrop and such amazing locations as the Grand Bazaar,"" McDougall said. Istanbul's Grand Bazaar has been a must-see since 1461. More than 550 years later, it attracts nearly a half-million visitors daily. Presumably few of them other than ""Skyfall"" director Sam Mendes envision its narrow, crowded aisles as a location for a high-speed chase. It is, however, an excellent place to purchase local handicrafts and to engage all your senses as you immerse yourself in the city. Railway scenes for ""Skyfall"" were shot on and around Adana's dizzying Varda Railway Bridge in southern Turkey, and beach scenes -- including one that was meant to be in the Far East -- were shot near Fethiye on the Mediterranean coast. ""Turkey actually allowed us to combine our needs of four different looks in one country, quite remarkable,"" McDougall added. 7 ways to go local while traveling . Key West, Florida .

Other scenes shot in the area include a car chase on Seven Mile Bridge, the segmented concrete (to make it hurricane-resistant) span you'll cross if you're driving to Key West, and a scene at the Ernest Hemingway Home in which M (Robert Brown) demands that Bond relinquish his ""license to kill."" Hemingway, also no slouch in the adventure department, moved to the 907 Whitehead St. house in 1931. A guided tour shows you his writing studio and introduces you to the descendants of Hemingway's famous six-toed cats, who have unlimited license to roam the house and grounds. The Bahamas . Of Bond's many visits to the Bahamas, the most memorable is Sean Connery's 1965 ""Thunderball"" battle in the underwater caves of the Exuma Cays. They've been known ever since as the Thunderball Grotto. (Connery returned there in 1983 for ""Never Say Never Again."") Several charter companies, including Four C's Adventures and the Island Routes 007 Thunderball Luxury Tour, will take you out to the grotto by boat and guide you on a snorkeling route to the inside of the caves, where light seems to stream in directly from heaven and colorful fish dart about below the water's surface. Some tours also include a visit to the nearby Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park and a stop at the Staniel Cay Yacht Club, where you can dine or spend the night. Paris . With an ""I'm too old for this stuff"" look on his face, Roger Moore as Bond chased Grace Jones as May Day up the steps of the Eiffel Tower in ""A View to a Kill"" (1985), only to watch her parachute off the top in one of the film's more memorable scenes. (It was almost as unforgettable as Duran Duran's video for the film's theme song.) On a tour of the tower, you'll learn about Franz Reichfelt's tragic demonstration of his ""parachute suit"" in 1912, which should convince you that parachuting is not the thing to do here. However, if you're feeling fit, you can climb the 704 steps from the ground to the second floor. From there, you can catch the lift to the top, where you'll find a Champagne bar with killer views of its own. Schilthorn, Switzerland . ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969) took us to the mountaintop: the 2,970-meter-high Schilthorn in Switzerland's Bernese Alps, which George Lazenby as Bond skied down at breathtaking speed, with Telly Savalas as Blofeld in pursuit. It's one of the great movie ski chase scenes, now documented in an exhibit at Piz Gloria, the world's first revolving restaurant, which doubled as the Bleuchamp Institute for Allergy Research in the film. Organized Bond-themed excursions that include a James Bond breakfast at Piz Gloria start from the car-free town of MÃ¼rren, or you can glide up the mountain yourself on a 32-minute aerial cable car trip that originates in Stechelberg. For more Bond-style adventure, ski the mountain's 15.8 km mixed-terrain Inferno course. Experienced skiers usually cover it in about 45 minutes; competitors in the annual Inferno Race -- the largest amateur ski race in the world -- can do it in 15. Bregenz, Austria . The James Bond producers were so impressed by the 2007 production of Tosca at the open-air SeebÃ¼hne floating stage on Lake Constance (or Bodensee), they knew they had to work it into a film. That's why in ""Quantum of Solace"" (2008), Daniel Craig finds himself chasing bad guys under the startling open-eye backdrop of the ""Tosca"" set designed by Johannes Leiacker. The annual Bregenz Festival, approaching its 67th season, are only slightly less exciting. The next Opera on the Lake will be Mozart's ""The Magic Flute,"" which opens July 17 and runs through the summer. Bregenz itself, in western Austria, is known for its contemporary architecture, such as the Festival House concert hall adjacent to the floating stage. Guided tours of both are conducted year-round. Auyuittuq National Park, Canada . ""Nobody Does it Better"" than the opening sequence of ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" (1977), in which Roger Moore BASE jumps off the edge of a mountain and ... whoosh! A Union Jack parachute opens and wafts him to safety. ""No effects, all done in camera for real,"" McDougall points out. (BASE is an acronym for Buildings, Antennas, Spans and Earth, the four things you can jump from.) The mountain, with its distinctive twin flat-topped peaks at 6,598 feet, is Mount Asgard in Auyuittuq National Park on Baffin Island, Canada. Serious outdoors people find the 7,370-square-mile arctic park a haven of pristine beauty offering 24-hour daylight in summer. Accessible via the Inuit hamlets of Pangnirtung and Qikiqtarjuaq, which can be reached only by small plane, the park requires that all visitors attend a safety orientation before they embark on their travels. For this level of adventure, only experienced wilderness travelers -- and MI-6 agents -- need apply.","No film series has provided more travel inspiration than James Bond .

"(CNN) -- Guus Hiddink will replace Louis van Gaal as coach of the Dutch national team after this summer's World Cup finals in Brazil. The Dutch football association (KNVB) confirmed Hiddink's appointment will run to the end of Euro 2016, when assistant coach Danny Blind will take control and lead the bid for qualification to the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Former PSV, Manchester United and Real Madrid striker, Ruud van Nistelrooy will also join the coaching set-up as an assistant. Hiddink was previously Dutch national coach between 1995 and 1998, leading the 'Oranje' to the World Cup semifinals in France where it was defeated by Brazil on penalties. Van Gaal revealed last year that he would not be seeking to extend his contract when it expires after this summer's tournament. Speaking to the KNVB website Hiddink said ""I am honored to return as coach for the Dutch team. With Danny Blind and Ruud van Nistelrooy, we also have a solid team with a lot of football knowledge and experience. ""It is wonderful that I can oversee my own succession. In this way the football vision for the Dutch team in the long term can be guaranteed."" Hiddink's nomadic managerial career has seen him take control of clubs in Holland, Spain, Turkey, England and Russia, including spells at Real Madrid, Chelsea and PSV Eindhoven. He has also had periods in charge of the Turkish, Australian, Russian and South Korean national teams. Meanwhile, 52-year-old Blind, has been an assistant in the Dutch national setup since van Gaal took charge in 2012. According to KNVB director Bert van Oostveen, the transition to Blind as head coach in 2016 is a key factor in Holland's long-term strategy for the national team. ""With Hiddink we get a coach with a wealth of international experience and successes,"" he said. ""He has proven his ability as a trainer. ""We are also very pleased with the further development of the technical staff. Blind recently proved his worth at the KNVB. In the next two years he has a chance to grow. ""With Van Nistelrooy, we again add a former international football player to the staff. It goes without saying that we have a lot of faith in this coaching staff.""","Former Chelsea and Real Madrid coach Guus Hiddink announced next manager of Dutch national team .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- The children of Martin Luther King Jr. are back at loggerheads -- this time over his Bible and Nobel Peace Prize. The estate of the civil rights icon filed a complaint in Fulton County Superior Court in Atlanta on Friday to force Bernice King, his daughter, to turn over the items. King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., the complaint reads. Bernice King has ""repeatedly acknowledged and conceded the validity"" of the agreement, but has ""secreted and sequestered"" the items in question, it says. Specifically, the estate -- which is controlled by Dexter King and Martin Luther King III -- wants his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and his traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term. Bernice King says her brothers just want the items to sell them. ""Our Father MUST be turning in his grave,"" she said in a Tuesday statement. ""While I love my brothers dearly, this latest decision by them is extremely troubling. Not only am I appalled and utterly ashamed, I am frankly disappointed that they would even entertain the thought of selling these precious items. It reveals a desperation beyond comprehension."" The complaint does not mention the possibility of a sale, and attempts to contact the King brothers, through the estate, Tuesday were unsuccessful. This is not the first time the family has been at odds over King's legacy. Over the years, the siblings have sued and counter-sued one another. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting ""substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America"" for his own use. They later agreed to a settlement and avoided a public trial. ""My brothers' decision to sue me is drastic and grieves me greatly. I have absolutely no desire to be in court or to fight yet another public battle,"" Bernice King said in her statement Tuesday. ""Nevertheless, some actions are sacrilegious and some things are not for sale."" Harry Belafonte takes King's heirs to court .

"(CNN) -- ""Who are we?"" It's a question Northern Sudanese have been asking themselves for some time. Tucked away at the meeting point of Arab North Africa and the Horn, the people here have identified with both East and West. It's a question Sudan's President Omar al Bashir believes he's given the definitive answer to. At one of his many public rallies he told supporters: ""We are an Arab, Muslim nation. Anyone who doesn't like it can go."" This was after those who didn't like it did exactly that: In 2011, after a peace agreement brought to an end more than 21 years of civil war, the majority of Christians chose to secede and create their own country, aptly named South Sudan. But it hasn't brought the two countries any closer to a lasting peace: Border squabbles and skirmishes over the division of oil wealth are still the norm. It did, though, give Islamists in northern Sudan a clearer goal for the ""cultural project"" launched in 1989 when they took power in a military coup that instated Islamic law and did away with any semblance of political plurality. Islamist theocracy . The project denounced the multi-ethnic, culturally-rich Sudan -- with its Sufi chants and Orthodox Easter festivals -- and reinforced -- as an Islamist theocracy with headscarves and ""public order"" courts. Effectively it created morality police. In the early years of Islamist rule, the public order courts were our bogeymen. Girls who were deemed inappropriately dressed -- by the arbitrary metric of whichever officer happened to be on duty at the time -- were carted off in the back of police pick-up trucks in their hundreds, taken to be at best humiliated, and at worst flogged. Even today, although the ""diktats"", or rules on Islamic dress have loosened, the occasional street sweep serves as a reminder of what still lies in wait should your behavior be ruled ""un-Islamic."" It was a public order court that sentenced Meriam Yahya Ibrahim to death for apostasy, for her refusal to renounce Christianity, a move that has left many of my Sudanese friends and family shocked. This comes as licenses to build new churches are routinely denied, permission for Christmas festivities routinely blocked and rights activists tell us an estimated 200 foreign nationals were thrown out of Sudan for ""Christian evangelizing."" Ibrahim's husband told me she was Christian when he met her and that he's never met the men alleging she is their missing -- Muslim -- sister called Abrar. Her father, who Ibrahim claims wasn't involved in her upbringing, has yet to speak, either in court or publicly. International outrage . And it's these missing pieces of the puzzle that the government has clung to, trying to distract the growing domestic and international outrage. But it hasn't escaped people's notice that the press conference Ibrahim's alleged brothers held was in a government hall, and that in a country where journalists are told not to broach certain topics, the statement by the man claiming to be her older brother was allowed to be freely published; a statement announcing that the woman he claims as a sister must return to Islam or be killed ""as a glory to the faith."" Perhaps it's because the ""Ijma"" or consensus of the Islamic community, which is taken as a guide in Islamic jurisprudence, is not unified in the meting out of a death sentence for apostasy, although countries like Saudi Arabia and Pakistan do have the law on their books. Or maybe it's because, even in a country that has found a way to live with the gunning down of protesters, the shrinking of freedom and allegations of government corruption and financial mismanagement, that seem to come almost daily, the death sentence of a mother-of-two for a crime that many here don't think really counts, has allowed many to realize, at the very least, who we are not.

"(CNN) -- Music manager Allen Klein, whose clients included the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, died Saturday after a lengthy battle with Alzheimer's disease, his publicist said. Klein was 77. The son of Jewish immigrants from Hungary, Klein founded his firm Allen Klein & Co. in the late 1950s before the label evolved into ABKCO Music & Records in New York. The independent label holds the copyrights to music by the Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, the Animals, the Kinks, Chubby Checker, Bobby Womack and hundreds of others. Klein represented dozens of artists, including Sam Cooke, the Animals, Bobby Darin and Herman's Hermits. He changed the music industry when he represented Sam Cooke in negotiations with RCA, winning the artist control of his own master recordings. Known for a tenacious and often blunt style in negotiations, Klein's greatest coups were inking contracts with the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, though both relationships ended in legal battles. ABKCO built up a catalog of copyrights to more than 2,000 songs, including much of the Stones' 1960s catalog. Klein retained ownership of those titles even after splitting with the Stones. In 1969, John Lennon persuaded the other Beatles that Klein should take over the group's business affairs, but Paul McCartney resisted the move and some music historians say the appointment hastened the Beatles' split. Lennon later fell out with Klein, who was thought to be the target of the former Beatle's 1974 song ""Steel and Glass."" Defending his tough style, Klein told Playboy magazine in 1971: ""The music business is about 99 percent no-talent losers who can't stand a winner in their midst."" In 1971, Klein worked with George Harrison to organize the ""Concert for Bangladesh"" at Madison Square Garden, one of the first major benefit concerts of the rock era. Ringo Starr was among the all-stars who performed at the concert. Late in his career, Klein agreed to license a sample of a Rolling Stones song to the British group the Verve for their hit single ""Bittersweet Symphony."" But after the song was released, ABKCO successfully argued in court that the Verve had used too much of the sample and won 100 percent of the song's royalties. Klein is survived by his wife Betty, their three children and four grandchildren. Services will be held in New York on Tuesday.","Allen Klein, who inked contracts for dozens of musicians, dies at age 77 .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev Wednesday asked that the federal trial of the suspected Boston Marathon bomber be moved to Washington, D.C. In a motion filed with U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, lawyers for Tsarnaev, 20, claimed that the defense team's own venue survey revealed an ""overwhelming presumption of guilt"" in the state, prejudgment as to the potential penalty -- the prosecution is seeking the death penalty -- and an ""extraordinary high number"" of potential jurors who either attended or participated in the 2013 Boston Marathon or know someone who did. Prosecutors said Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed Boston in the day the blasts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to killing four people and wounding more than 200 in the attacks. Defense lawyers said the ""publicity, tremendous local impact and galvanizing community reaction"" forced a change of venue in case against Timothy McVeigh, who was executed for his role in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that took 168 lives. ""The community impact here is even greater than that present in McVeigh, given that the bombings occurred at the Boston Marathon on the day thousands of Bostonians and others from the region gathered to celebrate the runners, the Red Sox, and Patriots Day, the indelible fear that friends and family could have been killed or injured, the trauma experienced by those in the region for four more days while the police sought the perpetrators, and the hundreds of thousands of Boston area residents who sheltered in place during the climactic final day of the search,"" the motion said. ""If a change of venue was warranted in McVeigh, it is even more compelled by the facts presented here."" Defense lawyers surveyed the Southern District of New York in Manhattan and the federal court district in Washington, both of which are ""reasonably close, accessible to witnesses and interested persons, and able to logistically accommodate a trial of this magnitude,"" the motion said. Washington would be the more favorable location, it added. In Boston and Springfield, Massachusetts, the survey found that 57.9 % and 51.7 % of the respondents, respectively, said they believed the defendant was guilty, compared to 47.9 % and 37.4% for Manhattan and Washington. In addition, 37 % of the respondents in Boston and 35 % in Springfield believed Tsarnaev should receive the death penalty. Defense lawyers asked the court for more time to study the issue before the November trial date. Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole in Massachusetts heard arguments about whether Tsarnaev's alleged ""betrayal"" of the United States was an aggravating factor for seeking the death penalty against him. A defense motion accused prosecutors of trying to use the suspect's foreign birth and immigration to imply that he was ""more blameworthy, and more deserving of severe punishment"" than a native-born person who commits the identical crime. The government has said that part of Tsarnaev's motive ""was to provide aid and comfort to America's enemies."" Prosecutors also said that after Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States, he ""enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States"" by killing and maiming its people, according to court filing. O'Toole agreed with the defense, saying that drawing a distinction between naturalized and natural born citizens was ""highly inappropriate.""","Defense lawyers say it's impossible to seat an impartial jury in Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the U.S. military to stop enforcing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, putting an end to the ban on openly gay troops. U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips' permanent worldwide injunction -- praised by gay rights organizations -- orders the military ""immediately to suspend and discontinue any investigation, or discharge, separation, or other proceeding, that may have been commenced"" under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. The judge, a Clinton appointee based in the Central District of California, previously ruled that the policy regarding gays serving in the military violated service members' Fifth Amendment rights to due process and freedom of speech, but had delayed issuing the injunction. The military was sued by Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group. Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy Schmaler would say only that the department is ""reviewing the ruling."" The department has 60 days to appeal, but is not required to do so. The Defense Department is reviewing the ruling to determine whether it has immediate impact and is consulting with the Justice Department, Pentagon spokeswoman Cynthia Smith said. Air Force lawyers in a recent case argued the military -- not the courts -- is in the best position to evaluate and enforce the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the controversial policy. A bill currently before Congress would overturn the measure after a Pentagon review is completed in December. In her ruling Tuesday, Phillips stated the policy infringes on the rights of military personnel. ""Furthermore, there is no adequate remedy at law to prevent the continued violation of servicemembers' rights or to compensate them for violation of their rights,"" the judge wrote. More than 12,500 people have been booted from the military since ""don't ask, don't tell"" went into effect. Along with barring known gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals from serving, the policy prevents the military from asking them about it. Log Cabin Republicans praised the ruling but urged ""caution by servicemembers considering coming out at this time, as the Obama administration still has the option to appeal."" The group said the ruling is a victory for strong national defense. ""No longer will our military be compelled to discharge servicemembers with valuable skills and experience because of an archaic policy mandating irrational discrimination,"" it said in a statement following the ruling. Servicemembers United, which describes itself as the nation's largest organization of gay and lesbian troops and veterans, also hailed the judge's ruling but urged gays who serve to be careful about coming out now. ""This order from Judge Phillips is another historic and courageous step in the right direction, a step that Congress has been noticeably slow in taking,"" said executive director Alexander Nicholson. The ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee called on the administration to immediately file a motion to stay the injunction so Congress can address the issue. ""We are a nation at war. This decision could have a negative impact on military and family readiness since the Department of Defense is unprepared to address the issues that are bound to arise from such a hasty change, Rep. Howard P. ""Buck"" McKeon, R-California, said in a statement. Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center, a research institute of the University of California-Santa Barbara, said he expects the Obama administration to appeal Tuesday's order. ""The case could be done next week if the administration decides not to appeal, or it could take five years if there is an appeal, or Congress could move faster than the Justice Department, which would render this case moot,"" said Belkin, whose institute researches sexual minorities in the military and advocates an end to the ban.

"(CNN) -- When President Barack Obama meets with other world leaders, they usually swap gifts. And these are much higher-end than your typical office secret Santa exchange. Presidents, kings and prime ministers showered Obama and his family with a wide assortment of tokens and trinkets, including a bamboo bicycle, masks, liquor and a small sword. And one -- British Prime Minister David Cameron -- even bestowed Bo, the first dog, with a bone-shaped chew toy adorned with a UK flag. The State Department released a detailed list of gifts to the White House and other government officials in 2011, the latest year available. Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife, Carla Bruni, were among the biggest spenders, dishing out gifts of all sorts, including luxury bags, polo shirts and chocolates. The Sarkozys bestowed Obama a black Hermes golf accessory bag estimated at $7,750, a Louis Vuitton bag worth $2,300 and crystal table lamps for first lady Michelle Obama. They also gave the Obamas a reusable grocery bag emblazoned with a dandelion, and his-and-hers Dior bathrobes. Qatari officials gave the president a wooden case containing a small sword while the Philippines ambassador gave him a bamboo bicycle. The White House did not keep the gifts, but it did not return them either. As required by law, the swag was hauled to the National Archives and Records Administration. The General Services Administration currently mandates that any gift over $350 be turned over to the government. ""Non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. government,"" the report said in justifying its decision to send them to the national archives, rather than refuse them. The gift list disclosed Friday includes rugs from Pakistani and Afghan leaders, and flavored liquor from the Polish president. From Down Under came a white 2GB iPod shuffle, courtesy of the Australian prime minister. U.S. neighbors to the north gave a basketball signed by the 2010-11 Toronto Raptors NBA team, courtesy of the Canadian prime minister. Then there were the pricey art gifts. A print photograph by artist Vik Muniz from a Brazilian governor. Price tag? $40,000. That gift did not go to the national archives. It was loaned to an unnamed museum for a public exhibit, the statement said. A Daum blue mask sculpture from the Gabonese president valued at $52,695 was sent to the national archives. Some gifts were more official, including a bronze statue of Abraham Lincoln given by the Chinese president. And the list goes on and on. But the president retained one gift -- a book from the Mongolian president, ""Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World"" by Jack Weatherford. Obama is not the only leader of the free world to receive gifts. While in office, President George W. Bush was lavished with tokens as well, according to 2009 government records. Gifts to him included a silver and gold dagger with a belt and case, all the way from Saudi Arabia. One of his main gifters? Sarkozy.

"(EW) -- There seem to be four big-screen modes for Pierce Brosnan: James Bond, magnetic sly fox (""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" ""The Matador""), way out-of-his-depths leading man (""Mamma Mia!""), and action-thriller paycheck-coaster. ""The November Man,"" which reunites Brosnan with his ""Dante's Peak"" director, Roger Donaldson, falls squarely but surely in the last category. Box office preview: Summer 2014 goes out with a sigh . Brosnan plays boozehound and ex-CIA agent Peter Devereaux, who is coaxed out of retirement to stop a conspiracy involving a war criminal (Lazar Ristovski). He's also asked to protect a relief worker (Olga Kurylenko, a former Bond girl of the Daniel Craig era) who holds more secrets than anyone could guess -- except the audience, that is -- while ducking a past protege (the stiff-as-a-board Luke Bracey) who chases him in some rather meh cat-and-mouse power play. (There's even an actual cat that makes some cameo appearances.) Is Joaquin Phoenix the prescription for Marvel's 'Doctor Strange'? The movie, based on Bill Granger's popular spy novel series, could easily have been made in Brosnan's post-Remington Steele days, with its fondness for familiar '80s action tropes like smashed BMWs and heavy arterial spray. Once in a while, there's a certain drive-in/double feature junkiness that elicits a chuckle or two (especially any scene with an oily officioso played by the growling Bill Smitrovich, the only performer who seems to be having any fun). But the utter lack of originality eventually sinks the movie, and the climax has more howlers than a wolf convention. ""The November Man"" may be an August release, but its silliness would make it a non-event any month of the year. Grade: C . See the original story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- If you are a survivor of sexual abuse who has not yet reported, you may be attending closely to the trial of former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky to see what happens to those who do. The news is both good and bad. You see some courageous men being taken seriously by prosecutors and journalists. But you see a degree of potential exposure that few victims would want to face, and that we could do a better job of preventing. First, the better news: We all know that sexual abuse is still a crime that is mostly unrevealed. But progress has been made. Comparisons of recent surveys to those from the 1980s show far more victims today say they reported or that someone in authority found out. Yet boys are still disproportionately less likely to report, for some of the reasons showcased in this trial: the fear that others will not believe they are really victims, and the fear that they will be stigmatized as wimpy and/or homosexual. So a case such as this with male victims coming forward, explaining how conflicted they felt, why it took them so long, what it did to their lives, but nonetheless giving convincing testimony that has clearly been believed by the prosecutors and much of the press, this certainly must give other boys and men some sense of possibility. Indeed, that this case is being prosecuted at all shows how much has changed. People in law enforcement and the public at large now know that boys do indeed get abused. Thousands of professionals have gotten specialized training in how to identify victims, how talk with them and how not to exacerbate the harm when interviewing. Specialized Child Advocacy Centers exist in more than 600 communities to make the process more child friendly. These trained police and prosecutors do understand why it is so hard to report, why the testimony sometimes changes and how the fact of participating in the sexual activity doesn't signify enjoyment or lack of harm. Growing numbers of women in law enforcement have certainly helped. But we still have a long way to go. Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know about allegations, how case unraveled . The possibility of your abuse ending up fodder for a national media frenzy that rivals the Super Bowl would hardly seem comforting to most potential disclosers. The possibility of having your lifelong identity become ""that kid who was molested by that coach"" would be terrifying. In that light, perhaps the most discouraging news for survivors in the trial so far was the refusal of the judge to allow the victims to testify anonymously. This ruling would seem callous. Lots of other countries have built in legal protections that prevent the media and other court participants from learning the names of child victims of sexual assault. Even in the United States we have protections against the disclosure of the names of juvenile offenders. The notion behind that is that young people can be permanently stigmatized by such notoriety. Why not victims, too? True, many news outlets have policies to avoid reporting the names of sexual assault victims. But it is an entirely voluntary policy, proudly flouted by some outlets. Studies have shown that information that could readily identify victims appears in 37% of news articles that report on child sexual victimization. So far, the names of the Sandusky accusers have not gotten widespread circulation. But they could. What was the judge's rationale for denying what would seem like such a reasonable request? ""Secrecy is thought to be inconsistent with the openness required to assure the public that the law is being administered fairly and applied faithfully,"" Judge John Cleland wrote in his order dismissing the request. ""Consequently, there must be justifications of public policy that are very deep and well-rooted to support any measure which interferes with the public's ability to observe a trial and to make their own judgments about the legitimacy of their legal system and the fairness of its results."" But there are. An enormous quantity of research shows sex crimes against children to be particularly traumatic, and aspects of the court experience to be a contributor to the trauma. Allowing victims to testify anonymously would not truly undermine the openness crucial to make a judgment about the fairness of the system. The victims still have to testify publicly, still have to be confronted by the defense, still have their credibility tested in the eyes of the jury and the media. Perhaps the judge was afraid of creating a basis for the appeal of a guilty verdict. But that only illustrates how the protection of victim identities needs to be better enshrined in law and practice so it is not seen as a risky anomaly. Opinion: Tell toddlers what's private about their bodies . However the rest of the trial goes, we we must continue to commit ourselves to building a justice system that takes into account the reasonable needs of child victims for privacy and protection. It is one of the biggest things we can do to help victims come forward and stop abusers after the first rather than the 10th victim.

"(CNN) -- A noted tech journalist and early adopter of Google's Glass headset is declaring the technology ""doomed,"" at least for 2014. There's a tongue-in-cheek nature to Robert Scoble's pronouncement, which he shared with the 4.7 million people who follow him on Google+. His strong language, he said, was a send-up of the tech press's sometimes over-the-top approach to news. But Scoble, who got his Glass headset in April on the second day the devices became available to some journalists and early testers, predicts the connected eyewear will flop with consumers when it goes on sale to the general public, presumably this year. Scoble said he thinks the price will be too high and there won't be enough apps or useful functions to make the wearable tech worth the cost. He has a sunnier view of Glass's long-term prospects, though. ""By 2020 I'm quite convinced this will be a big deal and there will be lots of competitors by then,"" he wrote. ""So, if you make it about 2020, then it isn't doomed. If it's about beating the Apple iWatch in 2014? Yes, totally doomed."" Apple has not rolled out a smartwatch yet but is widely rumored to be doing so soon, marking the tech giant's entree into the emerging wearable-tech field. Google did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article. Glass is a headset with a camera and small screen situated above the wearer's right eye. The wearer can access the Internet and snap images and video by using voice commands. A blogger and author, Scoble works as a new-tech ""evangelist"" for IT company Rackspace. But his influence in the tech community is broader and his writing helps shape opinion in some quarters. Scoble has 374,000 followers on Twitter and has been one of the most visible Google Glass users. A photo of him wearing the headset in the shower went viral last year. Scoble noted that Glass, which has sold for $1,500 to a limited number of beta testers, is likely to be released at a cost of more than $500. He says that's too much for the public at large. ""Price is gonna matter a LOT. But I'm hearing they won't be able to get under $500 in 2014, so that means it's doomed. In 2014,"" Scoble wrote. ""When they get under $300 and have another revision or two? That's when the market really will show up. 2016, I say."" He said the headset will need to be custom-fitted to its wearer, and that customers will need to receive an hour or two of training before using it -- which will inflate its price. Scoble also believes that battery life, at least on the current Glass models, won't be enough for some people. He said a lack of apps could also hurt. ""That will start getting fixed after a few months of release, but early users are gonna continually ask 'where's the Uber app?""' Or 'where's the Foursquare app?' Or 'why does the Facebook app suck?' he wrote. Scoble criticized the lack of a quality Facebook app in particular. ""Sorry Google, but Google+ still isn't used by my family, friends, or those I speak with ...,"" he wrote. ""Google+ isn't nearly as ubiquitous or as nice, truth be told, particularly for mobile users. This lack of Facebook support is the #1 thing that pisses me off about Glass."" All of that said, Scoble holds out hope. He said he still loves his Glass and that it's unfair to judge a test version of the still-new device as if it's a finished product. ""So, what would I do if I were Google? Reset expectations,"" he wrote. ""Say 'this is really a product for 2020 that we're gonna build with you.' First release is in 2014, but let's be honest, if it's $600 and dorky looking, it'll be doomed -- as long as expectations are so high."" While still in limited release, Google Glass has already stirred up some controversy. Some restaurants and other businesses have banned Google Glass over concerns about the headset's ability to take photos and record video. And users have already been ticketed for wearing them while driving, as lawmakers in several states consider laws to ban them behind the wheel. And then there's their appearance. Glass's part-futuristic, part-dorky look has been mocked in such spots as the blog, White Men Wearing Google Glass.ï»¿ .","Top tech blogger says Google Glass won't do well when it hits the market .

"(CNN) -- The inclusion of Mount Fuji in the UNESCO World Heritage list recently has spurred a huge reaction among international travelers and agencies. This Monday, as normal, hundreds of hikers flocked to Mt Fuji for the beginning of the summer climbing season. Climbers started to ascend the 3,776-meter peak as early as 3 a.m. to watch the sunrise from the summit. They lit torches and walked in long winding queues along the path that leads up the mountain. So numerous were the climbers in their colorful outfits it looked a little like a busy morning in a Tokyo subway station. Worshiped for centuries . The cone-shaped mountain has been worshiped in Japan for centuries. It is considered the symbol of this island country home to a reported 118 volcanoes. While Mt Fuji was already popular among tourists, the UNESCO World Heritage status will spark a new wave of interest, say local officials. According to The Japan Times, Japan Travel Bureau Corp. announced Monday a series of day trips for foreigners, accompanied by English-speaking tour guides. East Japan Railway Co. also offered a 50% discount on tickets for people who use the Chuo Line to visit the mountain. Risk of erosion . Environmentalists warn the extra tourists pose potential environmental problems, such as erosion or littering. It was reported that Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures, where Mt Fuji is located, will collect entrance fees to the site on a trial basis this summer to help pay for its preservation. Mt.

"(CNN) -- Discrimination against women and girls takes a staggering toll around the world, says author Sheryl WuDunn. It leads to as many as 100 million fewer females than males in the world. Ending the oppression of women is the great moral challenge of the 21st Century, a cause she compares to fighting slavery in the 19th century and totalitarianism in the 20th Century. WuDunn, a former reporter for The New York Times who is now an investment banker, and her husband, Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, wrote ""Half the Sky,"" a book focusing on the role of women in the world. She spoke about their findings at the TED Global conference in Oxford in July and in an interview with CNN. Watch an interview with Sheryl WuDunn . During their time as correspondents in China, WuDunn and Kristof learned of the phenomenon of an estimated 30 million ""missing"" baby girls in the nation. WuDunn says part of the gap could be attributed to infanticide by families who were determined to have a male child under China's one-child policy and in part to the development of the sonogram. That medical device can be used to determine the gender of a child before birth, prompting some parents to obtain abortions. ""One peasant in the southern part of China once told us, 'The sonogram's great, we don't need to have baby girls any more.' "" TED.com: Radical women embrace tradition . The problem is not limited to China; WuDunn says there are between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the world, even though women outnumber men in some more developed nations. The solutions, she says, are education and economic opportunity. Overpopulation is one of the larger contributors to poverty, WuDunn said. ""When you educate a girl, she has significantly fewer kids."" Girls who go to school get married later in life and educate their children ""in a more enlightened way."" WuDunn says her work is not just about helping reveal the plight of women and girls in many countries, it's also about helping provide the groundwork for a movement to solve the problem. In the Western world, where many people have all their material needs satisfied, it's an obligation to reach out and help others, she says. TED.com: Eve Ensler on embracing your inner girl . WuDunn told the story of an American aid worker in Darfur who had seen great suffering but never broke down. On a vacation back in the United States, she visited her grandmother and noticed a bird feeder in the backyard. ""She was in her grandmother's backyard and she basically broke down. And she realized that not only was she able to feed and clothe and house herself but also see that people in her country were able to feed wild birds so that they don't go hungry in the winter. She knew that with that luck and fortune also comes great responsibility."" Here are excerpts from  ""Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide"" by Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn: . ""So let us be clear about this up front: We hope to recruit you to join an incipient movement to emancipate women and fight global poverty by unlocking women's power as economic catalysts. That is the process under way -- not a drama of victimization but of empowerment, the kind that transforms bubbly teenage girls from brothel slaves into successful businesswomen. This is a story of transformation. It is change that is already taking place, and change that can accelerate if you'll just open your heart and join in. ... ""The tide of history is turning women from beasts of burden and sexual playthings into full-fledged human beings. The economic advantages of empowering women are so vast as to persuade nations to move in that direction. ""Before long, we will consider sex slavery, honor killings and acid attacks as unfathomable as foot-binding. The question is how long that transformation will take and how many girls will be kidnapped into brothels before it is complete -- and whether each of us will be part of that historical movement, or a bystander.""","Sheryl WuDunn: Tens of millions of girls die young or aren't born due to discrimination .

"(EW.com) -- ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" opens on a primitive planet, where the natives are restless and a volcano, in mid-eruption, traps First Officer Spock (Zachary Quinto) over a boiling ocean of lava. Naturally, the Vulcan stays cool as a cucumber, ready to die to save his crew -- an impeccably logical decision that also happens to be the compassionate one. But Capt. James T. Kirk (Chris Pine), commander of the U.S.S. Enterprise, has other ideas. He'll rescue Spock, even if that means violating a Federation rule that says the Enterprise can't be exposed to the planet's uncivilized hordes. Kirk, who never met a regulation he couldn't trash, guides the starship up into the air and over to where his comrade is about to perish, and the white-mud-caked warriors stare at the ship as if it were a god. It's a sensation that the movie transmits to the audience, since the Enterprise, emitting an awesome thrummm, never looked quite so massive or looming. Will crowd-funding a 'Friday Night Lights' movie work? Four years ago, director J.J. Abrams rebooted the ""Star Trek"" franchise with great swagger by treating the launch film as a unique pop culture origin story. The movie was all about how the Enterprise crew first came together, but really it was about how Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto rose up to become those superheroes of yore, Kirk and Spock, by echoing the looks, voices, and personalities of William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy just enough, while still making the roles their own. The two actors now really have a chance to get their Kirk and Spock on. Pine, with ice blue eyes and lips that dance on the edge of a smirk, does something marvelously clever: He evokes Shatner's hamminess by underplaying it. And Quinto makes the glowering, dagger-browed Spock almost fiercely withholding. ""Into Darkness"" provides room for these actors to deepen their interplay. The movie has an often sinister grandeur, but the images never overpower the human (or Vulcan) factor. Like Abrams' first ""Trek"" movie, this one is positioned as a prequel to the original TV series and subsequent films, though it also lifts (and twists) elements from that sacred text, 1982's ""Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan."" Kirk and Spock, each following his own nature (one's a hothead, the other a detached brainiac), are usually at loggerheads. Even when they wind up coming to the same conclusion they can't stop arguing about how they got there, and that's part of the movie's texture of cocky one-upmanship. 'The Bling Ring': Cannes review . The whole Enterprise crew has become a collection of colliding egos. Zoë Saldana's Uhura, who's in the middle of a lovers' quarrel with Spock; John Cho as the so-stoic-he's-cool Sulu; Simon Pegg's frantically funny and resourceful Scotty — these characters pop out at us with a new dynamism. And they all confront a villain who has been brilliantly retrofitted to throw everyone, including the audience, off-guard. This dastardly dude is a boyish-looking terrorist named John Harrison, who starts off by striking a note of urban chaos. But it's not long before he's revealed to be — how can I say this? — a foe familiar to Trekkies, with a concealed agenda and 70 of his comrades cryogenically frozen in photon-torpedo capsules. He's played by rising British star Benedict Cumberbatch in a totally original way, with the physicality of a dancer and an eager, puckish sincerity that ingeniously disguises his vengeful mission. Once Harrison's been captured and placed in a cell, Kirk has to listen to his own hunches about who this man is and what he wants. That's the real ''darkness'' the film's title is referring to: the place where you're no longer certain of the right thing. And that's a place of genuine excitement. Intergalactic fashion finds .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two former coaches have sued Major League Soccer team Chivas USA, claiming they were fired this year because they are not Latino. Daniel Calichman and Theothoros Chronopoulos, who worked in the team's ""academy,"" or player development, program, accused team owner Jorge Vergara Madrigal of Mexico of enacting a Latino-only employment policy, according to a lawsuit filed in a Los Angeles County court. Calichman and Chronopoulos, who are both white, also accused Vergara of implementing a discriminatory practice that was carried over from Chivas de Guadalajara, a pro team in Mexico owned by Vergara that allegedly has hired only Mexican soccer players since 1908. The two men, both former pros and members of the U.S. national team, are seeking unspecified damages for discrimination, harassment, retaliation and wrongful termination, their attorneys said in a statement Wednesday. The team fired the two coaches ""as part of an ethnocentric policy and practice of discriminating against and terminating non-Mexican and non-Latino employees,"" the suit alleged. In an interview in his attorney's office, Calichman recalled a team staff meeting last November. Vergara ""asked everyone who speaks Spanish raise your hand, and there was a group that could not speak Spanish,"" Calichman said. ""The work environment changed, and coaches that could not speak Spanish on the field were wondering, 'Hey, will we be fired because I can't speak Spanish and is it possible?' ""It feels horrible,"" he said of the alleged discrimination. The Los Angeles area-based Chivas team, which shares a stadium in Carson with the Los Angeles Galaxy, declined to comment. ""We are not commenting because it's a legal matter,"" said Christina Maillo-Belda, spokeswoman for Chivas USA. A co-defendant in the civil suit, the human resources firm Insperity Inc. of Kingwood, Texas, also declined comment on Tuesday's filing. ""Insperity has not yet been served with this lawsuit or even had the opportunity to review it,"" said spokeswoman Suzanne Haugen. ""However, Insperity does not comment on pending litigation."" The two former coaches experienced retaliation for opposing the allegedly unlawful employment practices, the lawsuit alleged. The two men filed complaints with the team's human resources manager and later with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The team terminated their employment on March 7 and sent a letter accusing the two men of unprofessional conduct that created an unsafe work environment, the lawsuit said. The two former coaches dispute that accusation by the team. Chronopoulos was a Chivas USA coach and the director of the team's academy program, which identifies and develops players age 18 and under for the pro team. Calichman reported to Chronopoulos and coached 17- and 18-year-old players in the academy program. He also helped the pro team as needed, the lawsuit stated. Both coaches joined Chivas USA in August 2011. A year later, Vergara acquired 50% ownership of the team and, with wife Angelica Fuentes, became the team's sole owner, the suit said. He ""undertook a systemic effort to reverse what he perceived as the 'Americanization' of Chivas USA and to implement a discriminatory employment practice similar to the ethnocentric 'Mexican only' policy that exists at Chivas de Guadalajara,"" the lawsuit alleged. Court documents cited Vergara's comments to the press, in which he is quoted as saying the plan called for Chivas USA to be ""the son of Chivas of Guadalajara"" but ""it got away from that and the clubs suffered a divorce in philosophy and structure."" In the suit, the two coaches accused Vergara of ""replacing players and staff who had no Mexican or Latino heritage with those who did have Mexican or Latino heritage or who, at a minimum, had some connection to Mexico (for example, being married to a Mexican spouse)."" In December 2012, Chronopoulos was directed by the team president to collect ethnic and national origin data on all academy players and their parents, the lawsuit claims. Many parents were offended and refused to respond, the suit said. Since Vergara took control of Chivas USA, about seven non-Latino academy employees, including the two former coaches, have been terminated, the lawsuit said. ""In contrast, no Latino employees have been terminated,"" the suit said. Also, ""the organization has culled virtually all non-Latino players"" from the team and ""has, almost uniformly, replaced them with Latino players,"" the suit said, referring to a Los Angeles Times account on the player changes. Among those players released or traded are James Riley, Ben Zemanski, Casey Townsend and eight-time Major League Soccer All-Star Shalrie Joseph, the suit said. The team acquired Eric Avila from the Colorado Rapids in exchange for Nick LaBrocca. The team also acquired three players from Chivas de Guadalajara, Edgar ""El Chore"" Mejia, defender Mario de Luna and forward Giovani Casillas, the suit said. On Wednesday, Chivas USA was last in the Western Conference with a 3-7-2 record.","NEW: Coaches wondered, 'Hey, will we be fired because I can't speak Spanish and is it possible?'

"(CNN) -- For the serious contenders at grand slams, it's all about trying to advance with minimal fuss in the first week. That way they have plenty of energy left for when the competition picks up in the second week. Serena Williams certainly isn't messing around in the early stages of this year's U.S. Open. After crushing Taylor Townsend -- a potentially tricky opponent -- in the first round in 55 minutes, Williams routed another fellow American, Vania King, 6-1 6-0 in 56 minutes Thursday to reach the third round. Men's No. 1 Novak Djokovic made quick work of his opponent, too, dispatching Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-1 6-3 6-0. This grand slam is big for Williams. Even though she has won 17 majors, none have come in 2014 and she didn't progress to the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. But New York could once again bring Williams joy -- she is the two-time defending champion. The top seed's only problems against King came in her first service game, when Williams hit three double faults in windy conditions. Williams' path to the final got a little easier when Ana Ivanovic was upset by big-serving Czech Karolina Pliskova 7-5 6-4 and Samantha Stosur -- who defeated Williams in the 2011 final -- blew match points and lost to Estonia's Kaia Kanepi in a third-set tiebreak. Ivanovic and Stosur were in Williams' quarter. Just how potent is Pliskova's serve? She trailed only Williams in aces heading into the tournament. Still, it marks more grand slam disappointment for Ivanovic, the eighth seed and a former No. 1. Despite occupying the final spot in the race for the year-end championships, Ivanovic crashed out early at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and now the U.S. Open. ""I do put a lot of expectations on myself,"" Ivanovic told reporters. ""I tried to overanalyze and overthink instead of just playing the game. ""It's a work in process. But I think I have potential to do well"" at grand slams ""and that's something I want to change for next year."" Almost forgotten this year is Victoria Azarenka, since she's missed most of 2014 with a foot injury and this month dealt with a knee complaint. The two-time finalist, however, rallied from a break down in the first set and then cruised past Christina McHale 6-3 6-2. ""It's always going to take time to rebuild,"" Azarenka told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Did Mars rover Opportunity order a jelly doughnut? Not quite, but scientists are baffled by a white rock with a dark red low spot in the middle that ""just plain appeared at that spot"" on the planet where the rover is situated, says Steve Squyres, lead scientist of the Mars Exploration Rover mission. In recent weeks, Opportunity took photos of the same spot on Mars, 12 days apart. The rover's panoramic camera showed only barren bedrock on mission day 3528 (in Mars time), but on day 3540, a photo of the same scene revealed the mysterious, doughnut-shaped rock. Squyres showed photos of this ghostly geological dessert at a recent NASA event celebrating 10 years since the Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed on Mars. Spirit's mission ended in 2010 after losing the use of two wheels, and ceasing to communicate. But Opportunity is still chugging along and finding new surprises, such as this rock. ""One of the things I like to say is that Mars keeps throwing new things at us,"" Squyres said at the event, gesturing toward the rock photo and laughing. NASA: Watch the presentation . The photos of the outcrop showing the absence, and then presence, of the pastry-sized rock were taken 12 days apart. The rover had not driven over that spot, Squyres said. There are two leading theories about where the rock, called ""Pinnacle Island,"" came from. Neither of them include the possibility of an intergalactic Dunkin' Donuts. The most likely scenario is that Opportunity flicked the rock with one of its wheels. ""We had driven a meter or two away from here, and somehow maybe one of the wheels, kind of, managed to spit it out of the ground, and have it slide to this position,"" Squyres said. Alternatively, there could be a smoking hole in the ground nearby and the rock could be a piece of crater ejecta, or piece of matter spewn from the impact of a meteorite. Squyres doesn't think this is as likely as the idea that the rover displaced the rock, however. Opportunity is now studying the mystery rock more extensively, making measurements and taking pictures. Its instruments have shown scientists that the ""jelly"" part is ""like nothing we've ever seen before,"" Squyres said. It's very high in sulfur and magnesium, and it has twice as much manganese as has ever been seen in anything on Mars. No one knows what that means. ""We're completely confused, we're having a wonderful time, everyone on the team is arguing and fighting,"" Squyres said. Spirit landed on January 4, 2004, followed by Opportunity on January 25, 2004. Their primary missions were designated for a mere 90 days, but both far outlasted that target. Squyres said he used to think that no matter how long the rovers lasted, at some point there would be a point in the mission where the team could say ""We're finished"" -- that they had learned everything could about Mars with those particular vehicles. But the Red Planet isn't like that. ""There will be something tantalizing, something wonderful just beyond our reach that we didn't quite get to, and that's the nature of exploration,"" he said. Opportunity has otherwise encountered scientifically important phenomena during its decade of investigation. At Endeavor Crater, where it is today, the rover found clay minerals that form in watery conditions, and indicate that water with a neutral pH could have once been there, which would be conducive to microbial life if there had been any. Endeavor has also unveiled veins of a mineral that appears to be gypsum, which is deposited by water. Opportunity is not the only robot roaming Mars. NASA's 2-ton Curiosity rover, which landed in 2012, has an even more powerful suite of scientific instruments. Because of Curiosity's findings, NASA announced for the first time last year that life could have existed on Mars. NASA is planning another rover mission in 2020 -- and that future robot could, possibly, collect samples that would later return to Earth for further study. Such sophisticated technologies will help us see what other mysterious ""sweets"" the planet can deliver.

"Washington (CNN) -- An e-mail discussion about talking points the Obama administration used to describe the deadly attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, show the White House and State Department were more involved than they first said in the decision to remove an initial CIA assessment that a group with ties to al Qaeda was involved, according to CNN sources with knowledge of the e-mails. After hearing, Republicans say there's more to story . Doomed ambassador: 'We're under attack' The unclassified talking points have become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the administration and Republicans, who say that officials knew the attack last September 11 was a planned terror operation while they were telling the public it was an act of violence that grew out of a demonstration over a video produced in the United States that insulted Islam. John King: Benghazi investigation both legitimate and partisan . That was the story that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice told five days later when she made the rounds of all five Sunday morning television talk shows. Obama administration officials have long said that Rice was using official talking points that were edited almost exclusively by the intelligence community. The attack also occurred two months before the November election, in which President Barack Obama's campaign often pointed out that it had ""decimated"" al Qaeda. Chaffetz: Obama has explaining to do on Benghazi . White House spokesman Jay Carney on Friday called the controversy a ""distraction"" from the facts and said the administration had raised the possibility of extremist involvement from the start. He told reporters the administration was careful with information on Benghazi and was open with the public once facts were established. An interagency discussion over the talking points to describe the attack just days previous that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans included the White House, State Department, CIA, FBI and Justice Department officials. A senior administration official told CNN that the e-mails were made available to Congress earlier this year and nothing contradicts what it has said. ""The White House made stylistic edits to the talking points to emphasize that the investigation was ongoing as to who was responsible"" and to simplify certain phrasing, the official said. Carney added that the only edit made by the White House or the State Department was to change the description of the targeted facility to a diplomatic post from consulate. The e-mail exchange and alterations to the talking points were first reported by ABC and The Weekly Standard and confirmed by CNN appear to contradict that assertion. A source familiar with the matter said then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland raised concerns over the CIA's first version of the talking points, saying that they went further than what she was allowed to say about the attack during her briefings and that she believed the CIA was attempting to exonerate itself at the State Department's expense by suggesting CIA warnings about the security situation were ignored. Carney said on Friday there was a ""deliberative process"" around the talking points involving several agencies. He said the talking points reflected the best assessment of the intelligence community at the time of what occurred in Benghazi, and said there has been an effort since to politicize the tragedy. ""This is an effort to accuse the administration of hiding something we did not hide,"" he said. The CIA had no comment on the matter. According to a congressional source with knowledge of the e-mails, the CIA's first draft of the talking points was sent to other agencies on the afternoon of Friday, September 14. They were requested by Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger during a classified briefing by then-CIA director David Petraeus and were intended to be used by members of Congress and administration officials. According to ABC News and The Weekly Standard, the first draft included a line that said ""Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack."" The first version also includes a reference to the terrorist organization Ansar al-Sharia -- an al Qaeda-affiliated group that operates in Libya that took credit for the attack on Facebook but later denied any involvement. Also in the initial talking points was an acknowledgement that the CIA had produced ""numerous pieces on the threat of extremists linked to al-Qa'ida in Benghazi and eastern Libya."" The reference also mentioned that ""at least five other attacks against foreign interests"" had been made since April 2012, according to the news organizations. In response to the initial assessment, Nuland on Friday e-mails a group involved in an interagency process of reviewing the talking points and brought up a number of concerns, according to congressional source. ""Now I understand that these are for members of Congress. I have serious concerns about all the parts highlighted below,"" she wrote. ""Why are we arming members of Congress to start making the assertion to the media that we ourselves are not making because we don't want to prejudice the investigation. Why do we want the Hill to be fingering Ansar al-Sharia when we aren't doing that ourselves."" She continued, ""The penultimate point"" -- information about the CIA receiving numerous threats from extremists groups -- could be abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to state department warnings so why do we want to cede that either...."" An NSC staffer replied that the ""FBI did not have major concern with the points and only offered a couple of minor points."" After Nuland weighed in, the reference to Ansar al-Sharia was scrubbed from the account. Nuland responds at 9:24 p.m. on Friday, writing, ""These don't resolve all of my issues or those of my building's leadership."" Just a minute after Nuland's e-mail, Jake Sullivan, then a policy adviser for then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, writes the group. ""I spoke with Tommy,"" Sullivan writes, referring to then-National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor. ""We'll work this through in the morning. Get comments back."" Republican spotlight shifts from Obama to Clinton . Opinion: Hearing's aim was to undermine Clinton . Less than 10 minutes later, Deputy National Security Council Adviser Ben Rhodes e-mailed the group stating that he didn't want anything in the talking points that would undermine the investigation and directs the matter to a Saturday meeting at the White House. According to multiple sources, the interagency group met Saturday morning, and according to a congressional source, the paragraph acknowledging that the CIA had warned about ""the threat of extremists linked to al Qaeda and Benghazi"" in preceding months was removed from the talking points after that meeting. After the Saturday meeting, a separate e-mail was directed to Rice, telling her that the first draft of the talking points seemed unsuitable based on the discussion at the White House meeting, the unknown author of the e-mail wrote, ""because they implied the CIA warned about a specific attack."" The e-mail continues: ""I spoke with Jake immediately after the (the White House meeting) and noted that you are doing the Sunday morning shows and need to be aware of the final posture that these points took."" What the Obama administration has said about the Benghazi attack . By the Numbers: U.S. diplomatic presence . A U.S. intelligence official would not discuss the specific changes that were made in the talking points, but reiterated the previous reasons given for why they were made. ""There were several valid intelligence and investigatory reasons why they were changed: the information about individuals linked to al-Qaeda was derived from classified sources, and could not be corroborated at the unclassified level; the links were tenuous and therefore it made sense to be cautious before naming perpetrators; finally, no one wanted to prejudice a criminal investigation in its earliest stages."" A senior U.S. intelligence official would also not comment on what the State Department may have recommended as part of the interagency review process, but did say it would be a ""significant stretch"" to suggest ""the State Department made a comment therefore the talking points changed."" The official also maintained nothing has changed since last November when Shawn Turner, the spokesman for the office of the Director of National Intelligence said ""there were no substantive changes made to the talking points after they left the intelligence community.""

"(CNN) -- The outlook for the underequipped members of the Syrian opposition appeared to brighten Thursday on the eve of a Friends of Syria meeting in Tunisia. Diplomatic sources told CNN that a number of Arab nations are supplying arms to the Syrian opposition. The sources wouldn't identify which countries. In London, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton predicted the opposition will find willing sources to supply them with munitions to counter the Syrian government onslaught blamed for thousands of deaths since last March. ""There will be increasingly capable opposition forces,"" she said Thursday. ""They will find somewhere, somehow the means to defend themselves, as well as begin offensive measures and the pressure will build on Russia and China. World opinion is not going to stand idly by."" Russia and China both vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have condemned the Syrian government for attacking its people. Also Thursday, U.S. officials told CNN they are considering providing the opposition with nonlethal aid -- such as secure radio communications and training. That is a step beyond what the Obama administration was saying Tuesday, when it was still clinging to the hope that political solutions would end the bloodshed. ""We don't believe that it makes sense to contribute now to the further militarization of Syria, what we don't want to see is the spiral of violence increase,"" State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. ""That said, if we can't get Assad to yield to the pressure that we are all bringing to bear, we may have to consider additional measures."" Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu has recently suggested that, beyond humanitarian aid and diplomatic solutions, ""we need to think about contingencies as well."" Both the U.S. military and intelligence community have expressed concern about providing arms to an opposition whose composition is unclear. The 70-plus countries and international organizations gathering Friday in Tunis are expected to unveil a plan for delivering emergency aid to the Syrian people and issue a stern warning to President Bashar al-Assad. They want him to agree to an immediate cease-fire and provide access to humanitarian groups to deliver the aid or face a yet-to-be mentioned response from the world community. A draft of the document, shared with CNN, calls on ""the Syrian government to implement an immediate cease-fire and to allow free and unimpeded access by the United Nations and humanitarian agencies to carry out a full assessment of needs in Homs and other areas."" Diplomats cautioned the draft was subject to change. What's more, the communiquÃ© will recognize the opposition Syrian National Council, members of which will be at the session, as a credible representative of the Syrian people. The United States insists it will not provide weapons to the Syrian opposition, and will leave it to others who have expressed an interest in doing so. Nobody told Washington they armed the Libyans and officials said they expect the same nod-wink in Syria. Neither Russia, which is a Soviet-era ally and arms dealer to Syria, nor China is participating. Preparations for the Tunis meeting coincided with the release Thursday of a U.N. report that identifies Syrian commanders and high-ranking officials who may be responsible for ""widespread, systematic and gross human rights violations"" and apparent crimes against humanity. The violations have been conducted with the ""apparent knowledge and consent"" of the country's ""highest levels,"" the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic says. Thousands have died in Syria since mid-March of 2011, when the government launched a crackdown against protesters. At least 101 deaths were reported Thursday, including 14 children and a soldier killed when he refused to open fire on people, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Seventeen unidentified corpses were found in a military prison in the Zawiya Mountain area of Idlib province, the group said. Residents told the LCC they believe it's likely most of these unidentified bodies were of soldiers who had defected. Opposition forces reported more shelling of Homs, the 20th consecutive day of attacks on the besieged city at the center of resistance. On Thursday, the United Nations announced the appointment of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan as joint special envoy of the United Nations and Arab League on the Syrian crisis. Annan will be tackling an environment described by the U.N. commission report as one in which most of the citizenry is ""in a state of disarray."" ""The government has manifestly failed in its responsibility to protect the population,"" the report says. ""Anti-government armed groups have also committed abuses, although not comparable in scale and organization with those carried out by the state."" Meanwhile, Britain and France demanded Syrian President Bashar al-Assad cease attacks against Homs so three journalists can receive medical care, even as reports emerged Thursday of renewed shelling in the flashpoint city. The journalists were in Homs to document attacks by al-Assad's forces when they were wounded in shelling, which also killed American reporter Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. Al-Assad has denied targeting civilians, saying his forces are after ""terrorists"" and foreign fighters bent on destabilizing Syria. Evidence that civilians are being killed by government forces has been documented by citizen journalists who post their work on social media websites and YouTube. The opposition reports the death toll exceeds 9,000. CNN and other media outlets often cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because the Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. The Syrian Foreign Ministry denied Syria was responsible for the deaths on Wednesday of two journalists ""who infiltrated its territory on their own,"" according to a banner on Syrian state TV. The British Foreign Office summoned Sami Khiyami, the Syrian ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Political Director Sir Geoffrey Adams said Syria was expected to facilitate the return of the bodies of the two journalists and to provide medical treatment to British photographer Paul Conroy. Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier of Le Figaro were wounded in the shelling in the Homs neighborhood of Baba Amr. Bouvier said in a YouTube video that she needed immediate medical treatment. ""My leg is broken, the length of my femur. I need to be operated on as quickly as possible, the doctors have treated me as best as they can except they cannot perform any surgical operations, so I need as quickly as possible, during a cease-fire, a car with medical equipment or at least in good condition to take me to Lebanon to be treated as quickly as possible,"" she said. Dr. Mohammed Al-Mohammed, who has been treating the wounded journalists in Baba Amr, said Bouvier was in critical condition and Conroy had been moved to a ""safe house,"" which the physician said was a misnomer. ""The problem is that we don't have a safe place, anywhere secure, in Baba Amr,"" Al-Mohammed told CNN Thursday in an telephone interview. He bemoaned the lack of medical supplies. ""We just have the basics,"" he said. ""I have to admit, all very primitive."" CNN's Elise Labott, Hamdi Alkhshali, Brian Walker, Arwa Damon, Hala Gorani, Tom Watkins and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Arab nations providing arms to opposition, sources say .

"(CNN) -- Turkish police have swooped to detain 46 people as part of a widespread investigation into match-fixing in European football. Former Turkey international players Arif Erdem and Fatih Akyel were among those held, along with Bosnia goalkeeper Kenan Hasagic, Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News reported on Wednesday. Erdem is assistant coach of the Istanbul Municipality team, whose 3-1 victory in a Turkish Super League match against Genclerbirligi in May 2009 is under investigation by the Turkish Football Federation. The game had also come under suspicion from German prosecutors who launched a probe into match-fixing last year. Goalkeeper Recep Ozturk, who then played for Genclerbirligi but is now at Konyaspor, has also been detained after being accused of betting €30,000 ($40,000) against his own team, Hurriyet. Erdem played 60 times for his country and had a long career at leading club Galatasaray before retiring in 2005, and along with Akyel helped Turkey finish third at the 2002 World Cup. Hasagic has played for Bosnia Herzegovina in 29 international matches. The Turkish federation said its investigation was separate to the Bochum probe, which has targeted more than 200 matches in 11 countries. ""The federation filed a complaint to the Sariyer Prosecutor's office on August 4, 2009, regarding information it has on match-fixing doubts in three games,"" it said on its official Web site. ""The investigation by the Bochum prosecutors was made public in November, and the information and documents obtained from Bochum prosecutors and the UEFA have been shared with the Sariyer Prosecutor's Office."" Turkish police said the raids took place all across the country, according to the state-run Anatolia News Agency. ""As part of the investigation, 46 people have been detained from 26 different provinces. We are targeting 53 suspects,"" Istanbul police chief Huseyin Capkin said. The arrests came just three days after Swiss club Sion told prosecutors that last week's 2-0 defeat by Grasshoppers Zurich appeared to have been targeted by match-fixers. The club said on its Web site that information in betting shops before the game indicated that the result would be manipulated. European football's governing body UEFA announced last week that Ukrainian referee Oleh Orekhov had been banned for life based on information from German police's investigations into match-fixing and corruption. In China, which has also been trying to stamp out match-fixing, police arrested three referees this month. One of them, Lu Jun, officiated in two World Cup matches in 2002 but has been accused of accepting bribes before his retirement in 2005. Two clubs in China's top league have been relegated in relation to the investigations, which also saw the country's football head Nan Yong lose his job.","Turkish police hold 46 people as part of investigation into match-fixing in European football .

"(CNN) -- Images of the latest gleaming aircraft models regularly pepper websites (including this one), but where do all of those dead airplanes go? The numbers are huge: approximately 12,000 aircraft are set to be decommissioned by 2020. In addition, 2,000-3,000 planes are estimated to have been abandoned around the world (primarily in developing countries) according to the Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association (AFRA). As their aircraft near the end of their service lives, aircraft owners must find ways for dealing with retirees. For aircraft at that awkward stage when they're no longer safe to fly but still too sturdy to demolish, there are storage facilities like that at Marana Aerospace Solutions in Arizona or the Mohave Air and Space Port in California. The problem is, they're only temporary. While some parts -- especially engine parts -- practically sell themselves and find new homes on new planes, other airplane parts can get more innovative second lives, such as the ones featured below. Furniture . Futuristic rivets, elegant curves, gleaming surfaces and the ability to withstand extremes ... it's easy to see why furniture designers would be intrigued by the potential of decommissioned airplanes. The widely acknowledged leader in this niche industry is MotoArt, a California-based company that's been designing sleek, sexy beds, tables, chairs and sculptures constructed from deconstructed airplanes for more than a decade. ""We have over 100 designs and have produced thousands of pieces that you find nearly in all parts of the world, from the Dubai Burj, to the Sears Tower, and even as far away as the North Pole,"" says managing partner Dave Hall. Germany's bordbar, the first company that thought to revamp airline trolleys as multifunctional and decorative furniture, customizes trolleys. This can mean incorporating butterfly patterns or corporate logos, transforming the trolley into a filing cabinet or mini-bar, complete with shelves, glass front and LED lighting. ""We sell our products around the globe, with approximately 220 wholesalers,"" says bordbar co-founder Valentin Hartmann. ""There is definitely a market for trolleys."" Bordbar trolleys start at €979 ($1,300). German company Skypak also specializes in glammed-up airline trolleys, selling luxurious, attention-grabbing designs like the Pure Gold trolley, decorated with 24-carat gold leaf. The company's star product, the Luxury Crystal trolley, is covered in 82,000 Swarovski crystals. Skypak's trolleys start at €1,380 ($1,833), but luxury trolleys go for anywhere from €3,900 ($5,180) to €27,800 ($37,000). Floor and wall tile . Aircraft aluminum isn't like the aluminum most of us know. Because of the alloys that make it sturdy and fit for flight, it's also difficult to recycle. Bio-Luminum, a building material from U.S.-based Coverings ETC, is made from completely recycled aircraft aluminum. ""The energy used in recycling aluminum is 5% of what would be used during the first generation of aluminum production,"" says Jennifer Ryan, business development director for Coverings ETC. The best part is that Bio-Luminum is itself recyclable. ""So if you ever desire to change your decor, Bio-Luminum can be removed and used over again,"" says Ryan. ""It is truly a cradle-to-cradle product."" Boat . Planeboats, or ""flying boats,"" are rare (the Japanese Imperial Navy developed a fleet during World War II), but a former 1939 Boeing 307 Stratoliner converted into a boat that can reach up to 13 knots occupies a remarkable place in recycled plane lore. The boat has an unforgettable name -- the Cosmic Muffin -- as well as an equally interesting history. It belonged to aviation pioneer Howard Hughes in the 1940s. After it was re-christened by pilot Jimmy Buffett, its current owner, Dave Drimmer, purchased it in 1981 to live aboard. ""The original aircraft controls in the cockpit are now used to drive the boat with both the pilot and co-pilot controls,"" says Drimmer. ""This is what makes the planeboat so unique and novel; you sit where Howard Hughes used to fly the plane to drive the boat."" Jealous? Intensely curious? The Cosmic Muffin is open for tours and charters out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. House . Architect David Hertz's design, the Wing House, a Malibu mansion constructed from an entire Boeing 747, manages to be striking and graceful, even without the knowledge that it was built on ecologically sound principles. Via his website, Hertz compares the process of converting the 747 into a house to the way ""the Native American Indians used every part of the buffalo."" The most obviously aerial feature is the curvilinear roof, constructed from the wings of the former plane. Working with a smaller budget, but no less entrepreneurial, Oregon resident Bruce Campbell's Airplane Home is a structurally untouched Boeing 727-200 that's been gutted on the inside. Then there is Joe Axline's ""Project Freedom,"" involving two airplanes, an MD-80 and a DC-9-41, that have been converted into a home. Hotel . It's difficult to imagine a traveler disembarking from an airplane wanting to spend a night in one. But if the number of hotels built into airplanes is any indication, such travelers do exist. Costa Verde, a luxurious hotel located in a Costa Rican rainforest, is a recycled Boeing 727. Despite its clipped wings, from the exterior it looks like an aircraft emerging from the jungle ready to fly out over the Pacific. The fuselage that encases the two bedrooms of the ""727 Fuselage Home"" suite is intact. Apart from the distinctive shape of the portholes and curved ceiling, however, the interior feels more woodsy bungalow than aircraft. Meanwhile, Stockholm's Arlanda Airport has budget accommodation Jumbo Stay, a hostel built into a Boeing 747, popularly known as a Jumbo Jet. ""I financed and built the whole hostel,"" says owner Oscar Diös. ""We wanted to be unique, but not discriminating toward anyone with a smaller budget."" This welcoming attitude may be why the cockpit has served as the setting of several weddings, and why former 747 pilots are regular visitors. ""Jumbo Stay is a place for everyone,"" says Diös. For €350 ($465) a night, there's the Airplane Suite for two in the Netherlands. Built inside a decommissioned Ilyushin Il-18, it comes with amenities you couldn't have on a private jet -- Jacuzzi, sauna, flat-screen TVs and basic kitchen equipment, not to mention a mini-bar and DVD collection. Artificial reef . Most airplanes try to avoid submersion in large bodies of water. That sort of thing is usually called an ""accident."" But if the airplane is empty, then sinking it into the sea to create an artificial reef, like the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia (ARSBC) did with a Boeing 737, it might actually be a good thing, as they become homes for, and thus promote, local marine life. ""The 'passenger list' of creatures that now inhabit the reef has grown to over 100 species,"" says Deidre Forbes McCracken, director of public relations at the ARSBC. Anything else . Recycling an airplane means recycling the interior as well. Australian retailer Rushfaster stocks laptop messenger bags fitted with former airplane seatbelts as straps -- a good gift for university freshmen who need to lug around textbooks. Then there's British retailer Worn Again, with its Worn Again Virgin line. Though often out of stock (recycling depends on the availability of discarded materials), the company stocks a line of bags, clothes and accessories made from recycled Virgin Atlantic interiors. European architectural firm LOT-EK has ambitious concept designs for a library of more than 200 stacked Boeing fuselages; Sky Tram presents the idea of converting fuselages into futuristic supertrains that would run on tracks suspended several stories above the ground. Sure, these innovations don't actually exist. Yet. But people laughed at airplanes, too, until they really took off.

"(CNN) -- Madonna will hear Friday whether she will be allowed to adopt a child from Malawi, a spokeswoman for the African nation's attorney general told CNN Monday. Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007. The singer was in court in Malawi, one of the poorest nations in the world, on Monday for a hearing in the case, said Zione Ntaba, press officer for the country's Attorney General's Office. The judge read documents and questioned the parties, the spokeswoman said. Madonna should appear in person Friday to hear the judge's decision, Ntaba said. The child Madonna is seeking to adopt is named Chifundo James, she confirmed. ""Chifundo"" means ""Mercy,"" the name earlier reports have cited for the girl, Ntaba added. An uncle of the girl was scheduled to sign adoption papers Monday, according to Martin Geissler, a reporter for the ITN television network who is in Malawi, but he does not appear to have been in the court. The child's family will have to give their permission for the adoption to proceed, Geissler said, but need not be physically present in the court to do so. Madonna arrived at the court Monday morning in a convoy of four SUVs with black-out windows, Geissler said from the capital Lilongwe. Eight security guards prevented journalists and the press from getting too close to the 50-year-old singer. ""She's keeping very tight-lipped,"" Geissler said. Chifundo James is reported to be 4-years-old. She has two uncles and a grandfather, who were not in court Monday, Geissler said. An international charity has criticized Madonna's plan to adopt the child. ""The best place for a child is in his or her family in their home community,"" spokesman Dominic Nutt of Save the Children said in a statement. ""Most children in orphanages have one parent still living, or have an extended family that can care for them in the absence of their parents."" The charity argued that foreign adoptions should happen only if a child does not have any relatives, and all other options have been considered. Under Malawian law, foreign adopters would have to spend a year or more living in the African country with the children they want to adopt, Geissler said. The rules were put in place to prevent child trafficking. The purpose of the law, Ntaba explained, is for the authorities to observe the prospective parent to make sure the relationship is not abusive -- ""that the parent will behave well around the child,"" she said. She said that American or British social services may also provide the monitoring and in the case of David Banda, the first Malawian child Madonna adopted, Malawi social services officers traveled to the United Kingdom to visit the child in Madonna's home. The judge has the discretion to allow Madonna to take the child home with her immediately, Geissler said. She is scheduled to leave Saturday, he said. Madonna adopted David Banda from Malawi in 2006. She has two other children. Press reports say Chifundo James's teenaged mother died days after giving birth to her, Geissler said. She lives in an orphanage. ""Madonna first came into contact with her a few years ago and fell in love with her,"" he added. ""She has always had in mind that this is the girl she was going to come back and adopt."" Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years. She made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" which highlighted poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating Malawi's children. She also helps run a nonprofit, Raising Malawi, which implements initiatives to help the needy in the southeastern Africa nation. On Sunday, Madonna arrived in Malawi and toured the village of Chinkhota, assessing plans to build a school there and other possible Raising Malawi investments. Do you think Madonna should be allowed to adopt another child? CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","Madonna will learn Friday if she can adopt another Malawian child .

"(CNN) -- Two NASA rovers are about 5,200 miles apart on the surface of Mars and will likely never meet. But though they roam alone, Curiosity and Opportunity continue to reveal details about the Red Planet's former habitable conditions. New studies in the journal Science describe insights from each of those rovers about ancient environments where microorganisms could have once lived. ""These results demonstrate that early Mars was habitable, but this does not mean that Mars was inhabited,"" writes John Grotzinger, lead scientist on the Curiosity mission, in an introduction to the studies in the journal Science. We've been hearing a lot about how the two-ton, car-sized Curiosity rover has been finding evidence that Mars may have hosted life at some point. Last year NASA came out and said that yes, Mars was once habitable. The new research reinforces that statement from Curiosity's vantage point, and adds the perspective of the Opportunity rover, which has found a different ancient habitable environment on another part of the planet. Opportunity is smaller -- weighing 384 pounds, and about 5 feet in both length and height -- and older, having landed January 25, 2004, at a place called Meridiani Planum. It has driven just under 25 miles in a decade, and is currently situated in a place called Endeavour Crater. What Opportunity has found . Opportunity does not have the tools required to detect carbon or nitrogen -- chemicals required for life -- directly. But it has been able to find smectite clay minerals -- which form in the presence of water -- in rocks on the rim of Endeavour Crater, with supporting evidence from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter orbiting above. Mystery rock spotted on Mars . Scientists directed Opportunity to a place on the crater rim where the orbiter suggested these clays could be found. There, Opportunity uncovered evidence of rocks that preexisted the formation of the crater. Scientists believe the crater's rim formed more than 3.7 billion years ago. ""These are rocks that were happy on the surface, and along comes the asteroid or the comet that formed Endeavour, and the rocks were uplifted on the rim, and then the ejecta was plopped right on top of them,"" said Raymond Arvidson, lead study author and planetary scientist with the rover missions. The ancient rocks are called the Matijevic formation. They are fine-grained, layered rocks with dark veneers that are carrying iron clays that suggest water with a neutral to only slightly acidic pH was once in the area. Opportunity showed scientists fractures across these ancient rocks they wanted to explore. The rover's rock-abrasion tool allowed scientists to uncover an aluminous clay that could be formed in only mildly acidic, and non-oxidizing waters. ""Whether or not life got started and evolved in that particular niche, in this groundwater percolating through the fractures, remains to be seen,"" Arvidson said. But in a younger rock formation called the Burns formation, which largely filled in the crater, the rover found evidence of a more acidic and very oxidizing environment. This suggests that the environment was less hospitable after the formation of Endeavour Crater. Curious findings . Curiosity, on the other hand, landed in Gale Crater, and helped scientists determine that an area called Yellowknife Bay was habitable in ancient times. Here, from the rim of the crater came stream waters that formed ""a lake-stream-groundwater system that might have existed for millions of years,"" Grotzinger wrote. His other car is on Mars . Smectite clay minerals there indicate there was a moderate to neutral pH, and the lack of sulfate minerals suggest also that there was not an acidic environment, Grotzinger wrote. This ancient habitable environment seems completely different from what Opportunity found at the Matijevic formation on Endeavour Crater, Arvidson said. Yellowknife Bay is probably younger, and definitely a sedimentary environment. All this suggests three distinct periods in Martian history, Arvidson said. In the first, in the early days, lots of water flowed on the surface, with lakes and groundwater flowing through, as represented by the Matijevic formation that Opportunity found and the mudstone in Yellowknife Bay that Curiosity found. One theory is that these warm, wet surface conditions took place in early times, when the planet's iron-nickel core was still at least partially molten, Arvidson said. The molten core provided a magnetic field around it that shielded the atmosphere, scientists believe. The Burns formation, as examined by Opportunity, represents a later period -- likely, a drying out of Mars -- with more acidic, oxidizing waters. Volcanic activity was probably dying down, and the magnetic field waning. Lake beds were turned into sand dunes. ""Then the whole system shut off,"" Arvidson said. The planet became what we see today: Cold and dry. Curiosity is equipped to find organic molecules, but finding them may be difficult. Assuming such molecules were enriched, and not destroyed when sediment turned into rock, they would have also needed to survive ionizing radiation. Another new study in Science describes the radiation environment on Mars, and suggests that, in theory, organics could have been preserved from millions of years ago -- but the indication of them might be much weaker now. What's next for the rovers . The Curiosity rover, representing a $2.5 billion mission, is now on its way to Mount Sharp, a sedimentary formation that will allow the rover to explore Mars' history by driving up the peak's slope and exploring rock chemical composition layer by layer. NASA is planning to launch another Curiosity-sized rover in 2020, which could collect samples that later missions might return to Earth. Opportunity will continue exploring Endeavour Crater, moving southward to see if there are more of these ancient rocks from a more livable time. But Opportunity's twin, Spirit, isn't going anywhere. Spirit also landed in January 2004, on the opposite side of the planet, and got stuck in the soft soil of a place called Troy. That location turned out to be a scientific gold mine. Spirit showed evidence that water, possibly in the form of snow melt, had trickled into the subsurface relatively recently, and continuously. Spirit has been defunct since it stopped communicating in 2010. The other rovers are too far away from it to pay their respects. Objective of 2020 mission to Mars: Signs of life, NASA says .

"(CNN) -- The first question for many relatives of the victims of MH17, as for us after Lockerbie, will be whether their loved ones suffered. Explosive decompression of an aircraft fuselage at 35,000 feet will cause almost instantaneous loss of consciousness. Explosive decompression is a terribly apt phrase. If it turns out to be true that MH17 was hit by a Buk Soviet-era SA missile, their warheads contain about 140 times the explosive in the PA 103 bomb. It seems impossible therefore that anyone aboard could have remained aware to suffer in the aftermath. The essence of the tragedy of MH17 is the suffering of the relatives. Some will need to view the bodies of those they lost. Surely they deserve security to say their last farewells. They should have that option. Bodies need to be treated with respect and precision of identification. I believe that in the case of MH17 the United Nations should also oversee immediate sending of an international team of investigators, covered by force if necessary, to ensure that relatives' needs, the bodies themselves and the evidence field are protected. It is already very late, but not too late. There has already been looting, abhorrent to relatives, there is something particularly unsavory about the thought of unauthorised interference with bodies, or indeed personal effects of the dead. There will now be some uncertainty about the evidential material on site. Maybe the U.N. should in future have a standby arrangement for immediate deployment of such an international ""sterilizing force."" Even in the case of Lockerbie, evidence emerged in court of improper interference with potentially evidential material on the crash site within Scotland. In the UK we found that a relatives' group predicated on the concept of allowing everyone to grieve in their own way, but always there to support its members, helped. The humanist, highly caring, relative co-ordinating our group cannot know how many of us she has helped through her dedication and skills. One of the most difficult yet most rewarding aspects of Christ's philosophy was to extend love to others even when they seem to be your enemy. We have witnessed the bitterness and personal destruction that can spring from rampant lust for revenge. Lust for revenge is natural, but self-defeating, for the consequence of revenge is so often further revenge. Nor does it even bring peace of mind to the avenger. Of course we condemn the actions of perpetrators and would rightly have them punished for what they have done, but we don't have to hate the perpetrators themselves. Imprisoned, they may emerge one day to do good. The late Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu helped to create the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. That concept can only work if truth precedes the attempts at reconciliation. Truth may become a fickle wraith for families to pursue through the labyrinth of International politics. It was Mandela too who publicly warned, long before the trial of those accused by the U.S. and UK of responsibility for Lockerbie, that: ""No one country should be complainant, prosecutor and judge."" The West ignored this warning. It is perhaps significant that the Netherlands, which lost far more citizens in MH17 than any other country, finds herself already the home of the International Criminal Court. Powerful governments have powerful means of controlling what we know and believe. International courts should be immune to that. Perversely it was the evidence produced at the Lockerbie trial in Zeist, Holland, which confirmed for some that Moammar Gaddafi's Libya was responsible. But for other close watchers, there were doubts there which have now greatly increased and led 25 UK Lockerbie relatives, together with members of the family of the one Libyan found guilty, recently to lodge a request for a third appeal against the Zeist verdict with Scotland's Criminal Case Review Commission. Nowadays we have a better route, through the International Criminal Court, and what those of us who are not MH17 relatives should do is to monitor and encourage all efforts to pass the whole known truth to the MH17 relatives and to discover and detain those responsible. It is no coincidence that Holland already hosts the ICC, for that nation's record in support of international justice is outstanding. MH17 relatives may also find help from the small UK charity Disaster Action. This cannot deal with so huge a tragedy directly but carries within it wisdom distilled from Lockerbie and other tragedies.

"Washington (CNN) -- Big tech firms and private prisons represent two industries vigorously lobbying to influence the scope of legislation aimed at overhauling U.S. immigration policy, a political priority in Washington. Microsoft, Facebook, and Intel want lawmakers to support increasing the number of visas available to highly skilled workers, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics. Others, like Corrections Corporation of America, which builds detention facilities to house illegal immigrants, have contributed heavily to the campaigns of lawmakers who take tough stances on the issue. In all, 359 lobbying clients pressed their positions on immigration reform to officials at nearly every level of government, including the White House, Congress and the Homeland Security Department, according to the analysis for 2012. The figure is up from the 317 clients lobbying on immigration from the previous year. It is difficult to track exactly how much each spends on lobbying an issue, campaign finance experts say. However, tracking the number of times something specific is mentioned on disclosure reports indicates its importance to a company or industry. ""They're not spending this money just willy-nilly. They have a goal and they're trying to achieve that goal legislatively,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group. ""You have to be sure they're writing the legislation for the right reasons and not just trying to benefit one particular company,"" Ellis said. President Barack Obama underscored the need for comprehensive immigration reform earlier this year stressing the need to better enforce related laws, provide a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented workers already in the country and reform the legal immigration system. The so-called ""Gang of Eight"" in the Senate and a similar bipartisan group in the House are working on crafting a reform framework leading up to what could be one of the year's biggest legislative showdowns. What's in Senate immigration plan? ""The reason immigration is on the table now is the outcome of the last election,"" said Judith Gans, manager of the immigration policy program at the University of Arizona. ""No political party likes to lose and the Republican party realized that their unfriendly stance toward immigrants was creating a coalition in the Democratic Party."" The upcoming legislative battle will create winners and losers, and businesses are doing everything they can to ensure they can influence the outcome. ""We will see Congress make it easier for that high-skilled, cutting-edged talent to come to the U.S. But if they don't address the channels for low skilled workers to come to the U.S., illegal immigration will continue,"" Gans said. The nation's tech sector, which has come to rely strongly on highly trained and science-savvy foreign workers, has long had a vested interest in immigration policy. When Congress failed to take action on the issue, big business and their lobbyists turned their attention to agencies and lawmakers for support in increasing the number of H-1B visas. Those are used by companies to temporarily employ foreign workers with special skills. But H-1B visas are capped at 65,000 annually for those with undergraduate or professional degrees. Another 20,000 are reserved for candidates with graduate-level credentials. The competition is fierce for slots and available caps are often exhausted quickly. Microsoft spent $8 million last year in broader lobbying efforts and filed 33 disclosure reports dealing with immigration â€” twice the number of lobbying reports of companies like Intel. Microsoft, which contributed $814,645 to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign, submitted four reports showing that some of its lobbying efforts were directed at the executive office of the president. The company also lobbied Congress and 22 other federal agencies and offices on issues like corporate tax reform and antitrust law. But the second-highest number of lobbying reports filed by the company dealt with immigration. Other tech companies also lobbied heavily. Intel spent $3.7 million in overall lobbying and filed 16 reports. Facebook spent $3.9 million in overall lobbying and filed eight reports, including those for lobbying the executive office of the president and the White House. ""The reality is that in the United States, we are creating unfilled jobs faster than we are creating new filled positions,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's executive vice president and general counsel, said during a speech at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution last year about his industry's need for more highly-skilled workers. Tech companies say they look for qualified U.S. workers first, but are having a tough time finding college graduates with the needed skills to work in science and technology fields. A significant portion of these corporate workforces are comprised of well educated, highly-skilled foreign nationals who are highly sought after and can only go to work for an American company if they are extended an H1-B visa. Intel says it is encouraged by legislative changes in the works. Several proposals to expand the available number of visas are working their way through Congress. These include a bipartisan measure sponsored in part by Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate. The lawmaker is also part of the ""Gang of Eight"" working on comprehensive immigration reform, which both parties view as a priority for capturing support from Hispanics, whose influence politically is growing. Politicians also are weighing the impact on business and how attracting the best workers helps innovation, product development and productivity. ""Immigration reform is critical issue for Intel,"" said company spokeswoman, Lisa Malloy. ""In the last year, we have seen growing bipartisan support for high-skilled, employment-based visa reform. This is very encouraging to Intel."" Another ""Gang of Eight"" member, Sen. John McCain has changed his views on immigration over the years. For instance, the Arizona Republican first supported and later opposed a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He is also the fourth-highest recipient of campaign donations from Corrections Corporation of America. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Kentucky Republicans, are other notable recipients of that company's campaign donations, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. ""The private prison industry is responsible for 16% of federal prisoners in the U.S. and makes a substantial portion of its profits from detention centers for illegal immigrants,"" the group said. ""Illegal immigration creates a pool of potential prisoners and there's some incentive to them wanting to have input on those policies,"" Gans said. In one case last year, lobbyists representing CCA were paid $60,000 to monitor ""issues pertaining to the construction and management of private prisons and detention facilities,"" according a federal lobbying disclosure report. Corrections Corporation of America spent $970,000 last year to lobby Congress and the U.S. Marshals Service on a variety of issues. It says it supports a bipartisan group of lawmakers who support or are ""open minded to the merits of public-private partnership and the related services we provide."" The company says its lobbying effort has been aimed at ensuring it understands reforms related to new civil detention facilities being pursued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""Not a single firm hired by CCA lobbies on our behalf for or against immigration enforcement or detention policies. Every firm we engage with is contractually bound to adhering to this strict policy. The primary focus of our lobbying efforts is education on the merits and benefits of public-private partnership in corrections and detention generally, and the relevant services CCA provides,"" said company spokesman Steven Owen. Construction, agricultural, leisure and hospitality were among other industries also lobbying Congress and federal agencies heavily last year on such issues as changing the nation's guest worker program. Whether spending on immigration lobbying will have any impact remains to be seen, policy and lobbying experts say. ""Lobbying on immigration reform is like lobbying on any complicated legislation in DC: messy and unpredictable. Just as with tax reform and health care reform, every affected constituency in the immigration debate is pushing their own agenda,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a veteran immigration attorney. ""Sometimes the stars align and a bill gets passed,"" Yale-Loehr said. ""Often, however, the effort fails, despite or because of everyone's efforts.""","Companies push immigration reform lobbying blitz for different reasons .
Microsoft, Intel, Facebook want more visas for highly-skilled workers .
Private prisons want tough immigration laws to help keep detention facilities filled .
Lobbying efforts could help craft immigration reform legislation ."
"(CNN) -- Stomach for the fight, matched by a stomach for waffles and hash browns. Bubba Watson, the American golfer who has just become a multiple golf winner, showed he had the appetite for both as he secured his second Masters win, adding another green jacket to the one he won in 2012. As he walked down the 18th fairway, Watson was able to soak up the atmosphere and prepare for a celebratory trip to the Waffle House. A far cry from his nerve-shredding playoff win over Louis Oosthuizen at Augusta National two years ago. ""I wanted to start celebrating but my caddie was in my ear saying, 'Not yet, not yet. Wait until we putt out and then celebrate all you want,'"" the 35-year-old told CNN before a winner's dinner of waffles and hash browns. ""It's a different feeling when you know you can four-putt the last hole and still win, it only took me two. It's a lot better feeling, the stomach feels a lot better this way than it did in the playoff!"" Watson finished eight-under par for the tournament after a three-under final round of 69 saw him stretch three strokes clear of compatriot Jordan Spieth and Sweden's Jonas Blixt, the Masters debutantes who tied for second place. ""I see myself as a guy who loves the game of golf and tries to get better at it,"" beamed the new world No. 4. The bedrock of Watson's success is his thumping drive, his ability to hammer the ball over 350 yards perfectly suited to the Augusta course. When Watson won the first major of his 11-year pro career in 2012, it coincided with him and his wife adopting a baby boy, Caleb. His son was one of the first people to embrace Watson on the 18th green. ""That was a big deal,"" said Watson. ""For us, being adopted parents, our story, trying to explain to him how much we love him and we care for him. ""If he loves golf it's going to be great for him because he'll see that he was at Augusta. For him growing up, it will be great for our family to be able to explain all of this to him."" If Watson's latest triumph is proof that he is no one-hit wonder, he showed no sign of getting carried away by his success.

"(CNN) -- Democrats spend so much time defending President Obama, it is easy to forget that even the most beloved presidents make mistakes and missteps. His new budget, which proposes a method of calculating inflation that will reduce increases in Social Security payments, is a doozy. Reps. Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva, co-chairs of the Progressive Caucus, have been raising the alarm for months. Reps. Alan Grayson and Mark Takano circulated a letter firmly pledging to vote against any social safety net cuts. As of this moment, 33 representatives have signed. Now, Obama is also getting pushback from outside Congress. Opposition runs the political gamut from the AFL-CIO to nonpartisan AARP to anti-tax activist Grover Norquist. A coalition of grass-roots organizations has organized to stop the cuts. It includes the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, MoveOn.org, Democracy for America, Social Security Works, Credo Action, my organization Rebuild the Dream and more. Many of these groups supported the president in 2012. On Tuesday, they presented the signatures of more than 2 million Americans opposed to cutting Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid benefits. Some may call this a knee-jerk response from liberals who would oppose any adjustments to New Deal programs. They are wrong. Progressives must be willing to reform programs such as Social Security, precisely because they are so important. The question is how? There are better solutions that the president could champion. For example, we could shore up Social Security for decades by raising the cap on taxable income -- so that it is not just poor and middle-class folks whose entire paychecks are taxed. But Obama's plan leaves that cap in place -- protecting the wealthiest Americans. Instead of asking more from the rich to shore up Social Security, his proposed budget would take more from the middle class and poor. Don't let all the D.C. jargon fool you. Some in Washington would have us believe that Obama's ""Chained CPI"" proposal is a mere tweak that more accurately reflects costs. Not true. By changing the fine print on cost-of-living adjustments, Obama's plan would ensure that benefits rise more slowly than inflation. That would have devastating impacts on ordinary people immediately upon passage, hurt more tomorrow and get worse each year. Under his plan, as food and medicine gets more expensive, your Social Security check would grow only a tiny bit. This approach may help the government's balance sheet, but it would hurt your pocketbook and your family. It is not cost savings; it is cost-shifting. To people who paid into the program for their entire lives, it is a cut -- plain and simple. Prices are rising even faster than inflation on things such as health care, which the elderly consume at a greater rate. The most accurate adjustment for inflation would actually give senior citizens more -- not less, which is what they would get under Obama's proposal. Our leaders should be trying to make life easier for middle-class families, not harder. Second, we are told that we cannot balance the budget without cutting the social safety net. But we didn't get into a budgetary hole because we spent too much money helping grandma. We have a budget imbalance because of the Bush wars and Bush tax cuts, combined with the economic downturn. Yet the Obama budget eliminates the recent automatic cuts to the Pentagon budget, even as it cuts Social Security and increases Medicare premiums for middle-class seniors. It doesn't make any sense. The administration says these cuts would come about only in the context of a so-called ""balanced"" compromise. But the numbers tell a different story. Economist Dean Baker notes that these cuts would hit the average retiree three times as hard as the recent tax increases hit the top 1%. Budgets are a vision for the country expressed in dollars. Obama's budget is far better than the Republican alternative. But it is time to start expecting more from the man elected twice to speak for the middle class. Bad ideas from a great president are still bad ideas. Everyone who pulled the lever for Obama in November should call the White House today, and say simply: Mr. President, this is not change we can believe in. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that President Obama was the first Democratic president to propose changes to reduce future Social Security benefits. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Van Jones.","Van Jones: Obama's budget proposed changes that will hurt Social Security recipients .
He says opposition to new formula for calculating inflation increases is strong .
Jones: Don't reduce benefits, raise cap on Social Security taxes so wealthy pay more .
Even a great president can make mistakes, and Obama made one here, he says ."
"London (CNN) -- Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday told an international summit on ending sexual violence in conflict that it was time for the world to banish the crime ""to the history books where it belongs."" ""It's time for us in an age where we see enough of chaos, failed and failing states, to write a new norm, one that protects women, girls, men, boys, protects them from these unspeakable crimes,"" he said. Kerry's words came on the final day of the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, hosted this week in London by UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and Hollywood star and U.N. special envoy Angelina Jolie. Kerry called on governments to end a culture of impunity for war-zone rape, for perpetrators to be held accountable and for victims to be supported, not ostracized by their communities. Representatives of more than 100 countries attended the summit, as well as hundreds of experts, survivors, faith leaders, and staffers from NGOs and international organizations. ""This conference, the largest of its kind in history, is about forcing the world to stop looking away,"" said Kerry. ""There is a real and critical role for governments to play in this fight."" Kerry also had a message for those who say that sexual violence in war is too ingrained to be wiped out: Look at what has already been done by the ""civilized world"" when its conscience is stirred. He cited efforts to stamp out the use of chemical weapons and nuclear weapons as examples of the world's ability to shift course after realizing the horror of mankind's actions. ""So when people ask if we can actually outlaw sexual violence in warfare, the answer is a resounding yes; yes we can achieve this goal."" The summit organizers have established four goals: Ending the culture of impunity by agreeing on an international protocol for documenting and investigating sexual violence in conflict zones; taking practical steps to protect women, including by training soldiers and peacekeepers; increasing support for survivors and human rights activists; and achieving a ""seismic shift"" in attitudes so that the problem is recognized and tackled globally. Jolie, who was joined at the summit by fiance Brad Pitt, gave opening remarks Tuesday. ""It is a myth that rape is an inevitable part of conflict,"" she said. There's nothing inevitable about it. It is a weapon of war aimed at civilians. It has nothing to do with sex, everything to do with power.""","Secretary of State John Kerry says world must ""write a new norm"" on sexual violence in war .

"(CNN) -- Darrell Royal, the football coach who led the University of Texas to at least a share of three national championships in the 1960s and 1970s, died Wednesday in Austin after a battle with Alzheimer's disease. He was 88. Royal is the winningest coach at Texas, one of college football's biggest programs. He compiled a 167-45-5 record at Texas from 1957 to 1976 and helped offensive coordinator Emory Bellard introduce the wishbone option offense to the Longhorns and to college football in the late 1960s. He was also Texas' athletic director from 1962 to 1980 before being inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983. ""No words are adequate to describe the impact Darrell Royal had on this state, the university, UT athletics and Texas football,"" Texas Athletics Director DeLoss Dodds said Wednesday. ""He was simply the foundation, the beginning. Anywhere you look today, on this campus, you see his fingerprints."" Royal, who played quarterback for Oklahoma from 1946 to 1949, began his collegiate head coaching career as a 30-year-old at Mississippi State in 1954. He also coached Washington in 1956. But he made his biggest mark at Texas, where he inherited a 1-9 team and turned in a 6-3-1 record in his first season in 1957, guiding the Longhorns to the first of 16 bowl appearances they'd make over the next 20 years. His Longhorns topped the national polls in 1963 and 1969 with 11-0 records. In 1970, the 10-1 Texas squad claimed a share of the national title. He never had a losing record in 23 seasons as a head college football coach, with a three-college record of 184-60-5. The wishbone formation, the three-running-back set that Bellard debuted on a collegiate level at Texas under Royal's guidance in 1968, helped the Longhorns go on a 30-game winning streak and spread to other colleges. Dodds said Wednesday that the current Texas team would honor Royal during Saturday's home game against Iowa State at his namesake Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. ""I think [head coach] Mack Brown has said this, but our first play from scrimmage on Saturday will be out of the wishbone,"" Dodds said. Brown said he lost ""a wonderful friend, a mentor, a confidant and my hero."" ""College football lost maybe its best ever, and the world lost a great man,"" Brown said, according to a university release. ""... His impact on the game, the coaches and players, the community and the millions of lives he touched, is insurmountable."" Royal is survived by his wife, Edith, the university said.

"(CNN) -- Goals at the end of each half from Demba Ba and Willian threw an enthralling EPL title race wide open as Chelsea secured a 2-0 win at leaders Liverpool Sunday. The defeat ended a run of 11 straight wins for Liverpool, who were frustrated by the tactical wiles of Jose Mourinho's visitors, to leave their bid for a first English championship in 24 years in the balance. Chelsea have closed to within two points but it is Manchester City who have emerged as the most likely challengers after a 2-0 win at Crystal Palace in the late game Sunday. First half goals from Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure gave City a comfortable victory and the knowledge that if can win their final three games they will repeat their 2012 EPL title triumph. City still remained in third place, three points adrift, but have a game in hand over the top two. Earlier, Chelsea, who held Atletico Madrid goalless in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal in midweek, made seven changes from that starting line-up, but it scarcely showed in a resilient display. They went ahead just before halftime as Senegal star Ba continued his recent run of crucial goals after a slip by Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. Liverpool, who have scored a leading 96 goals in the EPL this season, were restricted to few chances with Luis Suarez unable to add to his personal tally of 30. His second half effort was saved by Mark Schwarzer and the veteran Australian goalkeeper also kept out shots from Joe Allen and Gerrard. Desperately pushing forward at the end, Chelsea were caught by a sucker punch as substitute Fernando Torres broke clear and unselfishly played in Willian for the clinching second in injury time. ""A magnificent performance from all my team,"" was the verdict of Mourinho, who will be hoping they can repeat the success when they entertain Atletico in the second leg Wednesday. His Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers was less than impressed by Chelsea's stifling tactics. ""I think there were two buses parked today, never mind one,"" he told Sky Sports. ""It was like a back six with three midfield players in front of that. That's 10, with the goalkeeper, for 90 consistently behind the ball. ""It was clear that they'd come certainly not wanting to win the game, with the time-wasting and whatnot,"" he added. Mourinho has received a further boost, which he revealed during his post-match press conference. Key defender John Terry, who looked set for a long absence after injuring his ankle in the Atletico draw, may be fit to make an earlier return. ""He has a chance,"" Mourinho said. ""Let's see tomorrow and after tomorrow. After the match against Atletico, I said no chance. In this moment, I say maybe."" His Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers was less than impressed by Chelsea's stifling tactics . Earlier Sunday, Sunderland, whose shock victory last week at Chelsea so dented the title hopes of Mourinho's men, carried on that superb form with a 4-0 thrashing of fellow strugglers Cardiff. Conor Wickham scored a double, his fifth goal in three games, as Sunderland moved out of the bottom three but left their Welsh opponents in deep relegation trouble.","Chelsea win 2-0 at Liverpool in crunch EPL title match .

"(CNN) -- George Zimmerman's wife was arrested Tuesday afternoon for allegedly lying at his bond hearing about the couple's finances. Shellie N. Zimmerman, 25, faces a perjury charge, according to Jackie Barnard, spokeswoman for the State Attorney's office for the Fourth Judicial District of Florida. She met conditions for a $1,000 bond and was released Tuesday afternoon, according to the Seminole County Sheriff's Office. At her husband's April 20 bond hearing, Shellie Zimmerman was asked whether the couple had financial means to assist in the defense. ""Uhm, not -- not that I'm aware of,"" she replied, according to a probable cause affidavit filed Monday. She also testified under oath she was not aware of how much had been raised from a website soliciting cash for George Zimmerman's defense in the February shooting death of Trayvon Martin, 17, in Sanford, Florida. Zimmerman said he acted in self-defense. In April, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder after the case was referred to a state attorney for a review. He was released from custody later that month after posting bail. On June 1, Seminole County Judge Kenneth Lester Jr. ordered Zimmerman back to jail, accusing the suspect of not being truthful about how much money he had access to when his bond was set. Prosecutors alleged that George Zimmerman, 28, actually had about $135,000. According to the affidavit, prepared by an investigator with the State Attorney's office, the Zimmermans discussed finances via phone before the April 20 bond hearing. Those talks included the transfer of money from George Zimmerman's account to accounts of his sister and wife, according to the affidavit. Records show $47,000 was transferred from George Zimmerman's account to his sister's account from April 16 and 17, authorities allege. Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $74,000 from her husband's account to her account from April 16 to April 19, the affidavit states. George Zimmerman asked his wife in jail calls to ""pay off all the bills,"" including an American Express bill and a Sam's Club card, prosecutors allege. On April 24, after his release on bond, Shellie Zimmerman transferred more than $85,500 from her account back to George Zimmerman's account, according to the affidavit. Shellie Zimmerman will be arraigned July 31. Prosecutors have alleged the Zimmermans spoke in code when discussing the money in a credit union account, according to court documents filed by State Attorney Angela B. Corey. Zimmerman ""fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the PayPal account to defendant and his wife's credit union accounts,"" Corey said in court records. ""This occurred prior to the time defendant was arguing to the court that he was indigent and his wife had no money."" The judge ""relied on false representations and statements"" by Zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $150,000, Corey said. Zimmerman was required to post only 10% of that. Defense lawyers have argued that ""the vast majority of the funds in question are in an independently managed trust"" that Zimmerman and his attorneys cannot access directly. ""The audio recordings of Mr. Zimmerman's phone conversation while in jail make it clear that Mr. Zimmerman knew a significant sum had been raised by his original fundraising website,"" attorneys said last week. ""We feel the failure to disclose these funds was caused by fear, mistrust and confusion. The gravity of this mistake has been distinctly illustrated, and Mr. Zimmerman understands that this mistake has undermined his credibility, which he will have to work to repair."" The attorneys said Zimmerman did disclose the existence of the funds five days after the bond hearing, during his first conversation with the defense about the fund. ""When the defense team learned of the funds, we disclosed this to the court and to the State Attorney's Office, and the money was transferred to the Legal Defense Fund, which is now independently managed,"" the defense said. Of the $204,000 raised by the website, about $150,000 is now in the defense fund and $30,000 was used ""to make the complicated transition from private life in Sanford, Florida, to a life in hiding as a defendant in a high-profile court case."" The remainder, about $20,000, ""was kept liquid to provide living expenses for the first several months as the legal process unfolds,"" attorneys said.","Shellie N. Zimmerman makes bond .

"London (CNN) -- The UK Home Office will hold an independent public inquiry into the 2006 death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, it announced Tuesday. The Home Office said this inquiry will be independent from an ongoing government inquest.

Sir Robert Owen will chair the inquiry. He is the coroner for the government inquest. ""It is more than seven years since Mr Litvinenko's death and this government remains committed to seeking justice for his family,"" a Home Office statement said. ""It is hoped this inquiry will go some way to achieve this goal."" A public inquiry, unlike an inquest, can receive evidence behind closed doors. In Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security, and his widow, Marina Litvinenko, has argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for his poisoning, an accusation the Kremlin has strongly denied.

She said that with the coroner's backing, she pressed for the public inquiry ""when we realized that the coroner isn't able to prove the Russian state's involvement in what happened."" She called for a judicial review of the government's decision. ""I believe that we will find the truth, because I believe that British law can work,"" she said. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor.

"(CNN) -- Gabriel García Márquez, the influential, Nobel Prize-winning author of ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" and ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" has died, his family and officials said. He was 87. The literary giant was treated in April for infections and dehydration at a Mexican hospital. García Márquez, a native of Colombia, is widely credited with helping to popularize ""magical realism,"" a genre ""in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination,"" as the Nobel committee described it upon awarding him the prize for literature in 1982. He was sometimes called the most significant Spanish-language author since Miguel de Cervantes, the 16th-century author of ""Don Quixote"" and one of the great writers in Western literature. Indeed, Chilean poet Pablo Neruda told Time that ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" was ""the greatest revelation in the Spanish language since the Don Quixote of Cervantes."" The author's cousin, Margarita Marquez, and Colombia's ambassador to Mexico, José Gabriel Ortiz, confirmed the author's death to CNN on Thursday. ""We're left with the memories and the admiration to all Colombians and also Mexicans because I think Gabo was half Mexican and half Colombian. He's just as admired in Mexico as he is in (his native) Colombia, all of Latin America and throughout the world,"" Ortiz told CNN en Español. Share your memories with CNN's iReport . ""I believe they were somehow emotionally ready for this regrettable outcome. They knew he was suffering from a complex, terminal disease and was an elderly man. I believe (Garcia Marquez's widow Mercedes Barcha) was getting ready for this moment, although nobody can really prepare themselves for a moment like this."" In a televised speech Thursday night, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos declared three days of national mourning, ordering flags to be lowered to half-staff across the country. The author -- known by his nickname ""Gabo"" throughout Latin America -- was born in the northern Colombian town of Aracataca, which became the inspiration for Macondo, the town at the center of ""Solitude,"" his 1967 masterpiece, and referenced in such works as his novella ""Leaf Storm"" and the novel ""In Evil Hour."" ""I feel Latin American from whatever country, but I have never renounced the nostalgia of my homeland: Aracataca, to which I returned one day and discovered that between reality and nostalgia was the raw material for my work,"" reads a mural quoting the author outside of town. García Márquez was tickled that he had earned so much praise for his fertile imagination. ""The truth is that there's not a single line in all my work that does not have a basis in reality. The problem is that Caribbean reality resembles the wildest imagination,"" he told The Paris Review in 1981. A storyteller's childhood . García Márquez's early life was shaped by both familial and political conflict. His grandfather, a widely respected figure known as the Colonel, was a liberal military man who strongly disagreed with the political views of García Márquez's father, a conservative telegraph operator who became a pharmacist. (His father's ardent pursuit of his mother later inspired ""Love in the Time of Cholera."") Their political disagreement came to reflect that of Colombia as a whole, a country that spent a postwar decade in the grip of what was called ""La Violencia,"" a civil war that followed the assassination of a populist leader. García Márquez spent his early childhood with his grandparents while his parents pursued a living in the coastal city of Barranquilla. Both his grandparents were excellent storytellers, and García Márquez soaked in their tales. From his grandfather he learned of military men, Colombian history and the terrible burden of killing; from his grandmother came folk tales, superstitions and ghosts among the living. His grandmother's stories were delivered ""as if they were the irrefutable truth,"" according to the García Márquez site themodernword.com. The influence is obvious in García Márquez's works, particularly ""One Hundred Years of Solitude."" In 1936 the Colonel died and García Márquez returned to his parents and their growing family. He was eventually one of 11 children, not to mention several half-siblings from his father's affairs, a familial sprawl that also found its way into his books. After finishing high school, García Márquez went off to college with dreams of becoming a writer. His parents, on the other hand, had plans for him to become a lawyer. Writing ended up taking precedence: When La Violencia broke out, García Márquez started contributing stories to a local newspaper and eventually became a columnist. He had also been exposed to writers such as James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka and especially William Faulkner, who had turned his own patch of land in Oxford, Mississippi, into the shape-shifting past and present of Yoknapatawpha County. In the mid-1950s, García Márquez left Colombia for Europe, a move partly provoked by a story he'd written that was critical of the government. The distance, he later said, helped shape his perspective on Latin American politics. For years, García Márquez had been writing and publishing fiction, including short stories in Latin American journals and a handful of longer works, including ""Leaf Storm,"" which was published in 1955. But it wasn't until 1967 with the publication of ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" that he broke through to a wide audience. '100 Years' of literary renown . The novel is set in Macondo, a town founded by the patriarch of the Buendia family, José Arcadio Buendia. Over the generations, members of the family are set upon by ghosts and visions, fall in love, dream of riches and fight in wars. Natural events take on supernatural aspects -- rains that last years, plagues that create memory loss. It is a tapestry of almost biblical proportions in which reality and spirit swirl and merge, a world unto itself -- as well as a commentary on the politics and history of the world at large. ""The narrative is a magician's trick in which memory and prophecy, illusion and reality are mixed and often made to look the same. It is, in short, very much like Márquez's astonishing novel,"" wrote The New York Times in a 1970 review upon the release of the English translation by Gregory Rabassa. García Márquez worked on ""Solitude"" tirelessly, selling off family items, living on credit, smoking up a nicotine frenzy. Upon its release, the book became an instant bestseller in Latin America and was equally successful in English. It has been estimated to have sold in excess of 20 million copies -- some sources say as many as 50 million -- in two dozen languages. The book didn't ease all of García Márquez's problems, however. As a vocal leftist and defender of Castro's Cuba, he was regularly limited or denied visas by the United States until President Bill Clinton, a fan of ""Solitude,"" revoked the ban. Clinton commented on Garcia Marquez's death Thursday. ""I was saddened to learn of the passing of Gabriel García Márquez,"" he said in a statement. ""From the time I read 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' more than 40 years ago, I was always amazed by his unique gifts of imagination, clarity of thought, and emotional honesty. He captured the pain and joy of our common humanity in settings both real and magical."" García Márquez was also involved in a feud with onetime friend writer Mario Vargas Llosa, a Peruvian and a Nobel laureate, who punched the Colombian in the face in 1976 -- believed to be over politics but later revealed to be over Vargas Llosa's wife. García Márquez's ensuing works were generally praised. They included ""The Autumn of the Patriarch"" (1975), ""Chronicle of a Death Foretold"" (1981) and ""The General in His Labyrinth"" (1990). He is said to be the most popular Spanish-language author in the world. ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" with an English translation published in 1988, was a particular bestseller. The love story, which was turned into a 2007 movie, was referenced in such works as the 2001 movie ""Serendipity"" and the finale of the TV series ""How I Met Your Mother."" García Márquez's style and impact have been widespread. He is credited with spearheading ""el Boom,"" attracting attention to a generation of Latin American writers, including Vargas Llosa and Mexico's Carlos Fuentes. Magical realism is now an accepted genre, to the point that some critics believe it has been overused. And he prompted a focus on Latin American politics -- protesting the 1973 CIA-aided coup in Chile, calling attention to corruption and free speech issues in South America and around the world. He never gave up journalism. ""I've always been convinced that my true profession is that of a journalist. What I didn't like about journalism before were the working conditions,"" he told The Paris Review. ""Now, after having worked as a novelist, and having achieved financial independence as a novelist, I can really choose the themes that interest me and correspond to my ideas."" He was one of the most honored -- and highly respected -- authors on Earth, particularly in parts of the world where literature is taken as seriously as politics. ""On behalf of Mexico, I would like to express my sorrow for the passing of one of the greatest writers of our time, Gabriel Garcia Marquez,"" tweeted Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. Colombia's President summed up the author's presence on Twitter. ""Giants never die,"" Santos tweeted. For all of his immortality, however, Garcia Marquez preferred the here and now. Asked about the impact of dreams on his dreamlike writing, he said he'd rather focus on reality. ""Life itself is the greatest source of inspiration,"" he said. ""I see dreams as part of life in general, but reality is much richer. ""But maybe,"" he added, ""I just have very poor dreams."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo scored two stunning goals as Real Madrid closed the gap at the top of La Liga with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Osasuna at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday. The Portuguese opened the scoring after six minutes with a 25-yard strike before adding a similarly spectacular second just after half-time. Headers from Sergio Ramos and Daniel Carvajal added gloss to the victory which moves Real into second place above Barcelona and three points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid. Atletico can stretch their lead at the top of the table back to six points if they win away to Valencia on Sunday while Barcelona can go above Carlo Ancelotti's men themselves with victory at Villareal. Both Atleti and Barca will have played a game more than Real by the time the weekend's fixtures are complete, however. On the performance of his side and particularly Ronaldo who has suffered with injury in recent weeks, Real coach, Ancelotti, told reporters after the game that ""everything went well for Cristiano and for all of the players. There were no problems and some have had a rest. ""The match was good, not high intensity, and Cristiano showed he is fine,"" he added. Real are next in action on Tuesday as they look to protect their slender one goal lead over Bayern Munich in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal. Bayern find form . The reigning German and European champions, Bayern, were in fine fettle themselves on Saturday as they bounced back from first-leg defeat against Real to record a comfortable 5-2 victory over Werder Bremen at the Allianz Arena. Franck Ribery, Claudio Pizarro (2), Bastian Schweinsteiger and Arjen Robben scored the goals for Pep Guardiola's men. Elsewhere in Germany, Borussia Dortmund ensured they would finish the Bundesliga season in second position after twice coming from behind to draw with fourth placed Bayer Leverkusen. Goals from Lars Bender and Gonzalo Castro had twice given Champions League chasing Leverkusen the lead but Oliver Kirch and Marco Reus hit back for Dortmund both times. Leverkusen remain in fourth position, four points behind third-placed Schalke who play tomorrow against Borussia Monchengladbach, themselves chasing a Europa League place. Fifth placed Wolfsburg missed the opportunity to leapfrog Leverkusen after they could only draw 2-2 at home to Freiburg. Napoli close in on third . In Italy, Napoli drew 0-0 away to fifth-placed Inter Milan meaning one more victory will guarantee Rafa Benitez's side a spot in next season's Champions League qualifying stages. The Neapolitans currently sit in third place in the Serie A table, eight ahead of fourth-placed Fiorentina who earlier won 3-0 away to relegation threatened Bologna. Two goals from Juan Cuadrado and another from Josip Ilicic were enough for the Viola who now look likely to claim a Europa League place unless Napoli suffers a dramatic collapse. PSG kept waiting . In France, meanwhile, two goals from Dimitar Berbatov helped second place Monaco to victory at AC Ajaccio, ensuring Paris Saint Germain will have to wait until at least tomorrow to claim the Ligue 1 title. The Bulgarian scored his seventh and eight goals for the club since signing on loan from Fulham in January as Claudio Ranieri's men ran out comfortable 4-1 winners. With a seven-point lead atop the table and only four games remaining, PSG are unlikely to be denied a second successive league crown. In winning at Ajaccio, however, Monaco moved 11 points clear of third-placed Lille, all but confirming automatic qualification to the group stages of next seasons Champion's League.","Two Cristiano Ronaldo strikes give Real Madrid 4-0 victory over Osasuna .

"(CNN) -- Ryan Giggs' career as a player-manager got off to a winning start as Manchester United defeated relegation-threatened Norwich City at Old Trafford. The United legend is temporarily at the helm of the Red Devils after David Moyes was sacked on Tuesday. Giggs chose not to select himself for his first game in charge and instead watched from the dugout as his side, which bore six changes from last week's loss at Everton, cruised to a comfortable 4-0 victory. Wayne Rooney opened the scoring from the penalty spot after 40 minutes and then added a second two minutes after the break. Substitute Juan Mata knocked in a Phil Jones center after 62 minutes to make it three before stooping to claim his own quickfire brace after Lucas Antonia Valencia rifled across goal 10 minutes later. The win matched United's biggest victory of the season and saw the them register more shots on target than in any other league game under Moyes. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Giggs revealed he had struggled to sleep the night before and dreaded telling the players who would miss out of his team selection. ""Leaving the likes of Juan Mata out of the starting 11 was difficult and a position I've never been in before. I'm also one of their team-mates. I told them all individually and some of them were upset, but they didn't sulk. ""It's good to end the day as we did, scoring goals and creating chances,"" he added. ""I reminded the players the tempo needed to be quicker at half-time and they reacted well to that."" While delighted with the result, which was United's first win since early April, Giggs also said he was equally pleased with his team's performance. United looked sharper, faster and more penetrative with their passing than they have in recent weeks, particularly after taking the lead. Norwich had coped well up until then although the breakthrough arrived after some calamitous defending by the visitors. Three Norwich players missed opportunities to clear a weak cross into the box before the ball fell to the feet of United striker, Danny Wellbeck, who was duly hauled down by Steven Whittaker as he was about to shoot. Referee Lee Probert pointed to the spot and Wayne Rooney stepped up to send Norwich keeper John Ruddy the wrong way. The second half began just as the first ended with Rooney pushing forward and curling a shot beyond Ruddy from 20-yards out. Giggs then brought on Juan Mata who had dropped to the bench after last week's defeat at Everton and the Spanish international made it 3-0 just after the hour, knocking in a Phil Jones cross. Norwich were well beaten by this stage and a Mata header after Valencia fired across goal made it four shortly after. Rooney and Javier Hernandez came close in the final ten minutes for United while a deflected shot from Norwich's Leroy Fer rebounded off the bar but the game would finish without any further scoring. Norwich remain a point above the relegation zone in 16th position with two games to play after Fulham blew a two goal lead at home to FA Cup finalists Hull City earlier in the day, spurning the chance to move above the Canaries. Fulham were two up with 15 minutes to play thanks to second-half strikes from Ashkan Dejagah and Fernando Amorebieta but late goals from Hull's Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic snatched a draw. Elsewhere in England, West Brom took a step closer to Premier League survival with a 1-0 home victory over West Ham while Aston Villa's poor run of form continued as they were defeated 4-1 at Swansea. In Saturday's lunch time kick-off, Everton's Champions League hopes took a blow as they slumped to defeat at Southampton. Own goals from Everton defenders Antolin Alcatraz and Seamus Coleman were enough to seal a 2-0 victory for the Saints. A victory for Tottenham at 10-man Stoke means they now trail fifth placed Everton by just three points. See also: Is Man Utd too big a club to manage?

"(OPRAH.com) -- A man from Vermont got into the habit of leaving his wife little notes. Nothing elaborate -- just sweet sentiments like ""I love you"" or ""I can't wait to get home to you tonight,"" jotted down on Post-it notes and then hidden in places where he knew she'd stumble over them throughout the course of her day. You can say ""I love you"" by giving your time and attention to people in need. She'd open a drawer or reach into a kitchen cabinet and find a hidden note. From inside the dog food bin, to the laundry hamper, to the driver's seat of her car, the notes were everywhere. He was in the military and he was shipped out during the early days of the war in Iraq, where he was killed in action. On the morning of the funeral, his young widow put on her winter coat, placed her hands in her pockets, and found the last two notes which he had hidden there for her before he had left home. Knowing exactly what they were, she slowly pulled them out of her pockets. The first one read, ""I will always love you."" And the other read, ""We will always be together."" Did he know the circumstances under which she'd find them? It was hard to say. You can imagine the sorrow she felt as she read them, but think how lucky she was to have had a husband who managed to reach out with a final, loving gesture. Like this wonderful man, all of us can create ways everyday that say, ""I love you."" I know it's almost Valentine's Day, and we have come to think of only this day as LOVE day but instead, I am suggesting that we think of EVERY DAY as an opportunity to put a little love in the world. There is an old saying that goes something like this, ""Love doesn't make the world go round, but it sure makes the ride worth while."" You see, real joy and true happiness are found when we tell someone we care and show them how special they are in our lives. When I say love, I do not only mean the kind where two people are locking lips and coming up for air every 10 minutes or so. I am talking about the kind of love that embraces everyone who has a presence in our lives. The kind of love I am talking about extends throughout our circle of life, touching family, friends and co-workers. Oprah.com How to show your loved ones you care . I am talking about the kind of love where a woman gives her birthday bouquet away to a co- worker because the co-worker has had some rough financial times and can not afford to purchase a gift for her niece. The woman believes her birthday bouquet will be even more special when the co-worker gives it to her niece. Or, when everyone at a hair salon contributes to making a quilt for their friend who has just been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The quilt was filled with their well wishes and served as their own special way to cover their sick friend with love. An act of love is present when a woman grows out her red silky hair, just so that it could be pulled back in a pony tail and cut to be donated to Locks of Love, a company that makes beautiful wigs for women who have lost their hair to chemotherapy treatments as they battle cancer. Love is also found within a retired woman who decides to raise money so she can go to Africa where she can best tend to and take care of orphaned children who are affected by HIV and AIDS. We all know stories like these and we each have our own stories to tell, to inspire us and remind us what really matters. It is in these acts of kindness where the joy of living is found. These acts of love are everywhere, and when we turn our eyes and hearts to them, they touch and change our lives forever. Defining what love is has been the work of poets and philosophers throughout time, but it's our job too. It is something we all know when we feel it, but words simply are not adequate enough to define it. Love is so many things -- a feeling, an intention and a thank you. It is compassionate, it is generous, it is funny, it is serious, it breaks our hearts and yet it heals all things. Love is expressed in a trillion ways, it is found in a smile, blowing a kiss, a wink, a song, a poem, a word or even a batch of chocolate chip cookies. There is so much to say about love, but the heart of the matter is, we all want to be loved and we all want to love. Oprah.com: Great ways to celebrate Valentine's Day .

"Kabul (CNN) -- Afghan voters turned out in large numbers Saturday for historic presidential and provincial elections, undeterred by the threat of violence by the Taliban and poor weather. A heavy security presence in the capital, Kabul, and across the country ensured that the vote went largely smoothly, although some attacks were reported. ""Today, I came to here to select my next president and I hope that whoever it is... is a good person, who will help the people and bring changes to Afghanistan,"" said one voter at a Kabul polling station. Wide participation in voting was observed and polling hours were extended by an hour to allow all those in line to vote, Mohammad Yousuf Nooristani, chief of Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission, said at a news conference in Kabul. There were no major attacks in the capital, where cars were barred from the roads, police checkpoints were set up every few hundred yards and searches were carried out on every man, woman and child as they entered polling stations. The strong turnout came despite threats from the Taliban to disrupt the vote and punish all involved in the first democratic transfer of presidential power in the country's turbulent history. Afghan lawmaker Shukria Barakzai, at a polling station in Kabul, told CNN she felt proud and happy because ""today is the day ... when the people of Afghanistan can go and vote freely."" She said the turnout was a slap in the face for the Taliban and terrorists who have sought to obstruct the elections. ""See, wonderful people are coming to practice democracy,"" she said. ""We are not afraid of the threats. As much as they kill us, we get more stronger. As much as they killed our children, our journalists and innocent women, we say no, we will go and vote because we are fed up. We want to see real change, we want to enjoy our democracy."" Other Afghans also told CNN that they were determined to vote and that improved security is their main concern, after long years of war. ""We need a good president so the bombings and war stops,"" said a Kabul voter who has two children. ""I want my children to go to school without fear."" The Election Commission's Nooristani said about 7 million Afghans were estimated to have voted, with around two-thirds of the estimated voters men. Vote counting has started in the polling sites throughout the country and the preliminary results will be announced around April 28. The Independent Elections Commissions is completely ready to hold a second round elections if no candidate wins 50% +1 in the first round. Violence reported . Afghan Interior Minister Mohammad Umer Daudzai told reporters that 20 people were killed in violence across the country Saturday, as insurgents tried to disturb the voting processes. Seven military personnel, nine police and four civilians were killed. Forty-three people were also wounded in attacks targeting mostly voting centers, the minister said, adding that most wounded people were civilians . Meanwhile, Afghan security forces killed more than 80 insurgents across the country and foiled several attacks against voting centers, Daudzai said. Officials in the eastern Afghan province of Khost said a suicide bomber clad in an explosives vest blew himself up near a polling center. No other casualties were reported after the blast. Nearly 1,000 polling sites were closed because of security concerns; another 6,423 were open. Reports of violence and people fleeing polling stations popped up on social media. Outgoing President Hamid Karzai was among those to cast his vote Saturday, adding his voice to those of Afghans across the nation as they chose their next leader. Karzai is constitutionally bound to step down when his term runs out and the next president has been determined. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round, then a runoff vote will take place next month. Preliminary results are expected to be announced at the end of April. Electoral officials hope that this election is free of the allegations of fraud that marred the last vote in 2009. Pre-election militant attacks . The relatively trouble-free election day came in welcome contrast to the violence that overshadowed the run-up to the vote and is seen as a credit to the progress made by the Afghan security forces. Taliban militants have carried out multiple attacks in recent days, including on the country's election commission. On Friday, two Associated Press journalists were shot in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province, an attack that left award-winning German photographer Anja Niedringhaus dead and injured Canadian reporter Kathy Gannon. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate to the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing six Afghan police officers. A day earlier, the Taliban killed a provincial council candidate and nine of his supporters. Last month, Sardar Ahmad, one of Afghanistan's most prominent journalists, was among nine people killed in an attack in central Kabul. Less than two weeks earlier, Swedish Radio correspondent Nils Horner was shot dead in broad daylight on a Kabul street. Voter enthusiasm . While formal turnout figures are not yet available, recent polling by the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan found that 75% of Afghans said they wanted to vote despite the threat of violence. Some election workers, whose colleagues were killed, also said the violence would not stop them from performing their duties. Campaigning has stirred excitement, including through substantive televised debates between the leading candidates -- something unthinkable more than a decade ago under Taliban rule, when television was banned entirely. The pre-election violence highlights the need for security in the fragile nation, and the choice of a new president may have an impact on security cooperation with the United States and the rest of NATO. Karzai, who has often taken a contrarian approach to Washington, has refused to sign a U.S.-Afghanistan bilateral security agreement. But the two leading candidates in Saturday's election have said they would, and the third has said that he is in favor of signing the agreement. Without it, Washington has threatened the possibility of withdrawing U.S. troops by the end of the year. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force has roughly 51,000 troops from 48 different countries in Afghanistan. The majority -- about 33,500 -- are from the United States. Despite the string of attacks leading up to the election, violence in Afghanistan is at a two-year low, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said. He has praised Afghan forces for taking the lead in quelling militant violence. The candidates . Afghanistan is a nation of diverse cultures and languages, which harbors potential for ethnic divides. But the two campaigns consistently leading in pre-election polling have crossed ethnic lines to form their tickets. Top presidential contender Ashraf Ghani, who earned his doctorate at Columbia University in the U.S., is from the Pashtun ethnic group. His running mate is Abdul Rashid Dostum, a leader of the Uzbek ethnic group. Ghani was the country's finance minister under Karzai. The other frontrunner is Dr. Abdullah Abdullah who is associated with the Tajik ethnic group. Abdullah is partnered with Mohammad Mohaqeq, a leader of the Hazara ethnic group, and he also has a Pashtun on the ticket, Mohammad Khan, who is affiliated with Hezb-i-Islami, a splinter group of the Taliban. Abdullah is an eye doctor by training, who became Afghanistan's foreign minister under Karzai. He ran against him in 2009, but dropped out in protest of what he saw as large-scale voter fraud. He is considered to be relatively liberal and has made at least one public statement in support of women's rights. Karzai's favorite? Karzai has not publicly endorsed anyone, but the third major contender, Zalmai Rassoul, is widely seen as the establishment candidate. He is a Karzai ally and has backing from the President's brother, Qayum, who withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the former foreign minister. Like Abdullah, he is a doctor. He also has a reputation for honesty despite his years in an administration widely plagued with accusations of graft. His running mate, Habiba Sarabi, is one of only three female vice presidential candidates on the ballot. Her candidacy could appeal to women voters. Karzai was chosen by Afghan leaders to head the country after the fall of the Taliban and won two subsequent presidential elections in 2004 and 2009. The 2009 election was tainted by allegations of manipulation and irregularities. CNN's Anna Coren, Masoud Popalzi and Qadir Sediqi reported from Kabul, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Euan McKirdy and Joe Sterling and analyst Peter Bergen contributed to this report.","Twenty killed in violence across the country Saturday, Interior Ministry says .

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A male member of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly apologized Monday for shouting sexist remarks at a female colleague as she was giving a speech last week. Akihiro Suzuki, an assemblyman from the ruling LDP party, admitted to heckling fellow assembly member Ayaka Shiomura, who is from the minority Your Party, during her speech urging increased public support for pregnant Japanese women. Suzuki, who initially denied any involvement and condemned the harassment in an interview, publicly apologized to Shiomura. While admitting to making the first comment ""You should get married,"" Suzuki has denied making a second comment, ""Can't you even bear a child?"" Shiomura accepted his apology but stated, ""I'm positive that there were others besides Mr. Suzuki who made comments."" She said she hopes that others involved in the heckling will come forward as well. When asked whether he would continue his position as an assembly member, Suzuki stated he has no plans to resign. ""I will stay on if I'm allowed to,"" he replied. The incident last week reignited the debate over sexism in the Japanese workplace. Women are paid, on average, 30% less than their male counterparts, according to statistics cited by Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe during an editorial last year announcing the launch of ""Womenomics."" Women also hold just 3% of management positions in Japan's central government, according to the National Personnel Authority. Abe wants to increase that to 30% by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.","Tokyo assembly member apologizes to female colleague .

"(CNN) -- For those of you dreaming of visiting Mars, readings taken during the Curiosity rover's voyage to the Red Planet offer a new measurement to ponder as you weigh the risks. Mars-bound pioneers will be exposed to radiation levels that could effectively retire astronauts under NASA's current standards, scientists reported Thursday. The radiation astronauts would face on a round trip would be comparable to getting an abdominal CT scan ""about once every five days,"" said Cary Zeitlin, principal scientist for the NASA-led Martian Radiation Environment Experiment. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Science, based on data from a device called the Radiation Assessment Detector that took readings during Curiosity's trip to Mars. The spacecraft was similar to one that would carry humans, and scientists were interested in measuring galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the trip. ""It is clear that the exposure from the cruise phases alone is a large fraction of (and in some cases greater than) currently accepted astronaut career limits,"" they wrote. Zeitlin and his colleagues found voyagers could be exposed to between 554 and 770 millisieverts of ionizing radiation during the trip, depending on the level of solar activity. By comparison, the typical American receives about 6.2 millisieverts a year from natural and man-made sources, including medical diagnostic procedures. ""The radiation environment in deep space is several hundred times what it is on Earth, and that's even inside a shielded spacecraft,"" Zeitlin said. NASA standards limit the amount of radiation exposure for astronauts to levels that would produce no more than a 3% increase in lifetime of fatal cancers -- a level that varies with age and gender. The dose estimate was based on a one-way trip time of 180 days. That's about the fastest that current rocket engines can propel a spacecraft, and it's far shorter than the 253 days Curiosity took to get to Mars in 2012. 501 days in space with your spouse: Could you handle it? Most of the exposure estimated in Thursday's paper would come from galactic cosmic rays. They're composed of high-energy, highly penetrating particles, and astronauts would be exposed to them chronically. Shielding that would completely block those rays would be ""meters thick"" and too heavy to be used aboard a spacecraft, said Eddie Semones, a radiation health expert at NASA's Johnson Space Flight Center. Chris Moore, NASA's deputy director for advanced exploration systems, said the space agency is working on engines aimed at cutting the trip time by the 2030s, when it hopes to send humans to Mars. But it will take ""many years"" before those systems are ready, he said. In the meantime, Moore said engineers could try to limit travelers' exposures by designing a spacecraft in such a way that it provides more protection. ""Ideally, we'd like to arrange the configuration of the habitat to provide radiation protection by surrounding the crew with water, which contains a lot of hydrogen,"" he told reporters Thursday afternoon. ""That's the most effective shielding that we know of."" A one-way ticket to Mars . Astronauts would also be bombarded with solar energetic particles, which get accelerated close to the sun as a result of solar flares and coronal mass ejections that shoot portions of the sun into space. Moore said NASA is already developing personalized shelters that would protect astronauts from a solar storm and hopes to test them ""in the next few years."" Another possibility would be to figure out how to generate a magnetic field around the spacecraft that mimics the one that protects Earth from the worst cosmic radiation. ""It would require a lot of power for electromagnets, but it does have promise, so we're donig some really advanced studies on that."" A question of physics, a question of biology . The problem has two sides: physics and biology, Zeitlin told CNN. On the physics side, the radiation is in line with expectations. ""As it stands, what we measured is pretty much in line with predictions that people have made based on various models that they put together based on what the deep space radiation environment would be,"" he said. Solar energetic particle events only contributed about 5% to the overall measured dose equivalent during the laboratory's cruise to Mars. But these events are highly variable in terms of frequency and intensity, the study said, and the current cycle seems to be producing a weak solar maximum. ""The SEP contribution could conceivably be many times larger in a different time frame,"" the report said. And the figures out Thursday only cover the trip to and from the Red Planet. Anyone who spends time on Mars could be exposed to more radiation, depending on how long they stay and what the shielding conditions are like. The health question . Moon missions exposed astronauts to a similar rate of radiation accumulation, but the trip was far shorter. The Apollo 11 moon mission, for instance, launched on July 16, 1969, landing the first humans on the moon before returning to Earth on July 24, 1969. According to a 2010 NASA report on space radiation cancer risk projections [PDF], the average American male who is 35 can safely spend between 140 and 186 days in deep space, assuming heavy shielding, and stay below that 3% increase in cancer risk; a 35-year-old female could spend between 88 and 120 days. For those who have never smoked, however, it's estimated that a 35-year-old man could spend between 180 and 239 days in deep space, and a 35-year-old female could spend between 130 and 173 days. The number of safe days in space increases as men and women age. Zeitlin said his team just makes measurements; they don't decide what radiation dose is acceptable. When can we go? Interest in going to Mars has been mounting. The private company Mars One has started its recruitment process for a one-way trip for four people to land in 2023. The company received 78,000 applications as of early May. Even sooner, the Inspiration Mars Foundation wants to send two people -- a man and a woman -- on a 501-day roundtrip journey to Mars and back in 2018, without ever actually touching down. The organization was founded by Dennis Tito, the millionaire who became the first space tourist in 2001, and Moore said NASA would share the data from Curiosity with the group. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to land on the moon, wrote on CNN.com that the United States ""should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing American permanence on the planet Mars."" Buzz Aldrin: Get to Mars within 20 years . In the meantime, the 2-ton rover Curiosity -- a $2.5 billion mission -- has been using its sophisticated tool kit to uncover evidence that Mars was once habitable. Thanks to the rover's efforts, scientists have determined that, yes, conditions that could have supported life once existed there. More space and science news from CNN Light Years .

"(CNN) -- It remains advantage Los Rojiblancos in the race for the La Liga title as Atletico Madrid battled to a 1-0 away win at Valencia to lead by four points by the end of Sunday's program. Barcelona moved up to second with a 3-2 win at Villarreal in the late match, their first since the death of former coach Tito Vilanova this week. Barca trailed to a Ruben Cani goal just before halftime and fell further behind when Manuel Trigueros scored for the home side on 55 minutes. But a pair of Villarreal own goals from Gabriel Paulista and Mateo Musacchio allowed the Catalan giants to level before Lionel Messi grabbed the winner seven minutes from time. Real Madrid, who beat Osasuna 4-0 Saturday, are six points adrift but have a game in hand on both their rival. But Atletico will clinch La Liga for the first time in 18 years with two wins from their remaining three game, the last of which is against Barcelona . Atletico were able to register a ninth straight win in their relentless march to the title with a goal from Raul Garcia just before halftime proving the difference in the Mestella. ""We wanted to win for us and for all the people who've come to Valencia. Their support is essential"" #AupaAtleti, the scorer tweeted after the match. Both teams are involved in European competition next week, with Atletico fielding a strong team despite a Champions League semifinal second leg against Chelsea on Wednesday. Valencia, who are looking to overhaul a 2-0 deficit to Sevilla at the same stage of the Europa League, were also nearly at full strength and made a bright start against the league leaders. Atletico's David Villa came close to scoring against his old club before the visitors made the breakthrough as Gabi picked out Garcia who scored with a deft header. Atletico's leading scorer Diego Costa had two good chances to make the game safe for Diego Simeone's men in the second half but they held out for a vital three points although losing Juanfran to a red card in stoppage time. Meanwhile in France's Ligue 1, defending champions Paris St Germain missed the chance to wrap up a second successive title. The were held to a 1-1 draw by at struggling Sochaux to go eight points clear of Monaco with three games remaining. Uruguay star Edinson Cavani put PSG ahead on 24 minutes but an own goal from Thiago Silva after the break leveled the affair.

"Washington (CNN) -- Ever since Watergate became the shorthand for a government run amok, the political clichÃ© of our time has been about the political lesson of that era: That the coverup can be worse than the crime. Apply that clichÃ© to Benghazi -- and questions about the motive for removing the terror link from talking points about the Libyan attack in the heat of an election. Maybe there's a corollary question that we ought to be asking: In politics, when did spin trump everything, even the truth? We're in dangerous territory right now, although the president himself seems to be having none of it, calling the investigation a ""political circus."" Sure it is. But in the center ring is something that still begs an explanation, despite the president's dismissiveness: How -- and why-- did the account of what happened at Benghazi (i.e. the infamous talking points) go through a dozen iterations, beginning with a fairly detailed description of the potential involvement of al Qaeda that morphed over the course of a day into a simple, gauzy, bland (and false) theory? Administration officials say, of course, that this is just part of the regular, interagency ""process"" of consultation that occurs before information is released. In other words, this is the way intelligence always gets scrubbed and vetted. And in this case, don't forget, the information was being released to members of Congress on the intelligence committees, so they could speak in public with some clarity (!) on Benghazi. But that also means the information was going to Republicans -- in the heat of the fall election -- so antennae were up. What's more, the bureaucratic armor was on -- between people at the State Department and the CIA, each trying to make sure their agency wasn't thrown under the bus for the obvious failures in Benghazi. All in all, just another day in Washington. Let's try to deconstruct the accusations. First, the notion that politics was somehow at play is, of course, true. Was it 30% or 50% or 80% of the problem? Hard to say. What we do know is this: In an e-mail, Victoria Nuland, the State Department's spokeswoman at the time, makes the point that a key paragraph in the talking points -- containing context and detail about five other attacks in Benghazi -- ""could be abused by members of Congress to beat up the State Department for not paying attention to warnings so why would we feed that either ... "" She's right: Republicans and Mitt Romney would no doubt have accused the administration of not paying enough attention to warning signs. But since it was also the truth -- or an important part of it -- why suppress it? Then there's the rest of the story, which may even be more dispositive. Although the U.S. ambassador to Libya lost his life, the exact nature of the Benghazi operation is tricky. White House spokesman Jay Carney says the White House changed the wording from ""consulate"" to ""diplomatic facility"" to be more accurate. So what does that mean? Thanks to the digging of Glenn Kessler in The Washington Post, it looks very much like the Benghazi consulate ""was not a consulate at all but basically a secret CIA operation."" And, as Kessler also points out, the internal Accountability Review Board, in its investigation, tiptoed around the delicate matter: The U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi, it said, ""was never a consulate and never formally notified to the Libyan government."" In other words, this was a hit on a CIA outpost, resulting in the death of an ambassador who happened to be there at the time. That helps to explain the pushback from the State Department, which was publicly taking the heat -- and didn't want the CIA-driven talking points to add to the idea that they had failed to protect their own. In addition, State had been pretty mum on the whole picture, and Nuland didn't want the talking points to reflect more than she had been allowed to share publicly, so she naturally objected -- on behalf of her ""building's leadership."" The bottom line: That the more complex version of the truth -- previous recent attacks, previous threats linked to al Qaeda, the presence of ""Islamic extremists"" -- was somehow lost in translation and what emerged instead was something that turned out to be utterly false: a claim that the attack was ""spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. embassy in Cairo."" In the end, there are two parts to this Benghazi brouhaha. The president called the controversy a ""sideshow,"" and he's right: Republicans are trying to fund-raise off of this and hurt Hillary Clinton. And maybe the president was goading them, knowing that if they go overboard, the public will turn on them. But the president's dismissive attitude towards the whole mess willfully neglects the second part of the problem. He says, incredulously, ""who executes some sort of coverup or effort to tamp things down for three days? So the whole thing defies logic."" Alas, it doesn't. Nothing in life happens in a vacuum, and life in Washington is no different. In the context of the closing months of a presidential campaign, three days can be an eternity. And spinning across the finish line is all that counts. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Gloria Borger: When does spin go overboard, and out of control?
She asks: How did a broad assessment involving terror turn into a bland, false theory?

"(CNN) -- Checking the weather display for our departure from JFK Airport in New York to London's Heathrow Airport, an awkward blob of green, yellow, and red is sprawled diagonally across most of the New England coastline. Studying the computer in Operations, the routing filed with ATC (air traffic control) appears to navigate through the least intense area of a very wide storm system. I pick up the company phone, taking a rare opportunity to consult with our dispatcher located in a central location at our main hub almost 1,400 miles away. On most occasions, through our collaborative efforts, the dispatcher and I agree to the planning of the flight by electronic means. This day is different. On this day I require the verbal communication of a trusted professional who has more resources available to assist in our flight planning. In light of the now-lifted FAA ban on flights into Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, it seems that the resources available will have to include intelligence on airborne hostile activity. But let's be honest, why did the FAA exercise their authority in the first place? Israel has been the center of conflict since its birth in 1948, with the airport having been in existence even before that time. The answer for the FAA's decision had to lay in what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. I think we all get it. So what? One rocket is launched from Gaza and lands within a mile of Ben Gurion Airport. Big deal. The Israelis said, ""What's one missile when we have the Iron Dome? It's just another day in Tel Aviv for us. C'mon back."" Many flights soar over conflict zones . Well, one mile from the airport and one little ole rocket may not seem like much, but our arrivals to a runway begin at least 10 miles away. And our lumbering airliners are the most vulnerable in the approach phase, notwithstanding the initial takeoff phase of our flights. Airline pilots are paid to be paranoid. I've never flown with a colleague whom I considered too cautious. That being said, U.S. airline pilots understand the concept of mitigating risk. Not everything we do as humans is completely safe. But Israel's El Al airplanes have a little more risk mitigation in their arena. The robust Israeli airline has missile detection and defense systems installed. Most of these systems are designed to automatically thwart an attack from shoulder-launched weapons and low altitude threats. A similar system was proposed a couple of years after 9/11 for U.S. airlines but the costs were deemed to outweigh the potential risk. My airline went so far as to have the test hardware installed in three of our Boeing 767s. The technology was designed to defend against MANPADs -- a weapon considered to be the next terrorist threat. A cause for concern was that once the system was installed, the potential existed for it to be defeated by newer weapon technology. But now that it seems the FAA has set an arbitrary standard for safety of flights into areas of conflict what exactly is the criteria? How can yesterday be unsafe but today is all clear? Should missile launch frequency and distance from the airport be calculated via an algorithm? Should the type of warhead be considered? If there is to be a standard, the requirement to have it disseminated for airlines and their flight crews is a must. The Israelis have obviously set their own standards. I can't think of an area on the globe that is more focused on security than Tel Aviv. In that regard, should the criteria to halt flights be different for Ben Gurion Airport than it is for Cairo International Airport? Because of our military, U.S. airspace is full of activity involving more live ordnance than anywhere in the world. Airspace that is off-limits to civilian flights dot the entire country. Our military is practicing war tactics in these areas both on the ground and in the air. One does not stray into restricted airspace that is ""hot"" without authorization from ATC even if it is required for a weather deviation. A tense week for air travelers . I can guarantee that until the horror of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the furthest concept from an airline pilot's mind when it came to threats was a missile attack â€” and certainly not a missile attack at cruise altitude. But if this is a new day, then airlines and their pilots need to be provided with the tools to make safe routing decisions around areas of conflict. These tools will have to include appropriate intelligence. If airline pilots can be trusted with intelligence information after 9/11 but still can't take gels and liquids through airport security, something has to change. And now, as crazy as it seems, in 30 years of flying for my airline, my dispatcher and I have to incorporate missile threats into pre-flight planning.

"(CNN) -- Erika Andiola spent hours Friday speaking to immigration officials to keep her own mother in the country. She prevented her deportation in the nick of time. The prominent immigration rights activist has routinely visited immigration offices on the behalf of others, ""but this is the first time I have been here for my own mother"", she said. Thursday night, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers raided Andiola's Pheonix, Arizona, home and took away her mother, Maria Minerva Guadalupe Arreola, to deport her to Mexico. Andiola is president and founder of the Arizona DREAM Act Coalition, which supports legislation to allow the children of undocumented migrants to attain documented status. The acronym stands for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors. The family's lawyer Jose Panelosa told CNN affiliate KTVK that Arreola was on a bus headed to the border when the decision to release her was made. ""Fifteen minutes into the ride, there was a phone call to the bus and the driver took the call and spoke to the other agents, and turned the bus around"", he said. Arreola was released in Florence, Arizona, he said. Opinion: DREAMers are pushing their luck . The woman's son, and Erika's brother, Heriberto Andiola Arreola, was also detained in the raid, but was released Friday morning. When asked by KTVK what led to his detainment he said, ""I don't know if it has to do with my sister's activism, I don't know."" Andiola has often appeared on television discussing immigration rights with her mother. She has worked with Obama administration officials and members of congress on immigration reform. An official with ICE told CNN, ""ICE agents did not target these individuals because of their family member's role with the Dream Act Coalition."" On a press conference call Friday, Andiola said she spent hours in the offices of ICE seeking her family's release and was told that her mother would be ""deported right away"" under an ""expedited order of removal."" She told reporters that her brother and her mother were recently charged with traffic violations. ICE exercised ""discretion"" in releasing Arreola, according to spokeswoman Barbara Gonzales. Andiola's mother has been ""previously removed from the country,"" she said. Both her and her son's case are under review. New immigration rule helps undocumented families . Arizona passed a controversial immigration law in 2010, which the Obama administration quickly challenged. The U.S. Supreme Court threw out many of its provisions as unconstitutional. Arizona is the nation's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling. The Justice Department said Arizona's population of two million Latinos includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally, and 60% to 70% of deportations or ""removals"" involve Mexican nationals. Such home raids like the one Andiola had to endure are wasteful in light of anticipated immigration reforms, said Frank Sharry, Executive Director of America's Voice Education Fund. ""It's ridiculous to think we're spending billions of dollars arresting people who will be on the road to citizenship once Congress enacts reform."" Andiola feels her time and effort are being unnecessarily taxed as well. ""I am asking President Obama and his Administration to stop separating families,"" Andiola said. It shouldn't have to take thousands of phone calls to stop the deportation of one person ""every day all around the country.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. military's first and only study looking into ties between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and al Qaeda showed no connection between the two, according to a military report released by the Pentagon. A U.S. soldier in front of a bus hit by a roadside bomb near Nasiriyah, southeast of Baghdad, Iraq, on Tuesday. The report released by the Joint Forces Command five years after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq said it found no ""smoking gun"" after reviewing about 600,000 Iraqi documents captured in the invasion and looking at interviews of key Iraqi leadership held by the United States, Pentagon officials said. The assessment of the al Qaeda connection and the insistence that Hussein had weapons of mass destruction were two primary elements in the Bush administration's arguments in favor of going to war with Iraq. The Pentagon's report also contradicts then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who said in September 2002 that the CIA provided ""bulletproof"" evidence demonstrating ""that there are, in fact, al Qaeda in Iraq."" Although other groups, like the September 11 commission, have concluded that there was no link between Hussein and al Qaeda, the Pentagon was able to analyze much more information. The documents cited in the report do reveal that Hussein supported a number of terrorists and terrorist activities inside and outside Iraq. ""The Iraqi regime was involved in regional and international terrorist operations prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The predominant targets of Iraqi state terror operations were Iraqi citizens, both inside and outside of Iraq,"" according to the report. Read excerpts from report (pdf) Most of the terrorism was aimed at keeping Hussein and his Baath party in power, according to Pentagon officials. ""State sponsorship of terrorism became such a routine tool of state power that Iraq developed elaborate bureaucratic processes to monitor progress and accountability in the recruiting, training and resourcing of terrorists,"" according to the report. The report cited such examples as training for car bombs and suicide bombings in 1999 and 2000, both of which U.S. and Iraqi forces have struggled to contain since the rise of the insurgency in summer 2003.

"(CNN) -- Self-defense or murder? That's the question at the heart of the trial of George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Monday marked the start of jury selection in Seminole County, Florida, where Martin was fatally shot on February 26, 2012. The shooting put a national spotlight on Zimmerman's hometown of Sanford and sparked fresh debates about race relations and gun laws in America. Zimmerman is Hispanic; Martin was African-American. An initial decision not to pursue charges against Zimmerman led to the dismissal of the town's police chief and the appointment of a special prosecutor, who accused the neighborhood watch volunteer of unjustly profiling and killing Martin. Zimmerman now faces a second-degree murder charge in Martin's death. He has pleaded not guilty and is currently free on $1 million bond. Attorney: No imminent plans to put Zimmerman on stand . ""We don't need you to do that"" Prosecutors and defense attorneys agree on almost nothing about what happened that day. What's clear so far is this: Martin left the home of his father's girlfriend in Sanford to get a snack at a nearby convenience store. As he walked back, carrying some candy and a soft drink, he and Zimmerman crossed paths. Earlier, Zimmerman had called 911 to report a suspicious person in the neighborhood. A recording of that call includes a police dispatcher asking the volunteer, ""Are you following him?"" ""Yeah,"" Zimmerman replied. ""OK, we don't need you to do that,"" the dispatcher said. Zimmerman says he killed Martin, who was wearing a hoodie, in self-defense after the teen punched him and slammed his head on the sidewalk. He suffered a fractured nose and cuts to the back of his head, according to a medical report by Zimmerman's family doctor. Sanford police initially questioned Zimmerman and released him without charges. They said then there were no grounds to disprove his account that he'd acted to protect himself. The case soon became the center of a national controversy, which continues some 16 months later, though at a lower intensity. His family has said Zimmerman profiled the teen and crossed the line from neighborhood watch volunteer to vigilante. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Martin's family, has gone further, accusing Zimmerman of murdering Martin ""in cold blood."" Experts: Can't tell who is screaming in 911 calls . ""In the fight of his life"" According to Crump, Martin was on the phone with his 16-year-old girlfriend shortly before the shooting. The girl, who wishes to remain anonymous, says she heard someone ask Martin what he was doing and heard Martin ask why the person was following him. She then got the impression there was an altercation, during which an earpiece fell out of Martin's ear and the connection went dead, Crump said. Neighbors reported hearing gunfire. Zimmerman recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under Florida's ""stand your ground"" law, which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are. His lawyers will claim self-defense. Zimmerman himself could testify at trial. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he has no imminent plans to ask for a change of venue and would only do so if lawyers can't select a suitable jury. As jury selection began Monday, 21 potential jurors were brought into the courtroom. Four of them -- three women and one man -- were interviewed individually by attorneys, but there were no indications how either side felt about any of the potential jurors. From that group of 21, one person was dismissed. The same group of 20 will be back on Tuesday for more individual questioning. ""If we can pick a jury in Seminole County, this is where the incident occurred and this is where the case should be decided,"" O'Mara told HLN's Jean Casarez. He also said the George Zimmerman defense fund has raised $85,000 in the past week and a half. Media coverage of the case is expected to be intense. The case garnered so much attention that about a month after the shooting, President Barack Obama spoke about it, saying the shooting required ""soul-searching."" Zimmerman's brother, Robert, has called on the state to drop the charges. ""George lived in a community plagued by crime and was the first to come forward to help his neighbors,"" Robert Zimmerman said last month. ""George is a good, decent and honest man. It is now my honor to advocate for him. George is in the fight of his life quite literally."" Authorities initially ""did their job when they refused to charge someone with a crime who committed no crime,"" he said. ""In this country, you don't charge someone why any crime solely to assuage the concerns of the misinformed masses."" Gun, drug texts feature in new shooting evidence .

"(CNN) -- Let the math begin! With every team having played two matches, it's time to start computing every possible variable in which teams like the U.S. and Portugal can make it to the next round. Oh, if only the Americans were able to hold off the Portugese attack for 27 more seconds yesterday. Portugal could have hopped a flight with Spain back to the Iberian Peninsula. But alas, it wasn't to be. While we lament and scribble scenarios into our spreadsheets, here are five things to ruminate over today about this spectacular but surprising World Cup. 1. You're going to need two screens this week . That's because the last games of the group stages are played concurrently -- meaning, two games at the same time. It all began in 1982 when Algeria was on the verge of making the knockout rounds. Also in their group that year was West Germany and Austria. When they played, the Germans scored. The 1-0 result good enough to send both the Germans and the Austrians through. So, the two teams basically stopped competing. Had Germany scored two more goals (or lost), Algeria would have advanced. (It has to do with goal difference) Both Austria and Germany said, ""No, not us. We didn't cheat."" But get this, there were no shots in the final 80 minutes! So, FIFA wised up. And the next World Cup saw the first simultaneous matches for the last days of group play. On Thursday, the U.S. and Germany already know a 0-0 draw would get both through, so you don't think...? Nah, winning the group is too important. 2. There's a lot at stake today (read: pride) Let's go through today's matches one by one - . Netherlands v Chile: . If you're going to fixate on one match today, this is it. Both teams are phenomenal. Both are already going through. The only question is, which will top Group B? Bragging rights are a good enough reason to put up a great fight. Brazil v. Cameroon: . Cameroon is playing to not finish 32nd in a 32-team field. The Indomitable Lions? They've been more like The Skittish Kitties. Brazil hasn't exactly set the field on fire either with its performance so far. Still, there's no doubt this matchup is one they'll handily win. Spain v Australia: . Oh how the mighty have fallen. Defending champs Spain have already been knocked out of the contest. So this encounter is basically a test to see if it can salvage some of its pride. Croatia v. Mexico: . Croatia needs to score to advance to the next round. Not gonna be easy with Mexican goalie Guillermo Ochoa in the way. He's shut out Brazil and Cameroon, and inspired memes like the one where, Ochoa as Gandalf, stands before the goal proclaiming, ""You shall not pass."" 3. That putrid racism in soccer? Yup, still there . FIFA is not happy after pictures surfaced of two men who showed up to the Germany v. Ghana game in blackface and ""Ghana"" written on their shirts. Oh, at the same game, a Nazi sympathizer ran onto the field. Such a pity because the second half of Saturday's 2-2 draw was, in our opinion, the best 45 minutes of soccer in this tournament. 4. Don't rule the U.S. out just yet . If only the U.S. could have held on for a few more seconds. But it couldn't yesterday. And Portugal made history by racing down field and scoring what ESPN said was the latest World Cup goal ever in regulation. You'd think Portugal would be elated, but Cristiano Ronaldo's reaction to the dramatic equalizer was telling. He just looked down at the ground and walked back to midfield. Portugal really needed a win after putting itself in an impossible hole with a 4-0 loss in its opening match against Germany. So how will Group G play out? Germany and the U.S. each have four points, while Portugal and Ghana each have one. The Americans would prefer to just beat Germany, which would win the group. But if the Americans and Germans draw, both go through as they would if Ghana and Portugal tie. But if there are winners in each match, the loser of U.S.-Germany and the winner of Ghana-Portugal will go to tiebreakers, the first of which is goal differential. Confused? Let's simplify it for you. Just hope the U.S. wins or draws against Germany. 5. What does the fox say? Gooooal! How about them Desert Foxes? Algeria's on the verge of qualifying for the knockout round after a 4-2 victory over South Korea yesterday.

"Washington (CNN) -- Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., once a rising Democratic star whose political fortunes imploded over the use of campaign finances to support lavish personal spending, was sentenced to 30 months in prison on Wednesday. ""I misled the American people,"" Jackson, 48, said before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed the term, which also included an order for restitution and community service. The ex-Illinois lawmaker's wife, Sandi, received a 12-month sentence for her role in her husband's misuse of roughly $750,000 in campaign funds over several years. ""I don't have to tell you this is a very sad day and a very difficult case,"" Judge Jackson said, calling it an example of organized and joint misconduct and a violation of the public trust. ""You knew better,"" she said. As the judge read her sentence, Sandi Jackson wept. Her husband smiled slightly when he received his punishment, which was less than what the government sought. The pair pleaded guilty in February to various charges -- Jackson to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, and false statements; and his wife to filing false tax returns. After the hearing, Jackson acknowledged his failings and hoped for a renewal. ""I still, believe in the power of forgiveness. I believe in the power of redemption. Today I manned up and tried to accept responsibility for the error of my ways,"" he said before climbing into a waiting vehicle. Vacations, furs and memorabilia . A smooth politician and the son of a civil rights leader and one-time political heavyweight, the younger Jackson admitted to using campaign money to pay for things such as vacations, furs and Michael Jackson memorabilia. In a statement read in court, Jackson said he wanted to be held accountable for his actions and he knew what he did was wrong. He also asked the judge to not punish his wife for what he said ""was a subset of what I did."" ""I ask that my kids not suffer from my actions,"" Jackson said of his two children, 9 and 13. ""If probation is not available to my wife, give me her time."" Jackson's lawyers reiterated that sentiment and asked the court for an 18-month sentence for Jackson and probation for his wife. ""This is not Madoff,"" Reid Weingarten, Jackson's lawyer, said in court, referring to notorious Wall Street swindler Bernie Madoff. ""There was no Ponzi scheme."" Sandi Jackson sobbed through part of her courtroom statement and said she ""put her family unit in peril"" for filing false tax returns. ""I stand before you today asking for mercy,"" she said. ""My heart breaks every day with the pain it's caused my babies. I ask the court for mercy."" Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Jackson and 18 months in jail and restitution of $168,550 for his wife. ""This is a sad day that involves a waste of talent,"" prosecutor Matthew Graves said. ""They were in the top 10 percent of household earnings in the United States. There's just no need for this kind of conduct."" Graves said that Jackson did not ""deserve credit"" for his job as a congressman. ""That's what he was paid to do,"" he said. Jackson's lawyers pointed to his record in Washington -- one they said was good -- in arguing for a lighter sentence. The judge said the sentencing guidelines were excessive and that apologies expressed appeared genuine. She also cited helpful cooperation. ""The real remorse you've shown is palpable in this courtroom,"" she said. ""There's no question you've suffered. Your remorse is real."" After sentencing, the judge gave the couple a few minutes to discuss who wanted to serve their sentence first. Jackson will begin his sentence around November 1 at a prison camp in Montgomery, Alabama, the judge said. Jackson requested the location. ""I ask for Alabama so I can be as far away from everybody for a while as I can be,"" he said. ""I want to make it a little inconvenient for everybody to get to me."" In addition to jail time, Jackson must repay in full the money he misused, while his wife was ordered to make restitution of $22,000. Jackson and his wife also were ordered to perform community service. Jackson in Congress until 2012 . According to court records, Jackson misused about $750,000 in campaign funds from August 2005 through July 2012. Some of the eye-popping spending included $60,000 at Antiques of Nevada, where Jackson bought two hats belonging to the late singer Michael Jackson costing more than $8,000; a $5,000 football signed by U.S. presidents; and memorabilia involving the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and martial artist Bruce Lee. The Jackson's also use campaign funds to purchase Blu-Ray DVD players from Best Buy, dresses and jewelry from a small boutique and fur capes and parkas from a Beverly Hills, California, furrier. In total, prosecutors said Jackson made more than 3,000 purchases. Jackson served in the House of Representatives from 1995 until 2012, when he took a medical leave of absence and never returned. He was succeeded by Democratic Rep. Robin L. Kelly, who won a special election this year to fill the vacancy in the Illinois 2nd Congressional District. Jackson's lawyers later stated he suffers from bipolar disorder. A rising star, knows Obama . Early in his political career, Jackson was considered a politician on the rise. In 1997, Newsweek named him one of the 100 people to watch in the next century. ""He's a hit in Congress,"" read the Newsweek article. ""Will he be the first black president?"" Although Jackson never lived up to that hype, he was an extremely vocal supporter of then-candidate Barack Obama. ""I'm sure that Dr. King is looking down on us here in Denver noting this is the first political convention in history to take place within sight of a mountaintop,"" Jackson said in 2008, referencing the Rev. Martin Luther King's famous speech, ""I've Been to the Mountaintop."" ""I know Barack Obama,"" Jackson said. ""I've seen his leadership at work. I've seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across Illinois."" Outside the courtroom, Jackson Sr. told reporters that his son was ""unbelievably sick"" a year ago, but is now doing better. ""I don't know how I missed so many signs,"" the elder Jackson said.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 20 years have passed, but Diego Goldman still can't get rid of the sensation in his nostrils. ""Do you know what it smells like? I can still smell that smell -- the one of burning flesh."" It has been like that ever since the horrific day his mother woke him from his slumber with screams usually only heard in nightmares. On July 18, 1994, a bomb was set off at the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, killing 85 people and wounding about 300. ""There were bodies everywhere,"" Goldman, who was 18 at the time, told CNN. ""But it's the smell which lingered. I can never forget. Never. ""I remember arriving and knowing that so many people who I knew were inside that building -- I knew so many of those who were murdered. ""I just wanted to help. I wanted to help rescue those below the rubble, and worked for hours trying to get people out alive. ""It was chaos -- there was blood, flesh ... people didn't know what to do. Some couldn't stay and help, it was too difficult. ""But there were people I knew who would have been there. I can still see people's faces."" On Saturday, Goldman, like many of those affected by the bomb, will turn his attention to Argentina's footballers and their World Cup meeting with Iran -- the country blamed for the atrocity. Argentine prosecutors accuse Iran of helping coordinate and plan the attack through a Hezbollah cell in the region. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, and Iran vehemently denies any involvement. It's the first time Argentina has faced Iran in football since that fateful day -- and its 250,000-strong Jewish community, the largest in South America, wants its dead remembered. In a June 3 letter sent to FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the Latin American Jewish Community requests ""at the beginning of this match, a minute of silence in memory of the victims, in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the attack and all these years of impunity."" The move, which is unlikely to be successful as a spokesman for the global game's ruling body says it has not received a request from the Argentine Football Association, has brought fresh publicity to the search for justice. As well as the smell of burning flesh, the image of bodies laid strewn across the ground remains a permanent fixture in Goldman's consciousness after the building, the heartbeat of the Jewish community in the Argentine capital, was reduced to ruins. ""You don't forget things like that,"" he says quietly. ""I stood there with boyfriends, husbands, wives, girlfriends, all of us digging and hoping to find a loved one. ""I could see people trapped but I knew if I took a wrong step, more rubble could fall upon them. ""Some people just couldn't handle it -- the smell was enough to turn a lot of volunteers away. ""So many people died ... so many."" In February 2013, Argentine lawmakers agreed to work with Iran to investigate the attack -- a move which was met with skepticism. The formation of a five-person panel -- named the ""Truth Commission"" -- was passed by a 131-113 vote following an intense 14-hour debate. The move was struck down by the Federal Court, which ruled it unconstitutional, and a government appeal will now be heard in the country's Supreme Court. In 2007, Argentina requested the arrest of several Iranians in connection with the bombing, including Iran's former defense minister Ahmad Vahidi. While the request for a minute's silence on Saturday is unlikely to come to fruition, there will be a short remembrance service before the game on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana Beach, where Israelis, Argentines and Jews from across the world are expected to gather. One of those hoping to be present is Mariano Schlez, who has traveled from Buenos Aires to Brazil as part of a separate project aiming to connect Jewish football fans at the World Cup. Schlez and his wife, Paola Salem, received a charity grant to help launch activities for Jewish supporters who are in Brazil for the tournament. Many of them will attend the ceremony on Copacabana before watching the game, which is being played 216 miles away in Belo Horizonte. ""As Jews, we are always looking to show that we want to find justice,"" said Schlez. ""We see this game between Argentina and Iran as a great opportunity to tell the world that this case is still unresolved and there have been no convictions."" Argentina, which won its opening game against Bosnia, will begin as a heavy favorite against Iran on Saturday. Led by Barcelona's four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi, Argentina is expected to reach the later stages and possibly even win the tournament for the first time since 1986. But for many, a moment of silence before kickoff in Belo Horizonte would resonate loudest. ""We're asking for a minute's silence because it deserves to be respected,"" Goldman says. ""I think that the world should know that this was an act of terror which has impacted on both nations. ""We cannot allow ourselves to forget what happened."" For Goldman the memories remain raw -- and the smell refuses to go away.","Argentina faces Iran in World Cup Saturday .

"London (CNN) -- A British lawmaker said Thursday that he and 17 others have been awarded payouts over phone hacking by the News of the World newspaper, in settlements totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. News International, the parent company of the now defunct News of the World newspaper, issued a statement confirming that a subsidiary had agreed to settlements, but did not provide details. A number of people have brought civil cases against News International over alleged phone hacking by its employees. Chris Bryant, a Labour Party member of Parliament, posted on Twitter: ""News of the World apologises to me and 17 others in the High Court - and pays damages plus costs, with no hush clause."" In another post, Bryant said News of the World ""admitted in court today that my phone was hacked and privacy intruded."" He listed former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, actor Jude Law, the actor's ex-wife, Sadie Frost, and high-profile rugby player Gavin Henson as among the 18 people in court. News International, in its statement, said that News Group Newspapers, its subsidiary that was the publisher of News of the World, ""agreed (to) settlements in respect of a number of claims against the company."" It added that the company ""made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case."" The office of Mark Thomson, the lawyer who is representing many of the claimants, gave details of their payouts. The office said Law received £130,000, while Frost was awarded £50,000. Law's personal assistant, Ben Jackson, was given £40,000, while a former PR adviser to Law and his ex-partner, Sienna Miller, Ciara Parkes, received £35,000. Henson was awarded £40,000, as were Guy Pelly, a friend of Prince William, and Joan Hammell, a former chief of staff to Prescott. Lisa Gower, who was linked to actor Steve Coogan, was given £30,000, the lawyer's office said. According to court documents posted online by the Guardian newspaper, freelance journalist Tom Rowlands -- who had worked for fellow News International titles the Times and Sunday Times -- was given £25,000 damages after News of the World hacked his voice mail to get information it then used in stories it published itself. In a statement read outside the High Court by his legal team, Jude Law called the behavior of News of the World ""appalling"" and said he had brought legal proceedings ""to try to find out the truth."" The group of lawyers representing the claimants said they had obtained documents from News International that revealed its attempts to destroy evidence, partly thanks to the fact that the 12 legal firms involved joined forces to work together. ""As a result, documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a coverup and the destruction of evidence/e-mail archives by News Group have now been disclosed to the claimants,"" said the lawyers' statement, read outside court. ""In the face of this overwhelming evidence, the 'rogue reporter' position has disintegrated and the range, scale and extent of phone-hacking has become clear."" James Murdoch, chief executive of News International and the son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, has insisted that the practice of phone hacking was not widespread. News International scrapped the best-selling News of the World Sunday tabloid in July amid outrage over claims it had hacked into the voice mail of a missing 13-year-old girl who turned out to have been murdered. Mark Thomson said other claimants would press ahead with a trial scheduled for next month, and praised the courage of all those taking on ""a massive and influential multinational media organization."" Thursday's hearing followed the settlement of a number of other claims against News Group Newspapers, which also publishes the Sun. Among them was the claim brought by Law's ex-fiancee, Miller. Law's statement said: ""For several years leading up to 2006, I was suspicious about how information concerning my private life was coming out in the press. I changed my phones, I had my house swept for bugs but still the information kept being published. I started to become distrustful of people close to me. ""I was truly appalled by what I was shown by the police and by what my lawyers have discovered. It is clear that I, along with many others, was kept under constant surveillance for a number of years."" Prescott, in an interview with the Hull Daily Mail newspaper in his former constituency, said he had been awarded £40,000 in damages, plus his legal costs. ""Today's court decision at long last brings clarity, apology and compensation for the years of hacking into my telephone messages by Rupert Murdoch's News Group Newspapers,"" he told the newspaper. ""It follows years of aggressive denials and a cavalier approach to private information and the law. These denials were supported by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) and the inaction of senior officers of the Metropolitan Police."" A public inquiry was set up in the wake of the scandal to examine British media ethics and behavior. Senior executives and editors for News International and other media organizations, both current and former, have testified before the Leveson Inquiry, a wide-ranging government-backed investigation of British press ethics and practices, as have many of the alleged victims of phone hacking and other abuses by the press. The Metropolitan Police is also conducting investigations into phone-hacking claims and allegations that police officers were bribed for information.

"(CNN) -- Dieting in Hungary is not recommended. The country's cuisine is a rich blend of Europe, Middle-eastern and Asian food. The French lend their influence with goose liver pate, while the seven-layer Dobos cake can rival Austria's famed Sachertorte for sickly sweet extravagance. Food here is abundant and affordable -- a nightmare for weight-watchers, a dream for true foodies. Goulash . Goulash -- is it a soup? Is it a stew? Hungary's national dish (pronounced ""gooyash,"" by the way) is a cross between the two, a steaming bowl of slow-cooked beef, carrots, onions and loads of Hungary's trademark paprika to give it a good kick. It's hard to find a restaurant that doesn't serve it -- from the humblest café to the grandest establishments. Where to try it: In the sleek, modern surroundings of Budapest Bisztro (Vecsey utca 3, +36 1 783 0788). Langos . The Hungarians' favorite street food certainly hits the spot on a chilly morning when you're desperate for a quick bite before lunch. It's simple: a deep-fried flatbread topped with sour cream and grated cheese -- sometimes with a bit of garlic just to annoy the person next to you. Where to try it: The Danube town of Szentendre has some of the best langos in the country. There's tiny alleyway leading to St Janos church in the main square, where a sign helpfully saying ""langos"" should point you in the direction of a nameless stall halfway up the alley. Paprika chicken . Those sweet red peppers that are such a staple of Hungarian cooking really shine in this popular stew also known as chicken paprikash. Powdered paprika goes into the dish too, along with onions, garlic, tomatoes and a dollop of sour cream. Served with egg dumplings called nokedli (like the Austrian spätzle), it's comfort food that's hard to beat. Where to try it: If you're in the Buda Castle district of Budapest, try Alabardos Restaurant (Orszaghaz utca 2, +36 1 356 0851). Hortobagyi meat pancakes . Hungarians adore their palacsinta -- pancakes that are more like French crêpes than the thicker American ones you douse with maple syrup. This savory version is just as decadent: a rich stew of minced veal or chicken tucked inside the pancakes and smothered with a sour cream and paprika sauce. Where to try it: While relaxing under the stone arched ceiling of Pierrot (Fortuna utca 14, Budapest, +36 1 375 6971), housed in a 13th-century former bakery. Goose liver pâté . It's not just the French who like goose liver; the Hungarians are right behind them in their love for this buttery delicacy. Where to try it: They wrap it in bacon and lightly grill it at Aranysarkany Vendeglo restaurant in Szentendre (Alkotmany utca 1; +36 26 301 479). Or you can have it as a starter at one of Budapest's landmark restaurants, Gundel (Gundel Karoly Way 4, +36 1 468 4040), in the lush surroundings of the city park. Cold sour cherry soup . While a lot of Hungarian dishes are perfect for cold days, chilled sour cherry soup is just the thing for warm summer evenings. Fresh sour cherries combine with sour cream and sugar in this refreshing classic. Where to try it: Leves (Vamhaz korut 14, Budapest, +36 30 241 7760), for the takeout version. Tihanyi pike perch . Lake Balaton is Hungary's playground, where everyone flocks to laze in thermal springs and feast on the lake's plump pike perch. You can have this succulent fish roasted, grilled or prepared Tihanyi style: made into a terrine with cream, white wine, spinach and dill. Where to try it: Gorgeous views of the lake come with delicious plates of fish at Ferenc Pince Csarda (Cserhegy 9, Tihany, +36 76 448 575) from its prime position on the Tihany peninsula. Stuffed cabbage leaves . You won't go far in Central and Eastern Europe without coming across cabbage rolls, and Hungary is no exception. Here they're called toltott kaposzta: pork mince stuffed into cabbage leaves with -- you guessed it -- lots of paprika. It's best with sour cream on top, in true Hungarian style, along with sauerkraut and chunks of smoked pork. Where to try it: After browsing the stalls in Budapest's Central Market, you can grab a plate of hearty stuffed cabbage upstairs in Fakanal Etterem (Vamhaz korut 1-3, +36 1 217 7860). Kurtoskalacs (chimney cake) ""Chimney cake"" is made by wrapping pastry around a cylinder to bake over the last of the embers in an open fire. The pastry is also often coated in lots of sugar so the lovely sticky caramel coating can hold on to the extra flavors dusted on top -- anything from cinnamon to cocoa to chopped walnuts. Where to try it: It's best slightly warm with ice cream and coffee in Molnar's Kurtoskalacs café (Vaci utca 31) in Budapest. Dobos cake . Seven layers -- yes, seven -- of moist sponge cake sandwiched with chocolate buttercream. Then, before things get too gooey, there's a thin layer of caramel on top to give it a lovely crunch. We have 19th-century Hungarian confectioner Jozsef Dobos to thank for this heavenly creation which has become a staple in Hungarian coffeehouses. Where to try it: The sumptuous interior of Budapest's Central Kavehaz (Karolyi Mihaly utca 9, +36 1 266 2110) is a suitably grand setting for such a glorious cake. Eszterhazy torte . A cake fit for a prince -- Prince Eszterhazy, to be precise. The Hungarian royal's name lives on in one of Europe's most famous cakes: Five layers of almond meringue and buttercream with elegant swirls on top. Where to try it: Just around the corner from Budapest's ornate Parliament is Szalai (Balassi Balint utca 4, +36 1 269 3210), a delightfully old-fashioned cake shop where you can indulge in one of these royal treats. Somloi sponge cake . Not one but three types of sponge cake -- vanilla, chocolate and walnut -- go into this luscious dessert. But it doesn't stop there: Fresh whipped cream, chocolate sauce and pungent rum bring the three cakes together to form an exquisite dessert. Where to try it: For sheer opulence, this rich dish is best devoured in the fantastic interior of the New York Café (Erzsebet korut 9-11, +36 1 886 6111) in the Boscolo Budapest hotel.","Goulash, Hungary's national dish, is pronounced ""gooyash""

"London (CNN) -- The publisher of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World has paid singer Charlotte Church and her family £600,000 ($952,000) to settle a phone-hacking lawsuit, her lawyer said Monday. The payment by Murdoch's News Group Newspapers includes £300,000 in damages, plus legal costs, lawyer Mike Brookes said -- far more than other hacking victims have been paid. Speaking outside the court after the settlement was reached, Church said the behavior of tabloid journalists had ""sickened and disgusted her,"" and she did not believe the News International apology in court was sincere. ""They are not truly sorry; they are just sorry they got caught,"" Church said. Murdoch's News of the World was closed down last summer over revelations about phone hacking and police bribery by people working for the newspaper. Targets of phone hacking included not only celebrities like Church but also victims of crime and terrorism, wounded troops and their families, and politicians. Police are conducting three investigations into illegal activity by British journalists and private detectives working for them. Two parliamentary committees are also probing the scandal, and a separate independent inquiry has been established by Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron himself was drawn into the scandal for having hired a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, to be his spokesman after Coulson left the paper over the hacking scandal. Coulson has since resigned as Cameron's spokesman. He denies wrongdoing, but is among more than a dozen people arrested over phone hacking. No one has been charged. The Church settlement is much higher than in 59 other suits settled recently by News International, the British newspaper publishing arm of Murdoch's News Corp. Actor Jude Law was paid £130,000 ($206,000), for example, while retired soccer star Paul Gascoigne was paid £68,000 ($108,000). The newspaper publisher has also been paying the legal costs of the suits. Church had been the lone holdout refusing to settle, but said Monday she had changed her mind to protect her parents. News International was prepared to make the case ""into an interrogation into my mother's medical history,"" Church said. ""I would have learning nothing more from an actual trial since it was clear no one from News International was prepared to take the stand,"" she said. Brookes, her lawyer, said the settlement was higher than for others because Church's parents had also been targeted, starting when she was a teenager. ""The News of the World trespassed into the lives of an entire family. James and Maria are not remotely in the public eye. They are no more and no less than proud parents with an exceptionally talented daughter,"" he said. He said in court that News of the World ""targeted Charlotte and her voice mail messages repeatedly,"" obtained her personal medical information starting when she was 16, violated the privacy of her parents' voice mail, and ""coerced"" Church's mother into giving them an interview about Maria Church's attempted suicide. A lawyer for the publisher said in court he accepted ""everything Mr. Brookes has said,"" apologized, and said ""they should never have had to endure what they have suffered."" Church's settlement does not end the lawsuits against News International. Cherie Blair, the wife of former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, announced February 22 that she was suing over allegations her voice mail was intercepted to get news of her pregnancy when her husband was in office.","NEW: Her family should never have had to endure what they did, Murdoch's lawyer says .

"Tel Aviv, Israel (CNN) -- Israeli President Shimon Peres said Sunday that he could be willing to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, but expressed wariness of other forces in the country. ""Why not? I don't have enemies,"" he told CNN's Richard Quest at a business conference in Tel Aviv, when asked whether he'd be willing to have such a meeting. ""It's not a matter of a person but of a policy,"" Peres added. ""The purpose is to convert enemies into friends. If it was only him I'd take it with greater assurance, but there are other structures, other people. The Iranian Revolutionary Guard, half army and half organization, spreads terror all over the world. And I'm not so sure they support the president. We have to see the balance of the situation."" Peres reiterated Israel's position that it won't stand for Iran being a ""nuclear danger"" to the world, and that ""all options remain on the table to give weight to the words."" But Israel prefers a diplomatic solution, he said. The Israeli presidency is largely a figurehead position. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leads the government. In Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is in charge of the government. After Iran deal, Obama and Kerry pivot to Middle East peace . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Netanyahu late last week. It was the first face-to-face meeting of U.S. and Israeli officials since the U.S. and five other world powers reached a six-month deal with Iran last month over its nuclear program. Even though it's only a short-term agreement, world leaders hope it will pave the way to a long-term guarantee that Iran won't produce nuclear weapons. Iran insists its nuclear program is for civilian energy purposes, not weaponry. And Tehran hopes to recoup some of the billions of dollars it's lost as a result of international sanctions. Netanyahu wants to eliminate Iran's nuclear capability entirely, rather than merely suspend and limit the country's nuclear development. ""The problem is what will happen in the coming six months. It's a trial period,"" Peres said Sunday. ""President Obama said that for him also this is a trial and gave an estimate of 50-50 as to whether it will succeed."" Iran will not dismantle any of its nuclear facilities as part of an effort to reach a long-term agreement, Rouhani said in an interview published Friday in The Financial Times. Asked whether dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities was a ""red line,"" Rouhani said: ""100 percent."" Rouhani told the UK-based newspaper that the nuclear agreement hammered out in Geneva, Switzerland, is an important first step to see if a mutual trust can be built with the United States. ""The problems created over 35 years cannot be resolved over a limited time. The best test to see whether we are capable of building trust or not is this nuclear issue,"" he said. Rouhani, widely considered more moderate than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has struck a positive tone and reached out to the West to improve relations, particularly with the United States. He has also acknowledged the Holocaust, unlike Ahmadinejad. And Rouhani recently wished Jews a happy Rosh Hashanah through his official Twitter account.","Israeli president says purpose of diplomatic talks is to convert enemies into friends .

"(CNN) -- Hours before the George Zimmerman not-guilty verdict was announced, my partner and I were discussing ways to prevent our 16-year-old son from getting shot while jogging in the upper-middle-class, predominantly white neighborhood we had recently moved into. I promise you, it was a very real conversation. ""Maybe we should get T-shirts and sweatshirts with the school's name on it,"" my partner said. After the verdict -- it came as a punch to the stomach -- we thought maybe it was best if he only ran inside at the nearby gym. This is what it means to be a parent of a young black man in America today: sleepless nights, courtesy of a cocktail of institutional racism, self-inflicted wounds and statistics. Lots and lots of statistics. About the too-high high school dropout rate among black youths, the distressingly high number of black men who are perpetrators -- and victims -- of violent crimes, the disproportionately steep incarceration rates for black men. Those who create our pop culture have learned to monetize that negative image, and some young black men are mesmerized by it, adopting it as their own. As a result, we are all susceptible to the same prejudicial thoughts that led George Zimmerman to view a 17-year-old boy with a hoodie on his head and a bag of candy in his hand as suspicious. Related: My son knows he could be Trayvon . Trayvon could have been my son -- and that scares the hell out of me. If, during this 16-month ordeal, that thought never crossed your mind, then you have no idea what it is like to be the parent of a young, black male in America. After the verdict, attorneys from both the prosecution and defense seemed to go out of their way in their press conferences to say race was not a factor, which sounded more like wishful thinking than accurate commentary. After all, if Zimmerman were black, there would not have been a late night press conference afterward. When do you hear public outcry for the lives of young black males taken by other black males in cities such as Baltimore and St. Louis? If Zimmerman were black, I doubt the NAACP would have felt the need to issue a statement. If Zimmerman were black, Fox News would not have even bothered to show up. I remember walking home from the store one day, back when I was Trayvon's age. A white man in a sedan pulled up beside me, rolled down his window and said he wanted to talk. I was always taught to never talk to strangers, so I stayed silent and walked faster. He drove faster. I ran, yelling ""Help!"" as I tried to get away from him. That's when he pulled over, got out of his car, drew his weapon and yelled he was going to shoot me if I didn't stop running. It was only after he handcuffed me that he showed me a badge. After it was determined I was not the black male he was looking for, he let me go. Opinion: When blacks killed by non-blacks, justice rarely served . The worst part of that story? I consider myself lucky. He could have shot first. To be the parent of a young black man in this country is to be torn between wanting your son to see the world with no boundaries and warning him of the boundaries that are out there. Moving him into a safe neighborhood and then fearing for his safety. It's nerve-racking, to tell you the truth. Anxiety grips my body each time he leaves home. Seeing the defense attorneys crack grim jokes and gloat after the not-guilty verdict does not help matters. To draw so much satisfaction from the senseless death of a young black male going unpunished; to cavalierly absolve Zimmerman of any responsibility, as if Trayvon's death did not come at their client's hands. Opinion: Zimmerman case echoes issues of race, guns . But this is what it's like to be the parent of a young, black male in this country. This is what it's like.

"London (CNN) -- The publisher of Rupert Murdoch's now defunct News of the World tabloid paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds Wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman. The publisher apologized for intercepting phone messages of Alastair Campbell, the Blair aide, and agreed to pay costs and damages, Campbell said in a statement. He did not say how much the settlement was worth. With Wednesday's settlements, News Group Newspapers has settled 59 of the 60 lawsuits against it. But former child singing star Charlotte Church, who has testified publicly about the damage phone hacking did to her personal life, has refused to settle. Her case is expected to go to court as soon as this month. The phone-hacking scandal prompted Murdoch's son, News Corp. executive James Murdoch, to shut down News of the World in July. The best-selling British newspaper was 168 years old. Wednesday's agreement may not end Campbell's legal action against Murdoch's newspaper group, lawyer Gerald Shamash said. The publisher said it would continue searching for documents related to the hacking of Campbell's voice mail and disclose what it found to him. News Group Newspapers ""has agreed that Mr. Campbell may be entitled"" to further legal action, Shamash said. Comic actor Steve Coogan, who also settled Wednesday, echoed the words of many who have sued over phone hacking. ""This has never been about money,"" he said outside the court. ""Like other people who have sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information."" British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal, and police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of it: phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery. Two parliamentary committees are also investigating the scandal. The publisher of the shuttered tabloid is paying £40,000 ($63,000) and legal costs to Coogan, £45,000 ($71,000) plus costs to Liberal Democrat politician Simon Hughes, and £75,000 ($119,000) plus costs to sports agent Sky Andrew, lawyers and judges announced Wednesday. Retired soccer star Paul Gascoigne was paid £68,000 plus costs. The Murdoch group admitted both hacking his phone messages and having him followed by a private investigator, Derek Webb. Former lawmaker George Galloway got £25,000 ($40,000) plus costs as the publisher admitted hacking his phone messages after the start of the second Gulf war. A number of other high-profile figures, including actors Jude Law and Sienna Miller, and former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, have already received settlements from Murdoch's publishing group. Its parent company, News International, said at the time that the company ""made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by NGN or sought to conceal it. However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, NGN agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case."" Both James and Rupert Murdoch, as well as senior executives at News International, have testified before British lawmakers examining allegations of wrongdoing. There have been 13 arrests in connection with Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into bribery of police officers by journalists. There have been 17 arrests in relation to Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking inquiry. Three people have been arrested in connection with both investigations. No one has been charged.","NEW: Murdoch's News Group Newspapers has now settled 59 of 60 cases .

"London (CNN) -- Media magnate Rupert Murdoch's flagship British Sunday tabloid newspaper officially apologized Sunday for hacking into voice mails, in a scandal which has affected celebrities, politicians and royal household staff. The weekly newspaper offered compensation and ""apologized unreservedly"" for the ""unacceptable"" hacking. But at least one of the victims is rejecting the deal, her lawyer told CNN Sunday. Nicola Phillips, who used to work for celebrity publicist Max Clifford, has refused a payout offer, lawyer Mark Lewis said. ""She ... needs a declaration of the truth,"" Lewis told CNN. ""If I said I will give you 50,000 pounds ($82,000), but you have no way of knowing how many times your phone was hacked, you have no way of knowing how much damage was done."" He declined to say how much she had been offered, citing the terms of a letter Phillips received on Friday from News International, the News of the World's parent company. She is one of several Lewis clients suing over the scandal. Lewis said none of his other clients had received offers of compensation. He represents ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" host Chris Tarrant, among others. News International, which also owns the Sun and the Times of London, Friday apologized for the widespread phone hacking scandal. Murdoch's empire also encompasses the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post, Fox News and Harper Collins publishers. Actress Sienna Miller on April 5 won a court case to access phone records to see if her phone had been hacked. That same day, London's Metropolitan Police arrested two men ""on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting mobile phone voice mail messages"" on April 5, they said. British media identified them as Ian Edmonson, a former assistant editor of News of the World, and Neville Thurbeck, its chief reporter. By law, British police do not name people who have been arrested. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote to police last summer to ask if his voice mail had been hacked into, a source close to the situation told CNN in January. Police declined to say whether Brown had written to them or what action they took. A spokeswoman for Brown would not comment on the record. News International issued a similar apology Friday: ""Following an extensive internal investigation and disclosures through civil legal cases, News International has decided to approach some civil litigants with an unreserved apology and an admission of liability in cases meeting specific criteria."" The company added that it has asked its lawyers to set up a compensation fund to deal with ""justifiable"" claims -- but would contest cases that it believed were without merit. ""That said, past behaviour at the News of the World in relation to voice mail interception is a matter of genuine regret. It is now apparent that our previous inquiries failed to uncover important evidence and we acknowledge our actions then were not sufficiently robust. ""We continue to co-operate fully with the Metropolitan Police. It was our discovery and voluntary disclosure of this evidence in January that led to the re-opening of the police investigation. ""With that investigation on going, we cannot comment further until its completion."" In January, Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman stepped down amid speculation he had known about the hacking -- something he has always denied. Andy Coulson was the editor of the News of the World in 2007 when royal correspondent Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were sentenced to prison for hacking into voice mails of members of the royal family's staff. Goodman also admitted hacking into the messages of model Elle MacPherson. Coulson denied knowing about the hacking but resigned from the paper because Goodman ultimately worked for him. He was later hired to be Cameron's spokesman, a position he quit earlier this year after an extensive New York Times investigation reignited the scandal. Cameron said Coulson was stepping down because of the continuing pressures on him and his family. The former newspaper editor also believed that the focus surrounding the issue was ""impeding his ability to do his job and was starting to prove a distraction for the Government,"" Cameron added. The New York Times alleged in its story last year that -- far from Goodman and Mulcaire being lone culprits -- phone hacking was common practice at the newspaper. One of the few sources who went on the record in the Times article, former News of the World journalist Sean Hoare, said Coulson, then his boss at the tabloid, ""actively encouraged me"" to hack into the voice mails of public figures to get stories for the News of the World. But Coulson's allies have cast doubt on Hoare's credibility since the Times article came out September 1, pointing out that Hoare was fired from the paper over allegations of drug and alcohol abuse. A British parliamentary committee has also investigated the tabloid. News Corporation executives insisted in parliamentary testimony that illegal hacking into voice mail messages was not a widespread practice at News of the World. CNN's Nick Hunt contributed to this report.","Britiain's News of the World ""apologizes unreservedly"" for ""unacceptable"" activity .

"(CNN) -- A spokesman for a national registry of radiologic technologists declined Friday to say whether the group was aware of a 2010 incident in which David Kwiatkowski allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and was fired from an Arizona hospital. After being fired from the Phoenix hospital, Kwiatkowski went on to work at four more hospitals in four other states. He was arrested this month in New Hampshire in connection with stealing drugs from a hospital, and it's believed he infected 30 people in that state with hepatitis C through infected syringes. Exeter Hospital in New Hampshire said it consulted the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists before hiring Kwiatkowski and he held the required certification for his cardiovascular tech position. The registry's website says Kwiatkowski's certification was ""summarily suspended"" as of July 2012. Kwiatkowski was working at Arizona Heart Hospital in 2010 when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN. Hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire strikes fear in 7 other states . ""I looked in the toilet and spotted a 5 cc syringe and a needle floating in the water,"" the employee said in a statement submitted to the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency. ""The label was a blue fentanyl label... He then said 'Shit ... I am going to jail.'"" Fentanyl is a powerful narcotic frequently used in hospitals. Kwiatkowski flushed the syringe and needle down the toilet, according to the employee. Kwiatkowski was immediately fired from Arizona Heart Hospital, according to a hospital spokeswoman. He then relinquished his license as a radiologic technologist. ""I don't have the resources nor money to fight the accusations,"" Kwiatkowski wrote at the time. A few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania, and then went on to work in Kansas and Georgia before working in New Hampshire. The agency that placed Kwiatkowski in the Arizona job reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency, Springboard, Inc. A spokesman for the national registry said they're investigating the allegations against Kwiatkowski. ""Because we have strict confidentiality policies, the status of an ongoing investigation is not released,"" the registry said in a statement. Christopher Cook, a spokesman for the registry, declined to comment further. The director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state. ""We had no jurisdiction,"" said Aubrey Godwin. ""If drugs or alcohol were involved, we would want to get blood tests done, but he was out of state, so it was sort of hard to implement."" An expert in so-called ""drug diversion"" said it's not uncommon for healthcare professionals to leave a state when they're being investigated for drug use. ""They just move on to the next job,"" said John Burke, president of the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators. ""This is a much bigger problem than most people realize."" Godwin, the director of the Arizona licensing board, said he's not sure if his group reported the 2010 incident to the national registry. ""It's not clear. I can't say. It would have been just a phone call, and I don't remember a phone call, but I'm not sure on that one,"" he told CNN. In the Exeter case, Kwiatkowski has been charged with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product, namely a hospital syringe, according to an affidavit filed in federal court. He is suspected of stealing fentanyl, the affidavit said. Hepatitis C is considered to be among the most serious of hepatitis viruses. It is typically asymptomatic, going undetected until liver damage shows up, according to the Mayo Clinic. New Hampshire's health department is asking everyone who was a patient in Exeter's operating rooms and the intensive care unit between April 1, 2011, and May 25 of this year be tested. Those are two areas that Kwiatkowski visited during his ""routine duties to transport patients,"" an Exeter Hospital statement said. But it added he ""was not involved with procedures or patient care."" Exeter, in a statement, said it conducted a background check and took other steps before hiring Kwiatkowski full time. U.S. Attorney John P. Kacavas said his office interviewed employees at Exeter who said they had seen Kwiatkowski acting strangely, one time sweating profusely and with bloodshot eyes. ""One of them described him as unfit to provide medical care and his supervisor sent him home,"" Kacavas said. ""He provided a plausible explanation for his condition, which was that he had been crying his eyes out because his aunt had died and he was an emotional wreck."" According to state, county and hospital officials, he worked as a radiology technician and medical technician in cardiac catheterization labs in the following locations: . -- Oakwood Annapolis Hospital in Wayne, Michigan, January to September 2007; . -- Saint Francis Hospital, Poughkeepsie, New York, November 2007 to February 2008; . -- UPMC Presbyterian, Pittsburgh, March 2008 to May 2008; . -- Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center, May 2008 to November 2008; . -- Southern Maryland Hospital, Clinton, Maryland, December 2008 to February 2009; . -- Maryvale Hospital, Phoenix, March to June 2009; . -- Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, July 2009 to January 2010; . -- Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore, January 2010 to March 2010; . -- Arizona Heart Hospital, Phoenix, March 2010 to April 2010; . -- Temple University Hospital, Philadelphia, April 2010; . -- Hays Medical Center, Hays, Kansas, May 2010 to September 2010; . -- Houston Medical Center, Warner Robins, Georgia, October 2010 to March 2011. -- Exeter Hospital, Exeter, New Hampshire, April 2011 to July 2012.

"(CNN) -- A radiologic technologists' association didn't punish David Kwiatkowski -- later accused of infecting dozens with hepatitis C -- when he was fired in 2010 from an Arizona hospital because it ""did not have first-hand evidence"" against him to warrant such a move, the group said Monday. The American Registry of Radiologic Technologists said it suspended Kwiatkowski on July 24 after he was charged in federal court with obtaining controlled substances by fraud and tampering with a consumer product, namely a hospital syringe, in New Hampshire, according to an affidavit.

"(CNN) -- The other night, as I sat in the telescope operation room at the Keck Observatory in Waimea, Hawaii, preparing with colleagues to measure light from some of the most distant galaxies known, the phone rang with startling news. An exploding star had been sighted in M82, one of the nearest big galaxies. The ""supernova"" (as such stellar explosions are called) was a special, rare ""Type Ia"" -- the kind that led to the Nobel-worthy discovery of dark energy. Type Ia supernovae have happened in our galactic neighborhood only three times in the last 80 years. Like astronomers around the world, we were excited to be at a world-leading telescope, where we could collect new information about this rare event. The new supernova, SN2014J, is 11.4 million light-years from Earth, a mere stone's throw in cosmic terms. The previous record-holders were found in 1937 (14 million light-years away) and 1972 (16 million light-years away). Supernovae occur at the end of a star's life when its furnace runs out of fuel. Because gravity then overcomes the star's ability to remain puffed up, there is a violent collapse, followed by an explosion that produces radioactive elements such as nickel and cobalt. Most of the light we see from a supernova is emitted as those radioactive elements decay, so the brightness falls sharply over a period of weeks. Incidentally, all the iron in your blood came from the decay of radioactive nickel manufactured in a stellar explosion. So most of the atoms in your body were once in the interiors of stars. Because supernovae change brightness very quickly compared with galaxies (months compared with billions of years for galaxies), we quickly diverted the Keck telescope from our intended targets to SN2014J. Our galaxies will look the same another night, but the supernova won't. Amazingly, a professor and his students at the University of London Observatory had discovered SN2014J well before it reached its peak brightness. ""The weather was closing in, with increasing cloud,"" said professor Steve Fossey. ""So instead of the planned practical astronomy class, I gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the CCD camera on one of the observatory's automated 0.35-meter telescopes."" Deciding to look at M82 was almost pure luck -- there were fewer clouds in that direction, and the galaxy was pretty and bright. But Fossey quickly noticed M82 didn't look right: It seemed to contain a bright new star. He realized this might be a supernova and, together with his students, worked feverishly to rule out other explanations (such as a flaw in the camera or an asteroid in our galaxy appearing to pass by M82). In short order, the discovery of the new supernova was confirmed, and the e-mail alerts and notifications began. Tom Wright, one of the students, said, ""One minute we're eating pizza, then five minutes later we've helped to discover a supernova. I couldn't believe it."" The only supernova that's more extraordinary is SN1987A, which was discovered in 1987. It is in a tiny satellite galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, about 160,000 light-years away and 70 times closer than SN2014J. Here's an analogy for the vast distances across which we see supernovae: Imagine if 1987A were on the back porch. Then SN2014J would be just down the street; a garden-variety nearby supernovae would be in the next town, and the most distant supernovae would be over in the next state. Space is very empty -- there are only a few big galaxies near us. On average, the distance to the nearest big galaxy is about 100 times its size. But space is also huge, and there are billions of galaxies. In an ordinary big galaxy such as the Milky Way, one supernova -- of any type -- happens only every hundred years or so. But since there are so many galaxies in the universe, millions of supernovae go off every year. From Earth, we can see hundreds of these. One recipe we can use to find a supernova is to take pictures of a few hundred galaxies, repeat a few weeks later and look for the difference. The supernova will look like an overly bright star compared with the galaxy in which it lies. Finding one supernova in several hundred galaxies is equivalent to staring at one galaxy for several hundred years. M82 is an unusual galaxy because it has a high rate of star formation. That's why two other supernovae were found in M82 as recently as 2008 and 2004. But they were not the special Type Ia supernovae. Because we have a good idea of how much light is emitted by Type Ia supernovae, the brightness we observe is a direct indicator of the distance to the host galaxy. This makes Type Ia supernovae incredibly valuable for measuring cosmic distances. Careful observations of Type Ia supernovae across the universe were essential to measuring the expansion history of the universe over billions of years. This led directly to the discovery of dark energy, a sort of fifth fundamental force that is now one of the most important unknowns in physics or astronomy. The reason Type Ia supernovae are special is their uniformity. Basically, they all explode at about the same mass, so they are all roughly equally luminous. Better understanding the physics of that explosion and the effect of local galactic environment will make Type Ia supernovae even better ""standard candles"" and improve our understanding of the properties of dark energy and the cosmological evolution of the universe. The more data we can get, and the closer the supernova, the better the calibration. We are lucky that SN2014J was discovered about two weeks before it will reach its maximum brightness, rather than after. For the next week or so, the data will get better as the supernova gets brighter. On Tuesday night, it was reported to be 11th magnitude (astronomer units), which is about 100 times fainter than can be seen with the naked eye. But it should get at least 10 times brighter, with a maximum around 8th magnitude -- not visible to the naked eye but certainly discernible with a good pair of binoculars. M82 lies far north in the sky, in the constellation Ursa Major, near the Big Dipper, above the Dipper's bowl and about a third of the way over toward Polaris, the North Star. So if you can see the Big Dipper and the North Star, take a shot at seeing one of the most unusual supernovae in your lifetime. Of course, you can't get too excited about the timing. We see this light 11.4 million years after the explosion happened, because of the time light takes to reach our galaxy. So it was a really special time in M82 11.4 million years ago. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","In one of the nearest big galaxies, M82, a rare type of supernova exploded .

"(CNN)  -- Fernando Torres' highly-anticipated switch to English champions Chelsea was completed just before Monday transfer window closed in a deal that his former team Liverpool said had broken the British record. Chelsea's website reported that the Spain striker had signed a five-and-a-half-year contract, but did not disclose the fee -- which British media speculated would be about £50 million ($80 million). However, it was still well short of the world-record $130 million that Spain's Real Madrid paid English club Manchester United for Cristiano Ronaldo in 2009. In another deal confirmed late on Monday, Benfica said that Brazil defender David Luiz had joined Chelsea in a deal worth $34 million that saw Serbian midfielder Nemanja Matic sign for the Portuguese club. ""I am very happy with my transfer to Chelsea and I am looking forward very much to helping my new team-mates this season and for many years to come,"" 2010 World Cup winner Torres told the London side's website. ""Having played against Chelsea many times since coming to England, and in some very big games I will never forget, I know there are many great players here and I will work hard to win a place in the team. I hope I can score some important goals for the supporters to enjoy this season."" The 26-year-old scored 65 goals in 102 Premier League appearances for Liverpool after joining from Atletico Madrid in 2007 in a £20 million deal, netting 81 in 142 games in all competitions. Torres' move followed the news that Liverpool had agreed a club-record fee for Newcastle's England striker Andy Carroll, who handed in a transfer request in the afternoon after the 18-time English champions made an improved bid. Just before the 2300 GMT deadline, Liverpool confirmed that the 22-year-old had signed a contract until 2016. The fee was not disclosed but it reportedly surpassed the previous British record of £33 million ($53 million) that Manchester City paid for Brazilian Robinho in 2008. Will deadline-day spending buck the trend? Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich has been relatively quiet in transfer market for the past two seasons, but has this time backed coach Carlo Ancelotti with two marquee signings as his club languish fourth in the table -- 10 points behind leaders Manchester United. The London team also announced on Monday that the Chelsea FC plc made a loss of £70.9 million ($113 million) for the year ended June 30, 2010. ""The reduction in operating losses and increased sales in 2009-10 shows that we are moving in the right direction especially when viewed against the difficult macroeconomic environment,"" chief executive Ron Gourlay told Chelsea's website. ""The club is in a strong position to meet the challenges of UEFA 'financial fair play' initiatives which will be relevant to the financial statements to be released in early 2013.""

Carroll joined Uruguay World Cup striker Luis Suarez at Liverpool, with the 24-year-old completing his $36 million transfer from Dutch club Ajax earlier on Monday to become Kenny Dalglish's first major signing in his second stint as manager. The 24-year-old has scored 111 goals in 159 games for the Amsterdam side. Another high-profile striker on the move Monday was Tottenham's Robbie Keane, who has agreed a loan switch to London rivals West Ham until the end of this season. The move is likely to become permanent should the Hammers, currently bottom of the EPL, avoid relegation to the second flight. Blog: Who will be the best signing of the transfer window? Manager Avram Grant said after the 3-2 FA Cup win Nottingham Forest that he hoped the Republic of Ireland international would provide the spark to get the club away from the drop zone. ""He is not just a good player, he is a good character that we need in the next 14 games,"" the Israeli told the UK Press Association. Tottenham, who face AC Milan in the last 16 of the Champions League next month, were linked with a bid for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero. But the Argentina striker has signed a new two-and-a-half-year contract extension with the Spanish side until 2014 and told the La Liga outfit's official website: ""I'm staying here because I want to."" Spurs manager Harry Redknapp would not confirm his interest in Aguero or other reported targets in Spain as he arrived for Monday's training session, but told Sky Sports that former England defender Jonathan Woodgate would not be leaving on loan. Woodgate, who has returned to fitness after long-term injury, is needed as defensive cover after captain Michael Dawson was banned for three matches after being sent off in the 4-0 FA Cup defeat to Fulham, while French fellow center-back Younes Kaboul needs an operation, said Redknapp. United States international midfielder Michael Bradley has joined English club Aston Villa from German side Borussia Monchengladbach on loan until the end of this season. Villa boss Gerard Houllier told reporters: ""We've got to prepare for the future and Michael is 23 and a very hard-working midfielder who can score goals."" Villa allowed Irish midfielder Stephen Ireland to join Newcastle on loan for the rest of this season, almost six months after he arrived from Manchester City. Houllier also said that the club had received no bids for England winger Ashley Young. Turkey international striker Tuncay Sanli has moved from English Premier League side Stoke to Wolfsburg in a $7 million deal, the German club announced on their official website. The Bundesliga side also announced the arrival of attacking midfielders Koo Ja-Cheoul of South Korea and Venezuelan Yohandry Orozco, plus Bayer Leverkusen's Germany international striker Patrick Helmes and Czech midfielder Jan Polak. The 21-year-old Koo -- who scored five goals in six matches at the recent Asian Cup -- signed a three-and-a-half-year deal from Korean side Jeju United, while 19-year-old Orozco signed from Venezuela's Zulia FC until 2015. Stoke also allowed former Chelsea and Barcelona striker Eidur Gudjohnsen to join English rivals Fulham on loan, with the Iceland international having failed to win a regular place since his pre-season move from Monaco. German rivals Schalke signed Iran international midfielder Ali Karimi, who worked with coach Felix Magath when they were both at Bayern Munich, plus clubless Greece striker Angelos Charisteas -- who scored the winning goal in the final of Euro 2004. Serie A leaders AC Milan confirmed on their website the signing of 34-year-old Italy defender Nicola Legrottaglie from league rivals Juventus, on a contract until June this year. Italian champions Inter Milan have signed Japan leftback Yuto Nagamoto on loan from Cesena on loan for the rest of this season, with 20-year-old Italy international defender Davide Santon moving in the opposite direction. The 24-year-old Nagamoto set up the only goal of the Asian Cup final against Australia on Saturday which sealed a record fourth title for the Blue Samurai. Inter coach Leonardo has allowed Colombian defender Nelson Rivas to join Ukrainian side Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on loan, with a view to a permanent deal. Brazil-born Italy international striker Amauri has returned to Parma on loan from Italian rivals Juventus, who have replaced him with Cagliari's Alessandro Matri. English club Birmingham City signed Nigeria international Obafemi Martins in a six-month loan deal from Russian side Rubin Kazan, after the former Newcastle striker was granted a work permit. Portugal international striker Liedson has returned to the country of his birth after joining Brazilian club Corinthians from Sporting Lisbon in a $2.9 million deal. The 32-year-old qualified for Portuguese nationality in 2009 and played for his adopted nation at last year's World Cup finals in South Africa. Ecuador midfielder Jefferson Montero has swapped Spanish clubs after joining struggling Levante from Champions League hopefuls Villarreal on loan. Dutch club Feyenoord have signed Denmark international striker Soren Larsen from French side Toulouse on loan for the rest of this season, along with Arsenal's new 18-year-old Japanese forward Ryo Miyaichi and Borussia Monchengladbach midfielder Marcel Meeuwis.","NEW: Chelsea sign Spain striker Fernando Torres from English rivals Liverpool .

"(CNN) -- Pete Seeger, the man considered to be one of the pioneers of contemporary folk music who inspired legions of activist singer-songwriters, died Monday. He was 94. Seeger's best known songs include ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone,"" ""Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)"" and ""If I Had a Hammer (The Hammer Song)."" But his influence extended far beyond individual hits. His grandson Kitama Cahill Jackson told CNN that the singer died of natural causes at New York Presbyterian Hospital on Monday evening. Familiar with controversy . In a career spanning more than 70 years, Seeger frequently courted controversy. ""He lived at a time when so many things hadn't been done yet, the idea of making music about something hadn't really been done,"" Jackson said. ""And now people do it all the time."" Seeger's opinions didn't always sit well with authorities. ""From the start, he aspired to use folk music to promote his left-wing political views, and in times of national turmoil that brought him into direct confrontation with the U.S. government, corporate interests, and people who did not share his beliefs,"" William Ruhlmann wrote in a biography on allmusic.com. ""These conflicts shaped his career."" Early career . In 2009, Seeger talked to CNN about the beginnings of his music career in the late 1930s. ""I come from a family of teachers, and I was looking for a job on a newspaper and not getting one,"" he said in the interview. ""I had an aunt who said, 'Peter, I can get five dollars for you if you come and sing some of your songs in my class.' Five dollars? In 1939, you would have to work all day or two days to make five dollars. It seemed like stealing."" But Seeger said he took his aunt up on the offer. ""Pretty soon I was playing school after school, and I never did work on a newspaper,"" he said ""You don't have to play at nightclubs, you don't have to play on TV, just go from college to college to college, and the kids will sing along with you."" Last days . Jackson, Seeger's grandson, said the singer-songwriter had heart surgery in December to replace a valve, which had gone well and had nothing to do with his death. He said Seeger was in the hospital for six days before his death. He couldn't speak for the last three days, Jackson said, but his mind never went away and he continued to recognize people. ""He was a second father to me, he was a friend, he was a best friend,"" Jackson said. ""He was just this wonderful, genuine person."" People we've lost in 2014 .

"Editor's note: This post was created for your reading pleasure as a collaborative effort between the editorial staffs of BuzzFeed and CNN. (BuzzFeed/CNN) -- Edward Snowden, a 29-year-old former technical assistant for the CIA, revealed himself as the source behind one of the most notorious intelligence leaks in recent U.S. history. Snowden's leak revealed the shocking amount of information the National Security Agency was collecting as a way to track down foreign targets. And while the NSA's tactics may be unsettling, it's not just the U.S. government that is messing with your data. It's a brave new world of information mining. Here are a few ways your data are already being collected and put to use, even if you don't know it. 1. Facebook knows what you're buying. Facebook purchased data in 2012 on 70 million U.S. households from a data mining firm called Datalogix. Facebook then revealed in February what many users were already noticing: The social network was, in fact, tracking users' behavior to better advertise to them. The backlash from creeped-out users has since led Facebook to become even more transparent about its targeting programs. Users now also have the ability to opt out. 2. Your Facebook likes reveal personality traits. Liking something on Facebook is a simple, almost mindless way to pass time on the social networking site. But choosing to ""like"" beer, crappie or ""Real Housewives"" allows researchers to extrapolate far more intimate details about you, such as sexual orientation, political leanings and religion, according to a University of Cambridge study released in March. If you're curious, you can visit youarewhatyoulike.com and see exactly how much your Facebook can predict. 3. Ad firms watch your tweets to better market to you. Twitter, not to be outdone by Facebook's ad targeting, came up with its own version. Leading advertising firm WPP announced last week that it was partnering with Twitter in what the two companies are calling a ""global strategic partnership."" What does that mean for you? Twitter is allowing WPP to analyze Twitter data to set up a way to better monitor real-time consumer behavior. 4. Companies use retina trackers to see how your eyes move in the store. Social media companies are not the only ones scrambling to use your data for more precise targeting. Marketers and consumer-products companies have come up with an effective and very science fiction-y method to better monitor how you interact with products, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Using computer simulations of product designs and store layouts, companies like Procter & Gamble and Kimberly-Clark Corp. are experimenting with eye-tracking technology to better understand how things like how shelf placement or logo size affects consumer behavior. 5. Department stores can track your smartphone. Similarly, a Denver news station learned that some Nordstroms were using their WiFi network to track customers' smartphones and create a heatmap of their movements and how long they stayed in each section of the store. The WiFi tracking program does have an opt-out, which you can learn more about here. 6. Amazon has ads that watch what you look at online. Amazon was one of the first major companies to use what's now a commonly known practice: cookie tracking. In the most basic sense, cookies track and analyze where you're browsing and what you're looking at and then advertise Amazon products that match up. It was one of the first mainstream uses of cookie-tracking and definitely ruffled a few feathers. Amazon still tracks users' cookies, but there are also a lot of resources available to help people turn trackers off. 7. Target can tell if you're pregnant before you do. Target made news last year when it was revealed that its mailer system tracks purchase history and mails coupons based on those purchases. The system got a little too accurate for comfort when a Target in Minneapolis determined that a teenager was pregnant before she did. The mailer system analyzed her previous purchases and noticed that what she was buying in terms of groceries and toiletries fit a trend that usually meant a customer was in the early stages of pregnancy. Unfortunately, the girl and her family didn't know that yet. Sure enough, though, the mailer system was right, the girl was pregnant, and Target's purchase analysis figured it out before the humans it was monitoring did. 8. Qantas Airlines flight attendants carry iPads with up-to-the-minute data on frequent flyers. In the same way Target's algorithms were creeping people out with how much they revealed about their customers, Qantas Airlines learned that too much data can backfire. According to The Harvard Business Review, when Qantas armed its flight attendants with real-time, data-tracking iPads to better accommodate frequent flyers, the customers started getting a little uncomfortable. Qantas decided that the flight attendants needed more training if they were going to incorporate that level of information into customer service but said nothing about the ethics of using it in the first place. 9. An app can use data from your smartphone pictures to pinpoint where you took the photo. Chances are, if you have a smartphone, you've used it to take photos and upload them to share with family, friends and followers. What you may not know is that all of those photos have specific digital fingerprints known as EXIF data, which reveals where they were taken, when they were taken and how they traveled online. So what might an online stalker want to do with all that data? The aptly named Creepy is an app that can aggregate geo-located photos from all over the Web. There are other sites that can do it too, and it's very often what Anonymous uses to track targets down. 10. DNA databases are not just for the FBI anymore. Local law enforcement agencies across the country are building unregulated DNA databases under the radar, The New York Times reported this week. New York's database has 11,000 crime suspects in it, while the version in Orange County, California, has a whopping 90,000 profiles. The DNA is usually taken from low-level defendants who give their DNA to law enforcement in exchange for having charges against them dropped. So if you've given DNA to police in recent years, there's a chance they might still have it.","Remember cookies? They track and analyze your online activity to help companies advertise .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN)  -- A disgraced South Korean scientist -- who gained fame in 2004 when he claimed to have cloned human embryonic stem cells -- on Monday was convicted of embezzling money and illegally buying human eggs, state media reported. The Seoul Central District Court sentenced Hwang Woo-suk, 56, to a two-year prison term, suspended for three years, the Yonhap news agency reported. The scientist in 2006 admitted faking his findings, after questions of impropriety had emerged. Reports of his studies had attracted worldwide attention and enthusiasm from researchers and patients excited about their potential for treating diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. In 2006, prosecutors said Hwang masterminded the process of creating false studies on stem-cell technology. They also backed up his assertion that assistant researcher Kim Sun-jong deceived him with fake data that became part of the research. Prosecutors said Kim smuggled in-vitro fertilized stem cells into Hwang's lab to make it look as though the scientist was successful in creating stem cells through cloning. Hwang was charged with accepting 2 billion won ($2.1 million at the time of charges) in private donations based on falsified research, prosecutors said. They also accused him of embezzling about 800 million won ($856,000 at the time of charges) in private and government research funds. Hwang apologized publicly in January 2006 after a panel of scientists from Seoul National University found he had not derived human stem cells from eggs, as he claimed. ""It is true that the research papers had fabricated data, and I will take full responsibility. I acknowledge this and apologize,"" he said at the time. He acknowledged that much of the data and photographs published in the U.S.-based journal Science in 2004 and 2005 had been fabricated. The university panel's report said Hwang did produce the world's first cloned dog, Snuppy.","Hwang claim in 2004 to have cloned human embryonic stem cells .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has begun his visit to the UK as controversy continues over issues related to the Middle Eastern kingdom. King Abdullah is greeted by Britain's Prince Charles at Heathrow Airport. Queen Elizabeth and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met the king at London's Horseguards Parade parade ground, ahead of a full state banquet at Buckingham Palace. Brown will hold talks with King Abdullah at Downing Street Wednesday before the king's departure Thursday. The UK government regards the state visit, the first in two decades, as being of fundamental importance due to Saudi Arabia's involvement in hot issues such as the war on terror, the situation in both Iran and Iraq and the attempt to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians. But the visit has attracted controversy in the UK from activists on a number of issues. Human rights groups have called on the UK government to react to allegations about the treatment of women and the gay community in the Saudi kingdom, while other protesters have attacked the failure of the Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged bribes surrounding arms deals. The Press Association reported that around 100 demonstrators lined The Mall, the approach to Buckingham Palace, shouting at the procession as it passed by. Peter Tatchell, a human rights campaigner, told the agency that the UK government was showing ""incredible hypocrisy"" for making no comment about alleged abuses in Saudi Arabia while condemning events in Myanmar and Zimbabwe. ""It just shows oil and arms sales seem to have bought the Government's silence,"" the agency reported him as saying. There have also been allegations by Policy Exchange, a think tank, that organizations linked to the Saudi authorities have promoted Islamic fundamentalist literature in UK mosques.  Watch how royal visit has stirred anger. » . Vince Cable, acting leader of opposition party the Liberal Democrats, has already announced he will not attend events associated with the visit, while several ministers from Brown's ruling Labour party are expected to join a human rights protest outside the Saudi embassy Wednesday. King Abdullah stirred controversy ahead of his visit Monday, accusing British authorities of ignoring intelligence that could have prevented the 2005 London bombings . In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Saudi king said Britain failed to act on information provided by Saudi security services ahead of the suicide bombings on London's transport network in July 2005 that killed 52 people and injured more than 770. ""We sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist atrocities in Britain, but unfortunately no action was taken and it may have been able to avert the tragedy,"" the monarch told the BBC. He refused to elaborate on the details of the intelligence, saying that disclosing specific information ""may cause sensitivities"" between the two countries' security services. A British Home Office spokesman strenuously denied that any intelligence from Saudi Arabia had been overlooked in the run-up to the atrocities and that information provided by the Saudis ""was materially different from what actually occurred on 7 July and clearly not relevant to those acts."" ""We have made it clear that if we had intelligence that could have prevented the attacks we would have acted upon it,"" the spokesman told CNN. He also cited a parliamentary investigation last year that found no evidence that intelligence, passed on by the Saudis, could have prevented the bombings. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi Arabian counterpart in London Monday, but the Foreign Office insisted it was for personal reasons and not a snub. Miliband has just adopted a baby son and is taking time off to look after him, the British Foreign Office confirmed to CNN. Miliband's duties were being carried out by junior ministers in his absence. E-mail to a friend .","NEW Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah begins state visit to UK, meets queen, PM .

"(CNN) -- It's as red as blood and, for the traditional Hungarian chef, no less essential for a healthy life. But humble paprika -- national spice and integral to all the most treasured Hungarian dishes -- has been having a rough time. Hungarian paprika production has slumped as buyers across the world have turned to cheaper supplies from Spain, China and Latin America. And two years of unpredictable weather in Hungary may mean this year's crop of capsicum annuum peppers -- the raw ingredient of paprika -- is the poorest in 50 years. Horror of horrors, Hungary may even resort to importing the crop. But despite these trials, and past upsets such as the communists nationalizing paprika production, the spice remains as crucial as ever to the Hungarian soul. To understand Hungarians, you need to know a little bit about their favorite ingredient. And if all else fails, this paprika primer will make for good talking points if you're stuck in a Budapest goulash restaurant on a rainy afternoon. 1. It's Mexican . Well, from around those parts, anyway. Paprika peppers aren't indigenous to Europe -- the spice was among the treasures collected by Christopher Columbus on his expeditions around southern Mexico, Central America and the Antillies in the 15th century. It made its way to Hungary via the Balkans a little later, where it was grown in the gardens of the aristocracy. Its name is the diminutive of a Slavic word for pepper: ""Papar."" ""We believe Columbus's mission was a success because he came back to Europe with a marvelous spice,"" says Gyula Vegh, of the Szeged Paprika Museum, in southern Hungary. ""He discovered America on the way."" More: 11 things to know before visiting Hungary . 2. There are two -- yes, two -- paprika museums . And two paprika festivals -- one in the town of Kalocsa (Hungarian site only) and another in Szeged, which has been the center of the Hungarian paprika industry for more than a century. And, no, Szeged doesn't have a huge fiberglass paprika pepper on a pole just outside town. The two museums are also both working production plants. The Szeged Paprika Museum (Felső Tisza-Part 10, Szeged 6721, Hungary; +36 20 980 8000) shares a building with the Pick Salami factory -- visitors get three varieties of salami to taste and a 10 gram sampling of paprika. Visitors to the Paprika Molnar (Hungarian site only) factory, in the village of Roszke, get a guided tour from the company's CEO, Anita Molnar, as well as a spice sample. ""When people see how much work paprika-growing takes, they appreciate what they get in their little takeaway bag,"" Molnar says. Dried paprika peppers resemble red potato chips and can be eaten like that -- they're a big hit among kids visiting the Molnar factory. 3. Hungarian paprika is super sweet . It takes seven months, from seed to ground powder, to produce paprika. Hungarian paprika peppers are sweeter than others because of the country's cool growing season, which retains sugar in the spice. The weather also affects the color of the paprika. ""In hotter regions such as Peru or western China, the sun makes the paprika dark red,"" Molnar says. ""As the sugar content decreases, the red color is enhanced."" But Hungarian paprika wasn't always so sweet. In the 1920s, the peppers were of such a hot variety they could only be used after the pith had been removed, typically by women workers. ""However, women with little babies couldn't do the job because they'd have to touch the children afterward,"" Molnar explains. ""So unmarried women, or those with older children, picked the peppers instead."" More: Guide to Hungary's signature dishes . 4. It's not just for goulash -- try cake . Early last century, 830 workshops in Szeged alone processed peppers for paprika. But after a Hungarian botanist cultivated a new -- naturally sweet -- variety, large-scale farming became possible and the artisans were replaced. Hearty and cheap, the classic paprika-rich dish goulash was originally considered peasants' food. But paprika's good for more than goulash: It's liberally dispensed in the dishes served at Sotarto Halaszcsarda (Roosevelt tér 14, Szeged, Hungary; +36 62 555 980) fish restaurant in paprika central, Szeged. In Budapest, the upmarket Zeller bistro (Izabella utca 36-38, Budapest 1077, Hungary; +36 30 651 0880) gets rave reviews for its wide range of paprika-rich offerings. It sounds strange but Hungarian paprika's also sweet enough to use in desserts. ""Even I didn't know that paprika could be used for sweets and not only savory dishes,"" says Lajos Kossar, a Hungarian food writer and chef. ""Then I tasted my grandmother's paprika cake."" 5. The communists traded it for hard currency . After World War II, paprika production in Hungary was nationalized by the communist government. Local growers were prohibited from milling their own paprika powder and had to hand over all their peppers to state-owned mills. ""The old lady who looked after me when I was a child was sent to prison for four months for being caught selling two kilos of paprika,"" Molnar says. ""Paprika was strategic. Each year several thousand tonnes were exported for Deutschmarks or dollars. ""The communists needed the foreign currency."" 6. Paprika's bursting with vitamin C . The Hungarian scientist Albert Szent-Györgyi won the Nobel Prize in 1937 partly for the discovery of vitamin C. He also found a high vitamin C content in paprika peppers and learned to extract it. Szent-Györgyi sent vitamin C crystals from paprika peppers to parts of the world where people were suffering from scurvy.

"Columbus Junction, Iowa (CNN) -- This rural community in the southeast corner of Iowa is one of the last places you would expect to find a large number of students who don't speak English, yet English language learners have had a huge effect on the schools there, according to Columbus Community Schools Superintendent Rich Bridenstine. Nationally, 9% of students in the U.S. are considered to have limited proficiency in English, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. About 11% of those students attend school in rural settings like Columbus Junction. A quarter of the Columbus Community School students are English language learners, a large enough number to have an impact on the classrooms. Bridenstine sees a difference between a child who can speak general English and one who has the academic English skills required to get through school. ""The English language learners don't have vocabularies big enough to learn at the rate and speed they need to -- that their native English-speaking counterparts do,"" Bridenstine said. Columbus Community Schools is a majority-minority school district that pulls in students from Columbus Junction and four other nearby communities. Bridenstine says 66% of the 895 students are Hispanic and 31% are white. The largest employer in Columbus Junction is a Tyson Fresh Meats pork processing plant, which employs a high number of Hispanics, and more recently some Burmese. The children of those employees attend the schools there. ""Many of our young people come to us academically behind. Their vocabularies are very limited,"" Bridenstine said. ""Their parents often don't have high school educations either."" English language learners put a strain on school systems, according to Elena Silva of Education Sector, a think tank in Washington, D.C. ""Teachers across the board are not trained or well-prepared for this population,"" she said. ""We need a population of teachers that are prepared to teach students who are in the process of developing their language skills."" Rural schools in particular have difficulty with English language learners, according to Silva. ""They simply don't have the resources, training, funding and infrastructure to support English language learners,"" she said. The ELL students also have different cultural experiences, so teachers in Columbus Junction have adapted by teaching more background. ""It's taking what you know about a subject as a teacher and not presupposing that other kids have the same background that you think they should have,"" Bridenstine said. To help with the language skills, the teachers in Columbus Junction are encouraged to have students explain what they have learned to a student partner using English. ""We are making gains, but it isn't enough with what No Child Left Behind is requiring of us,"" Bridenstine said. Under No Child Left Behind, schools are required to reach 100% proficiency in math and English by the year 2014. The immigrants do provide some definite advantages, according to Bridenstine. ""The immediate benefit is financial. Without our Hispanics and coming Burmese, we would be a school district probably around 300 or 400, looking at consolidation,"" he said. Columbus is currently the largest school district in its county. ""We are blessed with a tapestry of diversity and there are a lot of people in the community that treasure that,"" Bridenstine added.","Iowa community has many English language learners in its schools .
Teachers have to add more background to lessons .
Students are behind in schoolwork and have limited vocabulary .

"(CNN)  -- A worldwide network of fraudsters conned thousands of people into buying fake golf clubs on eBay, a London court has heard. Ebay was hit by a massive worldwide fraud in counterfeit golf clubs. In allegedly the largest fraud uncovered by the online auction site, the counterfeit clubs, as well as clothing and other golf accessories, were sold ""on a scale, it is believed, has never been seen before,"" prosecutors told Snaresbrook Crown Court. The mastermind behind the million dollar operation, Greg Bellchambers, from east London, has already admitted fraud and conspiracy. His six co-defendants, who deny playing a ""crucial role"" in the plot, are said to have assisted Bellchambers in managing accounts and acting as distributors in the scam. Bellchambers sourced the ""below-par"" clubs in China and then marketed them on eBay as the original top of the line brands. The fraud only came to light when a disgruntled customer complained to a local trading standards office in London about sub-standard Acushnet clubs and an investigation was launched. When Bellchambers' home was raided, ""a large quantity"" of clubs were seized, with all of them fake apart from those which belonged to the 45-year-old. Adam Davis, for the prosecution, said: ""Nearly every major golf brand has been affected by the sale of counterfeit goods through the eBay accounts. ""It is the belief of the fraud investigation unit at eBay that this case represents the single largest counterfeiting conspiracy yet uncovered on their Web site."" Prosecutors claimed that many other people were involved, but proceedings have not been brought against them as they live abroad or there is insufficient information to identify them. The trial of Bellchambers' six co-defendants is expected to last three months. All deny conspiracy.","Fake eBay golf clubs scam left thousand out of pocket, court is told .

"(CNN) -- John Drury is a 6-foot-7 truck driver with tattoos on his head, neck and arms. Not surprisingly, he's known as ""Big John."" During the week, Drury spends 50 hours behind the wheel. But on weekends, the 43-year-old is a certified dance fitness instructor who breaks it down to Rihanna and Justin Bieber. Living by the T.I. song lyrics permanently tattooed on his head -- ""The old me is dead and gone"" -- Drury has danced away 97 pounds since February 2011. ""The main purpose of that tattoo is exactly what it says,"" he said. ""That 400-pound man was the old me and who I am today is the new me."" Check out this video of Big John's Dance Fitness class . ""Big John"" wasn't always big. Drury grew up on the west side of Cincinnati in a poverty-stricken area where sports, music and dancing kept him out of trouble. ""I grew up in the hood,"" he said. ""I was poor growing up, and that's what we did -- we danced. It was our culture."" Drury participated in break dancing competitions with his high school friends and often attended community dance functions. Some of his favorite places to visit in the '80s were the clubs in downtown Cincinnati. A year after Drury graduated from high school in November 1989, he was at a club showing off his moves on the dance floor. At that moment, his future wife, Lori, spotted him from across the club. ""I saw him dancing, and that's what attracted me to him,"" said Lori Drury, 42. ""I told my friend somewhat jokingly, 'That's the guy I'm going to marry.'"" And in January 1994, that's exactly what happened. But as they settled down and had two kids, Drury picked up more and more shifts at the trucking company, until he found himself working 70 hours a week. With little time to exercise or sit down and eat a proper meal, his motto became ""grab and go."" When he did stop, he ate the fast and greasy food offered at truck stops. ""I was big on sweets and eating doughnuts for breakfast,"" he said. ""Everything about my eating habits was just out of whack."" 9 ways to keep it healthy when eating out . From 'Big John' to 'biggest loser' Prior to becoming a truck driver, Drury weighed 260 pounds. After more than a decade of truck driving, Drury had piled on 140 pounds and his health was deteriorating. Doctors prescribed medications to control his high blood pressure and cholesterol. But the seriousness of his situation didn't hit home until a fellow truck driver, who was taking the same medications as Drury, died from complications of diabetes in late 2010. The truck driver weighed 450 pounds -- only 50 more pounds than Drury at the time. A few months after his friend passed away, Drury heard a commercial for a local radio station that was hosting a ""biggest loser"" competition. He entered the competition and was selected to participate. For three months, Drury had a gym membership, a personal trainer and a nutritionist. He began drinking a lot of water, preparing his meals and walking around the truck stop area. ""I'm a very competitive person,"" Drury said. ""I would just do whatever I had to do to get to the top. I decided there weren't going to be any more excuses."" With his new attitude, Drury not only finished in second place, he also lost 54 pounds. ""For a person who says 'no excuses' now, I used to be the first person to make an excuse,"" he said. ""I used to say, 'I'm too busy with my job.' It's just so empowering to know that regardless of my situation, I made it happen."" Journal helps woman lose half her body weight . Paying it forward . Now it was time to make some of his own dreams a reality. Through the gym membership, Drury discovered Zumba. He realized he could lose weight through his passion for dance. ""When they say, 'Feel the music,' I really feel the music. I get lost in it,"" he said. ""Even though I was the only man in the class, it didn't stop me."" Thinking back on his early days of break dancing, Drury thought he could make the idea of weight loss through dancing relevant to the public. ""I just thought I could help people, because I think people can connect with me and my story,"" he said. After entering yet another room full of women, Drury decided to get certified as a dance fitness instructor. In April 2011, he created his own dance fitness company called Big John's Dance Fitness. Drury helps people dance off their weight through routines set to the songs of Usher, Rihanna, Flo Rida and other pop and hip-hop music he thinks people can recognize and move to. They sometimes even do the ""chicken dance."" He holds hour-long classes every Saturday and Saturday starting at 9 a.m. for a fee of $5 per class. He's had as many as 30 attendees. ""I have people who can't afford it, and I'm never going to turn anyone away,"" he said. ""I have a longing for helping people and paying it forward. I care about the people, not the dollars."" But Drury is having some financial challenges of his own. To accommodate his new lifestyle, Drury now works 50 hours a week rather than 70, and it's sometimes difficult to make ends meet. At the moment, he teaches his classes in his home because he's trying to find an affordable dance studio. ""Ultimately, my dream is to make a dance fitness DVD, because the obese public can relate to me,"" he said. ""In these Zumba videos, there's no big people in those videos. How can the obese people relate to that?"" Open road ahead . Drury's target weight is 260 pounds. He's gained a few pounds back since he first lost the weight and now weighs in at about 315 pounds. ""It's still hard,"" he said. ""I'm not going to sit here and say I'm perfect. ... It's still a battle for me, and everyone knows that."" Drury is now inspiring others by leading through example. Not only does he encourage his wife and sons to dance with him, but he and his wife prepare much healthier meals for the entire family. They have replaced the French fries and fast food with baked chicken and fish. Drury no longer gets greasy meals at the truck stops; instead, he brings his food from home. He allows himself to consume up to 2,000 calories per day. As a result of his new lifestyle, Drury has come out of his shell, his wife said. Believe it or not, he used to be a shy and reserved man. ""He has so much more drive and just ambition for life,"" she said. ""It seems like he wants so much more out of life and he's more confident because he knows he can do it."" Drury's mission is to inspire overweight people to ""just get out there and move."" And despite the laughs and jokes he hears from fellow truck drivers about his passion for dance, Drury isn't hitting the brakes anytime soon. ""I can't think of a male truck driver anywhere out there doing what I'm doing,"" he said. ""I'm breaking all the stereotypes. I'm so passionate about dance fitness. This is my calling in life.""

"(CNN) -- Since a temporary radiologic technologist was accused of stealing drugs from a New Hampshire hospital and giving patients hepatitis C through infected syringes, troubling reports of his past have emerged -- casting a spotlight on the staffing industry as a whole. David Kwiatkowski worked in 13 hospitals in eight states between January 2007 and July 2012, when he was arrested in a Massachusetts hotel room ""in an intoxicated state,"" according to court documents. During that time he was employed by at least two staffing firms: Triage Staffing and SpringBoard Healthcare Staffing. A surge of contract employees have entered the work force since 2009, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Businesses turned to staffing firms to handle their workload until they were more certain of their company's future. More than 25% of all new jobs created were temporary. The health care industry was especially affected by the economic downturn in recent years, said American Staffing Association spokesman Steve Berchem. Patients put off elective procedures amid hospital uncertainty over effects of the Affordable Care Act. ""Many health care professionals were seeking the flexibility that contract work allowed and were leaving hospitals with vacancies,"" Berchem said. ""Hospitals are turning to staffing firms to fill those vacancies to make sure they have the employees and staff and skills they need to ensure quality care."" Approximately 1.7% of the health care industry's work force is now composed of temporary or contract workers, according to ASA data. That's about 240,000 employees, compared to the nearly 14 million full-time health care workers in the United States. Lack of evidence for man accused in hepatitis C case? But those temporary employees play an important role in hospitals, Berchem said. They fill in gaps in almost every field -- from nurses to physicians to med techs and administrators. While the hepatitis C infections have prompted concerns about whether contract workers are providing substandard care, research shows the opposite is generally true. A 2007 study conducted by the Center for Health Outcomes and Policy Research at the University of Pennsylvania showed that temporary nurses are often better educated and more recently trained. Berchem said hospitals that do not use temporary workers tend to have more negative patient outcomes because they have fewer staffing resources overall. Still, the Kwiatkowski case raises questions about the hiring process for both temporary and permanent health care workers. The case is not the first regarding a health care worker accused of harming patients during a career punctuated by troubling incidents. In 2005, a New Jersey law took effect requiring health care professionals or companies to notify the state Division of Consumer Affairs of concerns or misconduct of health care workers who could endanger patients. It was passed after nurse Charles Cullen was accused of killing more than 20 people in the state. Cullen reportedly was hired at a number of hospitals during his career in spite of what officials said was a questionable employment record. Two years ago, Kwiatkowski was fired from Arizona Heart Hospital in Phoenix when a fellow employee found him passed out in the men's bathroom, according to documents obtained by CNN. A few weeks later, he was working at Temple University Hospital in Pennsylvania. The staffing agency that employed Kwiatkowski at the time, SpringBoard, reported the incident to the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists, according to a spokeswoman for the agency. The ARRT said this week that they did not punish Kwiatkowski because they did not have firsthand evidence of the 2010 incident. And the director of the Arizona Radiation Regulatory Agency said officials stopped their investigation when Kwiatkowski moved out of state. Confused? So are investigators, who are still working to sort out all the facts. Scott Schnierer, vice president of business development for Comforce Staffing Services, said that most staffing firms conduct a seven-year background check on potential employees. They will also do on-site drug tests and verify a candidate's credentials. ""We're the legal employer of record,"" Schnierer told HLN last week. ""We insure them, we pay their payroll taxes. So while 'temporary' or 'contract worker' may have a certain reputation or connotation, we take them very seriously. ... We take the full HR responsibility as any direct employer would."" Did registry know man accused in outbreak was earlier fired? If there is a problem with an employee, hospitals are asked to report it to the staffing firm, he said. Either party can take disciplinary action. ""Basically, it really falls down to the department level,"" Schnierer said. ""If they want to put it under the rug, things can happen. But it's up to the department manager to report it to HR. HR should inform the staffing firm -- that's the only way we'll know."" One of the biggest problems, Schnierer and Berchem agree, is that former hiring managers are often unwilling to disclose the reason for a past employee's termination, creating holes in a background check. And it's not just a problem for staffing firms. Kwiatkowski was charged with stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital, where he was hired as a full-time employee. ""Many employers are fearful of litigation and will verify employment dates only,"" Berchem said. ""The system is only as good as the information available."" HLN's Allison Rampley contributed to this report.","David Kwiatkowski worked in 13 hospitals between January 2007 and July 2012 .

"(CNN) -- U.S. inspectors are investigating a possible leak at the Hanford nuclear site after an elevated contamination reading was found in a leak detection pit, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday. The elevated reading, however, doesn't pose an immediate public health threat, Inslee said. ""This is most disturbing news for Washington,"" the governor said in a statement. ""The discovery was made during a routine pumping outside the tank when pumps are also surveyed for radioactivity."" The leak detection pit is located outside and adjacent to a double-shell tank identified as AY-102, the governor said. ""It is not clear yet whether that contamination is coming directly from the outer shell of the AY-102 but it must be treated with the utmost seriousness,"" Inslee said. In February: 6 tanks leaking radioactive waste at Washington nuclear site . The U.S. Department of Energy has assigned engineers to analyze the source of contamination through sampling and video inspection, a process that could take several days, the governor said. The Hanford site, which once produced plutonium for atomic weapons, borders the Columbia River. ""Given the relatively early detection of this potential leak, the river is not at immediate risk of contamination should it be determined that a leak has occurred outside the tank,"" Inslee said. Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz just paid his first visit to the Hanford site on Wednesday. Even before learning of a possible leak, Inslee told Moniz he has ""serious concerns regarding the pace of addressing the leaking tanks,"" Inslee said. ""We will be insisting on an acceleration of remediation of all the tanks, not just AY-102. USDOE has a legal obligation to clean up Hanford and remove or treat that waste, and we ensure that legal obligation is fulfilled,"" the governor said.","An elevated contamination reading is found in a Hanford leak detection pit .

"Berlin (CNN) -- A German lawmaker who met Edward Snowden in Moscow on Thursday said Friday that the National Security Agency leaker offered to testify in front of the U.S. Congress. ""He didn't present himself as an enemy of America, quite the opposite,"" German member of parliament Hans-Christian Stroebele told reporters in Berlin Friday. Stroebele said he had suggested Snowden testify before German lawmakers and that the former NSA contractor responded that in fact he wants to testify in Washington. Snowden said he might go to Germany, if he gets assurances that he could stay in a safe place afterward without being deported to the United States, said Stroebele, a well-known leftist legislator in Germany. However, Snowden's attorney, Anatoly Kucherena, told reporters in Moscow that his client would not be leaving Russia to testify on the U.S. spying allegations. Kucherena said he would advise Snowden not to testify at all if it is not in his client's best interest. Snowden has been in Moscow since June, having fled there from Hong Kong. In August, after he spent five weeks holed up at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, Russia granted him asylum for one year. Snowden: 'Heartened by the response' Stroebele returned from the meeting with Snowden on Thursday with a letter from the NSA leaker to German authorities, which was distributed to the media. In the letter, Snowden says he is ""looking forward to speaking"" with German authorities in Germany ""when the situation is resolved"" -- a reference to the current efforts by the United States to extradite him. Snowden also wrote that he was ""heartened by the response to my act of political expression, in both the United States and beyond. ""Citizens around the world as well as high officials -- including in the United States -- have judged the revelation of an unaccountable system of pervasive surveillance to be a public service."" The benefits of this knowledge to society are becoming increasingly clear, and the ""claimed risks are being shown to have been mitigated,"" he added. Stroebele said he didn't know if Snowden had sent a similar letter to other governments in Latin America or elsewhere. The United States has charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government property. The 30-year-old collected information on spy programs -- in which the National Security Agency mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media, prompting uproar at home and abroad. German outrage . Snowden's letter to German authorities comes amid outrage among many German leaders about claims that an NSA surveillance operation targeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Snowden ""is an important witness for Germany,"" said Stroebele. But asked if Snowden could testify to German authorities via video link from Moscow, Stroebele said that could be problematic for several reasons. He suggested Snowden would be more limited in what he could say if he were in Moscow than if he were in Germany. So long as Snowden has asylum in Russia, he needs to avoid doing anything that would negatively affect his status there, the lawmaker said. In his closing remarks, Stroebele said that although the United States believes that Snowden has committed a serious offense, he believes he should not be penalized because his revelations have benefited the world. Stroebele also said Snowden, who was due to start a new job in Russia on Friday, appeared to be in good health. Kucherena told CNN on Thursday that the job was with a major Russian website but declined to give the employer's name for security reasons. He told Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti that Snowden would perform maintenance for the site. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Berlin and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Alla Eshchenko, Diana Magnay and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","NEW: Edward Snowden won't leave Russia to testify on U.S. spying claims, attorney says .

"London (CNN) -- Kate Middleton's name is on a ""target evaluation"" list prosecutors say was written by a private investigator who is one of the accused in Britain's phone hacking trial. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) released a scanned copy of the handwritten document, which it said was referred to as evidence during the trial at London's Old Bailey court Tuesday. Former editors at the now-defunct UK tabloid News of the World, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" Former employees Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup are accused with them. Specifically, the charge asserts that they listened to ""voice mail messages of well-known people."" The list, which the CPS said came from private investigator Glenn Mulcaire's notes, is headed ""target evaluation."" The 18 names include Kate Middleton -- now Duchess of Cambridge -- royal aide Jamie Lowther Pinkteron, celebrity public relations representative Max Clifford, and actress Angelina Jolie's former stunt double, Eunice Huthart. Six of the names on the list are redacted. The CPS said this was due to privacy issues. ""Given the specific nature of this case, we must also consider the potential for repeat victimization of not only those involved in this case, but other possible victims, who may have also been the targets of phone-hacking,"" it said. As well as being accused of conspiring to intercept communications, Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire face an additional charge of intercepting the voice mail messages of British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing and was later found dead in 2002. Brooks, her husband, Charlie Brooks, and a former personal assistant also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking. They were charged in May 2012, along with Brooks' former driver, a security guard and members of security staff from News International -- the then parent company of News of the World -- with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The hacking scandal prompted British Prime Minister David Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians.

"London (CNN) -- Several hundred attempts were made to hack the cellphones of aides to princes Charles, William and Harry, the trial of two of Rupert Murdoch's former senior executives has heard. A News International ""private wire"" -- which routed desk-based landlines through a mobile phone number -- was used 296 times by News International private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in an attempt to access phone messages of Mark Dyer, the heir to the UK throne's private secretary, Detective Constable Richard Fitzgerald told the Old Bailey court on Thursday. And between October 2005 and August 2006 there were 416 attempts to hack the voicemail of Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, private secretary to princes William and Harry. The claims were made in the trial of former News Of The World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, who are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 ""to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority."" They deny the charges. Other former employees of the tabloid, which closed down in 2011, Stuart Kuttner, Greg Miskiw, Ian Edmondson, Neville Thurlbeck and James Weatherup, are accused with them. Thurlbeck, Weatherup and Miskiw have pleaded guilty. Mulcaire was convicted of phone hacking in 2006, and has already pleaded guilty to hacking charges in the current case. Earlier jurors were shown whiteboards taken from Mulcaire's office and home that featured telephone numbers, mobile phone networks' passwords and names, such as tennis player Venus Williams and Rebekah Wade, Brooks' maiden name. The boards contained messages to avoid certain members of staff who worked for mobile phone networks. At the start of the trial jurors were played a tape of Mulcaire obtaining PIN numbers from mobile phone providers by pretending to be someone else such as an engineer, a practice known as ""blagging."" Giving evidence in the trial, Fitzgerald said voicemail messages could be intercepted easily in the early part of last decade. Asked by the prosecution if this was due to a security failure of mobile phone network providers, Fitzgerald said: ""I'd agree they were clearly not sufficient."" Hacking guide . Earlier in the day Fitzgerald gave jurors an insight into how to hack a mobile phone. The first way was to dial the cellphone number of the target; if it was engaged or turned off then the phone would go to voicemail. You could interrupt a greeting, Fitzgerald said, by pressing the *, # or 9 keys and listen to messages by entering a default PIN code, such as 3333 or 1010 depending on which UK phone network the hacking target was on as many users rarely changed these. If the hacker called the same number with two phones, the first call would make the line ""engaged"" putting the second call straight to voicemail. The first phone could even be set to terminate the call before the target was aware that they had been called. An alternative was to dial a number that directly accessed a person's voicemail, Fitzgerald said. The hacker could then access messages by entering a code; again these were often not changed from the cellphone's original default setting. As well as being accused of conspiring to intercept communications, Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner, Miskiw, Thurlbeck and Mulcaire face an additional charge of intercepting the voice mail messages of British schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002. Brooks, her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter also face a separate set of charges of conspiring to obstruct the police investigation into phone hacking. They were charged in May 2012, along with Brooks' former driver, a security guard and members of security staff from News International -- the then parent company of News of the World -- with attempting to pervert the course of justice. The hacking scandal prompted British Prime Minister David Cameron to set up an independent inquiry, led by Lord Justice Leveson, to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians.

"GREELEY, Colorado (CNN) -- Tim Masters often drank heavily before he was imprisoned for murder in 1999, but he said he's sworn off the stuff in an interview Wednesday, his first full day of freedom in nearly a decade. On his first full day of freedom, Tim Masters shows attorney Maria Liu a Hot Rod magazine. ""Just because I don't look angry doesn't mean I don't have a whole lot of anger inside,"" Masters said. ""I don't want to get drunk. People get drunk, they have no self control. I don't want to get mad or do anything stupid or say something stupid. I'd rather just stay sober."" The anger he fears unleashing is aimed squarely at the Fort Collins Police Department, which doggedly pursued him for almost 12 years before charging him with the 1987 murder of Peggy Hettrick -- a crime he has always insisted he didn't commit. Masters, 36, was released Tuesday from prison after new DNA evidence pointed to someone else. He will find out next month if he will stand trial again, but a prosecutor said Monday that charges against Masters could be dismissed.  Watch Masters talk about his freedom » . Speaking with CNN about 24 hours after his release, Masters said he is relieved to be out of prison, but he can't shake the feeling this saga might not be over. He also can't shake his anger at one investigator in particular. ""My opinion is that Jim Broderick, the guy in charge of it, has a very big ego and would not allow anything or anyone to convince him that he was wrong,"" Masters said. ""He made up his mind in the beginning, from day one when he walked into my bedroom and saw my horror drawings and war stories, that I was guilty. Nothing would change his mind."" Broderick did not return a call Wednesday to his office. His answering machine said he would not be checking messages until the end of the month. Michael Goodbee, one of the special prosecutors handling the Masters hearings, said in court that Broderick was out of town on a family emergency. Broderick told CNN in November, before the DNA evidence was confirmed, that he still believed Masters was the killer. The key players » . Masters was convicted largely on circumstantial evidence -- a collection of gory sketches and narratives, a few knives and a forensic psychologist's testimony that Masters' stories and artwork indicated he fantasized about sexual homicides. He was also the first person to find Hettrick's body. He didn't immediately report it, he said, because he thought it was a mannequin and someone was playing a prank. ""It's just unbelievable because here's all these stories and drawings that have no nexus with the crime. There's no one being stabbed in the back. There's no one being sexually mutilated,"" he said. ""The only thing they had in common with this crime is there was violence."" Lots of kids in high school sketch violent scenes and scribe violent stories, Masters said. Go to any high school, he said, and you'll likely find similar artwork and writings. ""They won their case by assassinating my character,"" he said. Masters said he's been angry for years. Though his father Clyde, who died while Masters was in prison, taught him to never show his emotions, his fellow inmates were aware of his bitterness, he said. ""My best friend who sat across from me at the chow hall, he used to actually sit there and say, 'Damn, I've got to look across at this surly face every day? Look at your face. You look mad all the time.' "" His frustration began to wane when the media started reporting on his case about six months ago. The letters he received in prison and support from fellow inmates helped, he said, but the anger is ""still going to be there. There's no way to get around that. It's still inside."" Masters said he can't thank his family enough for standing by him. And though he spoke with reverence of his father, there was an undertone of resentment in his words. It was his father, he said, who initially told him to cooperate with police, a decision that ultimately would be his undoing. His father allowed police to search their trailer. He also allowed Masters to be interrogated for hours without an attorney. Police would use the evidence and interrogation to convict Masters in 1999. ""We'll cooperate with them and give them anything they want and then they'll see that you didn't have anything to do with this and they'll move on,"" Masters recalled his father telling him in 1987. ""It turns out that by cooperating with them it just encouraged them, because I was the easiest suspect to go after."" Clyde Masters knew his son hadn't committed the crime, but he thought police were there to help, Masters said. His father was in the Navy for 22 years and felt you should obey authority, he added. ""Well, you know what? You shouldn't always submit to authority. Our country wouldn't exist if everyone submitted to authority,"" he said. ""It's just a shame Dad didn't know how the system was."" In a news conference after his release, Masters said he wanted only to see his family. He was whisked away from the courthouse to the local Elks Lodge, which his aunts and uncles had rented. At the party, he met some of his younger relatives for the first time. ""Everybody didn't get to come up there and visit me over the years, and the cousins, the younger ones, have had kids of their own and I don't know any of them, so I'm trying to learn everyone's name and not succeeding,"" Masters said. His first meal was two pieces of grocery store fried chicken -- which he ate simultaneously -- and a glass of lemonade. The chicken was ""fantastic,"" he said. ""I didn't even eat anything else with it. I just had two pieces of chicken there and people are shaking my hand and leaving like, 'Ugh, I got grease on my hand,' "" he said with a chuckle. ""Sorry."" During visits with family members, he learned how much the world had changed since he was locked up. Everyone had high-tech cell phones with cameras. His cousins and nephews were showing him YouTube and their MySpace pages. Despite the changes all around him, the changes within him seem negligible, he said. ""I don't feel a whole lot different other than a lot of emotional baggage,"" he said. ""Other people would be able to tell you better than I would how much I've changed."" His freedom still seems like a dream at times, he said. As for trying to recover the years he feels were wrongly taken from him -- the years in high school and in the Navy when he was pegged as a murderer or the decade he spent in a prison cell -- he understands they're gone forever. ""You can't get any time back,"" he said, quipping, ""My youth and my hair, gone."" Though there are strong indications that Masters could be fully exonerated in February, he is not getting his hopes too high -- not after the events of the past two decades. ""For me, it's not over until it's over. They haven't dismissed any charges. I'm out on bond, so I'm not completely free yet,"" he said. Masters said he and his legal team are prepared in the event of a new trial. ""Whatever happens, happens. We're ready.""

"(CNN) -- The scene: Muirfield's short-game practice area last July. It's Open Championship week and a boy who looks about 14 is playing from the bunker next to Rory McIlroy and Luke Donald. Only his girlfriend is watching him: all cameras are focused on the two British stars. Two children are stopping every player leaving the practice ground, asking for autographs. When it's his turn, the young man pauses, smiles and signs. They thank him. He's just started to walk away when one of the children calls after him: ""Excuse me, Mr. ..."" -- the player stops and turns -- ""...but who are you?"" With a slightly shy smile he replies simply, ""Matt Fitzpatrick."" The children are not alone. When Fitzpatrick practices on the Muirfield range, an official mistakes him for Tiger Woods' ball-boy. That most certainly won't be happening at Augusta National this week. For Fitzpatrick -- who still looks much younger than his 19 years -- has made a big impression since those days of mistaken identity. Not that he's changed his modest, courteous demeanor. Rather, his achievements and actions on and off the course have spoken loudly enough of a rich talent and a steely-quiet determination. First, the young British Open qualifier from Sheffield went on to make the cut at Muirfield, then to win the Silver Medal for best amateur. The following month he traveled to Boston and became the first Englishman in 102 years to claim the U.S. Amateur trophy. Then he caused just as big a stir by leaving a top U.S. college golf scholarship after just one term. Northwestern and its coach Pat Goss had guided former world No. 1 Luke Donald, but Fitzpatrick decided the Illinois university wasn't for him and didn't return from his Christmas holiday back home in Sheffield. ""The last couple of weeks of university I had a lot of time to think,"" he told CNN's Living Golf at his Hallamshire golf club in Sheffield. ""Just studying in my room and I wasn't doing much else. ""I wanted to take my golf as far as I could and I felt like it was hard to keep it progressing. I was almost doing more school work than golf."" His change of heart lies partly in that clear focus, partly in the chronology. He'd signed his letter of intent with Northwestern after he'd won the British Boys' Championship in 2012. Back then, he could only dream of qualifying for the Open, winning the Silver Medal and beating the world's best to claim the U.S. Amateur. But it happened, life changed and plans had to be rethought. The crucial point was that his U.S. Amateur victory had opened many doors. Invitations to three of the four majors this year, including The Masters. Starts on the PGA Tour. A place at the Scottish Open. He could start to put together a schedule that would be the envy of many young pros. He's also had overtures from top agents, including Tiger's. They know a winner when they see one. For beyond the raw talent, when you talk to Fitzpatrick's parents and others who've seen him win at every level from Hallamshire Club Championship upwards, they all speak of two or three other qualities critical for a career in golf. His dedication. His response to pressure: lifting his game when others might crumble. And his ability to think himself round a course. He puts the latter down to his dad, Russell. ""I would always remember lectures coming back from tournaments and he would say, 'Why did you hit that club there, there was no need.' And I'd look back and think, 'Well, he's right.' "" Despite the discussions with agents and top players, Fitzpatrick doesn't yet know when he'll turn professional. In part it's so he can take up his invites to the Masters, U.S. Open and his home Open. And in part because, as he says, ""I don't know if I'm ready yet ... I think I have a lot of room for improvement. But if you have a top-10 at the U.S. Open or the British Open you sort of have to re-evaluate I guess."" His immediate goal? ""I would like to be the lowest amateur for all three majors."" And so to the first of these this week at Augusta National. Fitzpatrick will be sleeping in the Crow's Nest, the traditional lodging place in the Augusta clubhouse reserved for invited amateurs. He's already played a few practice rounds and can't wait to get started. It's a course that demands patience, strategy and a great short-game.

"(CNN) -- In 1995, Kerry Washington had just launched her career. The actress, then 18, had one professional credit to her name -- a role in an ABC after-school special, according to Internet Movie Database. Oh what a difference a few years can make. Now Washington is the star of the hit ABC series ""Scandal,"" and she's nominated for outstanding lead actress in a drama at Sunday's Primetime Emmy Awards. The last time an African-American woman was up for such an honor was when she was starting out. (Cicely Tyson was nominated for her work in ""Sweet Justice"" in 1995.) Washington already has made history as the first black actress to lead a network TV drama in almost 40 years. Jada Pinkett Smith was the lead actress of a cable drama, TNT's ""HawthoRNe,"" which was canceled in 2011. Record accomplishments aside, it is undeniable Washington is having a moment. Not only has she seemingly been on the cover of every magazine lately, but the actress also managed to pull off a Hollywood coup by getting married without the world even knowing she was dating. ""I don't want to sound smug about it ... but the point is to do what's best for me,"" Washington recently told Glamour magazine of secretly marrying San Francisco 49ers cornerback Nnamdi Asomugha. ""I have girlfriends in this business who talk about their personal lives, and it works for them, and I love it. But not for me."" For most, the first time Washington grabbed attention was as struggling teen mom Chenille Reynolds in the 2001 film ""Save the Last Dance."" She followed that with roles in movies both big and small -- from ""Bad Company"" with Chris Rock and Anthony Hopkins to the indie ""Night Catches Us."" Despite positive reviews and glowing praise from her contemporaries, Washington had a career that was slow and steady at best. She finally began to break out when critics hailed her portrayal of Ray Charles' wife, Della Bea Robinson, opposite Jamie Foxx in the 2004 Oscar-nominated film ""Ray."" The pair teamed up again in 2012 for Quentin Tarantino's ""Django Unchained."" But it is her role on the small screen as political power fixer Olivia Pope on ""Scandal"" that has brought Washington the most recognition -- from the Emmy nomination to People Magazine's best dressed star of 2013. According to ""Scandal"" creator Shonda Rhimes, all the accolades couldn't be happening to a more well-deserving actress. Kerry Washington talks Olivia Pope, slavery and politics . ""She knows every single person's name (on the show),"" Rhimes recently told Vanity Fair. ""She gave out the prizes in our little weight-loss competition that we had on set. And, more importantly -- and this is a thing I am really trying to learn from her -- I have never heard Kerry Washington complain. That sounds like a casual thing to toss off, but think about the fact that she works more hours than anybody. I literally never hear her complain. That is a very rare breed of person."" It is also rare how Washington is able to keep her personal life private while still appearing accessible to fans. ""Scandal's"" success -- and consequently her own -- has partly been attributed to the series' active social media presence. Cast members live tweet during every episode, and Washington is especially engaged with fans -- retweeting them and answering their questions. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the social media strategy paid off last season in the form of higher ratings and increased buzz. For Washington, it translated into the chance to compete with Claire Danes of ""Homeland"" and Robin Wright of ""House of Cards"" for television's most prestigious honor. Washington has said she fully embraces the recognition, but for her, it has always been about the craft. ""I don't approach the work or the life of the work from the perspective of, like, what are voters gonna think,"" Washington told Entertainment Weekly after she was nominated. ""Or, what are critics gonna think? I just can't. Once you try to please a specific perspective or audience, it gets in the way of the work. The work is telling the story, and that's what you have to do: Tell the story in the best way possible to serve the creative vision and to serve the story. You can never control how it's going to be received."" Fans are looking forward to see what will happen Sunday, but to them, Washington's already a winner.","Actress is the first black woman to be nominated in her Emmy category since 1995 .

"(CNN) -- Today is a landmark anniversary for Tim Berners-Lee. In March 1989 he wrote a proposal to his employers at CERN for a somewhat abstract ""global hypertext"" system he called Mesh. A year later he re-named that system the World Wide Web. It caught on. A quarter of a century later, Berners-Lee is like a proud father, seeing his baby all grown up and making its way in the world without him. ""I feel a certain amount of inventor's pride,"" he tells CNN. ""My greatest pride has been the spirit of collaboration we've had for the last 25 years."" He's watched the Web grow through a carefree childhood and turbulent adolescence, reaching the kind of age when things suddenly get more serious, and it's time to make some important decisions about the future. ""At 25 it's more like a young adult,"" he explains. ""Suddenly it needs its independence; young adults are at the stage when they're looking for freedom, and in terms of what they do they're asserting their rights. ""Now, 25 years on, Web users are realizing they need human rights on the Web ... We need independence of the Web for democracy, we need independence of the Web to be able to support the press, we need independence of the Web in general. It's becoming very important to sort out all that."" Recent years have been marked by growing pains. Revelations of mass surveillance by the NSA and other agencies have caused international outrage. Arguments over net neutrality persist and copyright wars pitching open-net activists against mainstream creative industries have grown bitter, with Berners-Lee himself criticized at times. The stock and use of illicit material has grown with the dark net. Berners-Lee is clear that our ability to speak and associate freely is under threat. The widespread data gathering of the NSA revealed a ""broken"" system, he believes, and he praises whistle blowers like Edward Snowden whose leaks expose the excesses. ""When (systems) break the whistle blower is the person who saves society by pointing out something that nobody else will, because it's illegal,"" he says. ""One thing I'd like to see built in the future is an international convention and international respect for whistle blowers."" If spying is one threat, Berners Lee believes censorship is another. He recalls the situation in Egypt, where the Internet was cut off at the height of anti-government protests in January 2011. ""For a lot of people that was the first time they realized you could turn it off, and they asked themselves, who could turn it off for me?"" he says, adding that ""turning off the Internet is more or less a signal that the regime does not trust its citizens and that the regime is on the way out."" At 58, Berners-Lee is not taking a back seat. Having invented the Web once, he hopes to re-invent it through the ""Web We Want"" initiative, aiming to create a universal ""Internet Users Bill of Rights."" Key targets of the manifesto include spreading net access to the nearly two thirds of the world that still doesn't have it. Establishing clear regulations is also a priority, as is the protection of personal user information. Berners-Lee still enjoys enough power over his creation to make big changes realistic, through two authorities he founded and continues to lead. The World Wide Web Consortium (WC3) determines standards for all Web infrastructure, backed by the world's leading academic institutions and software developers. The Web Foundation manages the spread and ethical application of the Web, bringing pressure to bear on governments through initiatives such as The Web Index, which ranks nations by Internet access standards. The Web We Want campaign will rely on mass mobilization across industries, nations and activist bodies to succeed, but Berners-Lee is confident of fostering a spirit of cooperation. He has seen it before and considers it the Web's greatest accomplishment. ""It's really a story of collaboration, people working painstakingly on getting protocols right ... There's an international spirit that ignores boundaries,"" he says. As for what the Web will look like over the next 25 years, as it enters its middle age, Berners Lee sees a smarter Web emerging, with users empowered by the huge amounts of personal information collected as part of the ""Web of data"" -- information that could help personalize our Web experience. ""People are worrying about what other people are doing with their data,"" he says, ""but they haven't realized what they can do with their own data."" As we grow more connected to, and reliant on, the Web, so the potential for abuse increases. How we use such a powerful tool amounts to a test of our species, says Berners-Lee, but it's one he is confident we can pass together. ""In general the Web enables humanity to be more powerful and that power can be used for good things and to do horrible things -- but on balance when it comes to humanity I'm a tremendous optimist."" In pictures: What the Internet really looks like .","Tim Berners-Lee wrote the original proposal for the World Wide Web in March 1989 .

"(CNN) -- Formula One is taking another step in its techno evolution this year, with major rule changes meaning that the season could be more unpredictable than it has been for a long time. Sebastian Vettel's hopes of a fifth consecutive world drivers' title appear very much in the balance, with his previously all-conquering Red Bull team struggling for reliability during preseason testing. However, the sign of a true champion is the ability to cope with change and innovate accordingly -- something the Austrian marque has done better than any other in recent seasons. Indeed, the 64 years of F1 history have been marked by moments of design genius which have changed the elite motorsport, at least until the next maverick idea came along.

"(CNN) -- Don't pack away those winter coats and hats yet! We're in for another blast of cold Arctic air, which is gearing up to roll across most of the country this week, but it won't be as bad as the shocking freeze in January. The National Weather Service says some places from the central U.S. to the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys could be having some frosty high temperatures, as low 20 to 30 degrees below normal. If you call it Polar Vortex Part II (or III or IV), meteorologists say you'd be wrong -- nor was the first big cold spell of 2014, strictly speaking, a strike of the Polar Vortex. The Polar Vortex stays anchored over Baffin Bay, to the north of Canada, and doesn't move, says CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. But its shifting pattern allows cold Arctic air to spill southward into the United States. ""When it weakens, this allows the cold Arctic air that is often mislabeled the ""Polar Vortex"" to spill southward across the U.S. border and bring us bone-chilling temperatures,"" Morris explained. So from a technical perspective, ""if you're looking to get 'struck' by the vortex, you're out of luck,"" he added. Although this cold snap doesn't have as menacing a name, the Arctic air blast will cause temperatures to plummet 25 to 35 degrees below average east of the Rocky Mountains, Morris said. Temperatures will drop Tuesday to 10 to 30 degrees below normal for this time of year in places such as Minnesota and the Dakotas. Then the arctic blast will roll east. By the middle of the week, the freeze zone will sweep the Midwest and the East Coast, plunging lows into the single digits in Indiana and Massachusetts, among other states. It will cover two thirds of the country; even parts of the Deep South will drop down below freezing -- but just for a night or two, the National Weather Service said. There will probably be some snow here and there, but the good news is that things should stay pretty dry, the weather service said. Many of us will shiver. That's about it. It won't be like that original ""Polar Vortex"" -- which again, was a misnomer -- which debuted in early January. In case you forgot: The country experienced record low temperatures and freezing pipes all the way down to Alabama when a large frigid air mass broke free from the Arctic and came down to visit. Students, say goodbye to snow days . Meanwhile, along the Gulf Coast, a warm front will increase shower and thunderstorm activity in that region and the Southeastern states Tuesday and into Wednesday. ""By Wednesday afternoon, the front begins to push offshore again and heavier precipitation should begin to diminish. However, a developing surface wave along this front could clip the Mid-Atlantic with some light snows on Wednesday before it moves farther out to sea,"" the National Weather Service said. For those of you in the West, you will probably not experience precipitation Tuesday except for possible light snow showers in the higher terrain of the Northern Rockies. Wednesday, precipitation will move inland through California. Back in the cold East, well, maybe Punxsutawney Phil saw this coming.","NEW: Temperatures to drop 20 to 30 degrees below normal in some places .

It has the same origins, but it's much shorter-lived .

"(CNN) -- Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton summed up the dawn of a new Formula One era in three juicy words -- weird, mind-blowing and challenging. After 12 days of intense and drama-filled preseason testing, the elite motor racing series is promising more of the same when the 2014 campaign opens with Sunday's Australian Grand Prix. CNN World Sport looks back at the lessons learned in testing -- and forward to what lies ahead as F1 embraces one of the biggest rule changes in the history of the sport. Engine anxiety . The introduction of new engine technology in 2014 was never going to be easy and so it proved in preseason testing as all three engine suppliers -- Renault, Mercedes and Ferrari -- had teething problems with their power units. Turbo power is back in the form of 1.6-liter V6 engines that are allied with two Energy Recovery Systems, which have proved particularly temperamental during testing. Renault, which supplies engines to Red Bull, Lotus, Toro Rosso and Caterham, is in the biggest trouble ahead of the Melbourne opener. Its engine covered the least distance over the three preseason tests, ticking off 5,432 miles compared to 11,181 miles for Mercedes and the 6,346 miles covered by Ferrari, which powers just three teams. ""Some preparations are incomplete,"" conceded Rob White, who heads up the French company's engine program. ""Melbourne will be an anxious weekend."" Just to make things even harder, a new green initiative means the cars must get to the end of the race with 100 kilos of fuel in the tank. The drivers will have to manage their car's fuel consumption, and that's a race craft some may have to learn. Ugly cars . Some critics are calling 2014's chunky cars the ugliest in the history of the sport, with the droopy ""anteater nose"" seen on the Force India and Caterham cars ranked as a particular design horror. Aesthetics aside, new rules on aerodynamic design have had teams puzzling about how to recover downforce -- which delivers speed and grip -- in different places. For example, last season many teams, and especially four-time champion Red Bull, eked out extra speed by using the exhaust gases to increase downforce at the rear of the car. Those days are now over as the 2014 rule change means there is just a single exhaust exit from the side of the car -- and the good news for F1 fans is you will never hear the phrase ""exhaust-blown diffuser"" again. Unreliable Red Bull . Red Bull's Achilles heel -- a lack of reliability -- sneaked back into the garage to haunt the Austrian marque during preseason testing. On the penultimate day of the final Bahrain test, the problems with the car were so bad that four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel wasn't able to complete a single lap. ""Reliability is still a big question mark,"" said the German, who set the 18th fastest time on the final day in Bahrain. ""I'm not calling us favorites -- for that we haven't done enough laps and the speed is not there compared to some other teams."" But it is still too early to write off Red Bull. The last time the rules were changed in 2009, the team was initially dogged by reliability issues -- but recovered to finish that year with the fastest car before going on to win the next four world titles. Hamilton has given the Red Bull his vote of confidence, calling Adrian Newey's 2014 design ""stunning."" He also told reporters in Bahrain: ""Once they get the engine sorted ... as always, they'll be very hard to beat."" Quick silver . Could Hamilton be the title favorite for the 2014 world championship? The early signs are looking good for the 2008 winner. The new Mercedes has shown it has both speed and endurance, completing the most laps over the three winter tests and consistently finishing at the top of the timesheets. But there have been reliability glitches, and Hamilton will want to forget his crash on day one of testing in Spain. ""The goal is to win the championship, and this year I'm more pumped than ever,"" said Hamilton, who is also rumored to have rekindled his romance with singer Nicole Scherzinger over the winter break. But Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, who won two races in 2013, is taking a more cautious approach. ""I certainly don't see us as the top team,"" the German said. ""It may seem from the outside that we are in a slightly better position than our rivals but we won't know for sure until we get to Melbourne."" Best of the rest . Williams is within a whisker of a return to its glory days after a very encouraging winter. The nine-time constructors' champion set the fastest time at the final test thanks to Ferrari recruit Felipe Massa and also ran its car over several race distances. The team's Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas summed up the team's excitement, saying on Twitter: ""Think we are well prepared and made the most out of testing. Can't wait for Melbourne to go racing!"" The big guns at Ferrari and McLaren have had a relatively low-key buildup. Both teams have gone the distance but are yet to show they also have the pace. Fernando Alonso, who is paired with Kimi Raikkonen in Ferrari's intriguing lineup of world champions, was amusingly mysterious about the Italian team's chances. ""I can't say if we will be at the front or behind someone else but we will definitely be up there at the top among the best,"" the Spaniard said. There are no such guarantees for Lotus. The team skipped the first test in Spain and then saw drivers Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado set the slowest times of all 22 cars at Bahrain's final warmup. ""There will be some long days and nights before the first race,"" warned Lotus head of trackside operations Alan Permane. New faces, old friends . There are three rookie drivers joining the F1 merry-go-round in 2014. Denmark's Kevin Magnussen, the 21-year-old son of former F1 driver Jan Magnussen, makes his debut with McLaren, Swede Marcus Ericsson, 23, lines up for Caterham and Russian teen Daniil Kvyat, who has looked pretty handy so far, makes his bow with Toro Rosso. He may not be a rookie, but Australian Daniel Ricciardo will come under increased scrutiny in 2014 as he steps up from Toro Rosso to replace Mark Webber as Vettel's teammate at Red Bull. Fans of daredevil Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi will be pleased to see him back in the fold with Caterham. The F1 community is continuing to support its most successful driver, Michael Schumacher. The seven-time world champion remains in hospital more than two months after he sustained a serious head injury in a skiing accident. Organizers of the Bahrain Grand Prix recently announced they had renamed a corner of the Sakhir Circuit in honor of Schumacher. The Austrian Grand Prix returns to the calendar in June, with a new Russian race due in October on the site of the Olympic and Paralympic Park in Sochi. Changes at the top . The new season also brings some changes on the pit wall as McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh and Mercedes boss Ross Brawn were both victims of restructuring. Former Lotus team principal Eric Boullier arrived at McLaren as racing director, following the return to power of CEO Ron Dennis, but there is still a senior position available at the eight-time constructors' champion amid rumors that Brawn could ultimately fill the gap. Former McLaren technical chief Paddy Lowe now shares leadership responsibilities at Mercedes with Toto Wolff. The sport's chief executive Bernie Ecclestone is also considering his future as he prepares to go on trial in Germany on charges of bribery. Double or nothing . Despite criticism from teams and drivers, Ecclestone's plan to award double points at the final race in Abu Dhabi comes into force in 2014. The driver who takes the checkered flag on November 23 will win 50 points instead of 25. As well as double points, there is double jeopardy for the racers who, just like regular road users, will be slapped with penalty points on their Super License for bad driving -- 12 or more points and they will receive a one-race ban. The looming season will also see drivers use race numbers they have chosen for the rest of their F1 careers, with No. 1 reserved for Vettel as the defending champion. Into the unknown . There are new drivers, new rules and temperamental new engines to get used to in the looming F1 season. But, as the saying goes, the more things change the more they stay the same. After three winter tests, Red Bull is on the back foot; Mercedes and Williams may be favorites, but just who will win in Australia remains, as always, a race into the unknown.","F1 is entering a new era, with the opening race of the new season in Melbourne .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The fragile relationship between China and Japan came under fresh strain Tuesday as ships from both sides crowded into the waters around a disputed group of islands and nearly 170 Japanese lawmakers visited a controversial war memorial. The Japanese Coast Guard said eight Chinese government ships had entered waters near the contested islands in the East China Sea on Tuesday morning, the largest number to do so at any one time since tensions surrounding the territorial dispute escalated last year. China said its ships were there to monitor the movements of Japanese vessels in the area after a Japanese nationalist group chartered a flotilla of fishing boats to take dozens of activists there. The Japanese foreign ministry responded by summoning the Chinese ambassador in Tokyo to lodge a strong protest about the Chinese ships' presence near the uninhabited islands that lie between Okinawa and Taiwan and are known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. The Chinese ambassador, Cheng Yonghua, retorted that it was the Japanese vessels that were intruding in Chinese territory. Will radar-rattling turn to conflict? A day earlier, Beijing had protested to Tokyo about a visit at the weekend by three Japanese cabinet ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japanese people killed while fighting for their country, including convicted war criminals. Countries that suffered heavily at the hands of the Japanese military before and during World War II, such as China and South Korea, consider the shrine as an emblem of that aggressive period in Japanese history. But China's representations failed to deter 168 Japanese members of parliament from visiting the shrine on Tuesday to pay their respects to the war dead, the most to do so in recent years. How a remote rock split China and Japan . New men in charge . New leaders have taken office in both countries in the past few months: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in Japan and President Xi Jinping in China. They inherited a highly delicate situation concerning the disputed islands that analysts have warned could spiral out of control -- a concern for the United States, which has a mutual security treaty with Japan. ""Despite expressions by both governments that they wish to avoid a war, potential for escalation has increased and there is deepening pessimism on both sides over the prospects of a peaceful settlement,"" the International Crisis Group said in a report this month on the tensions between Japan and China. ""Tokyo and Beijing urgently need to work toward establishing communication mechanisms and strengthening crisis mitigation in order to avoid a larger conflict,"" the report said. In an indication of the strong stances both sides are taking on the matter, Abe said Tuesday in parliament that any attempt to land on the islands by China would be repelled ""by force."" Games of cat and mouse . The relationship between the two nations deteriorated severely in September, when the Japanese government bought several of the islands from a private owner, angering Chinese authorities and provoking a spate of sometimes violent anti-Japanese demonstrations in many Chinese cities. Since then, the situation has calmed somewhat, but Chinese government ships have continued to frequently sail near the islands, engaging in maritime games of cat and mouse with Japanese Coast Guard vessels. Chinese planes have also flown through the area, prompting Japan to scramble fighter jets. Both countries claim sovereignty over the remote, rocky islands, which are near important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible mineral deposits. Japan currently administers the area, but since September, China has mounted a concerted campaign to try to change the situation. It says its ships that enter the waters around the islands are conducting routine patrols of Chinese territory. But Japan says they are intruding in its territorial waters. In the repeated standoffs that result, both sides broadcast warnings to each other's vessels, ordering them to leave the area that they both claim. Nationalists' publicity stunt . The Japanese nationalist group known as Ganbare Nippon this week sent 10 fishing boats carrying dozens of its members to the area around the islands. A representative for the group, Yasushi Watanabe, said the voyage -- the third by Ganbare Nippon this year -- was aimed at publicizing Japan's territorial claim to the area, not at landing on the islands. China's State Oceanic Administration (SOA) said Tuesday that three marine surveillance ships on ""regular patrol duty"" in the area noticed several Japanese ships near the islands, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. The SOA said that it dispatched five more ships to join its three vessels near the islands. Together, the eight Chinese ships ""monitored the Japanese ships from different angles,"" it said. The Japanese Coast Guard said that its vessels had told the Chinese surveillance ships to leave the area, but that they had responded by saying that they were patrolling Chinese territory. Ganbare Nippon later said its ships had all left the area around the islands. The weight of history . The competing claims to the islands are intertwined with the region's complex history. ""Due to the brutal Japanese occupation of China in the 1930s, sentiments over the status of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands run deeper in the Chinese psyche than any other territorial dispute in modern Chinese history, with the exception of Taiwan,"" the International Crisis Group said in its report this month. China says its sovereignty over the area extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa.

"(CNN) -- If Matt Kuchar is feeling any ill effects of his Masters mishap it didn't show in the opening round of the RBC Heritage in South Carolina on Thursday. The world No. 6, who tied for fifth following a disappointing two-over par final round of 74 at Augusta National last Sunday, bounced back at the Harbour Town Golf Links firing a flawless five-under par round of 66.

"(CNN) -- The number of people who have fled Syria and registered as refugees amid the country's civil war was to surpass 3 million Friday, and a further 6.5 million are believed to be displaced within the war-torn nation, the U.N. refugee agency said. That means almost half of all Syrians have been forced to leave their homes amid the roughly three-year conflict, and one in eight has fled across the border, the agency said. In terms of scope and budget, the U.N.'s effort to help the Syrian refugees is the largest in the agency's 64-year history, spokesman Adrian Edwards said. ""The Syrian crisis has become the biggest humanitarian emergency of our era, yet the world is failing to meet the needs of refugees and the countries hosting them,"" Antonio Guterres, the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, said in a news release Friday. The data come a week after the U.N. said it had documented the killings of 191,369 men, women and children in Syria from March 2011, when an uprising began, to the end of April this year. The uprising began with mostly peaceful protests against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Daraa province. Syria responded with a ferocious crackdown against demonstrators and has consistently said it is battling armed terrorist groups as it targeted anti-government protesters. The war, pitting an Alawite Muslim-dominated regime against a largely Sunni Muslim insurgency, has torn the country apart. Numerous factions, some of them Islamist, oppose the government, and one of them -- ISIS, or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate. Refugees ""are arriving in a shocking state, exhausted, scared and with their savings depleted,"" the U.N.'s refugee agency said. ""Most have been on the run for a year or more, fleeing from village to village before taking the final decision to leave."" Most of the refugees are in countries neighboring Syria, including Lebanon (1.14 million), Jordan (608,000) and Turkey (815,000). Governments estimate that hundreds of thousands more are in their countries but unregistered, putting a strain on their economies, the U.N. said. Donors have given more than $4.1 billion to help, but more than $2 billion more is needed by the end of 2014, including to help more than 2.4 million people prepare for the winter, the U.N. said. More than 80% of the refugees are struggling to make a living in communities outside of camps, and more than a third are living in substandard shelters, the U.N. said. ""The response to the Syrian crisis has been generous, but the bitter truth is that it falls far short of what's needed,"" Guterres said. In far southwestern Syria, near the border crossing with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, militants detained 44 U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji for a second straight day on Friday, the United Nations said. These peacekeepers ""are safe and in good health,"" the United Nations said Friday, citing ""credible sources"" since its officials had not yet talked directly with those being held. The United Nations said militants detained the peacekeepers on Thursday, a day after taking the crossing from the Syrian regime. Those holding the peacekeepers are members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, one of the groups fighting the al-Assad government, an Israeli military official told CNN on condition of anonymity. In addition, 72 U.N. peacekeepers from the Philippines were ""restricted to their positions"" Thursday and Friday near Syrian villages in the area, the organization said without elaborating. The United Nations has said it is talking with a variety of groups to try to secure the detained peacekeepers' release. The world body revised the number of detained and restricted peacekeepers Friday from its earlier count of 43 and 81, respectively. The new count, it said, came after a check of the peacekeepers' leave records. The Fijian peacekeepers were detained Thursday morning near the Syrian town of Quneitra, the location of the border crossing that rebels had captured, according to the United Nations. Al-Nusra Front fighters and other Syrian rebels seized control of the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing Wednesday, a capture that represents a new dynamic in a war long feared not only for its deadly effects inside Syria but for threatening to widen into a destabilizing regional conflict. During the fighting Wednesday between Syrian forces and rebels, three errant mortar rounds and some small-arms fire crossed into Israeli-controlled territory, Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said. An Israeli military officer was moderately injured, the military said on Twitter, and Israeli forces responded by striking two Syrian military positions. U.N. peacekeepers have been in the Golan Heights area since 1974, charged with maintaining a ceasefire between Syrian and Israeli forces since a 1973 war. Israel seized control of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War and fought off an attempt by Syria in 1973 to retake the rocky plateau. In 1981, Israel annexed the Golan Heights. It is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. CNN Exclusive: A 13-year-old witness to ISIS's beheadings . What can U.S. do against ISIS in Syria?

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods will not play in next week's Masters after undergoing successful back surgery, the world No. 1 announced Tuesday. The 14-time major winner will miss the tournament for the first time since making his debut at Augusta National as an amateur in 1995. On Monday, he had an operation on a pinched nerve ""that has been hurting him for several months."" ""After attempting to get ready for the Masters, and failing to make the necessary progress, I decided, in consultation with my doctors, to have this procedure done,"" Woods, who has donned the green jacket on four occasions, said in a statement. Although the surgery was successfully performed in Utah by neurosurgeon Dr Charles Rich, Woods now needs to rest and rehabilitate for ""the next several weeks."" ""I'd like to express my disappointment to the Augusta National membership, staff, volunteers and patrons that I will not be at the Masters,"" the 38-year-old added. ""It's a week that's very special to me. ""It also looks like I'll be forced to miss several upcoming tournaments to focus on my rehabilitation and getting healthy. ""I'd also like to thank the fans for their support and concern. It's very kind and greatly appreciated. This is frustrating, but it's something my doctors advised me to do for my immediate and long-term health."" Woods has been struggling since last year with the back injury, which has severely hampered his game in the opening months of 2014. In early March, the condition forced him to stop playing after 13 holes of his final round at the Honda Classic. When he tried to return to action the following week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, he aggravated the injury when tweaking his back. On March 18, he withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational, explaining that neither the back spasms nor pain had subsided and telephoning Palmer personally to apologize for his absence. This year's Masters begins on Thursday April 10. The course is a special place for Woods, who won his maiden major at Augusta in 1997. Beating the field by an astonishing 12 strokes, the then 21-year-old announced his arrival in imperious fashion. He has won the coveted green jacket another three times since: in 2001, 2002 and 2005. An indication of Woods' devotion to the Masters is that he made his long-awaited return to golf in 2010 at Augusta following the well-documented breakdown of his marriage. The tournament had been the only major he had never missed, with a succession of injuries ruling him out of the British Open, the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship at various times since 2008. 'Further Damage' In a statement on his website, it was suggested Woods will ""begin intensive rehabilitation and soft-tissue treatment within a week."" The aim is for one of the game's most legendary figures to return in the summer, with the press release stating that ""Woods could have sustained further damage if he had continued to play."" Despite the disappointment of missing one of his favorite tournaments, Woods remains focused on cementing his place in the golfing firmament. ""It's tough right now, but I'm absolutely optimistic about the future,"" said Woods, whose last major came in 2008. ""There are a couple [of] records by two outstanding individuals and players that I hope one day to break. ""As I've said many times, Sam and Jack reached their milestones over an entire career. I plan to have a lot of years left in mine."" Nicknamed 'The Golden Bear', 70-year-old Nicklaus' record of 18 career majors is the main target in Woods' sights. Meanwhile, Sam Snead, who died in 2002 at the age of 89, won more PGA Tour titles than any other golfer but his 82 victories are just three ahead of Woods' tally. Both players' careers spanned at least 25 years, so allowing Woods -- who turned professional 18 years ago -- plenty of time to chase his targets.","Tiger Woods will miss the Masters after back surgery .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The Army and Marine Corps are allowing convicted felons to serve in increasing numbers, newly released Department of Defense statistics show. A U.S Marine keeps a watchful eye in downtown Baghdad. Recruits were allowed to enlist after having been convicted of crimes including assault, burglary, drug possession and making terrorist threats. The statistics were released by Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. He has given the Pentagon a month to hand over up-to-date details on the number of waivers granted, reports on how the recruits have performed and information about how the waivers are related to meeting recruitment goals. Pentagon statistics show the Army granted 511 felony waivers in 2007, just over twice the 249 it granted the year before. The Army aims to recruit more than 80,000 new soldiers a year. The Marines -- which recruits fewer new service members each year than the Army -- also reported a rise in waivers for felonies, with 350 granted in 2007, compared with 208 in 2006. ""There was a rapid rise in 2007 in the number of waivers the Army and Marine Corps granted to recruits convicted of serious felonies,"" Waxman said in a letter Monday to David Chu, the under-secretary of defense for personnel and readiness. ""I understand that there can be valid reasons for personnel waivers and recognize the importance of providing opportunities to individuals who have served their sentences and rehabilitated themselves. ""At the same time, concerns have been raised that the significant increase in the recruitment of persons with criminal records is a result of the strain put on the military by the Iraq war and may be undermining military readiness,"" he charged. The Army defended its use of waivers as a response to a changing American society, arguing that only three in 10 Americans of military age ""meet all our stringent medical, moral, aptitude or administrative requirements."" ""Today's young men and women are more overweight, have a greater incidence of asthma, and are being charged for offenses that in earlier years wouldn't have been considered a serious offense, and might not have resulted in charges in the first place,"" John P. Boyce Jr. of Army Public Affairs said in a statement to CNN. He said the Army never issues waivers for some types of offenses, including sexual violence, alcoholism and drug trafficking. But the Pentagon statistics showed the Army allowed 106 convicted burglars to enlist in 2007, up from 36 the year before. It also granted waivers to 43 recruits convicted of aggravated assault that year, up from 33 a year before; and to 130 people convicted of possession of drugs other than marijuana, a rise from 71 in 2006. It also allowed two people convicted of making terrorist or bomb threats to enlist in 2007, up from one the year before. The Marines did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Navy reported a slight decline in felony waivers, from 48 in 2006 to 42 in 2007. The Air Force said it granted no felony waivers in either year.

"(CNN) -- Somalia appealed for international help after a cyclone hit the northern region this week, killing at least 115 people, and sweeping livestock and homes into the ocean. ""The number of people killed will go up,"" said Ahmed Adan, a spokesman for the Somali prime minister. ""Most of the area is devastated. Whole villages were swept away. Some of the parts we can't even reach, a lot of people are missing."" The cyclone made landfall Sunday in the semi-autonomous Puntland region. It triggered days of heavy rains and flash floods that swept homes, boats, cows, goats and other farm animals into the Indian Ocean. The region heavily depends on agriculture as a source of income. In a news statement, the African Union Mission in Somalia said up to 300 people are feared dead and hundreds unaccounted for. Clean water, blankets, nonperishable foods, medicine and helicopters to reach the affected areas are among the most crucial needs, Adan said. ""There is a particularly urgent need for temporary shelter to protect the many displaced and vulnerable people from the elements,"" Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon said in a statement. ""I appeal to international aid agencies to provide any assistance they can to the thousands of people affected by this devastating cyclone."" Areas affected include Dangaroyo and Eyl, the latter a hub where pirates launch attacks on vessels traveling in the shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden. The self-governing Puntland region has long maintained that it cut ties with the Somali government over power squabbles. Somalia pledged $1 million to help those affected by the cyclone. Cyclones, typhoons and hurricanes are regional names for severe storms. What's referred to as a typhoon in the northwest Pacific Ocean is considered a cyclone in the Indian Ocean and a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean.","""The number of people killed will go up,"" government spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Teenagers looking to buy cigarettes in New York may have to look elsewhere if a city council proposal is approved and signed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The proposal would raise the legal age to buy any form of tobacco from 18 to 21. But will it be effective in limiting smoking among young people? Approximately 90% of smokers have already started smoking by age 18, according to the Surgeon General. ""Of every three young smokers, only one will quit, and one of the remaining smokers will die from tobacco-related causes,"" according to the Surgeon General's 2012 report, ""Preventing Tobacco Use Among Youth and Young Adults."" The key is to ""try to reduce the number of young people who ever try a cigarette,"" said Dr. Michael Steinberg, director of the Tobacco Dependence Program at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Steinberg is the co-author of a commentary published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine that looks at the pros and cons of the New York proposal. Critics say small businesses will suffer, and the city will lose tax revenue. Others say the proposed law will be hard to enforce and will impinge upon individual rights. But Steinberg argues teens need help to avoid picking up the habit. ""I think a 21-year-old is much more likely, based on their maturity and life experiences, to be able to make an informed rational decision about a behavior that might affect the rest of their life than, say, an 18-year-old,"" Steinberg said. He said that an 18-year-old is not necessarily thinking about the risks associated with smoking. ""Cigarettes and tobacco contain some of the most addictive chemicals in our society,"" said Steinberg. ""Smoking a cigarette delivers more nicotine more efficiently to your brain than if you were to inject nicotine intravenously."" Tobacco study finds 'urgent need' for policy change . The New York proposal was introduced in April by Dr. Thomas A. Farley, the city's health commissioner, and Christine C. Quinn, City Council speaker and a mayoral candidate. A vote on the proposal is expected to take place this fall, according to a spokesperson from the City Council's office. Federal law prohibits the sale of tobacco to people under the age of 18. Alaska, Alabama, Utah and New Jersey require people to be 19. Officials in New York estimate that raising the purchasing age to 21 will cut tobacco use by 55% among 18- to 20-year-olds and lead to a 67% drop among teens aged 14 to 17 years. Steinberg knows that limiting access to tobacco is not the only strategy for reducing youth smoking, but it's a start. ""It's not going to fix the problem in and of itself,"" said Steinberg. ""You also need educational programs."" The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a panel of health care experts, now recommends that primary care physicians offer patients interventions, education and counseling to prevent tobacco use among children and adolescents. Their reasoning? If teens never light up, they may never get hooked.

"(CNN) -- Spring has sprung and as far as golf fans are concerned, that means only one thing -- it's time for the Masters. Golf's first major of 2014 begins at the famed Augusta National on Thursday, this year marking the 78th installment of one of sport's most enduring contests. They are four captivating days in Georgia that never fail to throw up a myriad of storylines, sub plots and sensations. With the field as wide open as ever, CNN World Sport looks at six Masters headlines waiting to be written. Mickelson assumes Tiger's mantle . The buildup to any major championship is always dominated by Tiger Woods -- whether he is playing or not. Even Phil Mickelson has said it will be ""weird"" not to have Woods prowling Augusta's fairways. With the world No. 1 missing his first Masters due to a back injury, most homegrown fervor will focus on ""Lefty,"" the man who already has three green jackets in his wardrobe. The 43-year-old has had his own fitness worries, withdrawing from two tournaments this season, but returned his best finish of the year at the Shell Houston Open just a few days ago. The only current player who can hold a candle to Mickelson in terms of Masters success is Woods, whose four Augusta titles match the feats of Arnold Palmer -- two behind the record haul of another legend of the game, Jack Nicklaus. Mickelson's most recent triumph came in 2010 and featured a shot that has gone down as one of the finest in the tournament's illustrious history. It also showcased Mickelson's game perfectly, as he launched a six-iron from pine needles behind a tree onto the 13th green, over the stream that protects the front of the green. Should Lefty find his very best this week, a fourth Masters crown is a distinct possibility. A wide open field . Trying to predict the next major champion is a futile exercise. Since the start of the 2009 season, there have been 18 different winners of the 20 major titles on offer -- and 15 of those were first-time victors. Such is the talent being stockpiled at the top of the game, the winner could come from pretty much any continent and be stationed at either end of the age spectrum. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy was 22 when he won the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional -- the youngest winner since 1923, when the legendary American Bobby Jones triumphed. And Mickelson clocked in at 43 years young when he secured the fifth major of his career at the 2013 British Open at Muirfield in Scotland. Talented teenagers and voracious veterans lurk at every corner of a major championship field, and of the 97 players competing, around 70 will think they have a realistic chance of winning. McIlroy's redemption? Until McIlroy is cloaked in a green jacket, the abiding memory of his Masters experience will be of a red-faced youngster slumped over his club as one of golf's greatest chokes took hold. At the tender age of 21, he went into the final round at Augusta in 2011 with a four-shot lead, and blew it in epic style. The sight of McIlroy wandering around the VIP cabins 50 yards to the left of the 10th fairway looking for his errant tee shot are now the stuff of legend. By the time he signed for an eight-over final round of 80, to sink from first place to a tie for 15th, there wasn't a right-minded spectator who didn't feel the urge to give him a consoling hug. A typically stoic interview on the 18th further endeared the youngster to viewers the world over, as he admitted he couldn't put his finger on why he had ""unraveled"" in such a fashion. He later said he ""wasn't ready to win a major"" but just a few months later, he was. At the very next major, he shot a record low U.S Open score to win at Congressional in Maryland by an emphatic eight shots. The next year he doubled his major tally, adding the U.S. PGA Championship to his trophy cabinet, but you get the feeling he won't be content until his redemption at Augusta is complete. The Asian invasion . Adam Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters last year but how long will it be before the first Asian winner of golf's most prestigious prize? Last year's tournament was abuzz with the sight of China's Guan Tianlang striding the famous fairways at the tender age of 14, and winning the low amateur medal. The child prodigy represents a burgeoning talent pool in Asia, seeking to build on the breakthrough success made by Y.E. Yang at the 2009 U.S. PGA Championship. Not only did the Korean serve notice of Asia's arrival at the top table of golf, he did it by beating the greatest golfer of a generation -- Tiger Woods. The highest-ranked Asian player is Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, who sits 26th in the world list on only his second year on the PGA Tour. Matsuyama won the leading amateur prize on his Augusta debut as a 19-year-old in 2011 and already has a top-five finish on this season's PGA Tour. His compatriot Ryo Ishikawa has a top-10 place to his name this season despite languishing in the lower reaches of the top 100, while Korean veteran K.J. Choi has been a longstanding representative of Asia at the top level. Another one to watch is Thailand's 51st-ranked Thongchai Jaidee, who has five European Tour titles to his name. The Great Scott sequel? The last person to retain the Masters crown was -- yep, you guessed it -- Woods back in 2002 but could Scott be about to double Australia's tally of wins at Augusta? No-one is ranked higher than the 33-year-old going into the tournament. In fact, only a poor final round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March prevented him from returning to Georgia as world No. 1. He spoke on Tuesday of the privileges afforded to a Masters champion -- playing the course with his father Phil and hanging out in the champions' locker room. And after an arduous few years trying to land his maiden major, with his slump a the British Open in 2012 a particularly bitter pill to swallow, Scott's game has been freed up after last year's win. ""It has been incredible to see the reception I get every week I play since being a Masters champion,"" he said in his press conference. ""It has been a real buzz for me to be welcomed at all the golf courses I'm at. ""This week has been something I have been really looking forward to. But as the last week came around, I also realized it would be time for me to bring the green jacket back and leave it here maybe. ""So that motivated me to work harder that last week at home and try and get myself into some kind of form that can maybe go back-to-back and keep the jacket for another year."" A European 2014? The last European to don the famous green jacket was Jose Maria Olazabal in 1999. It was the second time the Spaniard had triumphed at Augusta, having won the Masters in 1994. Arguably the third leg of a hat-trick of Olazabal's career highlights also came on American soil, when he masterminded what will forever be known as the ""Miracle of Medinah"" when serving as Europe's Ryder Cup captain. Trailing 10-6 going into the final day of singles matches in the Ryder Cup clash between Europe and the United States, Olazabal's men pulled off one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time to eventually triumph 14Â½ points to 13Â½. The U.S. team, led this time by veteran Tom Watson, are plotting their revenge ahead of the next clash in Scotland in October, but what better way to lay down a marker than for a European to end the continent's 14-year drought at Augusta? There are four European players in the world's top 10 and two of them -- England's Justin Rose and McIlroy -- are already major champions. Sweden's Henrik Stenson won both the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup and the European Tour's Race to Dubai last year, while Sergio Garcia has finished in the top five in all four major championships during his career. Don't be surprised if Europe marches off with another major honor come Sunday. And finally .... The Tiger factor . He might not be playing but that doesn't mean Woods won't still be a talking point in Masters week. Whether it is clips of his famous chip-in back in 2005, or reams of column inches detailing his four Masters wins, Tiger's absence certainly doesn't mean he'll be absent from the debate. And of course, once the green jacket has been placed on the shoulders of the winner, a popular refrain might be ""What if Tiger had been playing?""","CNN World Sport takes a look at six potential storylines ahead of the 2014 Masters .

"(CNN) -- Rory McIlory and Phil Mickelson found form in the desert despite losing out on a dramatic final day at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship. Spain's Pablo Larrazabal may have walked off into the sunset with the $2.7m prize but the major winners saw the silver lining at their first tournament of the 2014 season. ""What a fun week this has been,"" enthused Mickelson, the world No.5, despite finishing an agonizing one shot off the lead alongside McIlroy. ""I am happy with the way I played and felt better with my swing each day."" McIlroy was a little more irked by the events of the weekend after he was slapped with a two-stroke penalty Saturday. ""I feel like I'm standing here and I should be 15 under par for the tournament and winning by one,"" said McIlroy, whose foot fault in the third round was pointed out by his playing partner's caddie. ""I played the least shots of anyone this week. So, I can count it as a moral victory more than anything else. ""It's frustrating but I've played well the whole week. It's a very positive start to the season so I'm not going to let one little negative ruin that."" A ding-dong final round at the Abu Dhabi tournament saw the lead change hands several times as overnight leader Craig Lee slid out of contention. At the eighth hole, world No. 7 McIlroy had moved into the lead as he clipped in his third birdie of the day. Then at the turn, Mickelson moved into the sole lead on 12 under only to unravel at the 13th where he tried to hit the ball out of a bush and carded a three-over-par seven. ""I ended up going with a 3-wood off that tee and just blocked it in a terrible spot,"" the American explained. ""I tried to right hand it out and I double hit it. I don't know how, but it happened."" Major celebration . McIlroy finished off the day with a birdie at the 18th for a very tidy round of 68 but had to rely on Larrazabal cracking to get his hands on the trophy. Mickelson needed an eagle at the last to snatch the silverware but his final shot stayed out and he had to settle for a birdie. Barcelona-born Larrazabal held his nerve to sink a birdie on the final green and win by a single stroke for his third career European Tour title. ""It just feels unbelievable,"" he told reporters. ""Today has been very special, to fight against Rory and Phil. ""I don't know what it does to my career. I don't know if this gets me into any of the majors.

"(CNN) -- Syria announced Tuesday that it is granting ""amnesty"" to protesters accused of committing crimes. But a report published by the state-run news agency seemed to suggest the protesters were not actually being offered amnesty, as in a general pardon, but were having their punishments for alleged crimes decreased. An announcement on state-run television said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad issued a decree granting amnesty to protesters arrested for crimes committed before Tuesday. The amnesty includes ""all of those who belong to various political movements including the Muslim Brotherhood,"" the alert on state TV said. The announcement came after weeks of Syrian officials describing some protesters as ""terrorists"" trying to destabilize the country. A report Tuesday on the website of SANA, Syria's state news agency, said that in addition to granting general amnesty, Assad's decree ""also pardons half penalties for felonies if there was no personal claim."" The report says Article 1 of Assad's decree grants ""general amnesty for all crimes committed before May 31, 2011, according to the following.""  It then lists changes in punishments.  The death penalty will be replaced with a ""life sentence of hard labor or long imprisonment sentence according to the crime,"" a life sentence of hard work will be replaced with ""20 years imprisonment with hard labor,"" and so on. A call to the Syrian Embassy in Washington for clarification was not immediately returned. SANA also carried a story Tuesday with the headline: ""Army and security forces arrest members of armed terrorist groups in al-Rastan, seize massive amounts of weapons and ammo."" The Syrian uprising, part of the so-called Arab Spring in which protesters throughout much of the Middle East and North Africa have taken to the streets calling for reforms, has been met with a fierce crackdown by the government. Roughly 830 people have been killed in the protests, according to the Syrian Human Rights Information Link. That number does not include security personnel whom the Syrian government says died in attacks by ""armed groups."" The United States has imposed new sanctions on al-Assad and other senior Syrian officials over human rights abuses, freezing any assets held in the country .

"(CNN) -- Having waited to be heard, Amanda Knox is finally speaking for herself. Five and a half years after her roommate Meredith Kercher was found murdered in the house they shared, the notorious American student has published her own book. ""Waiting to Be Heard"" was released this week in conjunction with her first network television interview -- together a triumph of spectacle over substance. But it could not have been otherwise. This murder was transformed into tabloid entertainment almost from the moment the body was carried out of the house, in picturesque Perugia, Italy, the day after Halloween 2007. Amanda Knox concedes being 'tone-deaf' in days after roommate's murder . Knox doesn't know what happened that night and is unable to provide us with a single new clue that could unravel the Gordian knot of police error, lies, national pride and xenophobic prejudice that turned a simple crime into an international mystery. Since she cannot offer that, her debut provides one thing only: performance. In her first television interview, she gave the same answers she has always given to the main questions about how she could have showered in a house with blood on a bathroom floor and faucet, and then, a few days later, named an innocent man as the killer. But this time the answers came with close-ups of the quivering lip and brimming eyes. All that emotion can't have distracted millions of viewers from the one thing that really matters: Who did it? Knox has a terribly high hurdle in winning hearts and minds. She must overcome the challenge that confronts anyone convicted of a gruesome killing and then released without a substitute defendant. Millions of people believe she got away with murder. Her other problem is the one that's dogged her from the start. If you want to, you can look at her and think she is acting. In her first interview, she occasionally looked evasive, her gaze drifting away. To many people that reads as shiftiness, but it can also have any number of more benign causes, including disorientation, PTSD or the very understandable nervousness that any untrained person would feel at being interviewed by a major television anchor for a national audience. Amanda Knox says her behavior was 'tone-deaf' after murder . Even in tears, she comes across as remote and cool. And years of coaching by attorneys still haven't prevented her from saying tone-deaf things such as expressing a desire to visit Kercher's grave. She cannot -- and probably never will -- provide a coherent explanation for why she named Patrick Lumumba, a demonstrably innocent man, as the killer. I've always believed, based on the available descriptions of what went on in the police station before she signed a ""confession"" putting him and herself in the house on the night of the murder, that the Perugia polizia wanted the killer to be a foreign man. After all, they were routinely arresting African, Arab and Albanian immigrants for drug and violent crimes that are increasing in what until recently was their homogeneous, walled Umbrian mountain town. When they saw what they thought was an appointment with an African immigrant on Knox's cell phone, they screamed at and browbeat her -- without ever videotaping the interrogation -- until she gave in and agreed with them. It's easy to envision that scenario if you believe, as I do, that all the evidence points to her innocence. It's harder to accept if you think she might have been not just callous and blithe in the weeks before the murder and the days afterward, but an actual killer. Since she can't give us any real answers, was her book and her coveted interview worth all the money -- a reported $4 million -- and bated breath? In the publishing world, the reaction was summed up by an editor I know: ""That used to be presidential memoir money."" But she spent four years in prison, wrongly accused, and endured outrageous and blatantly sexist abuse at the hands of the Italians. Take the sickening episode, which she reveals in her book, of being stripped and given a gratuitous manual gynecological exam immediately after being arrested and before being sent to jail. Four million bucks can't repair having one's persona hijacked, remade into the likeness of a witch or a female Charles Manson, and broadcast around the world. Most of that money has probably gone to the lawyers anyway, a gaggle of men in suits, for whom greasing the wheels of justice -- even when that ""justice"" is really about upholding the honor of police and prosecutors who made big investigative missteps -- and getting paid take precedence over figuring out what actually happened. If anything was left over, it went toward hauling a middle-class American family out the debt hole into which they plunged when they double-mortgaged their houses to defend their kid. In the end, this tragedy is about two very provincial families, one from suburban Seattle, one from north London, who have no idea what happened and who will never get answers, no matter how much money gets thrown around, no matter how many television interviews are granted,or books written or even court reviews concluded. No, they won't get answers until Rudy Guede -- whose fingerprints and DNA were in the room, who is in prison for the killing and who has never denied being present while Kercher bled to death -- explains what really happened. In the meantime, the lesson for those families and others like them seems to be keep your kids home and lock your doors.

"(CNN) -- Jack Quavis doesn't shy away from heated political discussions; in fact, he encourages them. Politics is an ever-present topic in his one-room barbershop in Buffalo, New York. Jack Quavis gives a customer a haircut at his Buffalo, New York, barbershop. He's the owner of Taylor Mae'd Barber Shop, an old-fashioned place with one distinguishing feature -- customers can share their thoughts on camera about current events while Quavis trims their hair. ""I'm tired of the average person not being heard,"" he said. ""At the barber shop, guys will open up. Everybody's eager to talk about something."" Politics, though often a taboo subject at social events and many workplaces, is the topic of choice in his shop, said Quavis. There's one barber chair used for haircuts. The others form a makeshift seating area. Photos and bumper stickers cover the walls, along with a handful of ponytails from past customers. ""It's a small, cozy kind of place,"" said Quavis, one where visitors ""can speak their mind and not be ridiculed for it."" Men share opinions with Quavis that they wouldn't be comfortable discussing with their closest friends, said the longtime New York resident. ""They trust me."" ""More or less, I'm not a threat to them. I'm not going to judge them for their opinions."" Quavis, 46, founded Taylor Mae'd a decade ago and began recording videos of his conversations with customers in December 2008. In an introductory video on his Web site, Quavis explains his goal. ""This is a chance to take a look and see what Americans are passionate about."" He also offers a warning: ""If strong opinions offend you, then maybe this isn't the Web site for you."" Perhaps surprisingly, many customers allow their discussions to be filmed and shared online. Quavis posts his barbershop videos on CNN's iReport.com and his personal Web site, All Buzzed Up. Though the men speak with obvious fervor, they manage to stay calm and still as scissors fly through their hair. Quavis heard plenty of political chatter when he worked as a bartender, but says those conversations were never as civil as those in the barbershop. During a typical recorded conversation, Quavis will ask about a current legislative issue, then let the customer talk as he goes to work. Often, the energetic barber will jump in to share his observations. ""I try to keep them guided by what's going on in the news today,"" he said. On Inauguration Day, Quavis recorded two interviews with customers. Both seemed excited to see Barack Obama as president and happy that George W. Bush was leaving office. ""I'd give him a four out of 10,"" said one customer, referring to Bush's performance. ""What'd he get a four for?"" asked Quavis. ""Just for taking the job,"" he joked, making Quavis laugh so hard that he had to stop shaving the man's head.  Watch Quavis and customers take on heated political topics » . One of Quavis' favorite topics these days is the ideological divide among politicians. Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill have battled over health care reform for months now, seemingly unable to reach an agreement. The barber talks quickly and passionately, letting a few choice words slip when he's on the subject. ""Our government's a joke right now,"" he said. ""If [politicians] stop being Democrats and Republicans and start being people, maybe these issues wouldn't be so tough. Don't vote along party lines, vote with what you think is true."" Several customers have echoed Quavis' sentiments. ""They've got to stop catering to big business and special interest groups -- got to listen to the people more,"" said Larry Switzer, a frequent Taylor Mae'd patron who shared his thoughts on camera. ""You would think that we would be in their special interest,"" said Quavis, chuckling. As he trims Switzer's hair, the two chat like old buddies. His 400-square-foot shop, which specializes in men's haircuts, sits on a busy road a few miles south from the heart of Buffalo. The Bethlehem Steel plant, which closed in 2001, looms down the street. ""A couple thousand acres, sitting there wasted,"" said Quavis. The economy has taken its toll on Taylor Mae'd as with many independent barbershops across the country, said Quavis. Customers go longer between haircuts and stories of being laid off from jobs seem more and more common. But, despite it all, Quavis remains optimistic. He's held a variety of jobs, but said he likes being a barber best. ""It's the best job I've ever had,"" he said. ""I love the guys who come here; I love their opinions; I love what it's all about."" Tom Ammo visits the barbershop once a week. He drops by Taylor Mae'd every Thursday morning with donuts and coffee, and he and Quavis record a video talking about current events. Some days, the ironworker will spend a couple of hours at the shop. ""There aren't many places you can do that,"" said Ammo. ""Barbershops are a dying breed -- the kind of barbershop where you can go in and hang out with the guys."" Ammo, 45, has known Quavis since high school. The men often talk about the government, but recently branched out to sports. Ammo now gives his predictions for upcoming Buffalo Bills NFL games during his weekly visit. ""He's a people person,"" said Ammo, referring to Quavis. ""Not too many people have the gift of gab and the ability to get people to talk."" Ammo said he's never liked public speaking, but finds being on camera a different experience. ""I was petrified to do a speech in high school or talk in front of crowds,"" Ammo said. ""But when he puts the cam on, I'm at ease and everything flows."" Quavis said his friends scoffed at the idea when he first decided to start recording videos, but he's starting to see a change in opinions. ""Slowly but surely, more and more people are coming around,"" he said. The barber says he doesn't affiliate with any political party. ""I'm a realist, neither Democrat nor Republican."" His opinions are often influenced by his customers' various viewpoints. ""Even if I disagree with something, if everyone else thinks it's the best for this country, I'll go ahead with it."" Washington politicians could learn a thing or two from Taylor Mae'd and other small barbershops, said Quavis. Whether discussing the economy, health care, or another political topic, everyone seems to find a way to agree. ""Somehow or another, when men come into a barbershop, we manage to find common ground.""","At Taylor Mae'd Barber Shop, customers can share their thoughts on camera .

"(CNN) -- As the protests in Cairo enter a second week, CNN takes a look at some of the key questions surrounding them. What are the protests about? The protesters are calling for democratization -- for a government that they feel represents them. They want President Hosni Mubarak, 82, to step down after 30 years holding onto power, and an end to what they complain is a corrupt regime. Some have called for the government to face a trial. The anger is driven largely by economic frustrations. Egypt has seen a dramatic rise in the cost of living in recent years. While the government has offered food subsidies to help people handle rising prices, many are struggling. Egypt's economy was stagnant for decades, but in the past 10 years started to grow, creating bigger differences between rich and poor, said Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan. ""And I think some of the protest is over the ways in which the labor movements have gotten left behind and haven't shared in the economic growth,"" he said. Why now? What sparked the protests? A wave of protests in nearby Tunisia which overthrew the government helped inspire people in other nearby countries, facing similar frustrations, that it was time for an uprising. But the spark, in many ways, was one young man. Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old college graduate in Tunisia, was unable to find work, so he set up a fruit cart. Police confiscated it, saying he had no permit. According to the Federation of Human Rights Leagues, police also beat him. Bouazizi set himself on fire in protest, and later died. His self-immolation triggered the huge protests in Tunisia, which in turn helped inspire people in other nearby countries, including Algeria and Yemen, to take to the streets as well. There have also been protests in Jordan and Sudan. A Facebook page calls for similar demonstrations in Syria. A popular Facebook page that helped organize the Cairo protests beginning January 25 was dedicated to Bouazizi. Who are the protesters? Many are young men. The majority of Egypt's population is under 30, and the vast majority of its unemployed are as well. While the protesters include people from different socio-economic levels and different parts of the country, there is a ""high proportion of the educated middle class,"" said Cole. There's ""a feeling amongst that middle class that they're not being given the opportunities in life that their degrees warrant -- what historians would call a 'blocked elite,'"" Cole said. Have the protests been violent? The protesters have generally been peaceful, chanting slogans and holding signs. Last week, police clashed violently with some demonstrators, leaving some dead and others wounded. Once the government sent in the military to take the place of police, the clashes came to a halt. The two sides have generally gotten along well. Some protesters have even posed for pictures with members of the military on their tanks. At times, the protests have even taken on the feeling of a music festival, with people wandering around, chatting, and celebrating. ""This is the start of the rest of my life,"" one jubilant young man who appeared to be in his 20s told CNN. ""As cheesy as it sounds, that's exactly how I feel right now."" How did chaos begin in some areas? Police disappeared from the streets in parts of Cairo and some other areas, and some police stations were ransacked. Over the weekend, looters attacked stores and homes and torched some cars, and some prisoners escaped. Men gathered in neighborhoods to create vigilante groups protecting their property. In some places, people handed out knives, sticks, clubs, and baseball bats to men and teenage boys, encouraging them to fight any looters who came along. Some Egyptians said they worry the chaos could be part of Mubarak's strategy, getting citizens angry at the protesters for creating havoc and excited for government security forces to come along and bring order. But the crime has also built more frustration against the government among many Egyptians. How many have died? While it's difficult to ascertain a solid death toll, Human Rights Watch staffers have confirmed more than 120 deaths in Cairo, Alexandria, and Suez, according to a researcher for the group in Cairo. How is the food supply? Many families are fast running out of staples, and they are either unable or unwilling to shop for groceries. ""I have three children, and I only have enough to feed them for maybe two more days. After that I do not know what we will do,"" school administrator Gamalat Gadalla said. Grocers have closed up shop or are running out of supplies themselves. ""With the curfew, there are no restaurants, food or gas. Basic goods will soon be in shortage,"" Sandmonkey, an Egyptian blogger said via Twitter. Egyptian state-run Nile TV has set up a hotline for citizens to call in and report bread shortages. There has been no other indication of what the Egyptian government is doing to address the crisis. CNN's Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson, Ivan Watson, Frederik Pleitgen, and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","Protesters seek representative government, economic opportunity .

"(CNN) -- Meet Bailey. She's a registered therapy dog, but you won't find her in hospitals or nursing homes. Instead, Bailey makes weekly visits to libraries and schools. She sits quietly or snuggles up to kids as they read her a book. And no, she's not napping, and the kids don't have treats in their pockets. She's actually helping these children learn to read. It sounds implausible. After all, dogs can't read. How could they possibly help someone learn a skill that they themselves can't grasp? But it's a growing trend, and it seems to be working. The philosophy is simple. Children who are just learning to read often feel judged or intimidated by classmates and adults. But reading to a dog isn't so scary. It won't judge, it won't get impatient, it won't laugh or correct if the child makes a mistake. In a nutshell, dogs are simply excellent listeners. And for shy kids or slow readers, that can make all the difference. Kathy Klotz is executive director of Intermountain Therapy Animals, which runs a nationwide program called R.E.A.D. -- Reading Education Assistance Dogs. She says there's another benefit of reading to the dogs that she didn't anticipate: confidence. ""A factor that we never planned for, that turned out to be really important, is that the child feels like they're letting the dog understand the story,"" she says. ""They get to be the teacher, the storyteller, the one who knows more than the dog for a change. ...They just blossom when they get to be the one who knows more than the dog."" Video: Meet Bailey and Wilmoth . The children know they're not actually teaching the dog, of course, but the for the kids, the idea that they know more than the dog and can share their knowledge is a powerful one. And now that volunteers are aware of that aspect, Klotz says they actively foster the idea of the child as the teacher. ""One of the things you do in the program is you always speak for the dog,"" says Klotz. ""Like if [the child] doesn't know a word, the dog doesn't know the word either. And then they're not alone, and they can look it up in the dictionary together."" Bailey and her owner, Jim Wilmoth, participate in weekly reading sessions at local libraries in West Virginia with kids who are generally between 6 and 12 years old. They're part of the ""Sit. Stay. Read."" program, which is similar to R.E.A.D. Programs like these have popped up in nearly every state to help improve literacy rates in the United States. ""The kids come in and read stories to Bailey and other therapy dogs for about 15 or 20 minutes at a time,"" says Wilmoth, who was interviewed by iReporter Jennifer Sias at the West Virginia Book Festival. ""It encourages them to practice their reading skills ... and it's a good way to involve families with the library system."" iReport.com: Wilmoth explains how he and Bailey got started . And then, of course, there are the proven physiological benefits of interacting with dogs. According to the researchers at the Center for the Human-Animal Bond at Purdue University, blood pressure drops and the heart rate slows when a person is petting a dog. The National Institutes of Health confirms what any dog owner knows: Dogs have been found to reduce stress. Each of these factors helps calm children and makes them feel less nervous or intimidated about reading. For older children and teens, the dog can be a supportive friend and provide an outlet from stress and peer pressure. Klotz says her organization has had particular success with kids in detention programs. ""A comment we always get in our detention program is that animals make kids respond so genuinely,"" she explains. ""They get away from peer pressure and towards a genuine enjoyment [of reading]. ... They love it."" It's hard to measure scientifically the success of the program and others like it. Because they're volunteer-based, and because each state uses different methods to measure reading level, doing a nationwide study would be difficult. However, Klotz says it's possible to see results in individual schools by comparing the reading improvement of kids who participate in the program with kids who don't. She says it's typical for the kids who read to dogs for just 20 minutes a week to improve their reading skills by a couple of grade levels in one school year. She's even seen as much improvement as four grade levels in a year. And Klotz thinks that reading comprehension is just the beginning of how these dogs help kids. ""It's not just reading scores,"" she says. ""They start to speak up in class, and volunteer, and finish homework. They don't want to miss school when they're going to read to the dog, so it improves attendance. It kind of just flows over onto everything."" R.E.A.D. staff and volunteers know people are skeptical about the program's results at first, but Klotz says anyone who's spent time with a dog will understand. ""It sounds a little kooky when people first hear the idea,"" she admits. ""But if they know dogs at all, and the way people relate to dogs, it quickly starts to make sense. But you don't quite ever grasp how really lovely it is until you see it happen and you see the kids light up and you see how excited they are. You see all these changes in them that they just weren't able to make.""","Therapy dogs in libraries can help kids become more comfortable with reading .

"(CNN) -- ""I have a crazy idea"": Those five words changed a simple meeting of school officials into the realization of Kim Ursetta's dream. Kim Ursetta leads her kindergarten class at Mathematics and Science Leadership Academy in Denver, Colorado. Ursetta, then president of a local teachers' union, blurted out those words 18 months ago during a meeting in the office of Denver, Colorado's, schools superintendent. The other officials in the room leaned in as Ursetta leaped into a sales pitch that would turn an ordinary day into a highlight of her career. ""I want to start a new kind of school,"" she said, a union-sponsored public school led by teachers, not a principal. ""I started talking about 21st century skills and wanting to prepare our kids in math and science, especially our low-income and ethnic minority students,"" Ursetta said. ""We've been doing schools the same way in this nation for 150 years, so if we don't step up, then nothing is going to change.""  Watch more about new school innovation » . Superintendent Michael Bennet -- now the state's freshman U.S. senator -- did not say no to the idea, and Ursetta walked out the door ""excited"" and ""shocked."" She immediately started ""pulling together a group of teachers to sit down with a blank sheet of paper and ask how you would do a school differently.""  See details about K-12 schools, teachers » . Three weeks ago, Ursetta's dream became a reality, as Mathematics and Science Leadership Academy opened its doors to 142 kindergartners and first- and second-grade students in Denver's mostly low-income, largely Hispanic Athmar Park neighborhood. A board-certified, 16-year teaching veteran, Ursetta, 38, believes the lack of teacher flexibility ranks among the top barriers blocking the nation's children from receiving the best education possible. As a teacher at traditional schools, Ursetta said she and her colleagues weren't allowed to change the order of their lessons. Two of the school's 12 teachers take on administrative duties as ""lead teachers,"" performing the traditional role of a principal. Although they follow school board-approved curriculum and standards, instructors can easily rearrange lessons to ""make better sense for the kids"" -- making better connections between different subject matter, Ursetta said. Sometimes, for example, it makes sense to group Ursetta's kindergarten students with first-graders working on the same subject. ""You normally would have to ask permission to do that,"" she said. ""But here, we just do it. We're able to try different things to teach them instead of just following a script."" The lack of quality school leadership is a big reason that experienced teachers leave their schools, Ursetta said. ""Studies show when you take accomplished teachers and allow them to have a leadership role, that's when they see the most success. Scores just soar. That's how we're focused here."" Race to the Top . Creating conditions for innovation and reform is one of the stated aims of the new education initiative launched by the Obama administration. Dubbed Race to the Top, the program is essentially a contest pitting states against each other to win a share of $4.35 billion in grant money from congressional stimulus legislation. More school funding appears to be a popular idea among many Americans, according to last month's national Gallup poll sponsored by the professional educators group Phi Delta Kappa. Thirty-two percent of 1,000 general public respondents said adequate funding -- not teacher flexibility -- was the No. 1 problem facing public schools. To qualify for Race to the Top, the rules call on states to create ""data systems"" linking student success with teacher performance. That idea jangles nerves at the National Education Association -- the nation's largest teachers union -- where members fear it opens the door to measuring teacher performance by how students score on tests. ""What we're really against is using a single [student ] test on a single day"" to assess teacher performance, said NEA Executive Director John Wilson. ""What we're more accepting of are multiple indicators,"" and teacher performance ""observed in classroom should count as the major part of evaluation."" Unlike the controversial 2002 No Child Left Behind program, which forced states to accept student testing standards in exchange for federal funds, Race to the Top is strictly a voluntary initiative. But Wilson said many teachers are reacting coolly to Race to the Top because they ""feel like it's too much like No Child Left Behind and are looking for something different."" Teachers wonder if the program will undermine innovation and creativity, Wilson said. Charter schools . Race to the Top also aims to give a boost to charter schools -- special public schools that are given more independence in order to encourage innovation. The program requires each state applicant to remove any limits to the number of charter schools. However, in some cases, ""the rate of charter schools has been allowed to grow faster than folks can keep track of -- and standards begin to slip,"" said U.S. Education Department spokesman Justin Hamilton. ""That's something we all need to be aware of."" Critics of Race to the Top question its emphasis on charter schools, prompting some officials to say the criteria are unfair to rural districts. In mostly rural Montana, state education chief Denise Juneau, a Democrat, has complained about the charter school criteria in a letter to U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan. The idea ""does not make sense,"" said Juneau's letter, because rural and economic conditions in her state make it challenging to support current schools, let alone ""the duplication of infrastructure a charter school would mean in most communities."" ""Why does everyone believe that charter schools are the only point of innovation?"" Wilson asked. ""There's so much going on in public schools that nobody ever talks about."" 'It's so unprecedented' So far, at least eight states have changed their laws in hopes of winning some of the federal grant money, according to the U.S. Department of Education. ""It's so unprecedented,"" said Tim Daly, president of the New Teacher Project, a nonprofit that advocates for high-need students. ""No one had any idea that states would take this competition so seriously. I certainly didn't. States had resisted reform for a million reasons."" Experts explain the shift in a word: recession. The sagging economy has cut tax revenues -- the lifeblood of public schools. ""The question is, is it the money or the prestige?"" said Daly. ""Are states doing this because they get money for this? Or are many states shocked by how far they have slipped?"" An independent panel of 50 to 80 experts will decide which states will get the grant money and how much. An announcement is expected toward year's end, Hamilton said. ""It's a program to showcase for the nation the states that are doing things right,"" Hamilton said.  It's for states that are pushing the education envelope and getting our children to where they need to be -- to be the most competitive in the global marketplace.""","Teachers -- not principals -- run new Colorado school focusing on math, science .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. team took to the field for its clash against Portugal with these words inscribed on its jersey patches: . ""The American will to win is stronger than any opponent in your way."" For 94 minutes on Sunday, they persevered. They were down, then they equalized, then they led. But, with mere seconds to go, Team USA's dogged determination was torpedoed by a header from Silvestre Varela. What seemed like a sure win ended in a disappointing 2-2 draw. ""A draw is just blah,"" U.S. goalie Tim Howard said. Now, the U.S. team will have to find steelier resolve for its next contest, against soccer powerhouse Germany on Thursday. A lot rides on that game, if the U.S. wants to advance to the next round. But before we get to that, let's look back at the drama and emotion of Sunday's spectacle. Cheers, then silence . From Arkansas to Alaska, American fans had flocked to Brazil. Some made it all the way to the jungle heat of Manaus where the game took place; others joined a crowd of about 20,000 people gathered in front of a big screen in Rio de Janeiro, chanting their belief in an American victory. Back at home, bars and streets were packed with people -- an unusual sight in a country that is ordinarily indifferent to soccer. ""What's for dinner? Portugal,"" an oft-repeated joke went. Portugal netted the ball first. If one were to go by history, that would have been disastrous. In 20 games, the U.S. has never recovered when the opposing team scored the first goal. But then, Jermaine Jones thumped in a stunning long-range shot to bring the score to 1-1. The noise was deafening. And when Clint Dempsey put the United States ahead 2-1, cheers erupted even on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. All the U.S. had to do next was bide time -- keep possession of the ball, keep an increasingly desperate Portugal at bay. They did -- until the end of the game and for four of the five minutes of stoppage time. But Varela's crushing late equalizer -- headed in from a pinpoint cross by Portugal's talisman, Cristiano Ronaldo -- stunned the U.S. supporters. But shock soon turned to grudging satisfaction. A tie isn't as bad as a defeat. After all, Portugal is ranked No. 4 in the world; the U.S. No. 13. A tie also gives another point for the U.S., moving it closer to qualifying for the knockout stages. 'You have to move on' The team captain certainly wasn't dwelling on the Portugal game's cruel finale. ""You're disappointed not to get three points but at the same time you have to take the positives from the game,"" Dempsey said. The team now has its sights set firmly on Germany. That confrontation is an intriguing one for U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who played for the German team that won the World Cup in 1990. But he didn't show any conflicted loyalties in his comments Sunday. ""We have one day less to recover. They played yesterday, we played today,"" he told ESPN. ""We played in the Amazon, and they played in the very kind of location where they don't have to travel much. Everything was done for the big favorites to go and move on. We have to do it the tough way, but we're going to do it the tough way."" Win or tie enough . The key question for American fans is what their team has to do to get through to the next round. The good news is that the U.S. players have their fate in their own hands: a win or a tie would be enough to see them through. A victory against Germany on Thursday, unlikely but not impossible, would put the United States top of the group with seven points. A tie would also be good enough to qualify, leaving Team USA second on five points, level with Germany, which would finish top because of a better goal difference. ... but a loss? In the event of a German win, things get a lot more complicated, but not necessarily catastrophic for the Americans. If Portugal and Ghana tie, the United States would stay in second place on four points. (Portugal and Ghana only have one point each at the moment.) If Ronaldo leads Portugal to victory, it would pull level with the United States. At that point, it would all depend on goal difference. The Americans currently have scored one more goal than they have conceded. The Portuguese, meanwhile, have let in four more goals than they've scored. Portugal would need a big victory or an especially heavy U.S. defeat to tip the goal difference to their advantage. 'We have to make it' If Ghana beats Portugal, the margins are a lot slimmer. Ghana currently has a negative goal difference of just one. So if Ghana wins by more than one goal, and the United States loses by one or more goals, Ghana would snatch second place. It's all complicated math. But Klinsmann appears determined to make sure there isn't a need for it. ""So we didn't make it quite yet,"" he told ESPN. ""We have to make it against Germany.""

"(CNN) -- Luis Suarez leading Uruguay to a late victory over England grabbed headlines on the eighth day of World Cup group play, but before that match began another team had an arguably more important victory. Colombia's 2-1 defeat of Ivory Coast means that the South Americans will definitely go through to the knockout stage of the competition, regardless of the results of their final group match next week, against Japan. Colombia becomes the third team guaranteed to go through. Through: . Netherlands . Chile . Colombia . There are also three teams that definitely cannot qualify for the knockout stage. Defending champs Spain are the highest-profile early casualty, but they're not alone. Out: . Spain . Australia . Cameroon . Beyond that, things get more complicated. Friday sees four teams trying to book a place in the knockout stage, as Italy face Costa Rica and France play Switzerland. All four teams won their first match. Remember, a team gets three points for a win and one for a draw. If two teams have the same number of points, the one with the greater goal difference is ahead, so -- for example -- Costa Rica's 3-1 victory over Uruguay puts them at the top of Group D, while Italy's 2-1 victory over England is good enough for second. In theory, any of those four teams can still go through at this point, which is why Italy's Mario Balotelli said he wants a kiss (on the cheek) from the Queen if his side beats Costa Rica -- that would keep England's chances alive, if slim. It may not be a surprise that Group D is turning into the most complex battle so far. Its teams are, as a whole, the highest ranking in the World Cup, with Uruguay ranked seventh in the world, Italy ninth, England 10th and Costa Rica 28th. The France-Switzerland match for the top of Group E is more likely to produce a group leader. Each team won their first match and has three points, so a draw will mean each has four and a victory for either side will give them six. The other two teams in the group, Ecuador and Honduras, both lost their first matches and have no points, so they both have to fight for a big win to have much hope of going through. If they draw, they get one point each and would only go through if either France or Switzerland win tonight, and the winner of the Ecuador-Honduras match also wins big in their last match of the group.

Nikolic came under fire last year short after he was elected by declaring, according to published reports, there was no ""genocide"" in Srebrenica. He has since been urged by Bosnian leaders to acknowledge the killings, which the prosecutors at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have described as a systematic extermination. Over a period of five days in July 1995, the Bosnian Serb army conducted a brutal takeover of the town. About 8,000 men and boys were rounded up and killed, with many buried in mass graves. At the time of the massacre, Srebrenica had been designated a U.N. ""safe area"" for people, predominantly Bosnian Muslims, trying to escape the advancing Bosnian Serb army. The people of Srebrenica, which sits a short distance from the Serbian border, were protected by just 100 lightly equipped Dutch peacekeepers. Without reinforcements, the Dutch were forced to stand aside while Serb troops took the town. Then-Bosnian Serb commander-in-chief Gen. Ratko Mladic -- now on trial on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity -- allegedly told one woman everyone taken out of Srebrenica would be reunited with their loved ones, according to Serbian TV footage previously shown in court. Truckloads of men and boys were taken from Srebrenica to execution sites where they were bound, blindfolded, and shot with automatic rifles, prosecutors contend. In the aftermath of the massacre, the United Nations gave NATO the authority to launch large-scale airstrikes against Serb targets, a move that eventually forced the Serbs to the negotiating table.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- The National Security Agency's controversial intelligence-gathering programs have prevented 54 terrorist attacks around the world, including 13 in the United States, according to Gen. Keith Alexander, NSA director. Speaking before a capacity crowd of hackers and security experts Wednesday at the Black Hat computer-security conference, Alexander defended the NSA's embattled programs, which collect phone metadata and online communications in an effort to root out potential terrorists. The secret programs have come under fire since their existence was revealed in June by former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked details about them to several newspapers. ""I promise you the truth -- what we know, what we're doing, and what I cannot tell you because we don't want to jeopardize our future defense,"" Alexander told the audience, which included a few hecklers who shouted profanities and accused him of lying. He then gave a partial recap, using PowerPoint slides, of how the two intelligence programs work. Alexander said the NSA can collect metadata on phone calls in the United States, including the date and time of the call, the numbers involved and the length of the conversations. He made a special point of saying the NSA does not have access to the content of citizens' calls or text messages. Top senator questions need to collect phone records . Alexander said the NSA's PRISM surveillance program, which probes digital activity such as e-mail, instant messaging and Web searches, focuses on foreign actors and does not apply to people in the United States. He said the phone and Internet data is necessary to ""connect the dots"" and identify potential terrorists before they act. Alexander attempted to reassure the audience that NSA officials are not abusing access to the databases to intrude on Americans' privacy. ""The assumption is that people are out there just wheeling and dealing (users' information), and nothing could be further from the truth,"" he said. ""We have tremendous oversight and compliance in these programs."" Congress and courts make sure the programs operate within the bounds of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and internal auditing systems are in place to prevent any abuse by employees, Alexander said. He added that only 35 analysts are authorized to run queries on the phone metadata. Alexander made no mention of a report in Wednesday's Guardian newspaper about the existence of another secret NSA program, called XKeyscore. According to documents provided to the Guardian by Snowden, XKeyscore allows analysts to search with no prior authorization through vast databases containing e-mails, online chats and the browsing histories of millions of people. CNNMoney: NSA chief to hackers: If you don't like what we do, change it . Alexander denied accusations that the NSA programs allow the government to collect all online data on everyone. ""We can't afford to and don't want to collect everything,"" he said. ""I have four daughters. Can I go and intercept their e-mails? The answer is no,"" said the security chief before looking out at the auditorium thick with hackers and joking, ""You may be able to."" Aside from a couple jokes, Alexander's words were serious and measured, and he seemed unfazed by a smattering of heckling from the audience during his hourlong talk. Ex-NSA chief: Safeguards exist to protect Americans' privacy . ""You lied to Congress. Why would we believe you're not lying to us right now?"" yelled one person. Alexander replied that people were basing opinions on what was ""written in the press"" without looking at facts and urged the heckler read his congressional testimony. During a Q&A session consisting of prescreened questions, Alexander said that one reason terrorists target the United States is a desire by people in the Middle East to run governments under Islamic law. But another attendee disagreed, shouting, ""They want to attack us because we're bombing them."" Another yell of ""bulls---!"" inspired the general to cap his explanation of the programs by saying ""And that's no bulls---, those are facts."" Overall, the reception to Alexander's talk seemed mostly positive. Black Hat attendees are primarily corporate-security types, interested in protecting their networks and warding off cyber attacks. The looser, hacker-centric Def Con conference, which starts here Thursday, could likely give him a more hostile reception. Alexander solicited advice on how to better balance security with civil liberties and put up an e-mail address so the room of tech experts could share their ideas with the NSA. He also hinted at possible damage resulting from the Snowden leaks, and wondered aloud whether the government will have the same success preventing terrorist attacks in the next 10 years as it has in the past decade. ""If we tell everyone exactly what we're doing, then the adversaries will know exactly how to get through our defenses,"" he said.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kelley Mulfinger thought she would be making a six-figure salary in marketing by her second year out of school. Instead, the University of Virginia alum is teaching a classroom of first-graders how to spell words like ""care."" Kelley Mulfinger says teaching has provided her with job security and a strong sense of purpose. Mulfinger is one of many recent graduates who are turning to lower paying jobs with the help of national service organizations such as Teach for America as the conventional job market shrinks. The 24-year-old signed on to become a teacher in Atlanta, Georgia, two years ago when she couldn't find a job that excited her. Now, faced with even bleaker job prospects, she just renewed her contract. Mulfinger says being a teacher means more to her than just having security. ""With the economy the way that it is, I look around and I see my peers losing their jobs or scared for their jobs and it's really made me reflect on my last two years and how much I've enjoyed the ability to make an impact every single day,"" she said.  Watch Mulfinger talk about what teaching means to her » . Teach for America received a record number of more than 35,000 applications in 2009, up 42 percent from last year, spokeswoman Rhonda Stewart said. Stewart attributes the increase in applicants to ""a growing interest in public service"" and ""an economy that's encouraging people to re-evaluate and pursue meaningful careers where they can have an impact right out of college.""  See more stories from recent grads who are turning to national service » . Smaller nonprofits also appear to be benefiting from the sudden availability of skilled labor. Jonathan Olinger, founder of Discover the Journey, a nonprofit that uses film to draw awareness to children living in crisis, said the economic downturn has proved to be an ""odd but effective motivator"" for people to turn to volunteerism. ""Highly skilled people who had been laid off from their jobs in the for-profit sector have been volunteering for us in their new-found time,"" he said. ""[It's a] validating excuse to finally follow their passion, live a life of purpose and step into something larger than themselves through serving."" AmeriCorps, an independent federal agency that places adults in jobs with local and national nonprofit groups, also says it has seen a 400 percent increase in applications in the past four months. Supporters of AmeriCorps say the experience provides job seekers with benefits including health care and money to help pay off student loans while they give back to their communities. ""National service is a cost-effective, empowering way for citizens to build an America they can be proud of,"" said former AmeriCorps volunteer Matt Wilhelm, who parlayed his stint as a volunteer into a full-time job with Calling All Crows, a nonprofit that uses the live musicians to promote human rights. President Obama's call to service has buoyed nonprofits and service organizations, whose operating budgets have also suffered the effects of the shrinking economy. Such organizations also stand to benefit significantly from legislation passed in the Senate and House to expand funding and incentives for national service programs. The legislation will affect national service programs administered by the federal agency of the Corporation for National and Community Service, more than tripling the number of positions in the AmeriCorps program from 75,000 to 250,000, for one. The legislation will also develop new positions in the areas of education, clean energy, health care and veteran affairs and create more financial incentives for potential applicants. The bill -- recently renamed The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act -- passed the House by a vote of 275-149 on Tuesday. It is awaiting approval from Obama, who has vowed to sign it. Democrats supported it almost unanimously; a strong majority of Republicans were opposed. Critics contend the bill is fiscally irresponsible in light of the current economic downturn. They also argue that the concept of volunteerism is undermined by providing financial compensation for community service. ""With the enactment of the landmark Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act legislation, millions of Americans of all ages will be able to serve to address their local community's most pressing needs,"" said Michelle Nunn, CEO of the Points of Light Institute and co-founder of the HandsOn Network, an organization that connects people with volunteer and paid opportunities in community service nationwide. ""The Volunteer Generation Fund provision of this new law will open pathways for organizations like HandsOn Network to apply for funds to train, equip and mobilize our greatest national resource -- our volunteers.""","So far this year, applications for Teach for America are up 42 percent from 2008 .

"(CNN) -- Wanted: Patient person. Physically fit, with basic knowledge of biology. Able to take pictures. Job: Find Bigfoot. Scientists in China's Hubei Province have announced they are looking for additional members for its special team tasked with tracking down the creature. The Hubei Wild Man Research Association (HWMRA) is recruiting researchers internationally to join the group's search in the Shennongjia forest region, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Luo Baosheng, vice president of the HWMRA, told Xinhua that the organization is comprised of more than 100 scientists and explorers who have been chasing the ape-like animal for years. The last time a organized search took place was in the early 1980s, Xinhua reported Saturday. ""Most importantly, we want the team members to be devoted, as there will be a lot of hard work in the process,"" Luo told Xinhua. Team members are also expected to be in good physical health and preferably 25 to 40 years of age, he added. The search for the phantom, known as the ""Yeren"" or ""Wild Man"" in China, will cost at least $1.5 million U.S. dollars, according to Wang Shancai, a member of the the group and an archaeologist with the Hubei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology. The group is seeking funding from various companies and institutions, Wang said. Chinese researchers have been searching since the 1970s. There have been more than 400 reported sightings of the half-man, half-ape in the Shennongjia area. In the past, explorers have found inconclusive evidence that researchers claimed to be proof of Bigfoot's existence, including hair, footprints, excrement and a sleeping nest, Xinhua reported. Witnesses say the creature walks upright like a human but is much taller, and is covered in hair head-to-toe. The search for Yeti is not restricted to China. People in the United States have been looking for years. The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) claims it's the oldest and largest organization with the goal of finding Bigfoot, also known as Sasquatch. The organization relies heavily on eyewitness reports from residents. According to BFRO's website, the animal began to be referred to as Bigfoot by journalists in the 1950s after a spat of sightings reported in northern California.","Chinese launching new search for Bigfoot .

"(CNN) -- A powwow-themed party that critics called a ""perfect storm of bad stereotypes"" has led to collaboration between Paul Frank Industries and Native American designers on a new line of clothing and accessories. Pictures from the September event ""Dream Catchin with Paul Frank"" traveled fast, showing guests, including singer Christina Milian, in neon headbands, feathers and war paint, sipping drinks with names like Rain Dance Refresher and Neon Teepee. The Native American community and others criticized the brand for hosting a party that encouraged guests to ""play Indian"" and misuse symbols of their culture. Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin' and headdresses . ""Your event stereotypes and demeans Native cultures, collapsing hundreds of distinct tribal and cultural groups into one 'tribal' mish-mash, thereby erasing our individual identities and contemporary existence,"" Native American blogger Adrienne Keene said in an open letter to Paul Frank LA and Red Light PR on her blog, Native Appropriations. Jessica Metcalfe of the Native fashion blog, Beyond Buckskin, said her initial reaction was shock and disbelief that this level of ignorance occurred at such a highly publicized event. She also demanded an apology from Paul Frank in an open letter on her blog. Paul Frank's Facebook page was flooded with comments deriding the party, prompting the company to issue an apology. Elie Dekel, President of Saban Brands, which owns Paul Frank Industries, also reached out to Metcalfe and Keene to apologize for the brand's misrepresentation of Native American culture. Several conversations among Metcalfe, Keene and Dekel led to a solution that would make up for the brand's mistake and shine light on an underrepresented culture, Dekel said. Native American mascots: Pride or prejudice? ""This is an opportunity to undo a wrong but also celebrate what we always wanted to celebrate,"" Dekel said. Metcalfe and Keene connected the brand with four Native American artists to help design the limited edition line of clothing and accessories. The ""Paul Frank Presents"" fashion collaboration will debut in August at an event during the Santa Fe Indian Market in New Mexico, the year's biggest celebration of contemporary Native arts and culture. No prices or images of the designs have been released yet. Louie Gong, a designer from the Nooksack tribe, will create a tote bag for the line. Gong says his work usually consists of designs on utilitarian items like custom shoes, T-shirts and bags. ""It's important to recognize that Native Americans are alive and around,"" says Gong. ""Subconsciously, people think we aren't around so we don't have a voice."" Dustin Martin from the Navajo tribe will design graphic T-shirts incorporating Native imagery with the iconic Paul Frank character, Julius the Monkey. ""Point lips, not fingers"" will be the theme of his screen print T-shirts, Martin said. The phrase, which is inspired by a Navajo belief that it's rude to point fingers, reflects how the collaboration came about, he said. The Native community, led by bloggers Metcalfe and Keene, ""pointed their lips toward Paul Frank"" and pushed them in the direction toward collaboration, he said. ""The ultimate product is that we aren't just pushing the blame, but giving direction in the right way,"" he said. ""Despite whatever comes out about the bad blood that started the collaboration, it's helped me grow as a professional and artist,"" Martin said. ""I really do think they are trying to set a good example.""","Paul Frank hosted a party last year that many deemed offensive to Native Americans .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is expected to push for reforms in how teachers are taught when he speaks at Teachers College at Columbia University in New York on Thursday. Education Secretary Arne Duncan is expected to say colleges profit from education schools but reinvest little. According to advanced quotes released by the U.S. Department of Education, he will say that ""schools, colleges and departments of education are doing a mediocre job of preparing teachers for the realities of the 21st-century classroom."" He will call for a ""revolutionary"" change in teacher preparation programs. Duncan estimates that about 200,000 new teachers will enter U.S. school systems annually. ""Schools of education have been renowned for being cash cows for universities,"" Duncan will say, according to his released remarks. ""The large enrollment in education schools and their relatively low overhead have made them profit centers."" Duncan will say that universities divert the profits from education schools to other departments while doing little to invest in educational research and clinical training. Duncan has focused on teacher accountability since he took office in January. Under the criteria to receive stimulus money under the Department of Education's Race to the Top program, states that link student achievement data to teacher evaluations will be rewarded. Several states, including California, have removed laws that made such links illegal.","Duncan to say colleges have done ""mediocre job"" of preparing teachers .

"PERUGIA, Italy (CNN) -- A judge was considering Monday whether to grant a request for a fresh autopsy on the body of the British student Meredith Kercher, killed in the Italian city of Perugia. Meredith Kercher was found dead in her villa November 2 with a knife wound to her neck. Kercher's corpse is still being held in a morgue in Britain as her family awaits permission to bury the 21-year-old who bled to death after she was stabbed in her bed. The request was received from the lawyers of Patrick Lumumba, one of the four suspects identified by Italian police. Carlo Pacelli, a lawyer for Lumumba - who was released by Italian police last week but still remains a suspect in the killing - said they wanted to establish more closely the time of death of the victim. The decision on a second autopsy is expected some time Tuesday, Francesco Marasco, the Kercher family's lawyer, told reporters in Perugia Monday. Marasco told CNN that Italian investigators would travel to London to carry out a second autopsy if it was granted. Kercher, an exchange student at Perugia's university, was killed late on November 1 in the villa where she lived, according to police. Investigators found her the next day, half-naked, with a stab wound to her neck. A report issued more than a week ago by an Italian judge suggested she may have been sexually assaulted at knifepoint before she was killed in her bed. The original post-mortem put the time of death at between 10 p.m. and midnight, according to a report from Perugia's prosecutor general Claudia Matteini. However, Matteini said that Kercher probably suffered a ""very slow agony"" as she bled to death and that the wound could have been inflicted as early as 8:30 p.m. and that she could have died at any time up to 11:30 p.m. Lumumba, a Congolese bar owner, says he has a solid alibi for the time of the killing, according to his lawyers. The autopsy request came a day after the latest suspect in the case, Rudy Hermann Guede, 20, claimed that an unidentified assailant attacked the British student, his lawyer told CNN Sunday. Guede has already admitted being in Kercher's home the night she was killed, but denies any involvement in her death, his lawyer, Walter Biscotti, told CNN. Last week, investigators said DNA on a vaginal swab taken from Kercher matched Guede's DNA, indicating the two had sex. Italian police say that they have connected Guede to a bloody fingerprint on a pillow at the crime scene, and that DNA tests on skin cells found on toilet paper there have linked him to the villa. The suspect, arrested last week after fleeing to Germany, claimed he was in the bathroom when he heard Kercher screaming from the bedroom, Biscotti said. He claimed he saw a person, whom he describes as ""the killer,"" outside the bedroom door, and that when he went to help the victim she whispered ""A.F"" into his ear, his lawyer said. Guede tried to confront the person, but the assailant ran away, according to Biscotti. His lawyer said Guede denies that he and Kercher slept together. Media reports in Italy and Britain say police are looking at the possibility of a fifth suspect involved in the killing following Guede's claims. But a source in the prosecutor's office in Perugia told CNN that no fifth suspect was being sought in connection with the killing. Guede is the only suspect to have acknowledged having been in Kercher's villa the night she died. He is expected to be extradited in the next 10 to 15 days on suspicion of murder and sexual assault. In addition to Guede, two other suspects remain in custody in connection with the killing: Amanda Knox, 20, Kercher's roommate, and Knox's boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, 23. A source in the prosecutor's office said forensic police will return to the villa before Friday's court hearing to determine whether Solliceto and Knox should continue to be held by police. The source said forensics investigators had discovered impressions on the victim's bra, which was found near her body, and were trying to determine if the impressions are fingerprints. According to a report in the Italian daily newspaper Corriere della Sera Saturday, Sollecito said in a statement to police that Knox lived in a dream world but said she was not a murderer. ""She lives life as if it is a dream, she's out of touch with reality. But from here to even just imagining that she is a murderer, it becomes impossible,"" the newspaper reported Sollecito as saying. Knox, from Seattle, has told police that she is unclear about what took place on the night of Kercher's death. Even the American's lawyer has admitted he was confused by his client's testimony. Both Knox and Sollecito deny any involvement in the killing. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Italy's supreme court on Tuesday explained its earlier ruling that American Amanda Knox be retried in the 2007 death of her roommate, saying the jury that acquitted her didn't consider all the evidence, and that discrepancies in testimony need to be answered. The high court also said evidence could support prosecutors' initial argument -- that Meredith Kercher was killed in a twisted sex misadventure game at Kercher and Knox's home in Italy, the high court said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. The appeals court jury that acquitted Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in 2011 ""neglected significant evidence"" and theories, the high court said in a 74-page explanation. Knox and Sollecito's retrial, which could start as soon as the fall, should examine discrepancies in testimony, the high court said. These include differing witness accounts of when screaming could be heard from the home, ANSA reported. The high court overturned the acquittals in March, but withheld its full reasoning until Tuesday. Kercher, a 21-year-old British exchange student, was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa she rented with Knox, then 20, in the central Italian university town of Perugia. Knox: Sometimes I can't stop crying . Knox and Sollecito were arrested that year and convicted in 2009 of murder in Kercher's death, but the jury overturned the conviction in 2011. Knox then returned to her home city of Seattle, Washington. In legal paperwork published in December 2011, the judge in the case wrote that the jury had cleared the pair of murder for lack of evidence proving they were guilty. Another man, Ivorian drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted separately of Kercher's killing. Guede admitted having sexual relations with Kercher but denied killing her. Francesco Maresca, attorney for Kercher's family, appeared satisfied after reading the high court's reasoning Tuesday. The ruling ""represents a very harsh judgment of the appeal trial,"" Maresca said. An attorney for Knox said that he respects the ruling but he doesn't agree with it. The high court, he said, was supposed to consider only the legitimacy of the appeal but instead attempted to re-examine the whole case. ""This means that we are going to do again a trial that has already been done, a trial in which there is no clear evidence,"" attorney Carlo Della Vedova said. Knox may be ordered to return to Italy for the retrial. If she refuses, the Italian government could appeal to the U.S. government for her extradition. But even if it does, it's not clear whether the United States would extradite her. When asked Tuesday if Knox would return to Italy to face the new trial, Della Vedova replied: ""Would you send your kid back?""","Italian high court: Evidence could support a sex-game theory .

"(CNN) -- A ban on polio vaccinations imposed by the Taliban could affect about 280,000 children living in tribal areas of northwest Pakistan, according to estimates from the World Health Organization. Last month, local Taliban militants prohibited polio vaccines over the United States' use of drone strikes in the region. When a three-day nationwide effort to administer polio vaccines began this week,health workers and volunteers weren't able to immunize children in North and South Waziristan. Time: Why the CIA's vaccine ruse is a setback for global health . Under this security situation, they ""obviously cannot operate,"" said Mazhar Nisar, the health education adviser in the Pakistani prime minister's polio program. ""We're hoping that the campaign will resume in the near future."" Throughout the rest of the country, vaccination efforts continued as 180,000 health workers and volunteers fanned throughout communities trying to immunize 34 million children, under the age of 5. The vaccine ban began in June after a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan declared in a statement that the vaccines ""would be banned in North Waziristan until the drones strikes are stopped."" The commander, Hafiz Gul Bahadur said that the drone strikes ""are worse than polio,"" and consulted with other Taliban leaders regarding the decision, according to the statement. Drone strikes are widely unpopular, as the Pakistani government has pressed the U.S. administration to stop the attacks. 20 dead in drone attack in Pakistan . Pakistan remains one of the three countries in the world grappling with polio. The country has had 22 reported cases this year. The other two countries are Afghanistan with 11 cases and Nigeria with 54. Polio is highly contagious and can cause paralysis, breathing problems, deformities and death. There is no cure for polio, so the focus lies on vaccines to prevent the disease. The vaccine is administered orally, and in multiple doses to achieve full immunity. Pakistan's tribal regions are areas where polio is known to be active, according to disease data. Global health within our grasp, if we don't give up . ""In a situation like this, any child who has not been administered for polio vaccine remains at risk,"" Nisar said. Vaccination points have been set up in the entry and exit points to the tribal areas, he added. The WHO, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and Rotary International have a joint polio eradication campaign. Read about a WHO doctor attacked during a polio campaign . ""Our concern is reaching every single child possible,"" said Michael Coleman, a communication specialist for UNICEF and polio. ""Where there are limitations presented, it's a concern."" To date, Pakistan ""has had real progresses,"" said Coleman. ""People are being reached, we need to be keeping that momentum up."" This is not the first time that Pakistan's polio campaign has made headlines. Last year, a Pakistani doctor was linked to a CIA operation to verify Osama bin Laden's whereabouts with a door-to-door vaccination campaign in the town of Abbottabad, where the al Qaeda leader was hiding before he was killed. U.S. officials have said the plan did not work, but aid groups and Pakistani health officials have said the CIA's alleged meddling with a vaccination campaign undermined Pakistan's efforts to eradicate polio. Bin Laden raid harms Pakistan polio fight . The ban on the polio vaccine has drawn criticism. ""Proscribing inoculation merely because some score is to be settled with the U.S. or the government is again an act of extremist proportions that would earn the Taliban more public anger,"" stated an editorial from The Nation, a Pakistani newspaper. Nisar pointed out that both Western and Islamic countries have eradicated polio through vaccines. ""There is no reason why Pakistan cannot do it,"" he said. ""This message needs to be disseminated, it needs to be reinforced. This is a campaign which saves the children from permanent disability.

"(CNN) -- She is poised to become one of the world's most powerful women, joining an elite club of fellow female trailblazers including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff. But when President Obama announced his nominee for the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve last October, few outside the financial world had heard of Janet Yellen. Serving as the current deputy to Ben Bernanke for the past three years, the Senate confirmed Yellen's nomination Monday. CNN takes a look at the woman who will serve as first female chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, the world's most powerful central bank, when Bernanke steps down at the end of the month. Backed by experience . A native of Brooklyn, New York, the 67-year-old economist has an impressive academic career coupled with extensive experience as a public servant. ""She is a proven leader because she's tough ... Janet is exceptionally well qualified for this role,"" Obama told reporters in October. ""She's served in leadership positions in the Fed for more than a decade."" After Yellen earned her B.A. in Economics with the highest distinction from Brown University, she went on to Yale where she received her doctorate in 1971. Her years in academia also saw her take on an assistant professor role at Harvard, a lecturer at the London School of Economics and Political Science followed by 26 years as a professor at University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Economics in the family . Away from her role at the central bank, Yellen's family is also closely tied to the world of economics. She met her husband, Nobel Prize recipient George Akerlof, while they were both working at the Federal Reserve in 1977. Meanwhile their son, Robert is an assistant professor in Economics at the University of Warwick in England. Communication is key . When then-President Clinton appointed her to chair his Council of Economic Advisers in 1997, he said: ""She is an esteemed writer and thinker who will serve our country well."" While today she speaks primarily on economic policy, Yellen was, in fact, the editor in chief of her high school paper, 'The Pilot.' As The New York Times reported, in order to maintain the school's tradition of having the editor interview the valedictorian, in 1963 Yellen delightfully interviewed herself. Finance is a small world . Her closest rival for the nomination was former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers -- who she taught macroeconomics to in 1976 -- but he withdrew his name from consideration last month amid mounting press coverage. Yellen has been widely welcomed by the markets and fellow economists, 300 of which had previously signed an open letter urging the U.S. president to nominate the New York native. Two steps ahead . During Obama's nomination announcement to appoint Yellen, he praised her good judgment and understanding of how the markets work while also highlighting some of the economic issues she has foreseen.

The 24-hour-a-day, 7-days-a-week hotline is part of a ""broader effort to improve our immigration enforcement process and prioritize resources to focus on threats to public safety, (on) repeat immigration law violators, recent border entrants, and immigration fugitives while continuing to strengthen oversight of the nation's immigration detention system and facilitate legal immigration,"" a news release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said. The new measure was launched by the Department of Homeland Security to ensure detained individuals ""are made aware of their rights"" or ""properly notified about their potential removal from the country,"" according to the release. The hotline number is 855-448-6903. A new ""detainer"" form -- which includes Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese and Vietnamese translations -- also is part of the new policy. The detainer -- or notice to detain -- form is official paperwork giving law enforcement the authority to hold a person in custody for a time. Administration to lower number of troops on Southwest border . ""The new form allows ICE to make the detainer operative only upon the individual's conviction of the offense for which he or she was arrested,"" the release said. Immigration rights advocates told CNN there ""has long been a need for more accountability and oversight of the issuance of immigration detainers."" ""The ACLU and other advocates identified four native-born U.S. citizens who were held unlawfully in custody through immigration detainers in Los Angeles County. One of these citizens was held for two days because of an immigration detainer despite repeatedly telling officers that he was a U.S. citizen,"" Laura Vazquez, immigration legislative analyst for the National Council of La Raza, told CNN in a statement. The council is a national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization. CNN attempted to get reaction on the new policy from the attorneys general in Alabama and Arizona -- two states viewed as having among the most strict immigration reform laws -- but were unsuccessful. An official in the Alabama attorney general's office said Thursday officials had no comment. The move by DHS comes just before the beginning of the new year, when new immigration laws in Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia will require businesses to enroll in the federal E-Verify program to ensure employees are eligible to work in the United States, according National Conference of State Legislatures. E-Verify is a controversial program designed to check a prospective employee's citizenship or immigration status. Supporters say it helps businesses avoid unintentionally hiring illegal immigrants. Critics complain that it is expensive to operate, pushes undocumented workers further underground, and is not always accurate.

"(CNN) -- If you are a coffee lover you might be tempted to pay for a cup of the most expensive coffee in the world. Indonesia's velvety tasting brew, Kopi Luwak, gives new meaning to rich coffee. It can cost up to $50 per cup. ""The supply is very limited in the world that makes the price is very expensive,"" Kopi Luwak brand managing director Henry Fernando said. The reason the supply is limited has to do with how the beans are initially processed. Just a warning here, it isn't pretty. Kopi means coffee in Indonesian and Luwak is a wild Asian palm civet, a fury creature that looks like a cross between a cat and a ferret. The civet climbs the coffee trees to find the best berries, eats them, digests the berries and eventually out comes the coffee beans in its stools. Farmers then pick up the civet droppings and take the beans to a processing plant. Something about the gastric juices in the civet's stomach gives Kopi Luwak its unique flavor. ""I do like it. Compared to other kinds of coffee, it has a more distinctive coffee taste and aroma,"" customer Yotje Hartono said as he sipped his coffee after watching the ritual of making a cup of the expensive brew. At a Kopi Luwak Café in Jakarta the staff brings out a gold-lined cup, a hot thermos of water and vacuum packed sealed package of the Kopi Luwak. The package is opened and poured into the cup and then the hot water is poured in. It is stirred and then covered. You have to wait two minutes before sipping it. When I first saw it being made I recoiled. I thought: ""I'm paying all this money for instant coffee, no way!"" But after taking the first sip I felt a little better. It is very smooth with hints of chocolate and caramel flavors and it doesn't have that acidic aftertaste that coffee sometimes does. For years it has been more popular overseas than in Indonesia but that is fast changing as the economy in the country continues to grow at a rate far faster than those in the west. ""We opened Kopi Luwak Café in 2002 and already have 20 stores,"" Fernando said. It has become even more popular around the world after it was featured on ""Oprah"" and in the Hollywood movie ""The Bucket List"" where Jack Nicholson's character was obsessed with it (not knowing of course what made it so special until the end). Kopi Luwak's growing popularity and the way its made has run into trouble. It has been given some nasty names such as ""crappuccino"" and inspired two of Indonesia¹s main Muslim organizations to consider putting a fatwa on it because the process appeared to be ritually unclean. But that all changed, Fernando said, after a bit of explanation about the bean when it is excreted. ""It still has the skin, inner layer. And we do the cleansing process, before we do processing and roasting. It's not a problem. And now, the Kopi Luwak is certified Halal,"" he said. And it is being enjoyed for a heck of a lot less in its home country than elsewhere. A cup costs about $8 in Indonesia as opposed to up to $50 in other countries. ""I feel it's the type of thing you have to do once at least,"" an American customer who happened to visiting Indonesia said.","Kopi Luwak is the world's most expensive coffee .

"(CNN) -- Add Superman to the list of reporters leaving the newspaper business behind. In the comic book series' latest issue, which went on sale Wednesday, an outraged Clark Kent quits his job at The Daily Planet after his boss berates him. ""I was taught to believe you could use words to change the course of rivers -- that even the darkest secrets would fall under the harsh light of the sun,"" the superhero's alter ego says in a newsroom outburst. ""But facts have been replaced by opinions. Information has been replaced by entertainment. Reporters have become stenographers. I can't be the only one who's sick of what passes for the news today."" In Wednesday's issue, Kent tells his editor he's been a journalist for barely five years. But for decades, his job as a reporter at The Daily Planet has been a mainstay of Superman's story. Word of the superhero's career move drew attention from media critics and others who've watched the newspaper industry's struggles. ""It seems very overly dramatic,"" said Erica Smith, a former newspaper employee who's tracked U.S. newspaper industry layoffs and buyouts on her Paper Cuts blog since 2007. ""It doesn't seem to me to fit either the industry or the character."" If he'd been laid off or taken a buyout, like more than 2,000 others in the U.S. newspaper industry this year, ""it would have been a little bit more realistic,"" Smith said with a laugh. The proportion of Americans who read news on a printed page is declining, according to the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. The center said in a September study that just 23% of those surveyed said they read a print newspaper the previous day -- an 18 percentage point decrease over the past decade. But online and digital readership is growing, the study said. And it may be that the Man of Steel, when he's not flying faster than a speeding bullet or leaping tall buildings in a single bound, is taking note. A spokesman for DC Entertainment, which is also owned by CNN's parent company Time Warner, said the comic book's writer was not available for comment. In an interview with USA Today this week, writer Scott Lobdell said Kent is much more likely to start his own blog than he is to search for new work in the news business. ""I don't think he's going to be filling out an application anywhere,"" Lobdell said. ""He is more likely to start the next Huffington Post or the next Drudge Report than he is to go find someone else to get assignments or draw a paycheck from.""","NEW: It would have been more realistic if he'd been laid off, blogger quips .

"(CNN) -- Jovan Belcher had been a success story, an underdog done good. An undrafted free agent from the fringes of the college football universe, he not only made the Kansas City Chiefs' roster, he made his mark -- playing every game since 2009, rising from special teams ace to starter, recording more and more tackles each season, and winning over teammates and fans along the way. On Saturday, it all came to a bloody end. Belcher first ended his girlfriend's life, police said, before taking his own just outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility. He and the woman he killed left behind a 3-month-old daughter. Why? That much no one knows or at least has said publicly, beyond that Belcher and his girlfriend had been fighting of late. ""I am devastated and heart broken,"" wrote Jeff Allen, one of several Kansas City players who took to Twitter to express their grief and astonishment. ""I'm sending prayers to everyone involved. Always show love and never be afraid to talk."" The first sign of trouble came around 7:50 a.m. (8:50 a.m. ET), when police in Kansas City, Missouri, got a call about a shooting. When officers arrived outside a split-level home in a middle-class neighborhood, a woman came out and told them a younger woman -- later identified as 22-year-old Kasandra Perkins -- ""had been shot by her boyfriend several times,"" said police spokesman Darin Snapp. About 20 minutes later, another call came into police. This one was from Arrowhead Stadium, the Chiefs' home, about ""a person who was in the parking lot, armed with a handgun."" Officers sped over and noticed a black man, talking to several coaches, and holding a gun to his head, Snapp said. ""As the officers pulled up and began to park, that's when they heard the gunshot."" The bullet went into Belcher's head, killing him. Opinion: Strong reactions on football player's murder-suicide . From the University of Maine to the NFL . The police spokesman initial didn't specify whom the linebacker was talking to before he fired that fatal shot. The league's website, NFL.com, reported one of them was the team's head coach, Romeo Crennel. Kansas City Mayor Sly James added that general manager Scott Pioli also witnessed the suicide. ""He knows all the players, he knows that particular player,"" James said of Pioli. ""He's very emotional about this."" What was known about Belcher, prior to Saturday's apparent murder-suicide, was that he came from Long Island, New York. He was a football standout and especially a star in the sport of wrestling, earning All-America honors in three of his four years at West Babylon High School. Belcher's next stop was the University of Maine. The school in Orono, in central Maine, is far from a college football hotbed. The Black Bears play in the Football Championship Subdivision, in the college sport's second tier. In these remote environs, the New York product started every game in four years before graduating with a degree in child development. Some projected him as a late-round pick entering the 2009 draft. That didn't happen. He did catch on with Kansas City as a free agent, though with no guarantees. But the 6-foot-2, 228-pound Belcher soon made an impression, leading the Chiefs with 17 special-teams tackles his rookie year. Over time, No. 59 emerged as a defense stalwart, starting 44 of the 59 games he played, including each one last season. ""One of everyone's favorite teammates including one of mine,"" Tony Moeaki remarked on Twitter after the news broke Saturday. ""Great great great teammate."" Opinion: Manhood, football and suicide . Despite deaths, Chiefs to play Sunday . Few, if any, know exactly why and how Belcher's story ended. But Snapp, the police spokesman, did offer clues. Prior to Saturday, Belcher's name had never come up with police, nor had officers ever been called to the residence where the first shooting occurred. But later they learned the football player and his late girlfriend ""had been arguing,"" including ""before the shooting occurred,"" said Snapp. Police arrived Saturday morning to find Perkins, who is originally from Texas, gravely wounded. Snapp said she was transported to a nearby hospital and ""died a short time later."" Sometime after that, Belcher drove about five miles northwest, to Arrowhead Stadium. He was armed, but never pointed the gun at anyone else -- instead thanking coaches for what they'd done for him, officials told CNN affiliate KCTV. ""The coaches said when he pulled up, they were never in danger. He never threatened them or anything,"" Snapp said. ""He talked for a little bit, and then he shot himself."" That gunshot ended Saturday's saga. It left the baby -- who was inside the Kansas City home, but in another room, when her mother was shot -- without a surviving parent, and she is now with relatives, Snapp said. The area around the stadium and the Chiefs' abutting practice facility shut down for about an hour after the second shooting. But it should be packed Sunday afternoon. The Chiefs, who were struggling mightily before this and sported a 1-10 record, will play the Carolina Panthers, as scheduled, the NFL announced. Kansas City's mayor said Saturday he hadn't given much thought over whether he felt the game should be canceled or go on. But he has no doubts where members of the Chiefs' organization stand. ""They think there should be a game tomorrow,"" James said. ""I think that they believe there is an obligation to the people of this city, the fans of the team, the fans of the other team to proceed and go forward.""

"(CNN) -- The number of unexplained dolphin deaths on Cape Cod, Massachusetts, rose Friday, with rescuers tallying the toll at 103. About 160 common dolphins have been found since the animals began stranding themselves in early January, said Michael Booth, a spokesman for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the organization leading the rescue the effort. The beachings have puzzled investigators, as rescue team members struggle to treat, tag and transport the living dolphins to the outer Cape Cod coast to be released. While dolphin strandings are not uncommon on the cape, Katie Moore, a marine manager for the group, said earlier this week the event is extraordinary in its ""protracted"" nature as well as the number of dolphins involved. ""There is a large variability year to year,"" she said, but this event represents ""more than half my annual average in a month,"" said Moore. Once beached, a dolphin is vulnerable to predators and susceptible to organ damage and sunburn. If a dolphin is still alive, the responders get it onto its stomach, if it is not already, for easier breathing. They keep away seagulls that would otherwise peck at it and warm it with blankets or cool it with water as necessary, Moore said. Necropsies had been performed on at least nine of the dolphins, and blood and microbial swab samples have been taken from some that were found alive, Moore said. So far, no pattern of disease or trauma has been found that would point to a cause. Although the winter and early spring are the normal time of year for dolphin strandings to occur, the weather this season has been unusually warm, leading to speculation about climate change and subsequently low ""distribution of prey"" as possible causes. Wellfleet harbormaster Michael Flanagan had earlier explained that usually, in the winter, ""the harbor ices over and inhibits the animals from coming close to the shore. But now that the water is warmer, we're seeing lots more dolphins washing up than ever before."" Moore cautioned that, while climate or other external factors such as acoustic disorientation can't be ruled out, ""we don't have a single answer.""","103 dolphins die on Cape Cod, Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- The two little girls vanished nearly 40 years ago, their disappearance long faded from the public consciousness, their names etched in a stone marker their hope-sapped parents placed in a local cemetery. But Maryland police have been tenacious about solving this cold case. And on Tuesday they breathed new life into it, when they announced a possible breakthrough. Convicted sex offender Lloyd Lee Welch Jr., 57, who's been serving a prison sentence in Delaware since 1997, was near Sheila and Katherine Lyon on that March day in 1975 when they went missing, Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger told reporters Tuesday. Welch was at a plaza that was among the last places that the two girls were seen alive, and he was observed paying attention to the sisters, Manger said. He declined to state how police obtained this lead. Manger said that anyone who has information about Welch should call authorities. Police released photographs of him and his now-deceased girlfriend, Helen Craver, about whom police are also seeking information. ""We need to know more about his activities,"" Manger said. Welch, who also went by the name of Michael Welch or Mike Welch, worked as a ride operator for a carnival company that set up their attractions in malls around the country, Manger said. His girlfriend also worked at the carnival company. Welch has ""multiple convictions for sex offenses against young girls,"" Manger said. Investigators believe Welch may have been involved in other unsolved crimes around the country. He was also a drifter and sometimes stayed in homeless shelters, Manger said. Montgomery County police have stopped short of calling him a suspect in the two sisters' disappearance. The case faded from the headlines years ago. If they're alive, the women would be 48 and 50 years old now. After years of holding out hope, their parents gave up. Sixteen years ago, they set a marker for their daughters in a cemetery with their dates of birth and the date they went missing, the Washington Post reported. But the police department has not forgotten Sheila, who was 12, and Katherine, who was 10, the day their older brother, Jay Lyon, saw them last. Maybe, in part, that's because he joined the police force as a homicide detective just a few years after that. Taken: The coldest case ever solved . Walk to pizza parlor . The girls must have been full of anticipation when they decided to step out for some fun in their neighborhood not far from Washington, D.C. Their birthday dates were just one day apart, and celebrations were coming up in just a few days. It was also the first day of Easter school vacation. They walked half a mile to a nearby strip mall to check out the Easter decorations, the Montgomery Gazette reported. Their mother told them to be home by 4 p.m. At 7 p.m., police received a call reporting them missing, the privately run missing persons website CharleyProject.org reported. Police swarmed out looking for them and questioned passersby. A medley of witnesses said they'd seen the girls. One saw them walking to the shopping center. Another -- a child -- saw them talking to a stranger, a man holding a microphone and a briefcase. Police drew a composite of him based on the witness's description. But the girls walked away from him. An hour later, their brother Jay, 15 at the time, spotted them at the shopping center eating pizza. And after that, someone else saw them walking in the direction of their home, according to the CharleyProject description. Had they arrived, they would have made it home on time. Back then, it was common for children to walk to places in the neighborhood without their parents. But when the girls disappeared, that feeling of safety was shattered, the Gazette wrote. Now-dead convict likely linked to Florida woman's '89 disappearance . Celebrity case . The girls' father, John Lyon, was a well-known radio host in Bethesda at the time, so the story of his daughters' disappearance made the rounds.

The man called again, but when asked for evidence that he actually had the girls, he broke off contact. In the ensuing years, the tips faded. The case languished. Until Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Chris Stevens knew what he was getting into. He knew, longtime friend Daniel Seidemann said, that Libya was a place of great promise, but also one of great peril. ""When he went to Libya, he had no illusions about where he was going,"" Seidemann said. ""He has probably done more than anybody on the planet to help the Libyan people, and he know going in that this was not going to protect him."" U.S. Ambassador J.

""He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. ""The world needs more Chris Stevenses,"" Clinton said. Stevens graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1982, then took a pause in his studies to join the Peace Corps, according to his State Department biography. ""Growing up in California, I didn't know much about the Arab world,"" he said in a State Department video prepared to introduce him to the Libyan people after his appointment as ambassador in May.

He spent most of his career in the Middle East and North Africa, including postings to Israel, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, in addition to serving as the deputy chief of the U.S. mission to Libya from 2007 to 2009, during the rule of Moammar Gadhafi, according to the State Department.

""In the 36 years that I was privileged to be his stepfather, I never saw him lose his temper once,"" Commanday told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""And he was calm and easy and people loved him not only for that but because he didn't impose his ideas on them and he was interested in the persons he was talking to.""

Then, in 2011, as Libyans began to take up arms against the dictator, Clinton tapped him for another role. ""In the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition,"" Clinton said. ""He arrived on a cargo ship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya's revolutionaries."" ""He was seen as a popular, personable and hands-on diplomat among State Department staffers who knew him,"" said Elise Labott, a CNN foreign affairs reporter who knew Stevens. ""He wasn't a pinstripe diplomat. He wanted to get his hands dirty, dig in,"" she said. Commanday conveyed a similar impression, saying Stevens was ""very happy"" to get the post. ""He wasn't looking for a ... cushy ambassador's spot,"" he said. ""He loved the Libyan people and was passionate about helping.""

"(CNN) -- Do comedy writers share notes or do they just think alike? On the day ""Tonight Show"" host Jay Leno announced he was passing the baton to Jimmy Fallon, he and an old rival shared nearly identical jokes on their late night shows. In his opening monologue on Wednesday, Leno said it had been a tough day for him. ""Had a really awkward day today,"" the late night host said in mock anguish. ""Had to call David Letterman and tell him he didn't get 'The Tonight Show' ... again."" At nearly the same instant on the ""Late Show,"" Letterman addressed his rival's impending retirement. ""I got a call from my mom today, she says, 'Well, David, I see you didn't get the 'Tonight Show' again,'"" Letterman said with a shrug. ""What are you going to do, mom?"" he asked. A bit of comedy serendipity? Maybe it was just too tempting to pass up. Many expected Letterman would take over ""The Tonight Show"" when former host Johnny Carson retired in 1992, but the gig instead went to Leno. Letterman jumped networks to start ""The Late Show"" on CBS, which airs opposite Leno on NBC. How Twitter helped Fallon get Leno's job . Emotional Fallon . Fallon bounded onto his ""Late Night"" set, full of energy, if a bit manic, after word of his new job. ""Hello! Welcome! This is 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,' for now,"" he said to chuckles. ""You guys probably heard the news -- I'm going to be taking over 'The Tonight Show' next February! ""But don't worry, until February, our focus is right here on whatever this show is called."" Later, Fallon's voice cracked as he paused and struggled for words at times. ""I want to thank everyone here at 'Late Night.' The staff, the crew and, of course, The Roots,"" he said, referring to his late night band. ""I have to say thanks to Jay Leno for being so gracious. It means so much to me to have his support."" An hour earlier, Leno congratulated Fallon in his opening monologue, while taking another swipe at the NBC executives that are showing him the door. ""I just have one request of Jimmy. We've all fought, kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place, okay? Now we have to keep it there,"" he deadpanned. ""Jimmy don't let it slip into sixth. We're counting on you."" Leno will wrap up his 22-year run as host in spring 2014, with Fallon officially signing on as his replacement. On his Twitter account, Fallon said, ""Today was one of the most exciting days of my life."" Rumors have been swirling . The expectation that Leno would leave NBC's legendary late-night program has been building recently, and Fallon's appointment isn't surprising in the least. He's had a swift rise to ""Tonight's"" chair, having hosted ""Late Night"" for just four years, but Fallon's transition was treated as such a near certainty that both hosts worked the headlines into their nightly routines. While Fallon initially downplayed the rumors, Leno went after his employer on a regular basis. He compared NBC executives to snakes, joked about the network's sagging ratings and kidded that the rumored late-night shuffle was like NBC's version of March Madness. Monologue: Leno congratulates Fallon . Just two days before the big announcement, Fallon and Leno again made light of the reports with a parody of the song ""Tonight"" from the musical ""West Side Story."" With Leno's contract set to expire in fall 2014, industry observers said the move was only a matter of time. And this, says media reporter Bill Carter, was the right time. ""Jay told me that really the difference with this was he went along with it,"" said Carter, a New York Times reporter who wrote ""The War for Late Night: When Leno Went Early and Television Went Crazy"" -- a book that chronicles the last time Leno left ""Tonight."" ""He agrees with this. He's on board with this."" This has happened before . Leno first exited ""Tonight"" in 2009 after 17 years as host, passing the torch to Conan O'Brien, who was then the host of ""Late Night."" Leno was moved to prime time with his own program, ""The Jay Leno Show,"" that fall. But when that brought dismal ratings, NBC decided to put Leno back in charge of ""Tonight"" at the start of 2010, leaving O'Brien without a job. Despite his short stint on ""Tonight,"" O'Brien wished Fallon well. ""I want to congratulate Jimmy. That is a really fun gig. You laugh, but it really is,"" O'Brien said, trying to reassure the audience he wasn't being sarcastic. ""Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it. He's going to do a fantastic job."" After getting the boot from ""Tonight,"" the flame-haired comedian eventually moved to TBS to host his own show, ""Conan,"" in the 11 p.m. hour, but the entire scenario generated ill will toward Leno and NBC. (TBS shares a parent company with CNN.) Yet as the years went on, Leno has proved to be resilient. As NBC's prime-time ratings suffered, Leno's ""Tonight Show"" was still able to rise above the rest in its time slot. At the end of March, ""The Tonight Show"" hit a seven-week high in total viewers, with 3.52 million watching. However, NBC was said to be concerned about losing younger viewers to ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" was moved up to compete with Leno and David Letterman's ""Late Show"" at the beginning of 2013. ""The more time Jimmy Kimmel is in that slot, the more the young audience goes that way, the harder it is for (Fallon) to keep that audience,"" one source familiar with the network's thought process told The Hollywood Reporter in March. Changing states of comedy . With the change in hosts comes a change in locales. According to a statement from NBC, ""As part of the transition, 'The Tonight Show' will be returning to its original home in 30 Rock in New York"" from Leno's base of Los Angeles. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo praised the move, saying in a statement ""on behalf of all New Yorkers"" that he's ""pleased to welcome 'The Tonight Show' back to its first home."" When it began in 1954, the ""original 'Tonight Show' ushered in the modern era of television,"" Cuomo continued. ""It is only fitting that as 'The Tonight Show' returns to our state, it will be headlined by New York's own native son and resident, Jimmy Fallon."" Out with the old . At 62 years old, Leno represents a more traditional form of hosting, as he's known for his ""Las Vegas-style comedy,"" said The New York Times. Fallon, 38, regularly incorporates the Web and social media into his act, offering ""a more contemporary and varied brand of entertainment,"" the Times said. This changing of the guard is one of the most closely watched exercises in pop culture, especially as it takes place at one of TV's mainstay productions. Even with its decline in ratings over the years, it remains a solid profit center for NBC, making between $25 million and $40 million for the network, according to The New York Times. Although it's been on the air for almost 60 years, ""The Tonight Show"" has had just a handful of regular hosts: Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Leno and O'Brien. ""The Tonight Show"" isn't what it was during the long tenure of Carson, who hosted the show from 1962 until 1992. In those three-network times, Carson dominated late-night TV like nobody before or since. He dominated the ratings and routinely sat down challengers like so many duck targets at a carnival shooting gallery. Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett, Joan Rivers, Pat Sajak -- they all tried to dethrone the king, and they all came up short. Carson sat behind ""Tonight's"" desk for 30 years before passing the torch to Leno, and ""Johnny"" is still the model against whom all are measured. ""Late Night"" producer Lorne Michaels, who's now executive producer of ""The Tonight Show,"" has called Fallon ""the closest thing"" this generation has to Carson. It appears it's now time for Fallon to show and prove. CNN's Henry Hanks contributed to this report.","NEW: New York Times media reporter Bill Carter says Leno was ""on board with this""

"Washington (CNN) -- To veto or not to veto: It's up to Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. She must decide if she is going to sign into law legislation that would allow business owners, as long as they assert their religious beliefs, to deny service to gay and lesbian customers. If she approves it, the state could face litigation and a boycott, potentially harming Arizona's economy and tourism industry as well as next year's Super Bowl. Arizona lawmakers pass controversial anti-gay bill . Brewer told CNN her decision will come after she returns later this week to Arizona from Washington, where she has been attending the National Governors Association meetings. ""I have to look at what it says and what the law says and take that information and do the right thing,"" she told CNN. The bill was sent to Brewer on Monday and she has five days to sign it, veto it, or do nothing and it would become law. She has been a conservative champion for much of her five years in office. And if that's any indication, the measure could very well become law. But it's not that straightforward. Her conservative creds . As secretary of state, Brewer landed the gubernatorial gig in 2009 after previous Gov. Janet Napolitano left her job to head the Department of Homeland Security. Just over a year into her tenure, Brewer rose to national prominence after signing SB1070 into law, a strict immigration measure also known as the ""show me your papers"" law that allows law enforcement ask people for legal documents, which critics say leads to racial profiling of Latinos. She made national headlines again for wagging her finger at President Barack Obama on a Phoenix tarmac after he stepped off of Air Force One over immigration. In her bid for re-election in 2012, she won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, even though her primary opponent sat on the organization's board of directors. The endorsement was well-earned, as was her A+ rating. Under her, Arizona became one of three states to allow people to carry concealed weapons without a permit. And people can take concealed weapons into restaurants or bars with a permit if no alcohol is consumed. But her conservative credentials took a bit of a beating last year when she said Arizona would participate in the controversial expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Many conservative governors chose to opt out but Brewer called it a ""moral"" obligation to provide health care for the poor and uninsured. LGBT record . While social and religious conservatives hope her conservative principles continue to guide her action regarding the LGBT measure, her record on lesbian and gay issues is thin. Nathan Rhoton, vice president of Equality Arizona, said that Brewer's record on related issues is ""largely unproven."" While she vetoed a similar measure last year, it was had nothing to do with the content of the bill but political power plays inside the Arizona state Capitol. The one substantive time she acted was not on the side of gay rights. She ended domestic partner benefits for state employees, which was a measure her predecessor implemented. Brewer said the state couldn't afford it and she defended her decision in court. ""She's been mostly silent on the issue of marriage equality and those types of things,"" Rhoton said. LGBT rights: The patchwork states of America . Some insight . Where Brewer has a proven record is in the area of Arizona businesses, cutting regulations and taxes. And that could provide the clearest signal on what Brewer might do this week. The religious freedom bill, SB1062, is opposed by some of influential business groups in Arizona. A letter sent to Brewer on Monday by numerous business leaders encouraged her to oppose the measure. ""After analyzing the bill, we are very concerned about the effect it could have on Arizona's economy,"" the letter, signed by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry among others, said. ""We cannot support measures that could expose our businesses to litigation, nor do we want to send a message that our state is anything but an open and attractive place for visitors and the top talent that will be the cornerstone of our continued economic growth."" And Brewer is well liked among the business community. ""We believe she's done more than any governor national wide to improve the economic competitiveness in her state,"" Garrick Taylor, spokesman for the Arizona Chamber, said. ""We know this governor always does what she believes is in the best interest of the state."" And LGBT rights' groups hope that her close ties with the business community is enough to convince her to oppose it. ""This is where we hope her pro-business stance will prevail,"" Rhoton said. Growing support . Brewer is also facing growing support for a veto. Is same-sex marriage no longer a political issue? Public pressure is mounting. Another major protest took place Monday evening outside the state Capitol. Businesses are hanging signs in their windows that read ""open for business to everyone!"" Both Arizona senators, Republicans John McCain and Jeff Flake, have publicly urged Brewer to veto. And according to the local newspaper in Prescott, state Sen. Steve Pierce, who voted for the measure, is now urging Brewer to pick up her veto pen. While the measure is not about same-sex marriage, a likely indicator of where Arizonans stand on the SB1062 is a Behavior Research Center's Rocky Mountain Poll from last year. It found that a majority of Arizonans support same-sex marriage. Kim Fridkin, an Arizona State University professor of political science, noted that ""it's an extreme measure even for (conservative) Arizona."" ""She'll be viewed more reasonable than liberal"" if she vetoes it, Fridkin said. A spokesman for the NFL, which will host Super Bowl XLIX, in Glendale next February, said the league is watching developments in Arizona. ""Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard,"" Brian McCarthy said. CNN's Dana Bash, Miguel Marquez and Quand Thomas contributed to this report.","NEW: NFL, which will host Super Bowl in Arizona next year, says it is monitoring situation .

"(CNN) -- Quick -- name a planet with rings. Easy, right? But Saturn and others are not alone: Now scientists have added another celestial body to the short list of objects in our solar system that have rings around them. The remote asteroid Chariklo orbits between Saturn and Uranus in the outer solar system. Researchers published a study in the journal Nature showing evidence of rings around it. Lead author Felipe Braga-Ribas of the Observatorio Nacional/MCTI in Rio de Janeiro said the discovery came as a complete surprise. ""We weren't looking for a ring and didn't think small bodies like Chariklo had them at all,"" he said in a statement. Chariklo is fairly small -- 250 kilometers (150 miles) in diameter. It is classified as a ""centaur,"" an object that has an unstable orbit and crosses giant planets' orbits. Mythological centaurs had both human and horse features, while centaurs in the solar system may have both comet and asteroid characteristics. The asteroid is only the fifth solar system object whose rings have been detected. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune also have rings. Telescopes at seven different locations, including the European Southern Observatory's La Silla site in Chile, saw a star seem to disappear for a few seconds on June 3, 2013. This happened because the star's light was obscured by Chariklo. The star's brightness also diminished a few seconds before and after that main blocking of light. Astronomers discovered that rings were responsible, and calculated their size, shape and orientation. The two rings orbiting the asteroid are relatively narrow: 7 kilometers and 3 kilometers across. They are separated by a gap of 9 kilometers. Scientists are informally calling these rings Oiapoque and Chui, after rivers near the northern and southern ends of Brazil. The gravitational interactions from small moons may be keeping the orbiting material in ring form, scientists said. ""So, as well as the rings, it's likely that Chariklo has at least one small moon still waiting to be discovered,"" Braga-Ribas said in a statement. And someday the rings themselves may lead to a moon being formed, scientists said. On a larger scale, a similar process could have been involved in the making of our own moon, as well as other planetary satellites. How these rings came to be is mysterious. One idea is that a collision created a disc of debris, the European Southern Observatory said. ""This discovery suggests that the event(s) responsible for the origin of the rings is relatively recent, or that a fortuitous balance of forces have combined to help sustain them,"" said Ed Beshore, deputy principal investigator for NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which aims to visit a near-Earth asteroid and bring a sample back to Earth. Beshore was not involved with this study. Scientists planning OSIRIS-REx, targeting an asteroid called Bennu, are finding challenges with the dynamics of small celestial bodies, Beshore said. The Nature study reinforces the idea that asteroids, comets and other relatively small bodies are ""no longer second-class citizens in our solar system,"" he said. ""Indeed, they may harbor important clues about the origins and mechanisms that helped create our planet Earth, and the processes that supported the rise of life here,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Egypt's military launched airstrikes in the country's Sinai peninsula, killing 13 people who the military called ""extremists"" loyal to the Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood, state media reported. The Thursday night strikes hit four homes in the northern Sinai, state media reported Friday, citing military spokesman Col. Ahmed Mohammed Ali. Details about what led to the attacks weren't immediately available. The strikes follow at least two recent deadly incidents on the peninsula. On January 25, an Egyptian military helicopter crashed in the Sinai, killing five crew members. The military, which said the crew was targeting militants, did not comment on what caused the crash. The organization Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, claimed responsibility on several al Qaeda-linked websites. The next day, unknown armed men attacked a bus carrying Egyptian soldiers, killing three troops and wounding 11 others, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported, citing a military official. Egypt's interim military-backed government has blamed the Muslim Brotherhood for many bomb attacks and shootings that have taken place in recent months. There was no immediate comment about Thursday's airstrikes from the Muslim Brotherhood, which has publicly denounced violence and called for a peaceful revolution against the government.

"(CNN) -- A magnitude 7.9 earthquake struck off the coast of central Peru on Wednesday evening, killing 15 people and leaving 70 hurt, President Alan Garcia said on national television. Pedestrians try to make calls on their cell phones in Lima, Peru, after a strong earthquake Wednesday. Peru's Panamericana TV put the death toll at 17. It showed footage of traffic lights in the capital, Lima, swaying with the quake. After everything stopped shaking, medics were seen tending to a woman. The video also showed chunks of plaster that had fallen from buildings. Some Lima residents were sobbing after the temblor, while others appeared to be praying. ""This has been the most terrifying experience we've had,"" Gladys Tarnawiecki told CNN from her home in Lima. ""It was extremely long ... never in my life had I experienced this long an earthquake,"" she said.  See the Lima resident describe how people were 'shouting and praying' » . Many people were outside in the streets, she said, as the radio warned them that aftershocks could follow the quake. Tarnawiecki said she was waiting in her car, afraid to go back inside. ""It was chaos,"" said Fernando Calderon, an American visiting Peru. ""Everybody started crying -- kids, everybody. Everybody started running toward any empty space. Everybody was afraid the buildings were going to collapse."" ""It's an awful experience, because there's no warning,"" he said. The quake shook inland towns, as well as cities near the coast and the mountains. There were power outages in Lima, Reuters reported, and people ran into the streets in panic as the tremor shook office buildings. Many stayed outside, afraid to go back indoors after the warnings of possible aftershocks. Meanwhile, tsunami warnings and watches issued after the quake for several Central and South American countries were canceled Wednesday night, as was a tsunami advisory for Hawaii. Peru, and most of the South American Pacific Coast, are on border of two tectonic plates: The South American plate, which includes most of the continent, and the Nazca plate, which extends across the Pacific along most of the coast.  See a map of where the quake struck » . The quake was felt for two minutes, according to Peruvian media. Broken windows were reported in Lima, and mobile phone service was interrupted. The coastal town of Pisco, about 160 miles (257 kilometers) south of Lima, appears to be the hardest-hit, and electricity was out in the town, Gen. Luis Palomino, head of Peru's national civil defense institute, told CNN International. He said he could not confirm any deaths. The quake struck at 6:41 p.m. (7:41 p.m. ET) and was centered 25 miles (61 kilometers) west-northwest of Chincha Alta, Peru, and 90 miles (161 kilometers) south-southeast of Lima, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was 25 miles (47 kilometers) below the Earth's surface. More tremors followed. A magnitude 5.8 quake occurred at 7:02 p.m. (8:02 p.m. ET).

"(CNN) -- It is a timely boost for Barcelona heading into their Spanish title showdown with Atletico Madrid. Lionel Messi, one of the world's best soccer players, is on the verge of a penning a new deal at the club. The Argentina striker has had a lean season by his own impossibly high standards, but has still scored 28 La Liga goals in his 30 games. Barcelona head into Saturday's epic title decider against Atletico knowing a win will secure their second successive La Liga crown. And news that the club's record goalscorer is set to extend his stay at the Camp Nou is a huge fillip for the Catalans after weeks of negotiations. A statement on the club's official website read: ""FC Barcelona has reached an agreement to adjust the terms in the contract binding Leo Messi to the club as a professional first team player. ""The revised and updated contract will be signed over the next few days."" Messi joined the Catalans in 2000 at the age of 13 and has gone on to win 21 trophies with Barca, including six La Liga titles and three European Champions League crowns. The 26-year was also voted World Player of the Year in four successive seasons, between 2009 and 2012, and will be one of the biggest names at the World Cup in Brazil. News of his new contract comes just 24 hours before the biggest match of the season in Spain, as the two title contenders go head-to-head. Atletico, who will also contest the Champions League final next weekend against city rivals Real Madrid, top the table and lead Barcelona by three points. A Barca victory will hand Gerardo Martino's men the title courtesy of a better head-to-head record against their opponents. Atletico need only to avoid defeat. Just a few weeks ago, after a disappointing home draw with Getafe, Martino said Barca's title race was run, but an unexpected dip in form by Atletico has presented them with a second chance. And midfielder Xavi, who is chasing an eighth title in Barca colors, insists they must seize this opportunity. ""We really believed we had no chance, but maybe we gave up too soon,"" he told the club's website. ""We thought we'd lost the league and these things happen in football, and now it's in our hands. It's a very important title, and we have to be together. It's an historic opportunity. It will be a great final match. ""(Atletico) are the best in defense, they pressurize you, support each other, and have different options up front. We are still hungry and people should be encouraged. La Liga should be seen as it is, competing until the end. ""Up against us are a great team. We are still hungry and people should be encouraged. This is a great generation, and this is an historic opportunity for us. ""It's a unique game and I don't know if it will happen again. It would be the icing on the cake for this generation, playing such an important match.""","Argentine striker Lionel Messi agrees a new contract at FC Barcelona .

"(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa's Formula One career is hanging in the balance after confirmation the Ferrari driver suffered some damage to his left eye following his crash in qualifying for the Hungarian GP -- although his condition continues to improve. Felipe Massa receives attention after his high-speed crash in Hungarian Grand Prix qualifying. The Brazilian remains in intensive care at the AEK military hospital in Budapest after suffering a skull fracture following his freak 200kph accident at the Hungaroring on Saturday. Despite the 28-year-old showing significant signs of improvement after undergoing emergency surgery, it has now emerged he may have sustained eye problems. If that is the case, and the Brazilian is unable to see properly in the future, it will mean his career in Formula One is over. Professor Robert Veres, the surgeon who operated on Massa over the weekend, told reporters: ""He has suffered some damage to the eye. We don't know if he'll be able to race again. ""It's too early to say about his future as we don't know the extent of the damage. Without an operation it's very hard to evaluate the eye's function."" Felipe Massa's crash in pictures. » . Meanwhile, doctors have confirmed that Massa is on the road to recovery and delivered an optimistic outlook in a Monday evening press conference. ""In the last 24 hours some major changes have gone through in the condition of Felipe Massa,"" said Colonel doctor Lajos Zsiros. ""His condition continues to be stable."" Massa has been taken out of an induced coma and is responding to questions. ""As we speak he is sleepy, but he gives adequate answers to the questions we ask him, and he can move his arms and legs spontaneously,"" Zsiros added. ""Right now he has no fever, and we have removed the drain tube from his wound. Further improvement of his condition can be expected. During the night we do not plan to do any more interventions on him."" Meanwhile, Peter Bazso, the medical director of the hospital, exclusively told CNN that Massa's injuries had been ""life-threatening"". Bazso said he had watched Saturday's accident on television and his team, who specialize in brain injuries, was immediately put on standby to operate as Massa was airlifted to his hospital. The surgeon and his team performed a two-hour emergency operation shortly after Massa arrived at the hospital, which also caters for the Hungarian military. Massa remains in a medically-induced coma in intensive care but Bazso said there were good signs of a recovery. ""We tried to wake him up three times so he could make contact with his family and each time we were successful,"" he said. Massa's parents and his pregnant wife Anna Rafaela flew to Hungary to be at his bedside after the accident. Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo also visited Massa and insisted no decisions would be taken over the manufacturer's direction for the rest of the season until the driver's situation was clarified. ""Our first priority is Felipe's recovery,"" he said. ""Felipe's been an important member of the Ferrari family for many years, since he arrived as a kid, so we all hope he can come back soon. Does safety need to be improved in Formula One? ""We don't want to wait too long for Felipe, but our first priority now is to find out about Felipe, and only at that moment will we take a decision."" After Sunday's race, Massa was also visited by Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali, team-mate Kimi Raikkonen and Brawn GP's Rubens Barrichello. It was a spring that had worked loose on compatriot Barrichello's car that hit Massa on his helmet, causing his injuries and subsequent crash into a tire barrier. The crash came less than a week after Formula Two driver Henry Surtees, the son of former world champion John Surtees, was killed in similar circumstances, knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at Brands Hatch in England, before crashing. Formula One's safety record has improved dramatically in recent years, with the last fatality in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at Imola.","Surgeon reveals Felipe Massa suffered eye damage in his crash on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama is probably the most pro-woman president in U.S. history, but his signature racial justice program, the My Brother's Keeper initiative, is for males only. That's wrong and needs to change. The President should follow the advice of more than 1,000 women of color who, this week, wrote a letter to urge him to include the sisters as well as the brothers. The women include civil rights icons Anita Hill and Angela Davis, movie stars Rosario Dawson and Rosie Perez, and writers Alice Walker and Sapphire. The signers also include schoolgirls, working-class women and, I'm proud to say, my 70-year-old mother, a retired schoolteacher, and my sister, a stay-at-home mom of two teenage boys. My mom, Legertha Butler-Walton, is Obama's biggest fan. But she says she didn't march with Martin Luther King Jr. to get the ""whites only"" signs taken down, only to have the nation's first black president put up a sign that says ""men only."" There's a myth that girls of color are doing better than boys. But that's not supported by the facts. Indeed the White House website attempts to justify MBK's exclusion of females by stating that ""boys of color are too often born into poverty and live with a single parent."" But don't African-American girls live in the same single-parent households as African-American boys? Don't Latina girls attend the same failing schools as Latino boys? Isn't a teenage girl on a reservation in California as afraid of being a victim of rape as a teenage boy in Chicago is afraid of being a victim of gun violence? Indeed African-American and Latina women are the poorest members of our society. According to a study by the Insight Center for Community Economic Development reported on NPR, the average net worth of a white woman is $41,000. Compare that to $100 for black women, and $120 for Latinas. Although African-American men are, generally speaking, not doing well either, they earn more money than African-American women, and are less likely to be raising children on poverty-level wages. The average net worth of an unmarried black man is 100 times greater than that of an unmarried black woman. But this is not about a race to the bottom. It is about understanding that the economic and social conditions that prevent many people of color from achieving the American dream do not discriminate on the basis of gender. And neither should Obama's most important race-based program to remedy these conditions. Community organizations, many now strapped for cash, stand to receive millions of dollars from MBK. Unless the initiative expands to include women, these groups are likely to orient their programs to where the money is by, for example, restricting job training, college preparation and mentoring to boys only. As a result of MBK, federal agencies are being asked to collect data about how their operations impact minority males. Unless the mission of this initiative is expanded, the data about girls apparently will be sent to the shredding bin. It's an ironic result for an administration that prides itself on its support for women's equality. First lady Michelle Obama spoke movingly at Maya Angelou's memorial service about how desperately she, as a black girl growing up in Chicago, needed to hear Angelou's message of empowerment, ""when there were such stifling limitations on how black women could exist in the world."" Now the President has the ability to help more women of color have the opportunities -- to grow up healthy and safe, to go to college, to live their dreams -- that his wife had. I am an African-American man who stood outside in the cold at both of Obama's inaugurations and sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" louder than I ever had before. The President frequently says that he doesn't have all the answers. For example, at the beginning of his administration he thought civil unions were good enough for same-sex couples. Now Obama thanks the LGBT community for helping him evolve to support marriage equality. One day the President will express the same kind of gratitude to the women of color who petitioned him this week to make My Brother's Keeper more inclusive. He has said this initiative is ""as important as anything I will do as president."" So we need him to get it right. A racial justice program simply will not work if it leaves out half the race. Too many girls of color are barely staying afloat in the same deep tides that threaten the boys. MBK is like a ship that comes along to throw a lifeline only to the boys. The message is to the girls is, ""Wait. There might be another boat for you at some later time."" But the truth is that the girls can't swim any better than the boys. The sisters need someone to keep them as desperately as the brothers. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Paul Butler wonders why Obama's signature initiative doesn't include girls .

"(CNN) -- Typhoon Matmo has slammed in Taiwan, bringing heavy rain, strong winds and the threat of landslides on the mountainous island. Winds traveling at up to 64 knots (33 meters per second) swept over the territory, downing trees, cutting electricity and sending water gushing over roads. ""The water is just sheeting off the mountains -- waterfalls flowing off cliffs, rivers in full flood. I've seen trees down, flash floods across the roads, so it's a really very hazardous environment at the moment,"" storm chaser James Reynolds told CNN Wednesday morning, approximately 7 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET). Reynolds was driving north along the coastal road on the eastern side of the island, a journey he described as ""not easy,"" as he swerved around fallen rocks and trees. Although the damage to buildings was still being assessed, Reynolds said many seem to have withstood the pounding winds. ""The infrastructure in Taiwan is built very well to withstand the wind so structural damage is to a minimum. But the electricity is out in small towns and villagers in the south east part of the island,"" he said. Offices and school were closed, and flights were postponed or canceled, as residents braced for the typhoon's impact. Matmo lost strength as it passed over Taiwan and was downgraded to a tropical cyclone. It's now heading across the Taiwan Strait to mainland China, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center and Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau. It's projected to hit coastal provinces in eastern China, including Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Anhui, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Typhoon Matmo comes on the tail of Super Typhoon Rammasun, which hit the Philippines last week and went on to cause havoc in southern China. More than 100 people were killed, mostly in the Philippines, as the storm downed buildings and caused flooding. The China Meteorological Administration said Rammasun was the strongest storm to strike southern China since 1973. Travelers are advised to check with their airlines about the status of flights in the region.","Strong winds, rain raises threat of mudslides in Taiwan .

Egypt is torn between obligations to Israel to control the border and domestic support for the Palestinians.  See dramatic photos » . Israel's Foreign Ministry said the open border posed a security risk. ""When the exit [from Gaza] is open, so is the entrance,"" ministry spokesman Aryeh Mekel said. ""Hamas and other terrorist groups may use this opportunity to smuggle weapons and terrorists into Gaza."" The exodus followed Israel's closing of its Gaza border crossings Friday to punish Gaza's Hamas leadership after days of rocket attacks on southern Israel. Mindful of its diplomatic pact with Egypt, Israel's Foreign Ministry issued a tersely worded call for Egypt to ""ensure that the border operates properly, in accordance with the signed agreements"" and ""Israel expects the Egyptians to solve the problem."" Earlier Wednesday, wave after wave of people -- cheered on by children chanting ""God is great"" -- washed over fences along the border and into Egypt. They left on foot, in cars and atop donkey carts. Israel's border closings have left Hamas-controlled Gaza cut off from food, fuel and other necessities. Aid agencies warned of the impending humanitarian crisis. Along the border in Rafah, the scene changed throughout the day from a carnival atmosphere -- as Palestinians flooded the town -- to a calmer situation. Later Wednesday, more cars traveled into Gaza than toward Egypt. By nightfall, Rafah's normally sleepy sister town of El-Arish, Egypt -- about a 20-minute drive from the border -- was still bustling with Palestinians. Trucks were traveling the road between the Egyptian town and Gaza, carrying Palestinians and their newly purchased goods. Meanwhile, Gaza City -- the Palestinian territory's most populated area -- was a virtual ghost town as people headed south. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said he had ordered his troops to allow Palestinians to cross into Egypt because they were starving, according to Egypt's state-run news agency MENA. In Washington, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said Wednesday that the ""situation on the border with Egypt and Gaza is quite serious today and we are very concerned about it."" State Department officials have been in touch with involved parties, she said, including ""many in the Egyptian government."" ""The focus should be on restoring the situation,"" said Perino, who blamed Hamas for the ""genesis of this problem,"" specifically, ""sending over to Israel upwards of 150 rockets a day that are landing in its territory. So Israel's defending itself."" The mass movement of people into Egypt began about 2 a.m. Wednesday, when residents reported hearing explosions near the border. Authorities said militants set off several explosions. At least six spots on the border wall had been blown apart. In another stretch, a steel coil wall had been sheared off. By daybreak, lines of people waited restlessly as a frontloader tore chunks of concrete from a border wall. Hundreds of cars streamed toward Rafah -- on the Egyptian border -- unloading occupants who then jumped over. John Ging, head of the United Nations Relief and Work Agency in Gaza, called the exodus ""the desperate acts of a desperate people."" ""Everything that is needed for the sustainment of life here is in short supply or has run out,"" Ging said. Border access between Gaza and Egypt has been greatly restricted since June 2007,  when Hamas took over the territory. Israel's military reported Wednesday that no rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel as of 6 p.m. (11 a.m. ET), marking a sharp reduction in what has been the daily launching of rockets. In Cairo, Egyptian police Wednesday arrested as many as 500 people on their way to demonstrations to show support for the Palestinians in Gaza, according to George Ishaq, a spokesman for Kifaya, an anti-government movement in Egypt. Student organizers at Cairo University said several thousand protesters turned out for a similar demonstration on the school's campus. In Switzerland, where she is attending a conference, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has blamed Gaza's Hamas leadership for its defiance of the international community. Hamas is a Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist organization which Israel and the United States consider a terrorist organization. Rice said on Tuesday that the Mideast Quartet -- composed of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia -- is examining a plan by Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the Palestinian Authority to take a greater role in monitoring border crossings between Gaza and Israel. Gaza receives about 70 percent of its electricity from Israel, and the bulk of the remaining power comes from a generation plant in Gaza. That plant relies on fuel supplied by an Israeli company.

"(CNN) -- They are some of the last thoughts of a serial killer, found on blood-soaked, handwritten and often poetic notes in his Alaska jail cell after he took his own life. ""Speak soft in your ear so you know that it's true. You may have been free, you loved living your lie, fate had its own scheme, crushed like a bug you still die,"" Israel Keyes wrote. Keyes killed himself in December. He was in custody in the killing of barista Samantha Koenig, 18, whom he abducted from a coffee stand in Anchorage, Alaska, last February. Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. Keyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia. They were found under his body, written in a combination of pencil and ink on a yellow legal pad, the FBI said in a statement. The bureau said the notes don't confirm any of his killings, add any new victims to his grisly toll, or offer any other clues that might help their investigation. It said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages. But a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society. ""I looked in your eyes, they were so dark, warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care. The more guiless (sp) the gaze the better potential to fill up those pools with your fear,"" Keyes wrote at one point. ""Your wet lips were a promise of a secret unspoke. Nervous laugh it burst like a pulse of blood from your throat. There will be no more laughter here,"" he wrote later. ""Forget the lady called luck. She does not abide near me for her powers don't extend to those who are deceased,"" Keyes also wrote. Shortly after the killer's suicide in December, Anchorage police Detective Monique Doll described Keyes as a murder addict, saying police interviews with him showed he got ""an immense amount of enjoyment"" from killing. ""Israel Keyes never expressed in any way, shape or form that he was ashamed of or regretted his actions,"" Doll said in December. ""He knew what he was and he was fine with it."" While he held no remorse, his writing indicates that he didn't think people in general cared for each other at all. ""Soon now, you'll join those ranks of dead, or you're ashes the wind will soon blow. Family and friends will shed a few tears, pretend it's off to heaven you go. But the reality is you were just bones and meat, and with your brain died also your soul,"" Keyes wrote. Keyes criticizes U.S. society elsewhere in the four pages. ""Consume what you don't need, stars you idolize, pursue what you admit is a dream, then it's American die,"" he wrote. And he appears to rip the American worker. ""Punch in the clock and sit on your ass, playing stupid ass games on your phone. Paper on your wall says you got smarts, but you still crawl like the vermin you are once your precious power grids blown,"" Keyes wrote. On the last page of the note, Keyes may be referring to his impending suicide or to another of his victims, but his words are disturbing. ""Okay, all is over, words are flaccid and weak. Back it with action or it all comes off as cheap. Watch close while I work now, feel the electric of my touch, open my trembling flower, or your petals I'll crush.""","Israel Keyes admitted to eight killings .

"(CNN) -- My dad still uses an old flip phone. It's gray. It's clunky. And its two ringtone choices are an early recording of Greensleeves or a dramatic poetry slam by Grover Cleveland. But it works for him. And that's all that matters. Besides, how proletarian could it possibly be when even the billionaire owner of the Dallas Cowboys, Jerry Jones, uses one? The world sort of took notice of Jones' phone last week at the Arizona State-Notre Dame football game which was, for recruiting and financial reasons, being played at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The venue is now known as AT&T Stadium. But you can call it the Flip Phone Dome. Because, at one point, Jones appeared on the game's TV broadcast while talking on his flipper inside his luxury box. And that's when the tweets started pouring out. ESPN anchor, Matt Barrie, wrote: Jerry Jones is worth over a billion dollars, but my man still uses a flip phone...#BlessHisHeart . And Cork Gaines, a sports writer for Business Insider, posted a screen grab from his TV. So, clearly, viewers were jarred by the sight of this very wealthy man using something many of us now look at as a museum piece. Mind you, this would be in the world's crappiest museum. ""Excuse me, ma'am. No taking pictures of the RAZR."" What's interesting about this is that it's not like Jones can't afford a smart phone. He just chooses not to have one. And you kind of have to respect that. Jerry Jones. The billionaire hipster. But I still wonder why a man who, otherwise, seems so committed to technology has such an old-school mobile device. Remember, his football stadium holds one of the world's largest, most advanced high-def video boards -- it stretches 160 feet wide and 72 feet high. If the stadium roof were open and you were standing on the moon with nothing else to do, you could watch Cowboys games. I wouldn't. But you could. After all of the outrage and amazement about his phone, Jones later went on the radio with 105.3 The Fan [KRLD-FM] and addressed the non-situation situation. ""I don't know what to say other than I can guarantee AT&T is on the top of that flip phone,"" he said. ""It works for me. I don't have any butt-dialing with that thing. I know that."" He's got a point. It's been so long since I've actually owned a flip phone that I've really forgotten what the experience even feels like. Fortunately, though, I haven't had too many problems with butt-dialing. However, I'd like to think mine would be rather pragmatic about his decisions to use the phone. ""Hey, it's Jarrett's ass. Can I swing by and borrow a cup of flour?"" He likes to cook. At this point, I don't think I could ever go back. But there are definitely some strong arguments supporting the use of flip phones even though smartphone prices really aren't that bad these days. Right now, for example, an iPhone 5C starts at $99. Which is fairly affordable. Of course, you'll have to live with the fact that people will think your phone was a victim of some sort of horrible paint explosion. But if you can get past the fact that its color cannot be found anywhere on the natural spectrum, you'll be good to go. Until the battery dies. That might be a legitimate argument for flip phones. They do tend to last longer by virtue of the fact that they're not trying to power a million different apps, all of which are keeping you from performing your duties at work. Hell, maybe that's why Jerry Jones is so successful. He can't be bothered with all these distractions. Whereas, at this very moment, the following apps are currently running in the background of my iPhone: . Messages, Safari, Facebook, Twitter, Clock, Evernote, USA Today Crossword, Reddit Pics, The Weather Channel, Instagram, Fox Sports, Clock, Camera, RSA SecurID, Tottenham Hotspur, Mail, Calendar, Remote, ESPN ScoreCenter, Key Ring, Google Maps, YouTube, MyRadar, and Settings. Currently running on Jones' phone: Phone. Clearly, one of us is more distracted. And perhaps there's a correlation between focus and wealth. Jones' net worth: $3 billion. My net worth: A Diet Coke and some pineapple chunks. So, there's that. Also, flip phones are arguably more durable. All the glass and major features are protected when you close them up. Whereas, with a smart phone, everything on the planet is basically a ball-peen hammer. Of course, water is the ultimate death blow to any phone. Which is kind of sad. Remember when pushing somebody in the pool was funny? Now it's a $200 investment. Anyway, I'm sure there's someone in your life who still uses a flip phone. So, share this with them and tell them it's OK. One of the richest men in the world is on their team. Jerry Jones. The billionaire hipster.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge ruled Friday it is unconstitutional to force abortion clinics to become surgical centers in the state of Texas, effectively throwing out a key component of an anti-abortion law that would have forced the closure of a number of facilities. In making the ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Lee Yeakel wrote that forcing the clinics to meet the same standards as hospital-level surgical centers ""imposes an undue burden on the right of women throughout Texas to seek a previability abortion."" That part of the Texas law was scheduled to take effect on Monday; critics of the law say it would have required the closing of a majority of 19 abortion clinics. The Texas Department of State Health Services and the Texas Medical Board filed a notice of appeal. The controversial law, which was signed by Gov. Rick Perry last year, is considered one of the most restrictive in the country. The Center for Reproductive Rights brought the lawsuit on behalf of some of the clinics, and it called the federal judge's ruling a victory. ""The court has made clear that women's well-being is not advanced by laws attacking access to essential health care, and that rights protected by the U.S. Constitution may not be denied through laws that make them impossible to exercise,"" said Nancy Northrup, president and chief executive officer of the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""Texas women still face serious threats to their rights, health, and ability to obtain safe, high-quality reproductive health care from reputable doctors in their communities. But at least for the moment, today's victory is vital in preventing politicians' scorched-earth assaults on women's health care from causing even more harm than they already have."" The state law also banned abortions past 20 weeks of gestation, tightened usage guidelines for the drug RU486, and it requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic at which they're providing such services. Last year, Yeakel overturned the requirement that doctors have admitting privileges, but a federal appeals court reversed the decision. The 20-week ban provision took effect last year, while enforcement of the remainder of the law is slated to take effect in September. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","The law required abortion clinics to become hospital-level surgical centers .

"(CNN) -- Low-income Latinos are routinely discriminated against in the South, a new report says, but the study's author and others say the problem exists nationwide, with millions of Spanish-speaking immigrants living ""beyond the protection of the law."" Migrant laborers help in the post-Hurricane Katrina cleanup in New Orleans, Louisiana, in 2006. The report, released Wednesday by the Southern Poverty Law Center, documents the experiences of 500 immigrants in the South, finding that Latinos routinely are cheated out of wages, are denied basic health protection and fall victim to racial profiling. ""Under Siege: Life for Low-Income Latinos in the South"" details stories such as that of a Tennessee woman who says she was jailed at a cheese factory for asking for pay, a bean picker in Alabama who says his life savings were taken by police at a traffic stop, and a rapist in Georgia who was not arrested because the suspect's victim was an undocumented immigrant. Forty-one percent of the people surveyed said they had experienced theft of their wages by employers. Forty-seven percent said they know someone who was treated unfairly by police. Seventy-seven percent of women surveyed said they have been sexually harassed by bosses, many saying that bosses used their immigration status as leverage. ""This report documents the human toll of failed policies that relegate millions of people to an underground economy, where they are beyond the protection of the law,"" said Mary Bauer, author of the report. ""Workplace abuses and racial profiling are rampant in the South."" But such discrimination is also rampant nationwide, she said. The human-rights law center focused on the South because that's the area the Montgomery, Alabama-based group knows best, she said. ""This is not limited to the South,"" she said. ""This does not stop when you get to some particular border. These same issues happen everywhere."" The problem may seem more acute in the South because Latinos are a relatively new immigrant group to the area, some observers say. ""Newcomers in any new region are always the first to be exploited. They're at the bottom of the pecking order,"" said Gustavo Arellano, the California-based author of the nationally syndicated ""Ask a Mexican"" column and a national radio commentator. ""What's going on in the South now has already happened in Southern California."" Teodoro Maus, president of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, has heard thousands of discrimination complaints from Mexican immigrants during the past two decades. ""In the South, you just open the door and you find it,"" he said. ""It's absolutely correct that there's generalized discrimination,"" he told CNN. ""There's a general feeling that discrimination is valid because these people are illegal, because these people have no right to be here."" But the attitude toward discrimination has changed throughout the years, said Maus, who was also the Mexican consul general in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1990 to 1994 and from 1995 to 2001. ""The big difference from previous years is that there were discriminatory acts before, but not the belief that discrimination is allowed,"" he said. Bolstered by what Maus called ""an ultraconservative element,"" some people ""realized they could have open aggression against a group of people who could not defend themselves."" Arizona also has experienced widespread discrimination, Maus and others say. Bernardo Mendez Lugo, Mexico's deputy consul in Tucson, Arizona, said he sees three main forms of discrimination: racial profiling by law enforcement officers, problems in the workplace and difficulties in the rental housing market. ""There is much abuse,"" he said Wednesday. Police officers frequently stop Latin-looking drivers ""for any reason"" and immediately call immigration officials if the motorist does not have an Arizona driver's license or other local identification, Mendez Lugo said. In the workplace, he said, employees often find they are passed over for promotions despite their qualifications or length of employment. The abuse, Mendez Lugo said, is generally aimed at undocumented workers. ""They are told, 'I'm going to call immigration [authorities] if you keep asking,' "" Mendez Lugo said. Federal officials say there are more than 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Most of them come from Mexico and other Latin American countries. John McManus, president of the conservative John Birch Society, doesn't see a widespread abuse problem. ""I would probably expect there would be some,"" he said. ""There's a small number of unscrupulous people who will always take advantage of others. Generally speaking, I don't think that's the case."" Nor does McManus believe the source of the information. ""I don't put any stock at all in anything the Southern Poverty Law Center says,"" McManus said. ""They like to distort a lot of things."" The center urged the federal government to strengthen labor laws and crack down on racial profiling. ""We're talking about a matter of basic human rights here,"" said Southern Poverty Law Center President Richard Cohen. ""By allowing this cycle of abuse and discrimination to continue, we're creating an underclass of people who are invisible to justice and undermining our country's fundamental ideals.""","NEW: Study's author, others say problem isn't just regional .

"Kabul (CNN) -- Her big brown eyes, framed by long soft lashes, are wide open as she takes in the unfamiliar surroundings. She's never stepped foot into a place like this, with books, computers, classrooms and musical instruments. In fact Naghma has never been to school, let alone one that looked like this. The seven-year old dressed in a blue headscarf and a tattered, red dress, is at Afghanistan's National Institute of Music with her father, Taj Mohammad. He's a big man with kind eyes and wears a grey shalwar kameez, Afghanistan's traditional dress. Naghma's older brother, nine-year-old Wakhil, is also with them, popping in and out of every nook and cranny, exploring this new and foreign world. But as they walk along the hallway, Naghma refuses to leave her father's side. She is his shadow -- a daddy's girl. It's right beside him, holding his hand that she feels most comfortable. Fleeing conflict . But last year Taj Mohammad betrayed his little daughter's trust. It began when the family fled the fighting in the country's southern Helmand Province. Taj Mohammad moved his wife and nine children to a refugee camp on the outskirts of Kabul thinking this would be a better life. But unable to make a living, the family suffered, especially when the brutal winter arrived. His wife had to be hospitalized when she fell ill and then his three-year-old son froze to death. Taj Mohammad borrowed $2,500 to pay for his wife's medical bills and other family expenses. But when he couldn't repay the debt he decided the only solution was to marry off Naghma, then only six, to the money lender's 19-year-old son. ""It was a difficult decision,"" Taj Mohammad tells me in a remorseful tone. ""Everyone gives away their child but to give Naghma away like that was just so hard."" When human rights groups found out they were outraged and contacted a U.S. lawyer Kimberley Motley. The former beauty queen and mother of three who lives between Kabul and Milwaukee, Wisconsin where her family is based, has been working in Afghanistan for the past five years. She arrived in 2008 as part of a U.S. State Department program to train and mentor Afghan defense attorneys. Anonymous donor . While it was only supposed to be a short-term stay, Motley realized there was a serious shortage of lawyers and decided to set up a practice. While her main clients are foreigners, embassies and corporations, she has made a name for herself with her pro bono work representing victimized Afghan women. When this case came across her desk, Motley jumped at it. Through her contacts and experience in the country, she arranged an assembly of Afghan elders known as a Jirga, and managed to get Naghma out of the marriage and back to her family. An anonymous donor then paid off Taj Mohammad's debt. ""I'm certainly very happy that Naghma did not have to be married off at the age of 6, so I'm pleased with that,"" explains Motley. ""But I'd like to make sure she gets an education and becomes successful."" Which is the reason why they're visiting Afghanistan's National Institute of Music -- a school that takes orphans and underprivileged children and is offering placements for both Naghma and her brother. Motley who walks through the school with Taj Mohammad and the two children asks them what they think. Through an interpreter, Taj Mohammad says he likes it very much and would like his children to attend. He knows he and his children have been given another a chance. ""When I couldn't pay my debt I felt like I'd been thrown into the fire and then someone rescued me -- that was Kim. She has been so kind to me I'm ready to do whatever Kim says.""","An Afghan man and his family flee to a refugee camp amid fighting .

"(CNN) -- The hour is almost upon us; FIFA will shortly vote on who will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer World Cup finals.   It sounds like a fairly simple, understated task to complete but the honor to host the tournament has far-reaching ramifications. The World Cup competes only with the Olympics as the biggest events in global sport; it generates billions of dollars to the economy of the host, and is able to create a ""feel-good-factor"" that is precious in the current era of austerity. Unsurprisingly, given the high stakes, the campaigns for the bidding nations have been multi-million dollar affairs, while accusations of vote rigging, bribery and corruption have abounded in global media. It has been the most scrutinized and controversial bidding process in the history of the game. But why are governments from the USA to Japan gambling so much political and economic capital on securing the rights to host the World Cup? What is at stake? There is a good reason why so many countries fall over themselves to host the FIFA World Cup. Since the first low-key event was held in Uruguay in 1930, the tournament has grown into a political and economic phenomenon, not to mention one of the single most-watched television events in the world. According to FIFA, viewing figures from the 2010 finals hosted in South Africa could have even eclipsed the record set by the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics. In Germany this year, 40 percent of the entire population watched their team lose a semi-final against Spain while as much as 90 percent of the Dutch population watched Holland lose against the same opponents in the final. With the eyes of the world focused on the hosts for the best part of a month, the effect the World Cup can have on a country can be huge. The 1998 and 2010 finals in France and South Africa respectively were feted for bringing together  multi-ethnic populations under one flag, while the 2006 tournament was seen by many as the final piece of Germany's post-Second World War rehabilitation. Even dictators have got into the act, with Argentina's military junta controversially using the 1978 tournament to bolster its image abroad. But what interests most governments today is the huge economic benefits that hosting the tournament brings. Bloomberg estimates that Germany made a €150 ($196) million profit from the 2006 tournament. The British government has predicted that a 2018 World Cup in England would be worth $4.7 billion to the country's economy. For others, like the Qatar 2022 bid, money isn't the real objective; rather a short cut to Qatar being taken seriously on the international stage. With billions of dollars at stake, it's no surprise that the bid process has been long, expensive, at times tetchy, and haunted by controversy. The favorites . The race for the 2018 World Cup is wide open. All of the bids come from Europe and when FIFA released their technical reports England came out with the highest marks. The country boasts arguably the most watched soccer league in the world, the English Premier League, good infrastructure and, in the bid's own words, the best commercial opportunities. But the English press has been doggedly pursuing allegations of corruption within the game's governing body, reporting which FIFA and members of England's own bid team have criticized. Ready to pick up the pieces is Russia. Although their bid report from FIFA faired less well, the Russian government has pledged billions of dollars to build new stadiums and infrastructure. A tournament in Russia would also open a huge, relatively untapped market for FIFA, which has awarded World Cups to South Africa in 2010 and Japan and South Korea in 2002 for similar reasons. The favorites to host the 2022 World Cup are the USA. The tournament would help to cement soccer's growing popularity in America and build on the gains made when it lasted hosted the tournament in 1994, which broke World Cup attendance records. If the USA bid fails, the bid with the most to gain comes from Australia. A superb 2000 Sydney Olympics, considered by the IOC as one of the best ever, proves that the Australians have experience in organizing successful international tournaments on this scale. The weather would be perfect too. But soccer is only the fifth most popular sport in Australia, behind the likes of rugby union and cricket, and arguments with various competing governing bodies angry that soccer would be taking center-stage for a month have troubled the bid. The outsiders . Everything would suggest that the joint Spain-Portugal 2018 bid is doomed for failure. After all FIFA has already publicly said that it wasn't looking for future joint-hosting of the World Cup after logistical problems at the 2002 World Cup in Japan and Korea. Both countries are also deep in financial crisis. But recent allegations suggesting that Qatar and Spain-Portugal had agreed a vote swap, allegations both bids deny, have raised the possibility that the bid was enjoying more support within FIFA than many initially thought. The joint Holland-Belgium bid has been very low key. So low key in fact that the bid team delivered their bid documents to FIFA on bicycle. But that might also go in their favor. Whilst every other 2018 bid has been mired in controversy, Holland-Belgium has been quietly going about its business in the background. Could it be a compromise candidate? The biggest surprise package in the bidding process for both World Cups has been the Qatar 2022 bid. A tiny, gas-rich emirate on the Persian Gulf, Qatar posses many seemingly intractable problems, namely its size -- the country's population is less than a million -- and the fact that the tournament would take place in the middle of summer when temperatures can hit 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). But a well-funded, innovative campaign has come up with a new form of zero-carbon air conditioning technology to be used in the stadiums, technology that could then have application in the third world afterwards. The Middle East's first World Cup would also appeal to FIFA's desire for the tournament to have a social legacy long after it has finished. Some European bookmakers even have Qatar down as favorites. Bringing up the rear is Japan and Korea. Despite both countries joint hosting the tournament in 2002 Japan and Korea believe they can go it alone. Japan appears to have very little support for the bid within FIFA. And the recently revived tensions between North and South has destroyed a key element of the Korean bid; namely that the World Cup could help to ease reunification between the warring countries. Who has been involved? With the world's media watching on Thursday, the bid presentations can't just be trusted to a handful of faceless bureaucrats. Oh no. Each country has called on the great and good from the spheres of celebrity and politics to come and endorse the bid and shake some palms in the crucial final hours. The England bid team arrived draped in royalty. As well as Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince William also joined David Beckham, one of the most famous sportsmen in the world. Cameron will be aware that intense last-minute lobbying by former-leader Tony Blair helped snatch the 2012 London Olympics. Other big political beasts are also involved. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton has been confirmed to appear with the USA 2022 bid, along with the Hollywood actor Morgan Freeman, whilst Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin is rumored to be putting in an appearance to bolster his country's 2018 campaign. With home-grown celebrities thin on the ground, the Qatar 2022 went about collecting the great and good of the game to extol the virtues of their bid. Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola, who used to play in Qatar's domestic league, has endorsed what would be the Middle East's first World Cup, as has France legend Zinedine Zidane. But the most glamorous bid has been from Australia 2022. None other than Nicole Kidman narrated the original bid presentation, and singer Kylie Minogue is rumored to be turning up. But in Zurich they will be relying on the talents of ex-super model Elle ""The Body"" Macpherson, who is hoping to have the same impact that Claudia Schiffer had when she was parachuted in before Germany's successful bid to host the 2006 World Cup. Her impact was such that even Nelson Mandela and his South African bid were eclipsed. FIFA members still refer to the so-called ""Claudia effect"". Controversy . The bid process has been by far the most controversial that FIFA has ever overseen. Its decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 bids at the same time has been widely criticized for encouraging vote collusion between bids -- an accusation FIFA deny. But it was the revelations by the British newspaper the Sunday Times that has marred the process. Undercover journalists secretly filmed two members of FIFA's then 24-strong executive committee allegedly offering to sell their votes. Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti were both suspended by FIFA's ethics panel following the revelations, reducing the voting number to 22. The same ethics panel also cleared the Qatar 2022 and the Spain-Portugal 2018 bid from colluding to vote for each other, allegations that had been made following the Sunday Times investigation. Another investigation by the British press, closer to the bid date, has made further uncomfortable accusations about three other FIFA members. Last Monday the BBC alleged that Issa Hayatou, president of the Confederation of African Football, Nicolas Leoz, president of the South American football confederation and Ricardo Teixeira, head of the Brazilian football association, all took bribes during the 1990s. In the short term it is likely that the allegations will hurt the England 2018 bid hardest. The chief executive of the England bid, Andy Anson, dubbed the BBC ""unpatriotic"" for screening its Panorama investigation into FIFA so close to the vote and fears that the British press may have upset other members of FIFA's executive committee who may now not vote for it. But if FIFA's members decide for a clean break to distance itself from the corruption allegations, the race becomes totally unpredictable, and a shock could be on the horizon.","FIFA's executive committee will vote on the hosts of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods has not given up hope of teeing off at the Masters later this month. The world No. 1 is a quadruple winner of the year's first major and he has never missed the tournament since making his debut at Augusta in 1995. A back injury looked to have ended Woods' 19-year run but the American says it's too soon to write him off for the tournament which runs from April 10-13. ""For Augusta, it's actually still a little too soon, to be honest with you,"" the 38-year-old told reporters. Fourteen-time major winner Woods was forced to stop playing during the final round of the Honda Classic on March 2. He tried to return to the course at Doral the following week, but his back prevented him from defending the title he won in 2013. ""I've had a couple weeks off and getting treatment and just working on trying to get ready for Augusta,"" added Woods. ""As of right now, it's still too soon, which is, as I said, pretty frustrating."" Woods won his first major at the Masters back in 1997. He last slipped on the green jacket in 2005 and he hasn't won one of the sport's four marquee tournaments since triumphing at the U.S. Open in 2008.","Tiger Woods is unsure whether his back injury will prevent him from playing in the Masters .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. is considering new security measures at airports due to increased concern that terrorists from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are developing explosives designed to avoid detection by current security screening, U.S. officials tell CNN. Officials tell CNN there is no imminent threat or plot; however, an additional vulnerability has been identified, which the Department of Homeland Security is working to address. ""DHS regularly monitors intelligence related to terrorist groups seeking to do us harm. DHS regularly re-evaluates our security apparatus, which includes a number of measures both seen and unseen, to fit an ever evolving threat environment,"" an agency official tells CNN. In recent months, U.S. officials have warned about al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula terrorists attempting to design new explosive devices to avoid detection. In February, the government warned airlines about possible shoe bombs, officials told CNN at the time, amid intelligence suggesting tactics tied to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula master bomb-maker Ibrahim al Asiri. A law enforcement source said the U.S. periodically receives information on attempts by those believed to have been trained by al Asiri to develop bombs that could defeat screening systems.","There is no imminent threat or plot, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Who is John Boehner? Among friends, he's just one of the guys. When the Republicans gained majority power in the House of Representatives Tuesday, the man poised to lead them was brought to tears. That evening, Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, who will soon become the new speaker of the House, told supporters, ""I spent my whole life chasing the American dream."" With tears forming and his voice quavering, Boehner recounted details of his life growing up in southwestern Ohio: ""I started out mopping floors, waiting tables and tending bar at my dad's tavern. I put myself through school, working every rotten job there was and every night shift I could find."" While it's a story of humble beginnings -- Boehner worked as a janitor in college -- it's a long way from the image many have of him today, as a Washington insider known for a ubiquitous tan, an unstoppable smoking habit and fiery speeches on the House floor. One of Boehner's friends, Jerry Vanden Eynden, who has known the 60-year-old, 10-term congressman since seventh grade, told CNN Boehner's career continues to surprise childhood friends. ""It was nothing that any of us would ever have expected,"" said Vanden Eynden, president of a Cincinnati, Ohio, candle company. ""We would have expected him more to be successful in business, the way he was, more than get into the political field."" ""I can't say that there was anything that made him outstanding to me in grade school. He was just one of the guys,"" Vanden Eynden said. Boehner is the second of 12 children. ""The thing I remember most about going to his house was there was always diapers on the line,"" recalled Vanden Eynden. ""No matter what time of year it was, they were either outside or inside, but his mom always had cloth diapers. There were so many kids running around."" Boehner is the first in his family to graduate from college. Earning a degree in business from Xavier University, Boehner eventually became president of Nucite Sales, a plastics and packaging company. Boehner began his political career in the 1980s, serving in the Ohio state legislature. He won his first congressional race in 1990. Twenty years later, longtime friends reject the idea that he has turned into a Washington elitist who's too chummy with lobbyists. Dan Danner, president and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business and himself a registered lobbyist, has known Boehner since he first ran for Congress. He said the image of an insider as someone who is ""co-opted by the system"" and becomes ""someone that you weren't when you came here"" doesn't describe the congressman. ""You know, I think he's still John Boehner,"" he said. ""There's no substitute for having run a business,"" Danner said. ""It's completely different if you've only signed the back of a paycheck and you've never signed the front."" During Boehner's time in Congress, he's also earned a reputation among reporters and colleagues as having a laid-back demeanor and a penchant for wisecracks. On Thursday, when questioned by ABC's Diane Sawyer about the possibility of a ""Slurpee summit"" with President Obama, Boehner responded, ""I don't know about a Slurpee. How about a glass of merlot?"" ""We were angels, and that's the way we'll keep it,"" said Vanden Eynden when asked if Boehner learned to joke around while attending an all-boys high school in Ohio. And while friends don't recall Boehner as someone who easily sheds tears, they say the recent public displays of emotion are genuine. ""It's sincere,"" said Vanden Eynden. ""I think he's seeing that he has a chance to realize that dream, that goal that he put out there.""","Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, soon will take over as speaker of the House .

"(CNN) -- Moments after Germany defeated the United States 1-0 Thursday at the World Cup, the globe's biggest sporting spectacle, frenzied U.S. fans danced and cheered in the humid air under New York's Manhattan Bridge overpass in Brooklyn. One more jubilant celebration -- sans a victory. Even in defeat, Team USA earned a spot in the last 16 of the World Cup after limping out from one of the tournament's toughest groups. They lost their final Group G game but still qualified, despite Portugal defeating Ghana 2-1. ""This is bigger than a moment,"" said a frantic fan in Brooklyn who was among the thousands who gathered at various locations around the nation to watch the big match. ""It's a movement. People are getting behind U.S. soccer."" Sales manager Dave Bogart said his heart was beating ""a mile a minute"" after Team USA's improbable advance from the feared ""Group of Death."" Thomas Muller's second-half strike condemned the U.S. to defeat following a rain-soaked match in Recife, Brazil. But star Cristiano Ronaldo's late strike for Portugal inflicted defeat on Ghana and ensured the Americans qualified in second place on goal difference. The American squad will now travel to Salvador, where its opponent will be Belgium on Tuesday. ""Every four years you get to see the game grow,"" Bogart told CNN under the Manhattan Bridge. World Cup fever, American-style, lives -- at least until Tuesday. From now on, any loss for a team means the end of its World Cup hopes. Throughout the country -- from outdoor viewing events in the nation's capital, New York and Chicago, to office lunch parties and crowded sports bars -- Thursday, June 26, 2014, was a national holiday of sorts. Meetings were canceled. Students played hooky. Doctors' letters were forged. Some bosses simply gave up, ordered pizzas and put on the game. That fever was in full view at breakfast time when an unnamed World Cup fan from suburban New York gulped down a cold beer at Jack Demsey's Pub in Midtown Manhattan. At an hour when New Yorkers are packing onto subway trains for their morning commute, the pub was already standing-room only. ""I actually got out of work with a concussion,"" said the superfan, who declined to give his name for obvious reasons. For many early risers, the breakfast of champions included pints of stout, ale and cider, fireball shot specials and spicy chicken wings. For 90-some minutes starting at noon Thursday, most of America seemed to stop. A year of method acting helped the superfan with his concussion charade, as did a ""real doctor's note from a real doctor,"" he said. ""I had to be off for two weeks, and I couldn't think or do anything,"" he told CNN. ""I put that (method acting) to use as a diehard soccer fan."" U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, the man who transformed Germany into a powerhouse team, on social media gave America's workforce permission to take a day off. His note said, in part, that the absence is for a ""good cause"" and that Team USA needs the ""full support of the nation"" in order to advance to the next round. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tweeted back: ""NYS stands strongly behind you. I'm approving an extra hour for lunch today."" On Sunday, 20,000 people showed up for the World Cup watch party at Chicago's Grant Park for the USA-Portugal match, CNN affiliate WBBM reported. But Thursday's crowd, which was expected to be bigger than Sunday's, turned out to be about 5,000. In California, at the headquarters of Edmunds.com, workers pecked away on their laptops while watching the game. The average age of workers at the Santa Monica headquarters of the car-buying website is 35. Edmunds CEO said he recognized a growing interest in soccer. ""We wanted to be open about it and allow them to watch the game, just so long as they (employees) get results,"" CEO Avi Steinlauf said. ""We'd rather have it this way, watching in a conference room, than trying to check the score on their phones or computers."" The final score didn't seem to matter much Thursday. The team advanced. As the superfan at Jack Demsey's Pub put it, his real affliction was not a concussion. ""The only thing I had was soccer fever, and the only prescription is more soccer,"" he said. ""When we win, it is the greatest feeling in the world. It's one of the rare sports that really shows the patriotism that is America."" For many on Thursday, even defeat felt great. U.S.-Germany match goes on despite downpour .

"Washington (CNN) -- The chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus said Tuesday that two African-American Republicans elected to Congress last week were welcome to join the group, but one of the new members-elect -- Tim Scott of South Carolina -- indicated he would decline. ""I grew up in an environment where we were just very much integrated, and life worked out really well,"" Scott told reporters Tuesday. ""I think the best for America is finding a way to fuse all of our communities together and erase all those lines that separate us."" Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee of California, who chairs the Black Caucus, said in a statement that membership in the traditionally left-leaning group ""has never been restricted to Democrats."" ""Should either of the two African-American Republicans recently elected to the House of Representatives request membership in the Congressional Black Caucus, they will be welcomed,"" Lee's statement said. Rep.-elect Allen West of Florida, the other incoming black Republican, told CNN on Sunday that he intended to join the CBC. Scott, who was tapped by House GOP leaders to serve on the Republican transition team, signaled he might be interested in the new seat at the Republican leadership table created for a representative of the incoming freshman class. ""Certainly I am going to keep my eyes open and see what happens,"" Scott said, adding he would ""get back home tonight and figure out what I'm going to do by tomorrow or Thursday and starting working towards it or start working for someone else."" Scott argued his class should wield some real power because of its numbers, adding: ""I think we should play an important role, a prominent role."" Endorsed by the Tea Party in his campaign, Scott was noncommittal about joining the Congressional Tea Party Caucus, saying: ""I don't know much about it, but certainly l support the Tea Party platform."" He downplayed the importance of congressional caucuses, calling them ""simply optional at this point."" In addition, Scott said he supported Texas Republican Jeb Hensarling over Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for the No. 4 House GOP leadership post, saying Hensarling has been actively seeking support from new members while he had yet to hear from Bachmann. Another incoming freshman supported by the Tea Party, Republican Rep.-elect Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, also said Tuesday that he was supporting Hensarling and was not planning to join the Tea Party caucus that Bachmann founded earlier this year.","Congressional Black Caucus is a traditionally left-leaning group .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen cited ""irreconcilable differences"" when he filed for divorce from Brooke Mueller Monday afternoon, a marriage that apparently hit the rocks when he was arrested last Christmas Day. Sheen listed December 25, 2009, as their date of separation and the day their twin infant sons began living solely with him. The couple married on May 30, 2008. The divorce petition, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, requested jointed legal and physical custody of Bob and Max Sheen, the boys who were born to the couple on March 14, 2009. Sheen was arrested on felony domestic violence charges after Mueller called police to their holiday home in Aspen, Colorado, last Christmas. She claimed he held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her, the police report said. The felonies were reduced to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count in exchange for his guilty plea in August. The plea deal allowed his time in a a Malibu rehab center to count for his 30-day jail term. Sheen's three-month probation is set to end Tuesday. He signed the divorce petition Monday morning, just six days after New York police reported finding him ""emotionally disturbed"" in a hotel room. Sheen was briefly hospitalized for what his representative said was an allergic reaction to medication. The New York incident led to tabloid speculation that Sheen's mental and physical health was in danger, but his publicist Stan Rosenfield sought to shoot down the reports. Rosenfield shared with CNN an e-mail he received Sunday from Sheen manager Mark Burg, describing the reports as ""complete bulls--t fabricated lies!!!"" ""Charlie is fine and will be at work on Tuesday,"" Burg wrote. The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen signed a contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom ""Two and a Half Men.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- JetBlue Airways and two TSA screeners will pay $240,000 to settle an Iraqi man's claim he was denied access to a flight until he covered a T-shirt that read in English and Arabic, ""We Will Not be Silent."" JetBlue and two TSA screeners settled a lawsuit for $240,000, but denied any wrongdoing. In the settlement, JetBlue and the TSA screeners deny any wrongdoing, saying they only wanted to resolve the 2½-year-old federal lawsuit. But Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi who immigrated to the United States three years ago, cast the settlement as a victory, saying the payout would discourage airlines and airport security officials from imposing restrictions in the future. ACLU attorney Aden Fine, who represented Jarrar, also called it a victory. ""A $240,000 award should send a clear and strong message to all TSA officials and to all airlines that what happened here is wrong and should not happen again,"" he said. The TSA screeners -- Garfield Harris and Franco Trotta -- declined comment, referring questions to their attorneys, who also declined comment, and the TSA. TSA spokesman Christopher White, while noting that the TSA was not a party to the suit, said ""There is absolutely no intention to take disciplinary action against the employees involved."" The incident occurred August 12, 2006 -- two days after the United Kingdom revealed a plot to bomb planes to the United States had been foiled. In response, the United States imposed a ban on carry-on liquids, and raised the threat level at airports. Jarrar, now 30, said he was attempting to travel on JetBlue flight 101 from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Oakland, California, when he was approached by TSA officers. The officers told him he'd have to cover his T-shirt. ""When I asked why, one of the TSA officers said, 'Coming into an airport while wearing a T-shirt with Arabic letters on it was equivalent to going into a bank while wearing a shirt saying, 'I am a robber,' "" Jarrar said. Jarrar said he originally refused to cover up the shirt, first asking to speak to a supervisor, and asking if there was a law prohibiting Arabic shirts. ""I said, 'I think as a U.S. resident and taxpayer, I think it's my constitutional right [to express myself],' "" said Jarrar, adding the T-shirt's message was not threatening. Jarrar said he finally relented when it became obvious he couldn't get on the plane without complying. The officials purchased a T-shirt for him to wear, he said. ""They had actually a discussion in front of me. One said, 'Let's buy an ""I [heart] New York"" shirt.' And another said, 'No, we can't take him from one extreme to another.' "" ""I said, 'What makes you assume that I don't love New York?' "" Jarrar said they eventually bought him a ""generic gray"" T-shirt with the words ""New York"" on it. ""They tried to say this is a compromise ... I said, 'It is not a compromise, you are denying me my rights,' "" Jarrar said. Airline officials also changed his seats without consulting him, forcing him to to sit in the back where flight attendants kept an eye on him, Jarrar claims. According to court documents, TSA screener Trotta said he remembers Harris telling Jarrar he ""had perhaps not made the best choice of clothing"" given the events two days earlier. But ""at no point in time did he ever request or order that the passenger change his shirt or suggest that his failure to do so"" would keep him off the flight. Jarrar said he is disappointed the TSA and airline did not apologize to him. In a written statement to CNN, JetBlue said it was pleased with the settlement. ""The settlement amount represents a fraction of the amount originally sought by Mr. Jarrar,"" spokesman Bryan Baldwin said. ""JetBlue continues to deny, outright, every critical aspect of Mr. Jarrar's version of events."" ""At no time did anyone from JetBlue ever say he could not board the aircraft unless he changed his T-shirt,"" Baldwin said. ACLU attorney Fine said Jarrar did not sue TSA directly because of ""legal considerations."" ""It's much more difficult to sue a government agency than it is to sue the direct government employee that committed the unconstitutional act,"" he said. But the JetBlue settlement should accomplish the same goal, he said. ""It's very difficult to bring these kinds of cases and to prevail on these kinds of cases, especially in a post 9/11 world in which airline officials and government officials have been given an extreme amount of latitude,"" Fine said. Jarrar said the slogan on the T-shirt -- ""We Will Not Be Silent"" -- originated in Germany as a campaign against the Nazi repression. He said artists in New York have printed it in various languages.","JetBlue and the TSA screeners denied any wrongdoing .

"(CNN) -- The terrorist attacks on America on September 11, 2001, gave his administration a clear goal and him the resolve to find out who was responsible and ""kick their ass,"" former President George W. Bush writes in his new book. In ""Decision Points,"" Bush describes his reaction when his then-National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice informed him of the crash of a third airplane into the Pentagon. ""I sat back in my seat and absorbed her words. My thoughts clarified: The first plane could have been an accident. The second was definitely an attack. The third was a declaration of war,"" the former president writes in his 481-page book, which goes on sale Tuesday. ""My blood was boiling. We were going to find out who did this, and kick their ass,"" Bush writes. ""In a single morning, the purpose of my presidency had grown clear: to protect our people and defend our freedom that had come under attack."" CNN on Friday obtained a copy of the book, being released by Crown Publishers. In the book, Bush also recounts the government response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He calls the response ""not only flawed"" but ""unacceptable,"" and describes his own failures in this way: ""As the leader of the federal government, I should have recognized the deficiencies sooner and intervened faster. I prided myself on my ability to make crisp and effective decisions. Yet in the days after Katrina, that didn't happen. The problem was not that I made the wrong decisions. It was that I took too long to decide."" Bush writes he also failed to ""adequately communicate my concern for the victims of Katrina"" -- a problem he calls one of ""perception, not reality."" ""Yet many of our citizens, particularly in the African-American community, came away convinced their president didn't care about them."" The former president recently told NBC's Matt Laurer that the ""worst moment"" of his administration was when rapper Kanye West declared during a Katrina celebrity telethon that ""George Bush doesn't care about black people."" West this week expressed a sympathetic view of Bush's reaction to the comment. Bush writes the Katrina had a lasting legacy on his second term. ""Just as Katrina was more than a hurricane, its impact was more than physical destruction. It eroded citizens' trust in their government. It exacerbated divisions in our society and politics. And it cast a cloud over my second term."" In ""Decision Points,"" Bush also details how he came to utter those infamous words ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job"" about Michael Brown, the FEMA chief who was leading the government's response to Katrina in the days immediately following the storm. Bush writes that he was in Mobile, Alabama, meeting with the Alabama and Mississippi governors and asked them if they were getting adequate federal support. ""'That Mike Brown is doing a heck of a job,' Bob said,"" referring to Alabama governor Bob Riley. ""I knew Mike was under pressure and I wanted to boost his morale,"" Bush writes, so he repeated Riley's words a few minutes later when he spoke to the press. ""I never imagined those words of encouragement would become an infamous entry in the political lexicon. As complaints about Mike Brown's performance mounted, especially in New Orleans, critics turned my words of encouragement into a club to bludgeon me."" The former FEMA head, who resigned two weeks after the compliment, told CNN in August that he winced when Bush uttered the line. ""I knew the minute he said that, the media and everybody else would see a disconnect between what he was saying and what I was witnessing on the ground,"" Brown said. ""That's the president's style. His attitude and demeanor is always one of being a cheerleader and trying to encourage people to keep moving. It was just the wrong time and the wrong place."" Bush in recent years has talked about his past problems with alcohol abuse and his 1986 decision to give up drinking completely. Just days before the 2000 presidential election, news broke that Bush had been arrested for driving under the influence in Maine in 1976. In his memoir, Bush writes, ""Not disclosing the DUI on my terms may have been the single costliest political mistake I ever made."" He says he had decided against doing so because he didn't want to undermine his admonitions to his daughters about drinking and driving. After the news came out -- so close to election day, Bush writes, he went to bed that night on the campaign trail thinking, ""I may have just cost myself the presidency.""","His blood was boiling after the 9/11 attacks, former president writes .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Prince Harry, the younger son of Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana, offered his condolences to September 11 victims Friday in his first official trip overseas. Prince Harry, 24, the third in line to Britain's throne, is making his first official trip overseas. Harry's two-day visit to New York, surrounded by public officials and community activists, could reflect a change in a public image that has been marred by several incidents, including a one-day stint in drug rehab in 2002 and accusations of racism in January. At the outset of his visit, Harry stopped at ground zero with New York Gov. David Paterson and briefly talked with family members of September 11 victims. The prince then laid a wreath at the World Trade Center site and bowed his head in a moment of silence. He left a handwritten note tacked to the wreath, citing an ""admiration of the courage shown by the people"" of New York on September 11, 2001.  Watch Harry lay a wreath at ground zero » . Harry later paid tribute to his fellow citizens at Lower Manhattan's British Garden at Hanover Square, where he honored the 67 British victims of the September 11 attacks, officials said. Harry's trip will also take him uptown to the Harlem Children's Zone, where he and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho hope to learn how the nonprofit has succeeded in supporting children in the low-income area, officials said. Following the example of his mother, Harry will use this trip to promote his own charity for children, Sentebale. Co-founded with Lesotho's prince, the charity supports children in the sub-Saharan country who lost parents to AIDS. Also on Harry's agenda is a meeting with veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars, officials said. Harry, 24, served for two months in Afghanistan as a Coalition Forces soldier in 2007. The third in line for the British crown, Harry is active in the British Army. He received a promotion to lieutenant in April 2008 and is training for an Army Air Corps pilot position, according to the prince's Web site.","Prince Harry meets with relatives of September 11 victims .

"(CNN) -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has struck a deal that ends the leadership fight for the number two slot in the new House minority, multiple senior Democratic sources tell CNN. Under the compromise, current House majority leader Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer will become the Democratic whip, which will be the number two spot in the new Democratic minority. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn agreed to end his bid for that spot and instead hold a new, third-ranking leadership post that will be created for him. In a letter to Democratic colleagues on Saturday, Pelosi said she plans to designate him ""Assistant Leader."" In a statement Saturday, Clyburn -- an African-American -- said it was important that the party's House leadership represented ""the diverse views, backgrounds and experiences of our membership."" The new structure, he said, ""honors the diversity and fosters the unity"" of House Democrats. ""I believe this resolution allows us to begin the journey back to a stronger and more resilient majority,"" said Clyburn, the current majority whip and a congressman since 1993. When the Democrats become the minority party in the House they lose the position of Speaker, a shift that left Hoyer and Clyburn jockeying for the House minority whip position. Hoyer also released a statement Saturday, saying he would look forward to serving as the Democratic whip. ""Since the election last week, I have made clear my belief that it was important for my friend Jim Clyburn to continue serving our Caucus as the third ranking member of our Leadership,"" he said. The deal allows Rep. John Larson of Connecticut to keep his post as Democratic caucus chairman and Rep. Xavier Becerra to remain as the vice chair of the Democratic caucus. Speaker Pelosi revealed the deal in a somewhat cryptic statement late Friday night. ""Should I receive the honor of serving as House Democratic Leader, I will nominate Congressman Jim Clyburn of South Carolina to the number three leadership position,"" Pelosi said.","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has forged a deal over the party's leadership structure .

"(CNN) -- John Jairo Velasquez -- the top hit man for notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar in the '80s, known in Colombia as the ""narcoterrorism era"" -- is a free man for the first time in 22 years. The 52-year-old Velasquez, also known as ""Popeye,"" was released Tuesday night from a maximum-security prison in the Colombian province of Boyaca, northeast of Bogota, the capital. He left the prison under heavy police protection. Velasquez surrendered to authorities in 1992, telling a reporter at the time, ""I don't owe anything to anybody. I haven't done anything wrong."" But in jailhouse interviews, he admitted several times to killing about 300 people, including soldiers, police officers, rival cartel members and civilians. He also confessed to masterminding the killings of more than 3,000 other people, most of them civilians. Some of his victims died in car bombings in cities across Colombia including Bogota; Medellin, his cartel's home base; and Cali. Velasquez was also responsible for a number of high-profile kidnappings, among them that of Attorney General Carlos Mauro Hoyos in January 1988. Velasquez confessed that he killed Hoyos in captivity. Also in January 1988, Velasquez kidnapped Bogota mayoral candidate Andres Pastrana. Pastrana survived the ordeal and went on to become the 57th president of Colombia, serving from 1998 to 2002. The victim and his kidnapper met again in 2012. Still in prison, Velasquez apologized to Pastrana and his family. ""I ask you for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart,"" he told Pastrana, ""for what the Medellin cartel did, for risking your very important life."" He also told Pastrana he dismembered some of his victims, something he says he deeply regrets as a man who's turned his life to God. Velasquez spent 22 years in prison, three-quarters of his sentence for the murder of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan in 1989, the only murder for which he was convicted. The victim's family has forgiven him. ""He was sentenced for my father's murder,"" said Juan Manuel Galan, the victim's son and a liberal senator. ""He gave us the truth and asked for forgiveness. In my case, I forgive him."" Velasquez told local media that he fears for his life as a free man and that there's an 80% chance that his many enemies will kill him, especially those members of the Medellin cartel whose names and crimes he disclosed to authorities. Relatives of many of his victims angrily protested Velasquez's release, saying that 22 years in prison was not punishment enough for the countless atrocities he committed during the narcoterrorism era and cocaine turf wars of the '80s and '90s. But Colombian Sen. Armando Benedetti said that Velasquez was being freed for good conduct, as any other prisoner would, and that his release complied with the law.

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama is considering airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops to help save thousands of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen, who officials said Wednesday are facing a potential slaughter at the hands of fighters with the so-called Islamic State. ""These kinds of options are on the table because they do alleviate some of the suffering that is sustained by religious and ethnic minorities that are being persecuted or at least threatened"" by ISIS, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said during a briefing. The news followed reports of a new round of U.S. airstrikes targeting ISIS positions near the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil. 'Possible imminent massacre' ISIS fighters have besieged the town of Amerli, 70 miles north of Baquba, since the Sunni extremists swept into Iraq from Syria since mid-June. The town's fewer than 20,000 residents are without power. ""Residents are enduring harsh living conditions with severe food and water shortages, and a complete absence of medical services -- and there are fears of a possible imminent massacre,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said this week. Their situation echoes the ordeal of Iraq's ethnic Yazidis, whose plight after they were forced to flee into the mountains to escape ISIS militants triggered U.S. aid drops and the first U.S. airstrikes against ISIS. Similar to the chaotic scenes that played out in the Sinjar Mountains, Iraqi military helicopters have been carrying out food drops and picking up Turkmen desperate to get out. Which groups are at risk in Iraq? Scant defenses . Surrounded on four sides, the 17,400 residents have had to defend themselves with only the help of local police, Masrwr Aswad of Iraq's Human Rights Commission has said. ISIS have vowed to push the Shiite Turkmen out, calling them heretics. Turkmen are descendants of a Turkic-speaking, traditionally nomadic people, who share culture ties with Turkey. There are Sunni and Shiite Turkmen in Iraq, and they account for up to 3% of Iraq's population. The United Nations estimates that of the besieged Turkmen population in Amerli, roughly 10,000 are women and children. Turkmen have been subjected to violence before at the hands of Sunni extremists. In 2008, a truck bomb exploded in Amerli, killing more than 100 people and leveling homes and businesses. At the time, it was considered one of the single deadliest attacks of the Iraq War. U.S. airstrikes hit ISIS . On Wednesday, American warplanes carried out three airstrikes near Irbil, destroying a number of vehicles and a building, the U.S. military said. Among the vehicles was a Humvee, the military said. ISIS seized a large number of military vehicles either abandoned or captured from Syrian and Iraqi forces. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of the U.S. Central Command, met with top officials in Baghdad and Irbil on Wednesday to discuss ""U.S.-Iraq defense cooperation and regional security issues,"" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad said. Austin met with leaders including Iraqi President Fuad Masum and Prime Minister-designate Haider al-Abadi in Baghdad, and Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani, the embassy said in a statement. U.N. report alleges atrocities . The airstrikes in Iraq came as a U.N. human rights investigators accused both ISIS and Syrian government forces of committing war crimes and atrocities in their brutal fight in Syria. The U.N. report released Wednesday said that public executions, torture and mock crucifixions have become regular fixtures in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria. It also said that the extremist group is forcing children to fight. ""Among the most disturbing findings in this report are accounts of large training camps, where children, mostly boys, from the age of 14 are recruited and trained to fight in the ranks of ISIS along with adults,"" said Paulo Pinheiro, the chairman of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria. The report also accuses the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad of repeatedly using chemical weapons against civilians. The U.N. investigators said the Syrian government dropped what was thought to be chlorine gas on civilian areas on eight different occasions in April. The government forces are believed to have made particular use of barrel bombs dropped by helicopters to unleash the gas, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a commissioner with the inquiry. Video posted on social media purports to show several of the alleged chlorine attacks. While CNN can't independently confirm the video, it shows a number of Syrian civilians fleeing the smoky aftermath of an explosion with their faces covered. More video shows wounded civilians, including children, in a field hospital. Some are having difficulty breathing, several are treated with oxygen masks. The investigators say they hope to use their evidence to build a case for future prosecution at the International Criminal Court. U.S. airstrikes in Syria?

"(CNN) -- A giant panda slated to be the star of the first-ever live broadcast of the birth of panda cubs has lost the role -- after it was discovered the bear is not pregnant after all, Chinese state media reported. Not only was it a phantom pregnancy, but zookeepers suspect the panda, Ai Hin, may have been faking it to improve her quality of life, the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding told Xinhua on Monday. Ai Hin, age 6, had shown signs of pregnancy, including a change in appetite, moving less and an increase in progestational hormone in July, according to Xinhua. But after almost two months, she began acting normally again, zookeepers said. Experts say pandas sometimes carry on the behaviors associated with early pregnancy after noticing that they get preferential treatment, the news agency reported. ""After showing prenatal signs, the 'mothers-to-be' are moved into single rooms with air conditioning and around-the-clock care,"" Wu Kongju, an expert at the Chengdu base, is quoted as saying. ""They also receive more buns, fruits and bamboo, so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life."" The birth of Ai Hin's supposed cub and its progress in its early days, from its first cries to acquiring its distinctive black-and-white fur, were due to be broadcast online to panda lovers in China and worldwide. Giant pandas are notoriously reluctant to breed in captivity and pseudo-pregnancies are common. The female is fertile for no more than three days a year, and the time span for a pregnancy is from 80 to 200 days, according to the Chengdu base. Scientists will closely monitor behavioral and physiological signs, but it's often a guessing game. Even if a pregnancy proves genuine, baby pandas have very low survival rates. According to the Chengdu base, only a third to a half of pandas born in Chinese captivity manage to survive past infancy. There was good news last month, though, when a panda gave birth to a healthy set of triplets in China's Chimelong Safari Park in the southern city of Guangzhou. The cubs are thought to be the only living panda triplets in the world. Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland thinks its panda, Tian Tian, could be the next to produce a cub, based on the latest scientific tests, but there are no guarantees. ""It is very likely that we will not know 100% if Tian Tian is pregnant until she gives birth,"" Iain Valentine, director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said earlier this month. As few as 1,600 giant pandas survive in the mountain forests of central China, according to the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo in Washington. More than 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, most of them in China.","Giant panda Ai Hin had a phantom pregnancy, Xinhua reports .

"(CNN) -- At last. The 77-year itch has been scratched, history has been rewritten and the yearning is no longer. Perhaps now -- after becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon for what seemed an eternity, Andy Murray will finally feel loved. A straight sets victory over Novak Djokovic in the final was accomplished with the grit and vigor for which this champion is renowned -- but it is his softer side which has endeared him to the wider world. Just 12 months ago, Murray stood on Centre Court and cried. He cried tears of pain and anguish -- showing a part of himself of which very few ever knew existed following his final defeat. ""It feels slightly different to last year,"" Murray told fans on Centre Court. ""Last year was one of the toughest moments of my career, so to manage to win the tournament today. ""It was an unbelievably tough match, so many long games. ""My head was everywhere in that last game, he was hitting some unbelievable shots and I think that is why at the end of the match I almost didn't know what had happened. ""The last 30 minutes have been a bit a bit of a blur. I just don't know what to say."" Turning point . That defeat in the final to Roger Federer was a turning point -- not just in Murray's career, but in his relationship with British tennis fans. He was human. He did feel. He was no longer the angry, skinny, and grumpy teenager which had always threatened but never quite delivered. No, this time the British public knew they had someone special. As those tears streamed down his face, the nation finally realized that this was a man who just desperately wanted to give the country what it wanted -- a Wimbledon champion. Fast-forward 12 months and with the U.S. Open title already in the bag and the experience of winning Olympic gold on the very same court, Murray produced his finest hour. A straight sets victory over World No.1 Djokovic is an astonishing achievement -- more so given the level of pressure heaped on Murray around this time of year. Murray is all too aware of the history. Not since Fred Perry won the last of his three titles in 1936 had a British man won the singles tournament at Wimbledon. It was the year that Jesse Owens won four gold medals at the Munich Olympics, the year when the Spanish Civil War began,a time when King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson and Franklin D. Roosevelt was reelected President of the U.S. following a landslide victory. Albatross . Since Murray emerged from the shadows of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the weight of expectation has hung around his neck like an albatross. But whereas last year he had yet to win a grand slam tournament before taking on Roger Federer in last year's final, that is no longer the case. His dramatic five set win over Djokovic at the U.S. Open last September came on the back of his Olympic triumph and gave him the belief he belonged at the very top. Working alongside coach Ivan Lendl, a man who like Murray also lost his first four grand slam finals, has given the Dunblane-born player an extra edge. ""He believed in me when a lot of people didn't,"" Murray told reporters. ""He stuck by me through some tough losses the last couple of years. He's been very patient with me. I'm just happy I managed to do it for him."" That belief was in evidence on Centre Court as he endured a brutal battle against one of the fittest men on the circuit in Djokovic. There were punishing baseline rallies, moments of cross court genius, drop-shots to delight and a level of willpower seen only at the very pinnacle of the sport. After taking the first set 6-4, Murray was forced to show the kind of resilience which he has become so well known for. In his quarterfinal tie against Fernando Verdasco, he came from two sets down to triumph, while he also trailed in his semifinal before fighting back to claim victory. Fightback . So when Djokovic led 4-1 in the second set, there were few brave enough to write Murray off, even against one of the finest players of his generation. From 4-1 down, Murray rallied, showing all the qualities which have turned him into a modern day Adonis on the tennis court. There was fight, there was passion, but there was also a vital component of coolness in the heat of the battle which gave him an extra edge. From 4-1 down, Murray broke back to level at 4-4 before taking the set 7-5 as Djokovic's nerve began to falter. With just one set separating him from sporting immortality, Murray began in fine style, breaking Djokovic to take a 2-0 lead. But the Serbian, who won the title in 2011, refused to buckle and battled back to level at 2-2 before breaking the home favorite once more to threaten the prospect of a fourth set. Recovery . Once again, Murray was forced to call upon his powers of recovery, using even muscle and straining every sinew in a bid to level the set. Backed by vociferous following, he fought his way back to level before breaking Djokovic to lead 5-4 and ensure he would serve for the match. Three consecutive points followed -- three Championship points awaited. But Murray has never been one for making life easy for himself -- nor for his fans who held their collective breath. Djokovic staved off three Championship points before having the audacity to force Murray to save three break points. Each time, with the pressure growing and the specter of failure on the horizon, Murray held firm. Then, finally, when the fourth Championship point presented itself, he took it. Cue bedlam. Hysteria. As Murray sank to the turf, a nation rose from its slumber to salute a new champion, a new hero, a sporting icon. The rocky road to love might have been a long one but this love affair between Murray and the British public could be just beginning.","Andy Murray wins Wimbledon after defeating World No.1 Novak Djokovic .

"(CNN) -- Not even football - or soccer, for those in the U.S. - could stop them. While the Confederations Cup, a warm-up tournament for next year's football World Cup, went on, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians took to the streets of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and many other major cities in Brazil. Read more: A new age of protests . In the beginning, they were few, mostly youngsters disgruntled with a 20 centavos (10 cents) rise in bus and train fares. After a violent response from the police, they were joined by Brazilians of all ages who had their own issues to shout about. Corruption, poor public services, increasing inflation, lack of security and the not-so-much-loved-anymore World Cup. At a time when Brazil was supposed to be celebrating, the streets were full of anger, chanting, confrontation with the police and destruction, produced by a minority of radical demonstrators. Watch running battles between police and protesters in Rio . Why did the protests gain traction? Tricky question, but there is one thing no-one can deny: A significant number of Brazilians are very upset with the state of the nation. The transport fare hikes were canceled on Wednesday, after local authorities in Sao Paulo and Rio agreed to a U-turn in an attempt to bring back peace and order to the streets. It is still unclear whether this will mean an end to the protests. More important than the issue, though, seems to be the timing of all this. Bus fare increases in previous years had not led to any significant popular reaction. The same movement that started this month's protests - the Movimento Passe Livre (Free Pass Movement, or MPL) - had been active in previous years. After each announcement of a new bus fare they would go to the streets in their hundreds, sometimes only dozens, without being noticed by many. Authorities expected the same in 2013. The latest increase, of less than 7%, was the first in two years and below the inflation of the period. The government, the press, the police and even bystanders were taken off-guard. But, somehow, the timing was just perfect for a national revolt. Brazil protesters: World Cup only benefits outsiders . That could be explained by the way we look at Brazil. In the past decade, when the country took some 30 million people out of poverty, Brazilians enjoyed looking at what the country and its people had achieved: More formal employment, more investment, more growth, greater spending power for those who had none, more security and better outlook on life. On top of that, Brazil had secured the privilege to host the two main sports events in the world - the football World Cup and the Summer (Winter in Brazil) Olympic Games - in 2014 and 2016, respectively. Brazil just seemed to have it all. With only one caveat: It did not. When facts of life began to remind many Brazilians that their lives were not as good as the government claimed, and the football extravaganza got closer, indicating more costs for the state without apparent benefits for the people, many people began to look at their country in a different light. Instead of focusing on the achievements, they looked at what they did not have, and that view seemed to go as far as the Amazon. In 2010, after eight years with a hugely popular president, the former metal worker Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazil saw his former minister Dilma Rousseff elected as his successor. From the same leftist Workers Party (PT), Rousseff became the first female Brazilian President. Two-and-a-half years have passed, and she is still popular among the poorest, but the recent protests were led by a different bunch: The traditional middle class. On the streets, well-educated people, from central, urban areas, shouted that they had been sold a lie. Inflation is once again a major concern, violent crime is on the rise, cases of corruption fill the press, healthcare is in a precarious state, infrastructure projects have not materialized and street traffic is depressingly worse than ever. While TV showed the inaugurations of costly, lavish football stadiums, people felt their lives were getting worse by the day. After all, the World Cup will cost the nation some $15 billion, and the promised legacy in infrastructure is still nowhere to be seen. Worst of all: A government accustomed to surf on its safe popularity, secured mainly by the distribution of money to the poorest, did not feel the need to listen. Rousseff's message, in pre-recorded announcements on TV, has been that the country just could not be better. The National Congress is even more to blame, with its representatives lashed by public opinion for shocking privileges, high salaries and cases of sleaze. A survey by Datafolha institute, conducted this week in the city of Sao Paulo, shows a drastic fall in the prestige of political institutions in the past decade. Only 19% of respondents say they hold the office of president in high regard, compared with 51% in 2003. The percentage of respondents who say they hold the National Congress in high regard has fallen from 30% in 2003, to 12% now. Many who took to the streets in Brazil - and inspired Brazilians around the world to do the same in their adopted countries - carried banners saying: ""It is not only about R$ 0,20."" What they meant is that the bus fare rise was perhaps the least of their concerns. Corruption, lack of accountability and a realization that many promises have not been fulfilled were what led them to the streets. The suspension of the transport fare rise may take them back to their normal lives. The issues, however, will not go away any time soon. And unless they are properly addressed, those problems can make the people march again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rogério Simões.","Simões: Brazil just seemed to have it all. With only one caveat: It did not .
Inflation is a major concern, violent crime is on the rise, cases of corruption fill the press .
Many realized that their lives were not as good as the government claimed, he says ."
"San Diego, California (CNN) -- In his epic ""Letter from the Birmingham Jail,"" the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. observed that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied."" But now that the Obama administration is fast-tracking the deportation of thousands of undocumented minors, perhaps hoping to get rid of them before the November elections, it's clear that expedited justice is just as bad. Some migrants who come to the United States are dying to go home. Sadly, some of these deported kids could be going home to die. When Americans first learned that as many as 60,000 unaccompanied minors from Central America had made their way into the United States since October 2013, and we heard the horrific stories they told about being assaulted and targeted for murder in their home countries, we had to know this story wasn't going to have a happy ending. The Obama administration has said from the beginning that most of those children would have to go home. In order to ensure such an outcome, the administration has its thumb on the scale. A lawsuit claims that the system is rigged to make it all but impossible to establish the ""credible fear"" necessary for the kids to obtain asylum. Despite the President's claim that there is no rush in returning the children and due process would be preserved, the reality is much different. Kids are given court dates they can't possibly be expected to make -- often in another state. Many don't have lawyers. Deportation cases are being rushed through the pipeline. According to the New Jersey Star-Ledger, the first bloc of deportation cases against children from Central America are under way in the New Jersey courts. Immigration attorneys and immigrant advocates worry that the children won't have enough time to find a lawyer who can prepare an adequate defense that might allow them to stay in the United States. For Katie Manton, an attorney with Casa de Esperanza, a nonprofit organization in the state that gives low-cost legal services to immigrants, justice expedited is no justice at all. ""Although the court clearly gives them this list of legal providers, I would bet 90% are not going to find lawyers,"" Manton told the newspaper. ""There are not enough, and the time frame they are giving them is very rushed. It's a violation of due process."" Of course, many of these kids will never make it as far as New Jersey. In fact, many have been quietly apprehended at the border and returned to Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. Last month, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a possible contender for the Democratic nomination in 2016, warned that the administration was giving the migrant children death sentences. O'Malley told a gathering of the National Governors Association in Nashville, Tennessee: ""We are not a country that should turn children away and send them back to certain death."" O'Malley was right. Take it from Hector Hernandez, who runs the morgue in the Honduran town of San Pedro Sula, which is one of the most violent cities in the world. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times, he said that at least one child slain in San Pedro Sula since February was deported from the United States. Gang members shot at another young man deported from the U.S. In another case reported by the Los Angeles Times, a boy was shot and killed after leaving a deportation flight, according to his cousin. The article refers to ""thousands"" of undocumented Honduran children who were deported by the United States. By the end of the year, there could easily be many more dead children who -- once upon a time -- managed to escape their hellish environment. They trekked all the way to the United States, only to be captured and sent home without a hearing, without due process, without a chance. Shame on us. This is not how a great country welcomes the most vulnerable people in the world.","Ruben Navarrette: U.S. rushes deportation of thousands of unaccompanied minors .

"(CNN) -- Can car-loving Saudis be convinced to step out of their air-conditioned comfort and take public transport? The Saudi Arabian government believes they can and is backing its belief by investing $22 billion into a public transport mega-project in the capital Riyadh. Set to begin construction early next year, a new metro network will encompass over 176 km (110 miles) of train lines and 85 stations, linking the city center to universities, the airport, a newly built financial district and commercial areas. The first trains as slated to run in 2019. During construction, it will be the world's biggest public transport project, employing tens of thousands of people, developers say. According to the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh, all carriages will be air-conditioned and divided into first, family and single class. Buses and trains take a distant second to personal cars in Riyadh and according to FCC Construction only 2% of commuters in the Saudi Arabian capital take public transport. It's no surprise because gasoline is highly subsidized -- a gallon at the petrol pumps costs around $0.50. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest oil producer ranks only second to Venezuela for the world's cheapest gasoline. According to reports, the Saudi government is weighing up increasingly the cost of fuel to give public transport a boost. Read more: Ramadan's Super Bowl effect . Chronically underdeveloped until now, the expansion of public transport in the Saudi capital will also cope with the projected boom in the local population. It has more than doubled since 1990 to 5.3 million and is set to top 8 million by 2030. ""Riyadh today is one of the world's fastest growing cities and our citizens deserve a world-class public transport system to enhance their quality of life... it will also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality,"" said Ibrahim Bin Muhammad Al Sultan President of Arriyadh Development Authority and Member of the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh. Of the six lines to be built, three will be constructed by Spain's FCC Construction company, working in partnership in a consortium including Samsung and Alstom. U.S. Firm Bechtel and Italian company Ansaldo STS lead the other two construction consortia. Read more: Google's view from world's tallest building . As well as an extensive network, it is hoped that the stunning look of some the new stations will help to tempt locals away from their cars.

With six platforms spread over four floors, and linking three of the new lines, the architects hope it will provide a multi-function public space. According to the architects, the white facade of the station will reduce heat from the punishing desert sun while the undulating lines of the building are meant to resemble the patterns generated by desert winds on sand dunes.","$22 billion project to build new metro network in Saudi Arabian capital .

"Guangzhou, China (CNN) -- It was 2 a.m. on a stormy summer morning. As the thunder rumbled in the sky, we were led out of a sprawling terminal building through a narrow side door and down a staircase into the pouring rain. A waiting bus quickly filled up with soaked passengers dragging carry-on luggage. After a short ride across the dark tarmac followed by another storm-battered trek, we finally entered the freezing cabin of an Airbus 330 jetliner. Smiling China Southern Airlines flight attendants welcomed us on board, greeting us as if we were excited vacationers about to take off for our dream destination, instead of frustrated, tired and grumpy passengers. As we settled into our randomly assigned new seats, things turned eerily quiet. Half of the plane -- the original passengers booked onto the airline's 8 p.m. flight -- seemed to have long fallen asleep during their agonizing wait, while the other half -- those of us re-booked from a canceled 7 p.m. flight and moved onto this one -- were too exhausted to make a sound. The arrival of a second busload of drenched passengers was followed by a lengthy, silent wait on board -- with no updates from the cockpit. It was almost 3 a.m. when the pilot announced our impending departure thanks to improving weather. Our plane finally roared into the starless skies at 3:08 a.m. -- more than eight hours after the scheduled departure time printed on my air ticket. Hopeful start . All signs pointed to a smooth journey when I checked in for flight CZ3547 to Shanghai on a recent Tuesday evening at the bustling Baiyun International Airport in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese metropolis long known as Canton in the West due to its former spelling -- which also explains the airport code CAN. Keenly aware of the country's notorious flight delays, I kept checking a popular flight-tracking app geared toward air travelers in China installed on my phone. Its information echoed that of the check-in agent: inbound aircraft had already arrived and weather conditions looked good at both origin and destination airports. More promisingly, the app's algorithm put the probability of an on-time departure at 90% -- ""What a lucky break,"" I thought, for a flight whose average delay had been 108 minutes in the past month. Looking forward to a late night reunion with old friends over street snacks in Shanghai after an easy two-hour hop, I arrived at Gate B231 shortly before the 6:20 p.m. boarding time. Across the tarmac in the distance, a cluster of tower cranes dominated the horizon. An even bigger new terminal is under construction and slated to open in 2016 at China's second-busiest airport, which saw more than 50 million fliers pass through its existing terminal last year. Massive growth . Decades of breakneck economic development have brought exponential commercial aviation growth, quickly propelling China to the No. 2 position in the global flight market, trailing only the United States. But all the shiny terminals and airplanes aside, China's reputation among frequent fliers continues to sink thanks to the country's abysmal on-time performance, with the busiest hubs in Beijing, Shanghai and -- to a lesser degree -- Guangzhou often competing for the title of the world's most delayed airport. Meanwhile, nothing happened as our scheduled boarding time came and went. As our 7 p.m. departure time approached, some passengers started gathering around the counter to inquire about the flight status -- and only then did we hear the most dreaded of all Chinese airport phrases: ""air traffic restrictions."" It's an all-purpose, vague term that can mean anything from bad weather to radar malfunctions, which may lead to less efficient aircraft movements ordered by China's already overly cautious controllers. Lately, however, it's apparently meant only one thing: military drills. Military priority . The Chinese air force controls the vast majority of the country's increasingly crowded airspace, leaving only narrow corridors for commercial airliners to take off, land and navigate -- and even those passages can be closed with little advance warning when the military conducts exercises. Hundreds of flights to and from eastern China -- including Shanghai -- were canceled or severely delayed for days in late July during a wave of air drills. Amid a huge public backlash, the military declared an early end to its exercises while blaming summer thunderstorms for most of the flight disruptions. Back at my gate, an hour passed when ground staff mumbled something to a few passengers near the counter -- and just like that, boarding commenced. By 8:15 p.m. everyone had been seated on the aircraft. Stretching my legs from the coveted exit row seat, I secretly congratulated myself for taking a slightly delayed flight that could still overcome its historically dismal performance. My hopes were dashed within minutes. Soon after I promised a flight attendant I'd help her evacuate the plane in the event of an emergency, the purser broke the bad news over the public address system: Everyone has to deplane as the pilot failed to obtain a departure slot due to continuing air traffic restrictions. Amid much grumbling and groaning, we returned to the gate area where the monitor still showed an ""on time"" departure. By now my flight-tracking app had warned me of delays for my flight as well as the next -- also last -- China Southern flight to Shanghai with no estimated new departure times. As the busy terminal slowly turned empty and shops began to close, our two gate agents -- speaking little English -- remained clueless about the flight status, much to the chagrin of non-Chinese passengers on the flight, who appeared to be at a total loss. Take two . Tensions were somewhat deflated when the agents started handing out food. A bottle of water, a pack of digestive crackers and a can of ""eight-treasure porridge"" bought the agents some peace and quiet as frustrated passengers ate and drank. Boarding started abruptly at 10:20 p.m. and completed swiftly for the second time. I sensed a collective sigh of relief as the airplane started taxiing -- but it soon stopped and the wait resumed. As we sat on the tarmac, the cabin staff sounded less optimistic about the flight leaving the airport. Then, lightning flashed and rain started falling. An hour after we boarded the plane for the second time, the pilot finally broke his total silence: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are going back to the gate because of weather."" The cabin exploded with expletives, while my app alerted me about the cancellation of the flight. Back in the deserted terminal, the only airline representative around explained that the last China Southern flight to Shanghai -- though badly delayed -- still had a chance of taking off and the carrier could accommodate all passengers wishing to continue their travel on that flight. ""You're such a liar!"" yelled a man in a black T-shirt, pointing his finger at the agent. ""Where's your conscience? Look at all the kids and elderly stranded here!"" Pounding the counter with his hand, another middle-aged man wearing glasses and a blue shirt demanded financial compensation. When the agent refused, the man barked: ""You call your boss now! Call him in front of all of us now!"" In between his outbursts, the man also chastised fellow travelers for not answering his battle cry: ""How do you expect to be compensated without banding together and making a scene? Each of us is entitled to at least 200 yuan ($32)!"" Irate passengers . The mutiny of our flight was relatively subdued by Chinese standards. In recent years state media has recorded numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers after flight delays or cancellations, ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees. Surprisingly, in the name of preserving ""social harmony,"" Chinese police often turn a blind eye to such egregious behavior that would certainly land the offenders in jail in many other countries.
