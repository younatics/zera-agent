"By . Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . A lawyer arrested by police at his Sydney city office on class A drug charges was, together with a co-accused, part of a 'sophisticated drug syndicate', a court heard on Friday. Australian Government solicitor Nick Gouliaditis, 34, clutched his face and looked stressed while sitting in the dock at Central Local Court, wearing what appeared to be the same clothes he wore when he was arrested more than 24 hours before on Thursday. He cut a very different figure from the happy snaps of him partying, drinking booze and hanging out with his family posted on his Facebook page. Scroll down for video . Mr Gouliadatis leaves Central Local Court on Friday, wearing what appears to be the same shirt he wore when he was arrested on Thursday. Sydney lawyer Nicholaos Gouliaditis, 34, faced Central Local Court today after he was arrested at his Martin Place office on Thursday morning . Mr Gouliaditis, seen here pictured at a celebratory occasion, appeared stressed as he sat in the dock. Mr Gouliaditis, in a 'selfie' on his Facebook page (left) and pictured at a party (right) Gouliaditis has been charged with dealing and possessing drugs, resisting arrest, dealing in the proceeds of crime and possessing a prohibited weapon. Police prosecutor Vanessa Robichuax alleged a Taser was found by police in a safe in his bedroom at his home in Newtown in the city's inner-west. The court was told his co-accused, Andrew James Connell, 24, was arrested on the same day at a unit in the Kings Cross nightclub district. Sgt Robichaux told the bail hearing that the men were involved in a 'sophisticated' criminal operation. Sgt Robichaux said Gouliaditis, whose bail was set at $20,000, also supplied drugs to two different people in a matter of hours despite an alleged buyer warning the 34-year-old he had been apprehended by officers earlier. An image posted on Mr Gouliaditis's Facebook page. Mr Gouliaditis has been accused of being part of sophisticated criminal syndicate, which his lawyers deny . His defence counsel Jeff Tanks told court the alleged 'syndicate' was not sophisticated but instead a 'street level' and 'garden variety' operation. Sgt Robichaux said police evidence against the men included telephone intercepts as well as physical and electronic surveillance. Connell's bail was also set at $20,000. He wore prison greens and sat in the dock stony-faced, as his mother and other members of his family sat in the gallery. Connell, who the court heard has mental health issues, was charged with offences including supplying prohibited drugs and dealing with the proceeds of crime. Sgt Robichaux argued that Connell had supplied drugs to mid-level dealers and was of too high risk to be granted bail. She told court he is unemployed and has been involved in a number of drug related offences before. An image of Mr Gouliaditis being arrested by NSW police on Thursday.

Mr Gouliaditis, pictured here being arrested in Sydney yesterday, appeared to be wearing the same blue shirt in court today. His defence barrister argued Connell had no history of violent offences. Gouliaditis will have to stay at his parents' home in Cronulla and report to local police regularly - among other conditions. Connell will leave Sydney to stay with his father in country NSW under a similarly strict set of terms, including receiving treatment from a mental health professional. The two men are due to face court again in October.

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . The barrister who came second to George Clooney's fiancé  in a poll of London's hottest lawyers today revealed her battle with breast cancer. Marianne Butler, a commercial lawyer, was dealt the devastating blow on September 26 last year, just a month after she was named runner-up to Amal Alamuddin. The 35-year-old told the Evening Standard she has since endured rounds of chemotherapy and pioneering drug therapy at the Royal Marsden hospital. She joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer. Scroll down for video . A month after being voted London's second hottest barrister, Marianne Butler, was diagnosed with grade III breast cancer . Ms Butler, left before treatment, came second in the Your Barrister Boyfriend poll of hottest female briefs in the capital last summer. She was second only to George Clooney's fiance Amal Alamuddin, right . 'I was laughing about it at the time. Generally speaking you either do laugh at dark things or you don't, and I tend to.' While pictures of Miss Alamuddin out with Clooney appeared on websites, in papers and magazines last Autumn, Ms Butler was in the midst of treatment. After doctors discovered a 6cm tumour, detecting the disease in Ms Butler's lymph nodes, she was referred on to a groundbreaking trial at the Marsden. Despite having no family history of the disease, Ms Butler was told her cancer was grade III, with doctors warning she must start chemotherapy just four days later. She was given the drugs pertuzumab and Herceptin, a combination previously only trialled in the U.S. The drugs worked to stop the cancer cells from communicating with other cells in the body, preventing it from spreading while treatment worked. And the treatment, performed by Professor . Ian Smith, was a success, destroying the disease, allowing Mrs Butler . to return to work at the Fountain Court Chambers. Ms Butler joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer' Mrs Butler's husband Tony told MailOnline: 'The key innovation in Marianne’s treatment was the use of pertuzumab straight away. 'Prior . to her diagnosis it was only given for second occurrences or to people . with Stage 4 cancer.  Concurrently with Marianne's diagnosis - just a . few days afterwards - the FDA in the U.S. approved pertuzumab for use as . a first step to shrink a tumour before the main treatment. 'This was following exceptional results during a trial. 'Professor . Smith was not only able to get permission to give pertuzumab to . Marianne for a first occurrence of breast cancer, but persuaded our . insurance company of the benefits such that they agreed to pay for it.' He added that Marianne was the first . person at the Royal Marsden -'and so probably in the country)' - to . receive herceptin and pertuzumab as a joint attack on a primary breast . cancer. She is still taking both drugs to try and prevent any recurrence, so continues to be monitored for side effects. Two of the other drugs which Marianne took during the course of her treatment were developed by Professor Smith and his team. Mrs Butler underwent a new drug regime, which her family believe was key to her recovery . They are currently trialling a new . monoclonal antibody drug, which is intended to direct the chemotherapy . drugs to only attack the offending cancer cells, thereby sparing the . patient the gruelling side effects of chemotherapy. 'It is truly groundbreaking stuff,' added Mr Butler. To raise money for the Marsden, her husband Tony and brother Julian Post joined by Professor Smith and 30 friends, are preparing to take on a charity cycle ride taking in four of the Tour de France's toughest mountains. The event, known as Le Cure De France, will take place from September 10 to 14. Their aim is to collect £100,000 to help other patients benefit from Professor Smith's work. Ms Butler, who lives in Barnes, said: 'I have been very lucky. This is now about the Marsden and other women. That is what these guys are cycling for.

"A midwife who snuck off to get high on laughing gas while on duty helping to deliver babies has been suspended for 12 months. Susannah Wheeler secretly inhaled Entonox, while working at Tameside Hospital, Glossop, Derbyshire, and returned to her duties ‘staggering’ and ‘slurring her speech as though she was groggy,’ the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told. The council was told suspicions about her behaviour were first raised in August 2012, when she was assigned a new patient while on a night shift. Susannah Wheeler secretly inhaled Entonox, while working at Tameside Hospital, Glossop, Derbyshire, and returned to her duties 'staggering' and 'slurring her speech as though she was groggy', the Nursing and Midwifery Council was told . She could not be found on the antenatal ward and the whole maternity unit went searching for the missing midwife for up to an hour. Wheeler eventually returned groggy and told colleagues she ‘did not know where she had been', before claiming she had been in the toilets for the duration. She was later found in a maternity room with a tube in her mouth, sucking the gas, before she spread her arms and fell onto the bed. A colleague then got into a tussle with Wheeler as she refused to release the tube, before begging the colleague not to tell anybody about the incident. Wheeler went missing again a month later. A colleague phoned Wheeler to ask where she was and she replied that she did not know. Three empty bottles of the gas were later found in Wheeler’s car prompting an NMC investigation. NMC panel chairman David Newman said: ‘The panel considered that Mrs Wheeler’s actions in using Entonox gas and being unfit for duty on two occasions had placed patients at risk of harm. ‘Her actions were serious and rendered her incapable of carrying out her duties. The Nursing and Midwifery Council  was told she was found in a maternity room with a tube in her mouth, sucking the gas, before she spread her arms and fell onto the bed. A colleague then got into a tussle with Wheeler as she refused to release the tube, before begging the colleague not to tell anybody about the incident . ‘It further considered that her actions potentially deprived patients of Entonox when it may have been required. ‘The panel concluded that Mrs Wheeler’s actions amounted to a significant departure from the standards to be expected of a registered midwife. ‘It determined that her actions constituted misconduct, in that they fell far short of the standards of conduct expected in the circumstances and those within the remit of the code.’ Mr Newman added: ‘The panel accepted that Mrs Wheeler had developed significant insight into her misconduct. ‘This, together with the genuine expression of regret and remorse, and the reflection she has shown, satisfied the panel that she had demonstrated a good understanding the impact her actions could have had on patients and the reputation of the profession. ‘The panel noted that Mrs Wheeler appeared to be an otherwise capable midwife and was provided with satisfactory references attesting to there being no other concerns regarding her practice. ‘Nevertheless, the panel acknowledges that Mrs Wheeler is currently unable to provide evidence that the circumstances leading to her misconduct have been fully remediated. ‘Mrs Wheeler’s own opinion is that her fitness to practise is currently impaired. ‘In light of all the information available, the panel decided that there was an ongoing need to protect the public. ‘Any immediate return to practice could place patients at risk of harm.’Wheeler, who has been employed at Tameside Hospital since 1999, admitted inhaling Entonox gas while on duty on two occasions. The nurse, who was not present or represented, was handed a 12-month suspension.","Susannah Wheeler inhaled gas, while working at Tameside Hospital, Glossop .

"By . Freya Noble For Daily Mail Australia . For many years Ricky Naputi, who at his heaviest tipped the scales at more than 400 kilograms (900 pounds), battled with his food addiction, and at the time of his death hadn't walked on his own for more than 7 years. His wife Cheryl described looking after him as 'just like taking care of an overgrown baby', and Ricky fell in and out of a deep depression over the state his life was in. The couple live on the island of Guam, just a four hour flight from Brisbane - where 6 out of 10 people are classified as either overweight or obese. Scroll down for video . The world's fattest man, Ricky Naputi, was cared for by his wife Cheryl for many years . Cheryl was Ricky's primary caretaker, and said when they married she knew what she was in for and that she very well may outlive him, if he didn't get his health in check. 'When Ricky and I met he was already a big man. So when he asked me to marry him I knew what I was getting myself into', Cheryl said during a TLC documentary - which tracked the couple's life over Ricky's final years. From there the couple embarked on a difficult and challenging journey to try and get Ricky to lose weight - each doctor giving him the same ultimatum - lose weight, or your life. The man was confined to his bed, and Cheryl did everything for him from cooking his food to cleaning every inch of his huge body, and helping him go to the toilet. Ricky was so huge he was unable to do anything on his own, and became short of breath ever just from speaking . At his heaviest the man weighed in at over 400 kilograms, or 900 pounds . Ricky could barely speak without becoming short of breath, let alone stand up or move from the bed he was confined to. He often needed the assistance of an oxygen machine. But Cheryl and Ricky had dreams to start a family and have children, despite never having consummated their marriage due to Ricky's extreme obesity. In desperation, he reached out to a woman from Houston, Texas, named Angie Flores who lost more than 80 kilograms after undergoing gastric surgery and is now an advocate for others looking to change their lives in the same way. Ricky desperately needed surgery which reduces the size of the stomach by 80 percent, but could not undergo it until he lost at least 40 kilograms on his own first. He battled with severe depression and was confined to his bed for the last years of his life . He desperately needed gastric surgery to remove 80 percent of his stomach but had to lose weight before that could take place . From there the morbidly obese man's life over the next few years took a cyclical and repetitive nature which eventually lead to the breakdown of his marriage, and later, his death. First Dr Duc Vuong, originally a refugee from Vietnam who trained in America as a obesity specialist, took the trip to Guam with Angie to assess the state of Ricky and the possibility of Ricky undergoing surgery. Dr Vuong told Ricky he must shift some weight on his own before he can even consider any procedure, and also laid some of the responsibility on Cheryl as she is the one who cooks for him. She admitted she was not strong enough to resist his begging for food - and lots of it - and said despite being immobile her husband was in control. His wife Cheryl cooked for him and struggled to say no to her husband when he insisted on more food . During one visit he was so heavy he could not even stand on the scales on his own and needed to lean on furniture . 'When it comes to food and Ricky wants something he'll keep going on and on and on and on until I finally give it to him. It's very hard because I am his wife - can I control his eating habits, no I can't.' When Dr Vuong reached out to a clinic on the Island, the head of the facility Dr John Steel gave Ricky the same ultimatum. If he couldn't lose any weight on his own then he could not be helped, it was simply too dangerous to try and perform surgery. The possibility of moving Ricky to Houston for an operation slowly became more and more impossible as he failed to lose weight, and the next step was to reach out to a doctor in Australia. World leading obesity surgeon George Hopkins, from Brisbane Australia, also made the trip to Guam to discuss the possibility of performing the surgery closer to home for Ricky - but again gave the man the same conditions. During the programme, he said: 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed' In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down. Ricky took some pills and stopped breathing. He died aged 39 . When he delivered it Ricky and Cheryl broke down, and said they couldn't handle hearing that Ricky had to lose weight on his own any more as they believed they had done all they could. 'It's hard being stuck here, I can't go nowhere I'm so depressed. I'm stuck in this bed every single day. Every single day', Ricky said through tears earlier in the documentary. In the end, Cheryl and Ricky's marriage broke down and Ricky took 'some pills' and stopped breathing. An hour and a half of CPR by paramedics failed to revive him and he died aged 39. Ricky's story highlights the obesity epidemic sweeping the world - and shows although he was presented with many ways out he could not overcome his demons. He described his relationship with food as 'like a bad drug addicts battle with', and his official cause of death was determined to be morbid obesity following his death on November 10, 2012.","The man from Guam weighed more than 400 kilos (900 pounds) at heaviest .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . High speed cameras allow researchers to see things that they would normally miss, from the beating wings of a hummingbird to how a boat cuts through water. Now researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The device uses a new technique to take high-speed images so it can capture chemical reactions and heat conduction, which were impossible to photograph before. Researchers in Japan have developed what they believe is the world’s fastest camera, which can take 4.4 trillion images a second. The large machine contains a pulse source, temporal and spatial mapping devices and an image sensor (illustrated) to take high resolution photographs at the rate of 4.4 trillion frames a second . The new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. It visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile’. The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera, while still being able to produce high resolution images. The previous fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’ where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then ‘probed’ for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image. Up until now, the fastest cameras used a ‘pump-probe process’, where light is pumped at the object being photographed and then probed for absorption by a laser, in order to collect vital data used to construct an image, Phys.org reported. But this technique relies on repetitive measurements to construct an image. Instead, the new camera uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography to capture movement. The camera visually maps the movement of an object over time in a ‘burst stream’ of timed photographs organised in the correct sequence, to show an object’s ‘time varying spatial profile,’ according to the journal Nature Photonics. It was developed by scientists at the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan. The new camera will make it possible for scientists to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. One day it could also be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of computer chips (pictured) including their tiny semiconductors . The device claims to be 1,000 times faster than the previous ‘fastest’ camera. It has high pixel resolution of 450 x 450 pixels to provide scientists with a lot of detail about the object they are photographing. The new camera is called Sequentially Timed All-optical Mapping Photography (Stamp) and will be used to capture chemical reactions and heat conduction that occurs at a sixth of the speed of light. It has taken three years to develop and the next step is make the device smaller, as it measures around three square feet (one square metre). The experts who developed the machine believe it could one day be used in medicine and to gain new insights into the manufacturing of semiconductors, for example. The computer chip components are tiny and by looking at detailed images of the manufacturing process, experts might be able to spot opportunities to make efficiencies.","Scientists from the University of Tokyo and Keio University in Japan created the camera, which uses a technique called motion-based femtophotography .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Forget large, bulky solar panels. Soon anything from clothing to cars could be used to harness energy from the sun. Scientists from Sheffield have developed low-cost, spray-on solar cells that can be applied to surfaces in a similar way to paint. The cells are made of a material called perovskite, which is cheap to produce and, when used as a spray, produces very little waste. Scientists from Sheffield have developed low-cost, spray-on solar cells that can be applied to small surfaces (pictured) in a similar way to paint. The cells are made of a material called perovskite, which is cheap to produce and, when used as a spray, produces very little waste . This, along with the fact the spray can be easily mass produced, means manufacturing costs are low, which ultimately means prices would be lower for customers. In theory, the spray could be used on any surface that the cells can stick to, however, its efficiency is likely to be affected on flexible surfaces, or fabrics. Around 85 per cent of photovoltaics currently used are made from crystalline silicon. It is expensive to produce and typically has a conversion rate of 25 per cent, on average. The material used in the spray-on cells is perovskite. Perovskite is a term used to describe the mineral crystal structure found in the calcium titanium oxide mineral species, made of calcium titanate. It was first used for solar cells in 2009, but efficiency was poor. Oxford researchers then used polymers to make solid cells, which were eventually engineered to efficiencies of 16 per cent. Efficient organometal halide perovskite-based photovoltaics were  demonstrated in 2012. The Sheffield team found that by spray-painting the perovskite they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent.

Perovskite is a term used to describe the mineral crystal structure found in the calcium titanium oxide mineral species, made of calcium titanate. The team of Sheffield scientists is the first to make perovskite solar cells using this spray-painting process. Spray nozzle and head pictured . Lead researcher Professor David Lidzey said: ‘There is a lot of excitement around perovskite-based photovoltaics. ‘Remarkably, this class of material offers the potential to combine the high performance of mature solar cell technologies with the low embedded energy costs of production of organic photovoltaics.’ While most solar cells are manufactured using energy intensive materials, perovskites, by comparison, require much less energy to make. By spray-painting the perovskite layer in the air, the team hope the overall energy used to make a solar cell can be reduced further. Professor Lidzey added: ‘The best certified efficiencies from organic solar cells are around 10 per cent. The Sheffield team found that by spray painting the perovskite, (illustration pictured) they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent. Perovskite cells, in general, have efficiencies of up to approximately 19 per cent . ‘Perovskite cells now have efficiencies of up to 19 per cent. This is not so far behind that of silicon at 25 per cent - the material that dominates the worldwide solar market.’ He added: ‘The perovskite devices we have created still use similar structures to organic cells. What we have done is replace the key light absorbing layer - the organic layer - with a spray-painted perovskite. ‘Using a perovskite absorber instead of an organic absorber gives a significant boost in terms of efficiency.’ The Sheffield team found that by spray-painting the perovskite they could make prototype solar cells with efficiency of up to 11 per cent. Professor Lidzey said: ‘This study is a significant step towards efficient, low-cost solar cell devices made using high volume roll-to-roll processing methods. ‘I believe that new thin-film photovoltaic technologies are going to have an important role to play in driving the uptake of solar-energy, and that perovskite based cells are emerging as likely thin-film candidates.'","Scientists from Sheffield have developed low-cost, spray-on solar cells .

Facebook purchased the company earlier this year when their $2bn (£1.2bn) deal to buy VR headset firm Oculus was approved. It will first be used for immersive games, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised the headset will 'change the way we work, play and communicate' - although virtual worlds could include advertising admitted Zuckerberg . The purchase of Oculus put Facebook in a battle with Sony, who has already unveiled its own version of a VR headset, destined for the PS4 next year. It also discovered that the display still features the Samsung logo. The device's 5.7-inch screen is a super AMOLED touchscreen with 1080 x 1920 pixels. This gives it a pixel-per-inch density of 368, and is full HD. By comparison, Apple’s iPhone 5S has 326 PPI, and the HTC One M8 has 441. The teardown also revealed a new positional tracking unit, which is a custom-made external infrared camera, designed specifically for the DK2.

"By . Andy Dolan for the Daily Mail . A Lithuanian burglar who was released from prison early and deported has been caught back in Britain just 12 days later. Police believe Marius Siurkus, 32, may have hoped to retrieve stolen jewellery he hid under floorboards. He was arrested at his former address in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, last week after being identified as a suspect in an assault. Shocked and fearful: Alexandra Kalandrani, left, was robbed by Marius Siurkus, right, who served hardly any of his prison term before being sent back to Lithuania - only to return days later . Police noticed the floorboards had been disturbed and discovered loot from the burglary last March beneath them. Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, has twice been freed from prison early and deported – only to return to the UK and continue offending. Yesterday the men’s victims and a local MP expressed their astonishment at the ease with which they came back. Their most recent victim, dancer Alexandra Kalandrani, 26, said: ‘It’s massively frustrating to learn that both people who burgled my house have been let out early and sent home, only to come straight back to Britain. ‘I don’t understand how someone can walk back into the country so easily despite being deported.’ The jewellery found by police has been returned to Miss Kalandrani. It was a gift from her mother, who died from cancer in June. More items are still missing. Stewart Jackson, the Tory MP for Peterborough, said: ‘It is quite clear that the current system is not working . . . Clearly it is good for the taxpayer if criminals are deported instead of serving in prison, but there needs to be a watch list of people who cannot come back.’ Accomplice: Mantas Pronckus was also jailed for the raid on Miss Kalandrani's home . Siurkus and Pronckus, 27, were jailed for a year and two years respectively in June for breaking in to the home Miss Kalandrani shares with her sister Rena, 24, a shop assistant manager. Siurkus was deported on August 3, less than six weeks into his sentence, under an early removal scheme intended to cut costs and free up space in prisons. He was arrested again on August 15. Siurkus has now been recalled to prison to serve out his sentence. He was not charged in connection with the assault investigation. Pronckus was originally jailed for 20 months in May 2012 after being convicted of two burglaries. He was arrested over another burglary the next April, and in August 2013 was sentenced to eight months in jail for that offence. He was again released early and deported – only to target the Kalandranis’ home seven months later. He remains in prison and will be considered for deportation. In a letter to Mr Jackson, James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said the early removal scheme means foreigners can be released up to 270 days before the halfway point of their sentence. They should not return until the sentence has expired. He said: ‘I have asked Border Force to investigate how he has managed to return to the UK before his sentence expiry date.’ Shahadot Ahmed, 24, who was burgled by Pronckus in 2012, said: ‘It worries me that the system allows these people to go free.’ A Home Office spokesman said it has deported more than 19,000 foreign criminals since 2010. The spokesman said this was ‘saving the taxpayer money, freeing up prisons and removing the opportunity for re-offending’. Sentimental: This solid silver necklace, which Miss Kalandrani's late mother gave to her, was among the loot stolen by Sirukus and Pronckus.

"By . Ian Drury . and David Williams . and Glyn Strong . 'Stateless': Sapper Poloko Hiri is now being denied citizenship in the UK due to a speeding fine which he received in April 2011 . He has served in the British Army for four years with an ‘exemplary record’, but Poloko Hiri has now been ordered out of the UK – because of a speeding offence. The 32-year-old from Botswana has had his application for citizenship rejected by the UK Border Agency who claimed the single offence was a sign of ‘bad character’. Officials ruled the soldier should be bracketed with murderers, rapists and drug dealers – ordering him to quit the country by next Friday. It is a decision that effectively leaves Sapper Hiri stateless as he faces certain arrest, prosecution and up to 25 years in jail if he returns to Botswana which deems enlisting in a foreign army a criminal offence. His case has left the Government accused once again of ‘betraying’ the military, following round after round of spending cuts. And it comes days after the furore over Fiji-born Lance Corporal Bale Baleiwai, 32, a veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, who was threatened with deportation last month because he was disciplined by his commanding officer for a fight with a colleague in 2010. Following an outcry, he was granted an 11th hour reprieve. Campaigners for Sapper Hiri contrast his case with that of foreigners who have been allowed to stay despite awful crimes, such as Iraqi Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, who left a girl of 12 to die under the wheels of his car. Sapper Hiri’s supporters have urged David Cameron to intervene, pointing out the UKBA’s decision is at odds with the Premier’s pledge to uphold the Military Covenant, society’s duty of care to servicemen. Sapper Hiri said: ‘For speeding, I am being treated the same as a  murderer or drug lord or a burglar. ‘I am trapped. If I go back home I’ll be thrown in jail. If I stay here, I’ll be breaking the law.’ The veteran, who has a six-month-old baby girl Peo in London with his ex-girlfriend, enlisted as a Commonwealth serviceman in the Royal Engineers in August 2008. On exercise: Spr Hiri with the Royal Engineers in Canada last year . He was eager to fulfil his dream of being a soldier but was too old to join the Botswana Defence Force. He said: ‘Iraq and Afghanistan were still going on. I knew I might have to put my life on the line and go to a warzone. I was prepared for that.’ Sapper Hiri, who lives in Leeds, became a design draughtsman – drawing up plans for bases, roads and other construction projects – and joined 73 Armoured Engineer Squadron, 21 Engineer Regiment. He completed exercises in the UK and Canada. In August 2011, he gave 12 months notice he wanted to leave the Army to take a degree in archaeological technology at London South Bank University – a move ‘fully supported’ by commanders. In April this year, he applied for British citizenship ahead of his Army leaving date, August 31. But the UKBA rejected his bid because he had received a £100 fine and five penalty points for speeding on the M1. He had been doing 81mph in a 50mph roadworks zone at 1.30am. His officer commanding, Major Chloe Plimmer, wrote to the agency praising his ‘exemplary record of conduct’ in the Army. The Army was ‘genuinely concerned’ that Sapper Hiri could be arrested and prosecuted if he was sent home to Botswana. Veterans Aid chief executive Dr Hugh Milroy, who has been helping fight Sapper Hiri’s case, said: ‘We recruited Poloko and now we are treating him as if he is illegal. ‘It springs to my mind these people appear disposable, almost like slavery, and no-one seems to care.’ Since January, Veterans Aid has dealt with 70 former Commonwealth soldiers who face being thrown out of Britain. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘Each claim for settlement is considered on individual circumstances and in line with published policy.’","Sapper Poloko Hiri could be sent back to Botswana .

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Inept: Grant Nanson, 21, of Sunderland, caught the crime on his mobile phone's camera by mistake . A bungling burglar who inadvertently filmed himself raiding a commercial yard on his mobile phone has been jailed after officers found the footage. Grant Nanson, 21, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, accidentally caught his crime on camera when he pressed record while trying to find the torch feature on his iPhone. Nanson, who was arrested shortly after the burglary was discovered on April 14 this year, had stolen a Mini, a Vauxhall Astra and a motorcycle from the premises. Graham O’Sullivan, prosecuting, said: ‘Police searched his home and found the iPhone, on which he had inadvertently recorded himself committing the burglary whilst trying to turn on the phone’s torch feature.' The two cars, which were valued at £11,000, were recovered - but a motorbike that was valued at £500 was never found. An Audi A4 was also damaged during the removal of the stolen vehicles. Barry Robson, defending, told Newcastle Crown Court that there were probably other people involved in the offence and called it the most ‘inept’ burglary he had ever seen. Nanson was also sentenced for a separate offence of affray, along with his father James Nanson, 42.

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A cash-strapped council has fronted £150,000 for a BBC police drama to be filmed in the town after making cuts in the budget for CCTV. Earlier this month it was revealed Ceredigion County Council had axed all funding for surveillance cameras in a bid to save £9.6million. But this week residents learned filming for the second series of Hinterland will begin in the seaside town of Aberystwyth, with the council agreeing to fund the production if an application for a European Grant is turned down. Scroll down for video . Council bosses in Aberystwyth have agreed to pay £150,000 for the production after announcing budget cuts . The first series of Hinterland, starring Richard Harrington as DCI Tom Mathias (pictured), was filmed in the area in 2013 and allegedly brought money into the local economy . The first series of Hinterland was filmed in the Welsh town in 2013. An English version of the crime drama appeared on the BBC while others tuned into a Welsh version on SC4, drawing in around 500,000 viewers between them. When filming for the second season came into uncertainty, the council guaranteed the money claiming the 'economic benefits' of having the production in the area were worth the cost. Residents have slammed the decision as 'totally inappropriate'. 'Both the BBC and SC4 already receive huge taxpayer subsidies, so council tax residents in Ceredigion will now be doubly hit hard,' said Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers Alliance. 'When public finances are so stretched it’s totally inappropriate for the Council to be funding TV shows and they need to reconsider their position immediately.' Among budget cuts recently announced was a £150,000 reduction to CCTV, the cancellation of £44,000 in funding for a local swimming pool, an £80,000 reduction to road gritting services and the closure of two libraries. But the council said paying for the filming will make them money, with an estimated £1million generated for the local community from the last series. Residents in the town described the decision as 'totally inappropriate' when the council faces such severe budget cuts . Aberystwyth is a popular tourist resort on the west coast of Wales. It was the backdrop for the drama in its first series . A spokesman said: 'The council is pleased to be in a position to provide this underwriting facility for this successful drama series. 'A study by ARAD Research into the economic impact of Hinterland on Aberystwyth and the surrounding area concluded that the first series generated an economic benefit of just over £1m which was a welcome injection into the local economy. 'It is hoped the economic benefit will be even greater as a result of this second series.' 'If the European Grant application is fully approved as submitted there will be no call on the council’s underwritten sum.'","Officials to fund second series of Hinterland to film in Aberystwyth .

"By . Bianca London . A young woman who become a shell of her former self after losing her hair as she fought leukaemia has set up a blog to share the secrets of how she keeps herself looking beautiful and glamorous. Despite undergoing months of chemotherapy, 21-year-old Emily Parker was determined to write about her experiences and inspire other cancer sufferers to 'bring normality back' by looking good. Emily illustrated the site with photographs of her own hair falling out and her various experiments with make-up and wigs to hide the ravages of the disease. Beauty blogger: Emily Parker, 21, has set up a blog to share the secrets of how she keeps herself looking beautiful and glamorous - while battling cancer . The fine art student soon had around 4,500 followers, with other cancer sufferers logging on to read her hair and make-up tips. Topics addressed on site include 'Best Hair-Growth Treatment', 'Top 10 Hospital Essentials' and 'Goodbye Hair'. Emily, of Uckflied, East Sussex, decided to set up her blog after she began scouring the internet to look for tips for leukaemia sufferers. Documenting her journey: Emily lost her hair and was left a shell of her former self as she fought leukaemia but used a beauty blog to help her on her journey and inspire others in her position . Battle: Emily (pictured, left, before her illness) was diagnosed in her second year at university and spent the next five months in and out of hospital undergoing four chemotherapy sessions to counter the killer disease (right) She said: 'After I found out about the leukaemia I tried to look it up but couldn't really find anything. 'There were plenty of leaflets offering advice, but they were too heavy and I found there wasn't anything for people my age as leukaemia is more common in people aged 40 plus. 'I decided to set up my blog as I found different brands worked better when going through chemo. I found some shampoos and hair growth treatment worked far better than others and I wanted to share that. 'I also found there were some particularly good moisturisers to use during chemo as my skin went really dry so I was having to moisturise all the time. Blogger: Emily decided to set up her blog after she began scouring the internet to look for tips for leukaemia sufferers . Tried and tested: The fine art student has around 4,500 followers, with other cancer sufferers logging on to read her hair and make-up tips . 'I've always worn make-up, even if it was just to pop to the shops, so as soon as I had the strength I put on make-up. 'It made me feel so much better about myself - bringing normality back into my life.' Emily had just completed her second year at Aberystwyth University in Wales when she was diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukaemia last June. She spent the next five months in and out of hospital undergoing four chemotherapy sessions to counter the killer disease. Emily, who is now in remission, said: 'Just before I was diagnosed I was just feeling quite run down and I got more tired than I usually would. Before and after: Emily documented the most upsetting aspect of her cancer battle - having to shave off what was left of her long brown hair and rounded up her hero products . 'I went to doctors a couple of times but they kept saying I had tonsillitis and said it would clear up. 'I continued to feel unwell so I was taken back to the doctors and they told me to go to A&E where they took some blood tests. 'After a couple of hours someone came in and said a specialist was going to come and speak to me - I immediately knew something was seriously wrong. 'I was told I had a type of cancer called leukaemia. I couldn't say anything, I was just hysterical - I cried for hours.' Happily Emily's subsequent treatment was successful and as she felt better she decided to help other young cancer sufferers who feel sapped of confidence. Tips: Emily loves her Trendco wig and shares her advice with followers . She began by giving tips on the best nail varnish for weak nails, recommending moisturisers for dry skin and the most comfy bras to wear in hospital beds. Emily also documented the most upsetting aspect of her cancer battle - having to shave off what was left of her long brown hair. Emily wrote: 'My hair started falling out after my third dose of chemo and I eventually decided to take it all off at the end of September. 'Since then it has been growing back and the only product I have used on it has been Lee's [Stafford] Hair Growth shampoo, conditioner and treatment. 'Now don't get me wrong, this is the first time I've ever been bald before, so I have no experience up until now, or no idea how fast hair should grow, but after using this product for about 3 months (as my hair didn't grow back straight away) I think it's grown really well and it is all down to these products!'. Furry friends: Emily sometimes calls on her pets to help out with her blog . Beautifying: Emily, who says she doesn't even head to the shops without make-up, shows her followers how to perfect the art . In her 'Top 10 Hospital Essentials for Cancer Patients' post Emily recommended Veet Hair Removal Cream as she struggled to shave her legs whilst in hospital. She wrote: 'Shaving posed another problem. On my medication I became very shakey [sic] at times, which made shaving my legs without taking a chunk of skin off a problem. This is where Veet comes in.' She also recommended Sally Hansen Miracle Cure strengthening nail varnish for her unusually dry nails and Bastille Dry Shampoo for when showering became a problem and Palmer's Cocoa Butter Intensive Relief Hand Cream for her dry skin. Favourites: She began by giving tips on the best nail varnish for weak nails, recommending moisturisers for dry skin and the most comfy bras to wear in hospital beds . After her blog proved a success, Emily decided to take a make-up course in Brighton and is considering a career in theatrical make-up. She's also planning to complete the third year of her degree but will have to return to hospital for tests every three months for the next three years until she's out of remission. Acute promyelocytic leukaemia is one of the most treatable forms of the disease with a 12-year progression-free survival rate estimated at around 70 percent. Symptoms include anaemia, fatigue, weakness, dyspnea (shortness of breath), fever and a susceptibility to bleeding and bruising. Emily said: 'I found doing my blog really comforting - when you type you can cry all you want and can carry on. 'I wanted to provide a place for people to go to where certain questions could be answered. 'I've had lots of messages from people saying how the blog had helped them and that they had taken my advice. 'I'm not saying people should be preoccupied their looks but when you're living with cancer, it is a way to feel normal again. 'Hair and looks matter a great deal to young women, and I saw this as a way to inspire and empower people.'

"By . Rob Cooper . Accused: Nile Ranger, 22, who now plays football for Swindon Town, claims that his alleged victim consented to sex . The woman who accused footballer Nile Ranger of raping her went willingly to his hotel room on the night she 'attacked', a jury heard today. The alleged victim then posted pictures of herself online dancing on a beach a month after the attack, Newcastle Crown Court heard today. Former Newcastle United striker Ranger, 22, who now plays for League One side Swindon Town, denies rape and says the woman consented to sex. In CCTV footage shown to the court, the jury saw the victim was unsteady on her feet in a nightclub before following Ranger out and into a taxi on the night of the attack. She was then seen crouching down, picking up the contents of her bag, outside the hotel before following him down a hotel corridor and into the hotel room. Toby Hedworth, defending, told the victim: 'It is apparent that you followed him up the corridor. 'You were not being dragged or helped along the corridor. You were not being forcibly taken anywhere. 'He says you were enthusiastically participating in the sex that took place.' The victim told the jury she returned to the hotel after the alleged attack with a friend to check who was on the desk the previous night. During evidence via videolink she told the court how her friend spotted Ranger standing at the desk. She said: 'Nile Ranger was at that desk and he was booking another room that night for the same thing to happen to somebody else. 'I wasn't going to let it happen to someone else. 'My brother noticed the state I was in. When I came in the house I was even missing a nail. I was in such a state I went straight into the bedroom, I couldn't even speak to him. 'I tried to convince myself it was a one night stand just to make myself feel better but I knew it wasn't a one night stand. 'It is not in my behaviour or my character. I knew what had happened but I tried to put it to the back of my head. I was so confused. All I wanted to do is dust it under the carpet. 'I didn't want my name tarnished in the press. My friend came to my house and told me there were precautions where my name wouldn't be released to the press. That's what made me go to the police.' Toby Hedworth, defending, told the court the victim went on holiday just a month after the attack is alleged to have taken place at the Carlton Hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle, in January last year. He said: 'This is not someone who has been devastated by what's happened. 'This is someone who didn't want a relationship with Nile Ranger and got on with your life.' He told the jury she posted photos of herself and a friend dancing on a beach while on holiday the following month. In response the victim told the court how she went on holiday to try and forget about what had happened. Gary . Langham, who was a night porter at the Carlton Hotel at the time of the . attack, later described Ranger as 'cocky' and 'a typical arrogant . footballer full of drink with a bird on his arm'. Trial: Nile Ranger, seen here (right) competing for the ball during a match for Newcastle against Fulham, denies rape . Mr Langham told the court that he was on duty on the night of the alleged rape and that Ranger appeared 'loud and boisterous' whereas the girl appeared 'mortal drunk'. When asked if he had concerns for the victim he said: 'She was mortal she was beyond p***ed. I said, ""Is everything alright?"" to Nile. 'I didn't decide to do anything but when I went outside to get some fresh air I  saw a police car going past. I flagged it down and told them Nile was inside with a lass and asked them if they could kick them out and check if everything was alright. 'I have heard he gets leary and I couldn't be bothered with him kicking off.' The court heard how Mr Langham told the police that the victim wasn't  distressed and that she appeared coherent but drunk and that she had gone with  Ranger willingly. When asked what he meant by 'leary' Mr Langham said: 'Nile is a typical arrogant footballer; that is what they are like. A gob***** coming in full of drink with a bird on his arm.' A friend of the victim told the court how she received a text the morning after  the alleged attack from the victim. In the text the victim told her that 'something bad had happened' and 'I have  had sex with Nile.' Her friend told the court how she went to visited the victim that morning and  found her hiding in the corner of her bedroom. Her friend told the court: 'I could tell by her texts there was something  wrong. She is usually very bubbly but she was emotionless even through message. 'When I went to see her she said she had slept with Nile and it wasn't like her  at all. She said I can't remember what happened and she was bursting into  tears. She was shaking and crying her eyes out. 'The more she was trying to remember the more upset and distressed she was getting.' Ranger denies a single charge of rape. The case continues.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . A furious mother who ordered a Domino’s pizza for her family opened the boxes to find half of their food already eaten before it had even arrived. Karen Carman ordered a £20 pizza, garlic bread and dips from the takeaway outlet in Blackpool, Lancashire after celebrating a bingo win. But when the food was delivered they were disgusted to find the box covered in greasy fingerprints - and someone had tucked into half of their garlic bread and finished the dip. Scroll down for video . Karen Carman's Domino's order of garlic bread and dip (pictured) which arrived half-eaten by staff members . Mrs Carman phoned the store in Devonshire Road to complain and was told the branch had a ‘hot holding rack’ to store food, which staff are allowed to eat from. It was explained that her order had been delivered by mistake after a member of staff had begun eating half the food and forgotten about it. She said: ‘We were about to open the boxes, however, there was a greasy residue over the leaflet and some of the boxes. ‘On opening the box containing the garlic bread we were absolutely horrified to find that this had been opened and half eaten. ‘Along with it was an empty container of the garlic dip, the lid of which was stuck to the top lid of the box and empty plastic container was next to the half-eaten garlic bread. ‘It was obvious that it was someone’s half-eaten meal and we were all sickened and disgusted. ‘We certainly didn’t want to eat anything else after that. Karen Carman ordered the takeaway to celebrate a bingo win but was left disgusted when it arrived. She called the branch to complain and was told that it had been delivered by mistake after staff had started eating it . ‘The thought that we had been delivered something half-eaten and covered in dirty grease made us all feel ill.’ The mother asked the store’s manager to investigate, before reporting the incident to Blackpool council’s environmental health department. She said: ‘She [the manager] phoned me to tell me that she was very sorry but they have a “hot holding” rack for storing food and it appeared that staff eat from this and on this occasion a member of staff had half-eaten a garlic bread and put it back and forgotten about it.’ A spokeswoman for environmental health confirmed that staff had visited the store and given management advice on keeping employees’ food separate from customer orders. Mrs Carman said: ‘I am appalled that this practice is allowed to go ahead. ‘In my opinion it is unacceptable for a fast food outlet to allow staff to be taking food that is destined for customers.’ The takeaway was last inspected for its hygiene and food safety in April this year when it received a five out of five stars and was rated ‘very good’. Tracey Matthews, a spokeswoman for the fast food outlet, said: ‘At Domino’s Pizza our aim is to provide 100 per cent customer satisfaction, so it greatly concerns us when any aspect of our service falls below expectations.’ Mrs Carman was offered a full refund, together with £20 credit and some vouchers to donate to charity.

"By . Margot Peppers . Virginity pledges have long been a contentious subject, and now a new study has shown that they may do more harm than good. According to findings recently published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies, only people who have genuinely strong religious beliefs actually keep their promise. For others - even those who attend church regularly but don't consider themselves devout - virginity pledges are more often broken, leading to risky behavior and a greater likelihood of having unprotected sex. Saving themselves: A new study has found only people with truly strong religious beliefs keep their virginity pledges. Those who are religiously committed but not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior . The study involved 1,380 students between the ages of 18 and 24, all of whom attended a 'large, public Southeastern state university'. When the participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their sexual behavior, more than a quarter said they had signed a virginity pledge - which is about the same as the statistic nationwide among young people in that age group. The problem arises when those who aren't totally committed break their vow; if they haven't had comprehensive sex education, they have little incentive not to have unprotected sex. 'For pledge signers with low religious commitment, there are unintended negative consequences with regard to increased participation in risky sexual behaviors,' reads the study. It also found that these people are even more likely to engage in dangerous sexual behavior than people of the same age who have never taken such a pledge. A study published in the Pediatrics journal 2008 had similar results; it found that more than half of young people become sexually active before marriage regardless of whether or not they have taken a pledge. However, while 34per cent of people who do not take a pledge say they always used a condom, only 24per cent of those who have taken a pledge said the same. 'Taking a pledge doesn't seem to make any difference at all in any sexual behavior,' said Janet E Rosenbaum, one of the authors of the report. 'But it does seem to make a difference in condom use and other forms of birth control that is quite striking.'","According to findings recently published in the Journal of Child and Family Studies, young people who take a pledge but are not devout are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior ."
"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . An American woman whose beaten body was found stuffed into a suitcase in Bali was repeatedly violently abused by the daughter accused of killing her, old police reports have revealed. Police in Oak Park, Chicago were called to the home once shared by Sheila von Wiese-Mack, 62, and her daughter Heather Mack 86 times in 10 years. But despite the repeated calls, von Wiese-Mack often said in police reports that she didn't want officers to arrest her daughter, who is now locked up in Bali accused of the grisly murder. Her mother's body was found last week inside a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi in front . of an upscale hotel in the exclusive Nusa Dua . district. Her body is expected back in the U.S. on Wednesday. History of violence: U.S. police reports have shown that Heather Mack, pictured in a Bali police station last week, allegedly pushed her mother over and broke her arm. She is now accused of killing her . Records of the old calls, obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times, reveal episodes in which the daughter allegedly attacked her mother and stole her credit cards, money and jewelry. In a particularly brutal call in 2010, she reported that her daughter had . punched her already-broken ankle during an argument over household . chores. The following year, the teenager allegedly pushed her mother to the floor, breaking her arm - and leading to police to take her into custody. But on other occasions, the mother insisted her daughter was not arrested because she didn't see how her going to jail would help the situation. Happier times: Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured right, also told police that her daughter, left, had repeatedly bit her and punched her already-broken ankle during a fight about chores. Her body was found in Bali last week . Former home: When the mother and her daughter lived at this home in Oak Park, Illinois, police were called there 86 times in 10 years, records have revealed. They moved out last year . Heather Mack's Chicago attorney, Michael D. Elkin, would not comment on the records but did express concern about her treatment at the hands of Indonesian officials. Mack, who is now 19 and two months pregnant, has been sexually assaulted in police custody at least three times, hasn't been given enough water and has been forced to take pills she doesn't recognize, he said. 'Heather . stated in our last conversation that she found what appeared to be . needle marks on various areas of her body,' he said in a statement, adding that she sounded dazed and incoherent at times . Col. Djoko Hari Utomo, the police chief in Bali's provincial capital, Denpasar, denied the sexual abuse claim. 'We never treat her like that,' Utomo said. 'We even treat her better than treatment for other detainees here.' Haposan Sihombing, an Indonesian lawyer assigned to accompany Mack and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer - who is also accused of the murder - also denied the abuse allegations. Grisly: The battered body of Sheila von Wiese-Mack was found inside this suitcase outside a hotel last week . Accused: Mack and her boyfriend, Tommy Schaefer (left and right), have both been arrested over the killing . Addressing her reported pregnancy, Utomo said she would be provided health care.

"By . Sophie Borland for the Daily Mail . Patients whose hearts have stopped beating will be given a dummy drug as part of a controversial NHS trial. Paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water instead of the standard injection of adrenalin before carrying out CPR, according to a report by the Caerphilly Observer’s Gareth Hill. The trial, which will begin this Autumn on 8,000 patients who have suffered a cardiac arrest, is aimed at assessing whether adrenalin shots actually increase survival rates. Although it is widely used by paramedics and doctors, concerns have been raised that it has limited effect and may even cause brain damage. Trial: Paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water instead of the standard injection of adrenalin before carrying out CPR (file picture) But the study is regarded as highly controversial as patients and their relatives will not be told whether they are been given adrenalin or the placebo. Neither will emergency crews administering the shots. It is being funded by the Department of Health's National Institute of Health Research and will begin this autumn in ambulance service areas in London, the South Coast, the North East, the West Midlands and Wales. Researchers at Warwick University who are overseeing the study said there would be local advertising campaigns in these areas telling patients how to opt out of the trial if they so wished. Dr Martin Underwood, who is leading the trial said: 'We do not know that adrenalin does improve survival. 'It is possible that it improves short-term survival but few patients leave hospital and it may be at the cost of neurological damage. Staffordshire Ambulance officers work with heart attack equipment (file picture) 'It may in fact be something that is custom and practice that is actually harming people. 'There are sufficient grounds for concern that what we are doing at the moment is detrimental to people. 'We wouldn't expect people would be put at unnecessary risk by this.' He stressed that the data would be regularly reviewed at regular intervals so that if the trial showed patients being given adrenalin were much more likely to survive it would be halted. Around 50,000 people in Britain suffer a cardiac arrest outside hospital every year and only around 6 per cent survive. Adrenalin injections have been given as part of the Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation process or CPR since the 1960s, but recently doubts have been raised over their effectiveness. Research from Japan in 2012 on 417,000 patients found that although it initially restarted their hearts, adrenalin actually reduced their survival odds and increased the likelihood of them suffering brain damage. The study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, examined adrenalin use in people going into cardiac arrest before they arrived at the hospital. Data showed that patients who were given adrenalin were less likely to survive a month, and if they were to survive, were more likely to suffer neurological problems. Professor Gavin Perkins, who is one of those leading the trial and specialises in Critical Care Medicine at Warwick University, said: 'The need to do this research is underpinned by a serious concern that although using adrenalin might help restart the heart in the short term, it causes severe brain damage leading to death a few hours or days later. 'We want the best possible outcomes for all people who have a cardiac arrest, both now and in the future. 'All patients will receive the treatment that is proven to improve survival from cardiac arrest, CPR and defibrillation. 'Adrenalin is an unproven treatment for cardiac arrest and may be harmful, which is why there is a need for this study.' One dilemma with the study is that relatives of patients who die may not necessarily be told that they were given a placebo drug. Dr David Hunter, Professor of Medical Ethics at Flinders University in Adelaide, Australia, said the study was 'probably ethically justifiable – although ethically challenging because of the potential for harms to those who can't consent to them'. He said: 'I'm not that keen on using passive means to inform relatives that their now deceased loved ones were part of a trial. 'While there are costs and indeed risks as they note in doing this directly the risks are incurred by doing it indirectly and I think it's a matter of respect that you inform people.' The Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, the London Ambulance Service, the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust, the North East Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust and the South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust will be taking part in the trial. Paramedics and clinicians will be blind to whether they are administering adrenalin or placebo. Nigel Rees, of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: 'Given the uncertainty of the evidence and the life-threatening nature of the condition being treated, it is important that we obtain the best evidence we can to provide the best treatment possible. 'When doctors, nurses and paramedics do not know whether a treatment is effective it is common to undertake a research study. 'We will always endeavour to act in the best interests of our patients, their safety of which is paramount.' The trial – which will cost more than £2.75 million – is expected to run until at least 2016.","Paramedics will give them a placebo containing salt water .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary for MailOnline . A Miami man who prosecutors say strangled a University of Florida student in a fit of jealousy over a woman choosing the victim over him was convicted Friday of first-degree murder. The family of slain 18-year-old Christian Aguilar watched in the courtroom as 20-year-old Pedro Bravo was convicted. After a two-week trial, the jury in Gainesville also convicted Bravo of six other counts related to Aguilar's death. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty and Judge James Colaw sentenced Bravo to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Aguilar's parents and family were silent as the verdicts were read. They left the courtroom hugging and began crying outside. Bravo watched the clerk read the verdict with no reaction. He appeared calm. Aguilar's father, Carlos Aguilar, addressed the court before Bravo's sentencing. 'I cannot tell you the quantity of pain that we have been going through,' he said. The victim's brother Alexander said, 'It’s been agonizing - so much pain and agony' according to The Miami Herald. 'I am now a student at the University of Florida. I would have loved to spend time with my brother here but that is never going to happen. I trusted the jury and they didn’t fail me.' The victim's mother, Claudia Aguilar, said '[Bravo] made the most terrible decision for me and my family,' according to the newspaper.

But Pedro was held . accountable. I promised Christian at his burial that there would be . justice' while speaking to The Herald. Bravo had pleaded not guilty, saying he and Aguilar got into a fist fight the day the college student died but that he left Aguilar alive. Bravo remained defiant before his sentencing, rising and walking to the podium to speak. 'I know in my heart I did not do anything to hurt my friend that would cause him to die,' Bravo said to gasps in the courtroom. 'I know in my heart what I did, I know God knows what I did. I'll take life or life without parole, and I'll do it.' Investigators found Aguilar's blood in Bravo's car and presented evidence that Bravo researched ways to drug people and dispose of bodies. Aguilar's body was found in the woods. Victim: Pedro Bravo was convicted of killing college student Christian Aguilar, pictured .

Standing together: Alex Aguilar, second from left, leaves the courtroom with lead Detective Randy Roberts of the Gainesville Police Department at left . Sentenced: Pedro Bravo sits in court after being sentenced to life in prison . Aguilar and Bravo knew each other from their days at Doral Academy, a high school in Miami. Bravo had dated Friman, who was also a student, while at Doral, but she and Aguilar had begun dating when the two moved to Gainesville for college. Prosecutors presented reams of writings by Bravo that showed he was obsessed with Friman, so much so that he decided not to attend Florida International University so he could move to Gainesville and pursue her. But when he arrived, Bravo learned Friman had begun seeing Aguilar. Bravo bought what prosecutor's called a 'murderer's starting pack' including a shovel, duct tape and enough sleeping drugs to knock someone out. For days, Aguilar ducked Bravo's attempts to meet with him. But after a mutual friend approached him on Bravo's behalf, Aguilar reluctantly agreed in an effort to help with Bravo's depression. On September 20, the two spent hours together eating and buying a CD at Best Buy. Prosecutors say the two men were in Bravo's SUV in a Wal-Mart parking lot when Bravo slipped into the backseat, grabbed a strap, and choked Aguilar to death. Taking the stand in his own defense, Bravo said he and Aguilar fought, and that he left his friend lying injured on the ground. But Aguilar was still alive, Bravo said. The Gainesville Police Department released a statement, saying 'The men and women of the Gainesville Police Department stand relieved with the family of Christian Aguilar as a jury found Pedro Bravo guilty of 1st Degree Murder. 'For weeks, members of the Gainesville Police investigated the disappearance of Christian Aguilar and searched tirelessly for him.  It quickly became clear that a missing persons case had turned into a Murder case.  A very detailed investigation was completed that revealed Pedro Bravo was undoubtedly responsible for the murder of Christian Aguilar.' 'I am relieved,' Friman told The Miami Herald. 'I am exhausted. It’s been a long two years but I feel like the weight has finally been lifted off of us.'

"By . Jennifer Newton . The family of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, pictured, have been accused of extortion for charging authors to use his characters . A judge has accused the family of Sherlock Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of extortion by charging authors a fee to use his most famous characters. Heirs to the literary rights of the author had filed an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court in a bid to stop the publication of a book based on the characters Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, insisting they must pay a license to use the characters. But a judge in the US has ruled that due to the copyright expiring on all but the last ten Sherlock Holmes stories, charging publishers and authors to use the characters amounted to extortion. According to the Times, Judge Richard Posner of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals made the comments after author Leslie Klinger refused to pay for the licence in his new book, In The Company of Sherlock Holmes. Previously he had ruled against the estate's argument and said Mr Klinger was free to use the characters. Now the judge has criticised the estate and ordered it to pay $30,000 in costs. Judge Posner said: The Doyle estate's business strategy is plain; charge a modest fee for which there is no legal basis, in the hope that the 'rational' writer or publisher will pay it rather than incur a greater cost in challenging the legality of the demand. 'It's time the estate changed its business model.' However, lawyers for the estate said they were considering an appeal and said the judge's comments were out of touch. Mr Kilnger had previously paid for the licence in his first book A Study In Sherlock, even though he didn't believe he needed to. Leslie Klinger, left, refused to pay the $5,000 demanded by the family of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for his new book, right . But he refused to pay a second time, which led to legal action. Doyle wrote four novels and 56 short stories about the London-based sleuth which were published in the U.S. between 1887 and 1927. U.S. copyright protection for the novels and the first 46 stories has lapsed and they are now in the public domain, but the final ten stories remain under copyright. Mr Klinger argued that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson, played by Benedict Cumberbatch and Martiin Freeman in the BBC show,  were established in the works already in the public domain . For his latest book, Mr Klinger refused to pay and in June a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled in his favour, sparking the latest court action. At the time Judge Posner wrote: 'When a story falls into the public domain, story elements - including characters covered by the expired copyright - become fair game for follow-on authors.' Mr Klinger argued that the essential characteristics of Holmes and Watson were established in the works already in the public domain. Therefore, he says, he and his team are free to write new works based on them. In Britain, works are protected for 70 years after an author's death meaning the works are long out of copyright.","Family of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had insisted authors must pay to use his characters .

"By . J Gardner For Mailonline . What could be America's most isolated seaside home is up for sale and could soon belong to a lucky hermit able to come up with more than $41,000. Maine's tiny Boon Island and its lighthouse, which sit off the coast of the town of York, are up for auction by the federal government until 5:30am Wednesday. At 133-feet, the lighthouse is New England's tallest -- but at six desolate miles off an already sparsely populated coast, is it also its loneliest residence? Lonely home? Boon Island Light Station sits in the Gulf of Maine about six miles off the coast of York, Maine and would make an isolated home perfectly suited for many a sea-loving hermit .

Desolate: The isolate outcropping of granite is located six desolate miles from York, Maine and was once the site of a shipwreck where sailors eventually turned to cannibalism . The goverment opened bidding up again, which ends early Wednesday. Bidding could potentially be extended a second time. In addition to its isolation, Boon Island's dark history could be to blame. The barren outcrop of granite was the site of a shipwreck in 1710. The stranded sailors ultimately resorted to cannibalism.

Khory, who works at the apartment complex on Kalakaua Ave, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car. Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder. However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer. 'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car. Conklin was taken to hospital with cuts, bruises and a head injury. She was hospitalized in serious condition, emergency officials said. This is not Hansen's first run-in with police. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. Wanted: Jill Hansen posted a picture of this car, a BMW 328 Wagon, as well as a waterfront home in Hawaii, in the hours after the alleged attempted murder and before she was arrested on Wednesday . Police used Hansen's car, which she left at the scene after running away, to identify her and track her down . Police arrested 30-year-old Jill Anjuli Hansen shortly after 7 pm on May 14 . The incident occurred in the garage of the Diamond Head Apartments on Kalakaua Ave in Waikiki . Surfer Jill Hansen was arrested for attempted murder . There is also an active restraining order filed by her father. According to the court documents, her father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. She has multiple rants on the social media site. She claims to be a professional surfer and model and lashes out at critics. According to the court documents, Hansen's father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. He has a restraining order against his daughter . Police said Hansen followed the older woman through the parking garage's security gate and then intentionally hit the woman with her car after she had exited her vehicle . Police said Hansen and the older woman do not know each other, and there was no apparent motive . According to Insurance News Net, Hansen is known in Honolulu for being a worry on the roads. A member of the Mau­na­lani Heights Neighborhood Security Watch, who asked not to be identified, said the group alerted its members about Hansen last year after several incidents involving erratic driving and behavior. 'We needed everybody on the lookout for her - that's how scary it was,' the member said. 'All 500 members were eventually brought into the loop of this situation because it was so serious.' 'There were probably over half a dozen people that had been adversely affected by her driving. 'Two people almost run over by her, one person almost had a head-on collision with her.' Hansen was not arrested in connection with those incidents, the member said. Bad reputation: Jill Hansen was allegedly known around her neighborhood for her driving record, and not in a good way, sources say . According to court records, Hansen was cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time on Sunday. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72 mph in a 35 mph zone in Wahiawa. She is set to appear in court for that case in June. She was also ticketed for using a mobile electronic device while driving in July. She received a $147 fine. In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance. In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights. She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center. Besides her driving offenses, Hansen was arrested April 18 for investigation of third-degree assault. She is scheduled to appear for that case in District Court on Friday.

On May 21, Hansen attempted to slip . out of jail in Honolulu by falling in line behind someone who was . walking out the exit, police say. Jail guards immediately recognized the ruse and detained her again. 'She tried to slip out behind someone who was walking through the door,' jail spokesman Toni Schwartz told KHNL-TV.

Five-year-old Jacob Velasquez, of Pembroke Pines, FL., is already playing Beethoven and Mozart, and can learn entire sonatas in one afternoon. Despite playing the piano for just over a year, the pint-sized prodigy is already winning accolades. Mr Velasquez has even been admitted to the National Musician’s Guild, no small feat. Scroll down for video . Prodigy: Jacob Velasquez plays entire sonatas without needing to look at sheet music . It all began one afternoon about a year ago. Mr Velasquez’s mother Tina was in the kitchen and heard music coming from the living room, she thought it was the boy’s father. ‘Willie was at work and I was in the kitchen and I hear the song Willie was playing the night before,’ she told Local 10, adding ‘I came in here and said, 'Jacob, oh my gosh, that's you.’ Soon after able to read music, Mr Velasquez learned Beethoven’s Sonata in only three weeks. The youngster’s photographic memory enables him to look at sheet music only once and he can memorize a song, according to the station. Remarkable: Mr Velasquez learns an entire sonata in one afternoon, it takes others a month . The whiz kid’s parents soon decided to have him audition for the National Musician’s Guild, they told the station. Not an easy task, many adults are intimidated, but not Jacob. ‘""He had to learn 10 classical pieces all by memory,’ father Willie Velasquez told the station. The wunderkind nailed it. ‘He did amazing, actually, he exceeded the expectations,’ the proud father added. Why does he like to play piano?: 'Because I learn all these songs!' Mr Velasquez’s proficiency has him learning entire songs in one class – it takes others a month to learn, according to piano teacher Jaffird Sierra. His feet too short to reach the pedals, Mr Velasquez has to adjust his playing to suit his size limitations. ‘I think he has it in his mind the whole knowledge but he has too short of hands and he is too small and he wants to play,’ Ms Sierra told the station, adding ‘he knows, but he cannot do that.’ Unlike many prodigies, Mr Velasquez enjoys his craft. When asked why, he said ‘Because I learn all these songs!’","Jacob Velasquez, 5, was reading sheet music a year ago .

Aspiring street artist Justin Lewis, 19, was arrested for snatching a £560 iPhone from a shop display. But Lewis - who uses the nickname Enemie - walked free from court because of his graffiti skills. A court heard Lewis has painted dozens of pieces of art around his home city of Newport, south Wales. Scrawler: Aspiring street artist Justin Lewis, 19. The convicted thief who was let off jail after snatching a £560 iPhone from a shop display because a court heard he the potential to be the 'next Banksy' Art or vandalism? Two examples of teenager's Banksy-inspired graffiti on walls in Newport, Wales . Grafitti artist Justin Lewis (pictured) dreamed of being the next Banksy until he was unmasked last year . He was described in court as 'Newport's Banksy' because of his distinctive stencil-style designed. Newport magistrates heard how Lewis has 31 convictions for 61 offences dating back to 2009. But his lawyer Sophie Toms claimed he was about to enroll on an 'art course' to get his life back on track. Magistrates in Newport said they did not want to jail him because of his talent. Chair of the bench Jennifer Lewis said: 'We have taken into account what your solicitor has said about your art.' Lewis was given a 12 month community order with 40 hours unpaid community work. He was told to pay £975 costs including £560 compensation for the iPhone, which was never recovered. Newport magistrates heard how Lewis has 31 convictions for 61 offences dating back to 2009 . The court heard Lewis has painted dozens of pieces of art around his home city of Newport, south Wales . Lewis was linked back to dozens of graffiti pieces through his tag 'Enemie' Instead of being hailed as an artist, Lewis was charged with criminal damage when he was unmasked . Magistrates in Newport said they did not want to jail him because of his talent . In June last year Lewis was caught spraying graffiti and was given 180 hours of unpaid work, a 12-month community order and told to pay £105 in costs by magistrates in Cwmbran, South Wales after he admitted criminal damage. He was also warned to stop doing street art despite the fame of Banksy. Speaking at the time, chairman of the bench Keith Minton told him: 'You are very close to going to prison'. Since Bristol-born Banksy made his name with his trademark stencil-style 'guerrilla' art in public spaces - on walls in London, Brighton, Bristol and even on the West Bank barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians - his works have sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds. He has dozens of celebrity collectors including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera. Ironic: One artwork features the words 'can't catch this vandal' by a CCTV camera .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Mazafer Maroof, 31, from Stoke-on-Trent, has been jailed after raping and filming an assault on a 16-year-old girl . A married father-of-two has been jailed after raping and filming a sexual assault on a 16-year-old girl as she slept in her bed. Mazafer Maroof, 31, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, raped the teenager after plying her with alcohol at a house party in April this year. He then used his mobile phone to record a second sexual assault on the teenager. During the trial, the jury saw video footage which showed the girl was asleep at the time of the two attacks. Maroof denied carrying out the attacks, but was found guilty of rape and sexual assault after a trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. He was jailed for seven years and also placed on the sex offenders' register for life. During the trial, the court heard how Maroof had 'pestered' the girl at the house party. Once her friends told Maroof to leave the girl alone, he left the party - but continued to send her dozens of 'vile and abusive' text messages. He later returned to the party and persuaded the teenager and her friend to let him take them to a supermarket to buy more alcohol. The trio then went back to a house to continue drinking. Once the girl fell asleep, and her friend left the property, Maroof raped his victim. Sentencing him, Judge David Fletcher said: 'You have no empathy for your victim and you don’t have any remorse. 'It is clear that you were in a dark place, you were drinking vast amounts of alcohol, you were partying non-stop and you were separated from your wife and family. 'But you committed the offences on the girl. Your victim was a girl aged 16 and you were a married man of 30 at the time. 'She was unable to prevent you. The jury was shown video footage and it was clear there was no response.' Defending Maroof, Barry Grennan said: 'He is 31 and he should have known better. He should have realised he cannot ply people with drink. He shouldn’t have done it and regrets it bitterly. The father-of-two was jailed at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, pictured above, for seven years and was also put on the sex offenders' register after being found guilty of rape and sexual assault . 'He has spent the last two months in custody and found that to be a thoroughly unpleasant situation. 'He needs to address this so it doesn’t happen again and he is prepared to undergo sex offence courses. 'He wants to get back to his wife and he’s devastated he can’t see his children. He wants to complete his sentence, come out, get back to his family and work.' After the hearing, Detective Inspector Becky Cawkwell, from Staffordshire Police’s child exploitation team, said: 'This sends out a strong message to those who commit such crimes - you will be caught and dealt with accordingly. 'Staffordshire Police is committed to protecting children and other vulnerable members of the community. 'We thoroughly investigate all allegations of sexual abuse, including historic offences, and work with partners to tackle these very serious crimes in a sensitive manner.'","Mazafer Maroof, from Stoke-on-Trent, plied girl with alcohol at a house party .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . An 18-year-old learner driver led police on a 111mph chase through Birmingham that ended only when he crashed the car into a concrete post. Adnan Pathan sped through the 100mph barrier as officers pursued him through residential streets in the Perry Barr area of the city shortly before 4am on May 4. The chase came to a dramatic end when Pathan ploughed the high-powered £25,000 Volkswagen Scirocco into a pillar. Adnan Pathan accelerated to 90mph - more than twice the speed limit - as officers pursued him on Walsall Road, pictured, a residential street in the Perry Barr area of the Birmingham shortly before 4am on May 4 . He was jailed for six months and banned from driving for a year at Birmingham Crown Court after he previously admitted to aggravated vehicle taking. The court previously heard how he drove through three major junctions, ignored a read light and caused another vehicle to brake while being pursued by police. He also sped over speed bumps and undercut cars while driving at more than 111mph in a desperate attempt to evade the police. Sentencing, Judge Patrick Thomas QC told him: 'It is pure good fortune you did not kill somebody else. 'You . drove in the most dangerous way. You were trying to get away from the . police at speeds in excess of 100mph and you were drawing away from . them. 'A pedestrian walking out from behind a car on to the road would simply have had no chance at all.' Earlier Madhu Rai, prosecuting, told the court the Scirocco had been hired by someone else, who hadn't given Pathan permission to drive it. The chase came to a dramatic end when Pathan drove down a dead end and ploughed the high-powered £25,000 Volkswagen Scirocco into a pillar. File picture of 2014 model . The court heard how Pathan, from Perry Barr, was driving on Birchfield Road when police first spotted him. They followed him on to Walsall Road where he was driving at 80mph - twice the legal speed limit - before accelerating to 90mph. The 18-year-old accelerated again, this time passing 100mph and . undertaking cars in a desperate attempt to evade his potential captors. Miss Rai said: '111mph is the maximum speed reached during the pursuit. 'Pathan went through three other major junctions, ignored a red light and caused another vehicle to brake. Pathan was jailed for six months and banned from driving for a year after previously admitting to aggravated vehicle taking at Birmingham Crown Court, pictured . 'The defendant also went over speed bumps before the chase ended when he went down a dead end and crashed into a concrete fence post.' Devon Small, defending, said Pathan had taken the Scirocco out for a drive and had intended to return it later that morning. 'It was while he was in Perry Barr that he realised he was being followed. He panicked. He did not have insurance for the vehicle. 'He did not think through the consequences of his actions. It was a high performance vehicle and he did not realise he was driving that fast.'","Police pursued Adnan Pathan as he sped through Perry Barr area of the city .

"By . Associated Press . Shot dead: Jose Banda, 20, with his newborn daughter Alisa. Authorities say Banda was fatally shot in December 2012 minutes after he slammed into a truck that was being pushed by a father and his two sons after the vehicle had broken down . A drunk driver did not deserve 'execution' by a Texas father accused of taking the law into his own hands in a fit of rage over the killing of his two sons in a wreck, a prosecutor told jurors on Tuesday. David Barajas is accused of fatally shooting Jose Banda in December 2012, minutes after Banda plowed into a pickup truck that Barajas and his two sons had been pushing on a rural road. Twelve-year-old David Jr. died at the scene and 11-year-old Caleb died at a hospital. Barajas' truck had run out of gas about 100 yards from the family's home. In opening statements Tuesday in Barajas' murder trial, prosecutor Brian Hrach told jurors Banda made a horrible decision by drinking and driving, . Banda 'deserved punishment. He deserved severe legal punishment, but he did not deserve a public execution,' Hrach said. Barajas allegedly left the scene of the accident, retrieved a gun from his home and returned to kill Banda. Sam . Cammack, Barajas' attorney, told jurors his client did not kill Banda, . and that the father never left the crash site. Cammack described to . jurors an accident scene in which Barajas, desperate to help his sons, . was covered with their blood after he had tried to perform CPR on the . boys. Tragic family: Wife, Cindy Barajas, Jenessah Barajas, Caleb Barajas, David Barajas and David Barajas Jr. In December, 2012, Caleb and David Jr. were killed during an accident near their home in Alvin, Texas, as the boys and their father were pushing their truck . 'When police get there my client is doing what he was doing the whole time, trying to save his children's lives,' Cammack said. Legal . experts said the case will be difficult to prosecute given the lack of . hard evidence: no weapon was recovered, no witnesses identified Barajas . as the shooter and gunshot residue tests done on Barajas came back . negative. An even greater challenge for prosecutors could be overcoming sympathy in the community for the father. Many people in the town of Alvin where the tragedy occurred, 30 miles southeast of Houston, have supported Barajas. Some have said they might have done the same thing in a similar situation. Hrach tried to minimize the absence of a murder weapon, saying that a bullet fragment from a .357 caliber weapon was found at the murder scene and that an open box with .357 caliber ammunition was found in Barajas' home. Brothers: David Barajas Jr. (left) died along with his brother Caleb Barajas (right) in a car accident on a rural road near their home in Houston in December, 2012 . The home security system at Barajas' house with cameras that would have shown the accident scene had been disabled, the prosecutor said. Witnesses will testify that they saw Barajas leave the scene and then come back and approach Banda's vehicle, going up against the car, appearing to be hiding something, Hrach said. Barajas' blood was found on the armrest and dashboard of Banda's car, Hrach said. But Cammack tried to cast doubt on prosecutors' claims that Barajas was responsible by suggesting to jurors that various other people seen near Banda's vehicle after the wreck could have been responsible. When 911 calls were played for jurors later Tuesday, Cammack tried to suggest Barajas would not have had enough time to shoot Banda. Lost to terrible accident: Caleb Barajas (left) was pushing a broken down car with his father and brother David (right) near their home in Alvin when they were struck and killed by a drunk driver . On the calls, screaming can be heard in the background as an unidentified caller told a dispatcher a boy is 'bleeding badly ... he's in half. It's bad.' While questioning dispatcher Grace Gambino, Cammack highlighted for jurors the timeline. The first 911 call came in at 11:33 p.m., a child was reported dead at 11:34 p.m., gunshots were heard at 11:35 p.m. and police had arrived at the scene and cleared it for EMS to come in at 11:40 p.m. If convicted, Barajas faces up to life in prison. At least 25 family members and friends of Barajas were in the courtroom, wearing buttons that said, 'Forever in our hearts, David and Caleb Barajas' and with a picture of the two boys. At least 20 relatives and friends of Banda were also in the courtroom. Before opening statements, Judge Terri Holder asked that family members take off the buttons, saying she did not want anything to influence the jury. 'This is a difficult case for everyone involved. Everyone in here has lost somebody they loved,' she said.","David Barajas is accused of shooting dead Jose Banda after he plowed into his two sons in December, 2012 .

"By . Reuters . A mystery woman, who apparently tried to hide her identity by removing her fingerprints, has been identified as Ann Marie Miller, a disbarred lawyer from Virginia pictured here in this undated handout . A mystery woman, who apparently tried to hide her identity by removing her fingerprints, on Friday was identified as a disbarred lawyer from Virginia, said investigators in a case spanning at least four states. The woman, jailed in Ohio since July 9, was arrested after trying to use a fake birth certificate to obtain a state identification card under the name Julia Wadsworth. While booking her in jail, authorities discovered that her fingerprints were gone. 'There was no ridge detail whatsoever. Just smooth, like a baby's butt. They're never going to come back,' said Allen County Sheriff Samuel Crish in northwestern Ohio. On her computer, investigators found she had researched information on how to remove fingerprints and how to determine if someone was being investigated by a federal agency, he said. She was identified after Crish's office contacted police in southwest Florida, where the woman mentioned she had spent time caring for an elderly man. An article and photos in the Fort Myers News-Press led to an anonymous tip late Thursday identifying her as a former lawyer who faced charges in Virginia, Crish said. He said the woman's name is Ann Marie Miller, 40, who practiced law in Roanoke until her license was revoked in 2009 by the Virginia Bar, records show. Her attorney confirmed on Friday that Ann Marie Miller is the woman's true identity. Miller earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a charge in Ohio of tampering with state records, a third-degree felony punishable by up to three years in prison, said attorney Stephen Chamberlain, who declined to comment further. Miller also previously faced several charges in Virginia related to a love triangle with a male attorney and a female paralegal, Crish said. On her disbarment notice in Virginia, Miller's address was listed as in Colorado. Crish said she is also wanted there on multiple charges, including burglary and trespassing. 'In 30 years, I've never seen anyone go to this extreme, ever,' he said. 'I really thought the worst.'","The woman, jailed in Ohio since July 9, was arrested after trying to use a fake birth certificate to get a state ID card under the name Julia Wadsworth .

"By . Phil Medlicott . Lewis Hamilton has likened his 'intense' Formula One title battle with Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to a game of poker. The drivers' standings are currently led by German Rosberg on 202 points, with Briton Hamilton 11 points behind in second and eight races of the season remaining. The relationship between the drivers was subject to scrutiny when Hamilton refused to allow Rosberg to pass during the Hungarian Grand Prix last month, acting against team orders. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Lewis Hamilton take James Corden for a spin on track . Intense: The Mercedes team-mates have rarely seen eye to eye this year as they vie for the Formula One title . Winners: Hamilton with five race wins, and Rosberg with four wins, have dominated the F1 podium this season . Tough task: Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff has a challenging task to keep both drivers happy . Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff has since said he can see the pair's rivalry potentially getting 'more heated', but has also stressed it has 'functioned really well' up to this point and that 'they push each other to new levels, to new heights, in a way that is not detrimental to the team.' Hamilton admits this particular title fight has more to it to some of those he has been a part of in the past. The 29-year-old said: 'The battle does feel a lot more intense this year. 'When I was racing against Kimi Raikkonen (in 2007) and Felipe Massa (in 2008, the year he won the title), they were in a different team and their cars had different strengths and weaknesses to my car and, in my team, it was just me that was really competing with them. Leaders: Hamilton and Rosberg have both been on the podium nine times this season as Mercedes dominate . Disgruntled: Rosberg has clashed with Hamilton this season over disputes involving team orders . VIDEO Hamilton should have obeyed team orders - Rosberg . 'Now I'm racing against a guy who has the same car as me - we both have access to exactly the same data and feedback so it is really hard to try and be ahead. 'It's a little bit like playing poker - you have a set of cards and the other guy is not supposed to know what you got, but Nico and I can see each other's cards so then it's more difficult to beat each other.' Hamilton is in no doubt that it is a tougher task directly vying to be champion with a team-mate, but has also emphasised that he is enjoying his racing more than ever at the moment. Close competition: Rosberg currently leads his team-mate in the Championship but only by 11 points . 'It is definitely more challenging (than competing against someone from another team), because you have to find ways to create small margins,' Hamilton said. 'And so what you do is bring your skills, things that you've learned, things you can put into the mix. 'And you always have to move forward - you can't just be good and that will be enough, you have to keep pushing the boundaries, because every time you take a step forward the other guy makes an equal step so you have to keep doing it.' Reflecting on his 2008 triumph, he added: 'It was great because it was the beginning of my Formula One career but a lot of the things that went on in the sport at the time weren't so enjoyable. 'Now, with so much more experience, I'm able to really enjoy the sport more. I'm happier and can focus solely on racing without any of the distractions I had back then.' Thrill: Hamilton took TV presenter James Corden for a spin during a high speed interview . Hamilton says his overwhelming feeling when claiming the title in 2008 was relief, and he does not believe the experience will count for too much in his pursuit this time around. 'When you win a championship, for me it was a relief, because you worry all year, you think about it non-stop,' he said. 'The only fear is failure, you know? And so when you do win, you just kind of think: ""Oh thank God for that and go relax now"". 'It's not all ""Yeah, yeah I won, I won! It's the greatest thing!"" 'I know I've been there before because I'm going for my second championship but it feels like I'm going for my first. It really does. It doesn't feel like I've had one already and I've experienced it. 'Every race is different and every season is a new experience. Every Sunday you feel different, every start you feel different.'","Rosberg currently leads the F1 Championship, 11 points ahead of Hamilton .

The dust storm, known as a 'haboob', reduced visibility to zero and led to mandatory evacuation notices for residents and businesses. Wildfires have continued to rage in Oregon for more than a week and this dust storm is threatening to complicate efforts from firefighters. Scroll down for video . A dramatic dust storm moves towards a barn near Harrington, Washington yesterday. The wall of dust, known as a haboob, reduced visibility to zero . Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has authorised the state fire marshal to send structural firefighters and equipment to help crews battle a wildfire that is threatening more than 130 homes in Jackson County. A storm system that moved through the area Tuesday afternoon helped the fire gain momentum and cross containment lines, a Jackson County sheriff's spokeswoman said. The Rogue River Drive Fire between Eagle Point and Shady Cove started Monday and has grown to about 300 acres. More than 7,000 lightning strikes blanketed central Oregon on Tuesday. And a dramatic dust storm blew through Eastern Washington and north Idaho on yesterday evening in advance of thunderstorms, lightning and rain. The dust cloud led to mandatory evacuation notices for residents and businesses. It also hampered efforts to tackle wildfires in Washington and Oregon . Washington state troopers said the dust storm or ‘haboob’ reduced visibility to zero in parts of Whitman and Adams counties, leading to numerous traffic accidents. Matt Fugazzi, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Spokane, said that Washington gets a dust storm like this every couple of years. Winds of 40 to 50 mph kicked up a wall of dust in advance of the thunderstorms as the weather front moved up through Eastern Washington and western Idaho and kept heading north. A wildfire sweeps through Rowena, Oregon, on August 5, threatening seven homes. With steep terrain, high temperatures and high winds, firefighters are facing a difficult challenge .

Washington State Department of Natural Resources firefighter, Schuyler Jorgensen, calls in a weather report as a DNR firefighter walks down a smoking hill  on August 11 . Four buildings, including one home, were destroyed in a fire that burned across 10 acres in Mead, north of Spokane, shortly after the thunderstorm moved through. Fire officials at the Devil's Elbow Fire complex on northeastern Washington's Colville Indian reservation said that after a week, nearly 800 firefighters had encircled the 32-square-mile fire with containment lines. They expected their work to be tested by the winds accompanying yesterday's new thunder and lightning storms.

Corey Wilford, a spokesman for the Beaver Fire, said there was no immediate word whether an investigation will be conducted. About 150 rural homes have been evacuated. The fire was 30 percent contained after burning across 45 square miles of the Klamath National Forest north of the Klamath River.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . They normally cause a stir when they rev their engines outside Harrods during the summer months. But now expensive Arab-owned supercars - many of which have been expensively customised - have been spotted all over London's most upmarket streets, and their drivers don't think twice about parking on double yellow lines. Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Bugattis are among the cars seen cruising around west and central London this summer as rich Qataris, Saudis, Emiratis and Kuwaitis move to Britain to escape the Middle East's baking mid-summer months. Among the supercars spotted include a £2.5million premium LaFerrari, £2million Bugatti Veyron and £700,000 McLaren seen parallel parked on double yellow lines outside five-star Bulgari Hotel in Knightsbridge last night. Gary Tolson, sales manager at luxury car dealership, Tom Hartley, said: 'It is extremely unusual seeing four of the most expensive cars in the world all parked next to each other. Many of the supercars you see around central London at the moment have been modified with paint jobs costing anything up to £30,000. A lot of them have also been given different wheels.' Scroll down for video . Supercars belonging to wealthy individuals from the Middle East have been taking all the best parking spots in London's upmarket postcodes. A £2million    brown Bugatti, £700,000 McLaren, £2million LaFerrari  and £300,000 Maybach were seen on double yellow lines outside BVLGARI hotel in Knightsbridge last night . Crowds gathered to look at the limited production plug-in hybrid  McLaren P1 supercar outside BVLGARI. It is estimated to cost around £700,000, top speed 217mph . A £350,000 Rolls Royce Phantom, customised with a £30,000 chrome paint job and expensive wheels, was also seen outside The Dorchester in Mayfair. Mr Tolson said: 'This one has been really pumped up with huge wheels and paintwork which would have cost thousands.' It was parked next to a bright orange £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador and a £270,000 Rolls Royce Ghost. The luxury cars are flown distances of around 3,000 miles in planes such as the Qatar Airways Airbus A330. Owners, many of them from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait, will happily pay a small fortune - in excess of £20,000 for a return journey. Qatar Airways  ships the luxury cars from Doha to Heathrow and the precious cargo can either be accommodated in a single row or in a side-by-side configuration. The rich Arabs stay in the best hotels and empty their wallets in London's most expensive shops, but they also cause problems with their unique supercars.

"By . Steph Cockroft . A honeytrapper and her boyfriend lured a man to a park over Facebook so they could attack him with a meat cleaver for his money and mobile phone. Haseena Aziz arranged to go on the 'date' in order to give her 29-year-old boyfriend Afahan Hussain a chance to rob the victim. The 28-year-old tempted the man to meet her in a park in Birmingham by flirting with him in a series of messages over the social-networking site. Haseena Aziz, 28, pictured left, arranged to go on a 'date' with a man in Birmingham so she and her boyfriend Afahan Hussain, 29, pictured right, could threaten him with a meat cleaver and rob him . The unnamed 25-year-old victim caught a train to Birmingham from his home in London in June this year in the belief Aziz wanted to start a relationship with him. He took a seat on a bench in parkland near a fly-over in Hockley, Birmingham, expecting to meet Aziz for a date. Instead, Hussain - who has a gold tooth - appeared from behind and punched and headbutted the defenceless victim. He then held a meat cleaver to his face and demanded his phone and cash. The court heard how Aziz laughed as she watched the attack and even waded in by kicking the man in the groin. The pair later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up. West Midlands Police launched an investigation. The pair were found through phone and social media enquiries. They were charged with robbery and both found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court. The pair - who later sent texts to the victim mocking him for falling for their set-up - were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court of robbery . Recorder Oscar Del Fabbro . jailed Hussain for a total of 12 years after he was found . guilty of the robbery, as well as a separate crime of wounding with intent to cause GBH. Aziz was also found guilty of robbery and was sentenced to four years in prison. The court heard how, weeks after the park attack, Hussain also slashed a complete stranger across the face with a Stanley knife during an unprovoked street attack. He shoulder-barged a 27-year-old man to the floor in the early hours of August 7. As the victim scrambled to his feet, Hussain then pulled out a knife and slashed him down the left side of his face severing an artery and narrowly missing his left eye. Unemployed Hussain denied the offence but the victim's recollection of his attacker's distinctive gold tooth was crucial in the conviction. Speaking about the second attack Detective Constable Sara Caldwell, from West Midlands Police, said: 'It was completely unprovoked. The man was walking with a friend to a local shop to buy cigarettes when Hussain deliberately barged into him and lashed out with a knife. 'The victim suffered significant blood loss, nerve damage and has lost sensation on the left side of his face. It was an outrageous attack. 'Anyone who carries a knife in public is potentially putting themselves and others in danger and can expect to be jailed, even if they don't strike out with it in anger. 'The judge described Hussain as a dangerous man and a risk to the public.He will rightly spend many years behind bars and be subject to an extended licence period upon his eventual release.'","Haseena Aziz, 28, from Birmingham, arranged to meet 25-year-old man .

"By . Joel Christie . and Associated  Press Reporter . The mother of a 12-year-old Florida girl who authorities say jumped to her death because she was excessively bullied is now suing the Polk County School Board, a construction materials company and a teenager accused of stalking her daughter. The lawsuit was filed on Monday in Polk County. Rebecca Sedwick leaped to her death from the roof of an abandoned concrete plant in Lakeland in September 2013. A month later, the sheriff's office controversially arrested two of her classmates, Guadalupe Shaw, 14 and Katelyn Roman, 13, on charges of aggravated stalking. Suing: Tricia Norman has filed a lawsuit against three defendants - including the local school board and another student - that she claims had a hand in the suicide death of her daughter, Rebecca Sedwick (right), in September 2013 . Too young: 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick committed suicide on September 10 last year by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory in Lakeland, Florida . The pair were named and shamed over the alleged incident. They were accused of harassing Rebecca while they were students at Crystal Lake Middle School, as well as cyberbulling, allegedly sending her messages such as 'go kill yourself'. However the charges were later dropped because police could not find any evidence of the alleged online data. Sedwick's mother, Tricia Norman, is now seeking more than $15,000 from each of the defendants over the death of her daughter. The defendants are listed as School Board of Polk County, Cemex Construction Materials of Florida and a 'former classmate' of Rebecca's. Norman, who said in the aftermath of her daughter's suicide that her 'happiness no longer exists', believes the School Board didn't properly supervise the girl accused of stalking her daughter, even though they were allegedly aware of the situation. She also claims Cemex Construction Material in Lakeland, owners of the building Rebecca leaped to her death from, did not properly care for the perimeter fence at the abandoned facility, allowing the 12-year-old to easily scale it. The former student listed in the lawsuit is identified only as G.S. Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, (left) and . Guadalupe Shaw, 14, (right) were arrested . for allegedly stalking Rebecca Sedwick until she committed . suicide, however the charges were dropped on lack of evidence . The alleged physical and emotional abuse caused Rebecca to 'suffer serious mental and psychological injuries during the school year', which directly led to her death by suicide, the suit claims, according to News 13. The actions are described as 'exceeding all bounds of decency and utterly intolerable in a civilized community'. Attorneys allege the online attacks continued after the girl's death. After Rebecca's suicide, Guadalupe Shaw - of the two girl's arrested - allegedly posted a Tweet saying the pre-teen's death did not bother her. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted. At the time, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said the Tweet was the reason for Ms Guadalupe's arrest. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' Sheriff Judd said at the time. The charges were eventually dropped. Devastated: Tricia Norman, seen here at a press conference in November, has now filed a lawsuit against three defendants she believes are partly responsible for her daughter's death . Tragic loss: Rebecca Sedwick pictured with her older sister, Amy . It was alleged the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators Ms Shaw sent messages to Rebecca calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Shaw's attorney's denied the allegations. Her parents also gave an interview saying they regularly checked her Facebook. Right before taking her own life, Rebecca changed one of her online user names to 'That Dead Girl'. She also messaged a male friend saying: 'I'm jumping.' Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. Disturbed: A police report earlier this year on the death of Rebecca Sedwick found a variety of factors contributed to her suicide . 'She appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally disturbing.' Following a major investigation, a 300-page police report, released in April this year, found numerous factors may have contributed to Rebecca's death. The file said Rebecca was concerned about her mother and stepfather's fighting, had been involuntarily committed and wrote in her diary that she cut herself to ‘ease the pain.’ She had also broken up with an online boyfriend before her suicide. In a diary entry dated two weeks before she leaped to her death in September 2013, the girl notes that on one particular day, she had been called ‘pretty, nice beautiful, funny, awesome.’ Yet she also had been called ‘ugly, stupid, slut, fat, not good enough.’ At the bottom of the page she wrote one word: ‘suicidal.’ The file contained scant evidence of cyberbullying, even though officials publicly described cruel text and social media messages as reasons for Rebecca's suicide. ‘Rebecca was a very fragile child,’ Sheriff Judd said in a recent interview after the report was released. ‘Rebecca's wagon was already pretty heavily burdened with bricks. And we never said that bullying was the only reason Rebecca committed suicide. But what the bullies did, is that they continued to stack bricks on an already overloaded wagon, 'til finally it broke.’ All the facts of the case will now be argued in court as part of the new lawsuit.","Tricia Norman listed three defendants in the lawsuit she filed Monday in Polk County, Florida .

Masterminds Nirmon Grover and Ajit Arura were jailed for three years each for their part in importing fake designer goods - after more than 80,000 items were seized at a storage unit in Alperton, northwest London. The fake haul consisted of 34,100 pairs of Nike trainers and Ugg boots, as well as Louis Vuitton bags, designer fragrances, headphones and fake Rolexes and Breitling watches - which if they were real would have been worth in excess of £17million. Scroll down for video . Nirmon Grover, left, and Ajit Arura, right, were jailed for three years for their part in importing fake designer goods - after more than 80,000 items were seized at a storage unit in Alperton, northwest London . Grover, 44, of Southall, west London, and Arura, 36, of Newport, Wales, were sentenced at Harrow Crown Court for their part in the massive import and export business, operating under the name Grover International Limited. Brent Council’s Trading Standards team uncovered the massive haul at a storage unit, which was estimated to have a street value of £1.7million. Experts believe this is the most sophisticated operation they have ever come across, involving a global supply link to China and Europe, and the sentencing was the result of a five-year investigation. Andrew Clooney, Senior Prosecutor at Brent Council, said: 'The investigation stretched back a number of years as each time we went back to the storage facility, more counterfeit items were seized. When the storage unit in northwest London was raided, officers seized thousands of items including fake Rolex watches, designer trainers and fragrances . 'Our partners at HMRC were then reporting seizures of goods at the docks in Southampton and Tilbury. 'It was no doubt a sophisticated operation. 'We are committed to keeping counterfeit and unsafe goods off the streets and this haul should act as a warning to other rogue businesses that we will leave no stone unturned in investigating and prosecuting people who look to gain from the proceeds of criminal activity.' The pair were sentenced on charges relating to four different seizures of substantial quantities of counterfeit goods from June 2008 to February 2010. The fake goods will now be destroyed.","Trading Standards seize 80,000 counterfeit items at London storage unit .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Julie Anne Barnes . For nearly three years we have waited for the pitter patter of tiny paws. Soon, that wait could be over. Experts are confident that giant panda Tian Tian – whose name means Sweetie – is pregnant and may produce Britain’s first panda cub by the end of the month. Public interest in the panda and her mate Yang Guang, or Sunshine, reached fever pitch yesterday, undimmed by two previous unsuccessful breeding attempts. The pair, on loan to Edinburgh Zoo from China, refused to mate in 2012, while last year Tian Tian had a failed pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Expecting: Tian Tian, a female giant panda sits in her enclosure at Edinburgh zoo in Scotland . Tian Tian the panda is pregnant and could give birth by the end of August, keepers at Edinburgh Zoo say . The Giant Panda, who came to Scotland in 2011, was artificially inseminated last year but lost the cub at late term . This time scientists hope they could . finally see the first panda cub – or even twins or triplets – born in . Britain. Keepers have been monitoring Tian Tian since she was . artificially inseminated in April. Iain . Valentine, director of pandas at the zoo, said the latest scientific . data suggested that Tian Tian is pregnant and her due date is likely to . be around August 28 or 29. But . he warned: ‘This is all very new and complex science and we still have a . bit of time to go yet, as like last year, the late loss of a cub . remains entirely possible.’ Last . year keepers tried to inseminate Tian Tian with a frozen sample of . sperm from a dead panda, Bao Bao, which had been kept at Berlin zoo. The . foetus was not carried to full term. The latest attempt used sperm from . Yang Guang. If the . pregnancy is successful, it could mean a £50million boost to the . Scottish economy, studies suggest – and put Scotland firmly into the . international spotlight weeks before the independence referendum on . September 18. A team of up . to nine people will be on hand to help deliver the cub, including two . experts due to arrive from China next week . Mr Valentine said: ‘We’re . very excited. We know she is now pregnant from the tests that we have . been running. It is not a phantom pregnancy. ‘We . are using a combination of tests which give an indication of when . implantation has taken place. 'The keepers noticed that there were . behavioural changes, she started to become less co-operative and wanted . to spend less time eating and more in the cubbing box. 'That also ties in . with the science. ‘We don’t . know how many cubs there are. We know at least one – we don’t know . whether there is another one in there, or another two.’ While . giant pandas are famously reluctant to mate, both in captivity and in . the wild, and pregnancies often fail even if they do, Tian Tian has had . cubs in the past in China. She . and Yang Guang arrived on loan from China in December 2011 following . five years of talks between officials and became the first giant pandas . to live in the UK for 17 years. The . animals, both aged ten, will remain at Edinburgh Zoo for a decade.

"By . Mail on Sunday Reporter . A grieving daughter who wanted her father’s funeral to be ‘a perfect send-off’ has claimed it was ruined by a council official halting the burial, telling her that metal coffins were banned. Stella Birdsall, 48, had ordered a £3,000, vacuum-sealed, navy blue metal casket with steel handles for her father Colin, 72, because she wanted ‘to do the very best by my dad’. She said the service at St Botolph’s Church, in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, on Thursday ‘went beautifully’ but then the official ‘ambushed’ the funeral cortege beside the open grave. Stella Birdstall, 48, was holding a funeral service for her father Colin, 72, in this church in West Yorkshire when a council official halted proceedings because they were using a metal casket - which is banned . Miss Birdsall said he told the family that the interment could not go ahead because it breached Wakefield Council’s policy barring the use of metal caskets – and that she had two options, either to postpone the burial or to change the casket. ‘Everybody was in a state of shock,’ she said. ‘I was dumbfounded.’ After a hurried discussion, the family decided that the hearse should return to the undertaker’s parlour so that the body could be transferred into a wooden coffin. She said her father’s body was put in a plain, plywood box which was the only one they had in stock. Miss Birdsall said she did not blame the undertaker, Jennings Funeral Services, but added: ‘It was like Wakefield Council ambushed my father’s burial.’ Miss Birdsall said she is looking at exhuming her father’s body for reburial in a more suitable coffin. She added: ‘Nobody has been talking about what a beautiful service it was. It has all been about what happened at the graveside.’ A spokesman for Wakefield Council said: ‘We are looking into these comments and until we have done this we are not in a position to comment.’","Stella Birdsall, 48, ordered navy blue metal coffin to bury father Colin in .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Fiona Taylor, 44, bought fake bags from China and sold them as the real thing, making a huge profit . A woman who made more than £400,000 selling fake designer handbags spent the money on school fees for her children and luxury goods for herself. Fiona Taylor, 44, of Newton on Ouse, North Yorkshire, organised 'handbag parties' where she sold counterfeit bags for hundreds of pounds each, telling buyers they were the real thing. The mother of two laundered cheques through her son's bank account and spent the money on luxury goods, private school fees, holidays and a new car, a court heard. Teesside Crown Court was told that Taylor sold fake Mulberry bags at the parties which she organised across North Yorkshire, telling one woman they were sourced through a contact at Mulberry's own factory. In fact, the bags came from counterfeiters in China, and they quickly fell to bits, prompting complaints from customers. Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said Taylor paid more than £250,000 to Chinese counterfeit suppliers over five and a half years. He told the court she made regular substantial payments between November 2007 and May 2013 totalling £273,071. Mr Bennett said she had earned £418,687 by selling fake goods, which meant she'd made a profit of £145,616. He told the court that one complainant attended a handbag party at the home of a friend in October 2009, buying a handbag which subsequently fell apart. Another woman paid Taylor £585 for two Mulberry bags, a Jimmy Choo purse and another purse. She later found that the serial number on one of the bags, bought for her daughter, was fake and when it was sent to Mulberry they confirmed it was counterfeit. So many of Taylor's customers contacted the genuine Mulberry store in York that the firm contacted Trading Standards. Mr Bennett said Taylor signed a declaration stating she would stop selling such goods, but it had little effect in discouraging her. In June last year Taylor's home was searched and a large number of fake Mulberry, Gucci, Louis Vitton, Prada and Chanel bags and other items were seized. Susanna Proctor, defending, said Taylor had been made redundant from her job in a bank and - without a source of income - began buying bags for friends. Video courtesy of Pink 2 Paris . The real thing: But Taylor wasn't selling genuine bags by Louis Vuitton, left, or Mulberry, right, like these . Ms Proctor said: 'People were texting her and asking for bags and it snowballed out of her control. 'She is incredibly ashamed of her behaviour and is terrified of going to prison.' Taylor admitted two counts of selling counterfeit goods, two counts of concealing criminal property and 14 counts of possessing criminal property. Judge Peter Armstrong said organised criminals were benefitting from the counterfeit trade. 'That is why these offences are so serious,' he said. The judge said he took into account Taylor's early guilty pleas, references and previous good character, and handed her a three-month jail sentence, suspended for two years. He also ordered Taylor to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work, and a proceeds of crime hearing will take place at a later date.","Fiona Taylor, 44, organised 'handbag parties' where she sold the fake goods .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Katherine Padania, 45, made £30,000 selling fake Mulberry bags after buying them on the internet for £100 and selling them on for £150 . A conwoman fleeced over £30,000 from unsuspecting customers by flogging fake designer accessories from China at 'handbag parties'. Katherine Padania, 45, shipped in knock-off Mulberry handbags, purses and wallets after buying them online for £100 each. The schemer then held 'handbag parties' where she claimed the bags were real and sold them at £150 each as 'factory seconds'. But she was caught out when an unhappy customer complained to trading standards after a buckle fell off one of the brown and gold bags. Padania was arrested after trading standards officers discovered a stash of fake goods at her home in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs., on October 26, 2012. On Friday she appeared at Stafford Crown Court where she pleaded guilty to selling and possessing counterfeit goods, but walked free after being handed an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months. Sentencing, Judge Mark Eades told her: 'What you did is not a victimless crime. It is so easy to get involved in selling counterfeit goods. 'There is a real market out there for fashion items selling for a cheap price.' The court heard Padania conned her customers out of more than £30,000 over a 12 month period. In total, 60 Mulberry handbags, wallets and purses were seized from her home by Staffordshire County Council, which would have been worth £24,000 if they were real. Paperwork listing transactions over a four-month period adding up to a total of £17,230 were also found. Padania claimed to investigators that she thought the items were genuine. However the judge dismissed this, saying you would have to be 'blindfolded twice over' not to notice they were fakes. She was rumbled after one customer complained to Trading Standards after the gold buckle on her bag fell off . Prosecuting, Richard Dewsberry said: 'She was selling the handbags to other people by hosting handbag parties. 'She told customers she could source the products much cheaper from Mulberry because they were factory over-runs or seconds. 'One customer bought several handbags in August 2011. The first bag broke relatively quickly, the buckle came off. 'The customer told Mrs Padania about this but she suggested she should take it to a local cobbler to get it fixed. 'The customer told the defendant it would be better to contact Mulberry directly, but Mrs Padania quickly put her off that idea by saying they would not be interested. 'The customer then started to use a second bag and the same thing happened. 'This time, instead of going back to Mrs Padania, she contacted Mulberry and Trading Standards. 'The items were checked and confirmed to be counterfeit.' Padania tried to claim to investigators that she thought the bags were real, but the judge said 'you would have to be blindfolded twice' in order to think they were genuine . David Bratt, defending, said that Padania had run a professional operation, but had been 'mortified' by her actions. After the hearing Staffordshire County Council officials said they welcomed the court proceedings. County Councillor Mark Winnington, cabinet member for economy, said: 'Counterfeiting is a serious crime that damages the local economy and puts jobs at risk. 'It also means people are fleeced into ending up with shoddy and in some cases dangerous goods. 'This sentence demonstrates that this was not just an opportunistic sale of a few items - it was a methodically well planned set-up designed to con as many people as possible. 'We hope this sends out a strong message that counterfeit sales won’t be tolerated and that we will do all we can to protect our businesses which are harmed by this type of crime.'","Katherine Padania, 45, admitted possession of counterfeit goods .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Five members of a violent smash and grab gang who wore burkas during a daring £1.5million heist at Selfridges were today jailed for a total of 58 years. The gang, who had carried out a similar raid at a jewellers’ in Windsor weeks earlier, threatened terrified staff and customers while smashing display cabinets and snatching expensive designer watches.

The robbers can be seen dressed in burkas as they smash their way through the Selfridges store . Six thieves dressed in burkas stole £1.5million worth of expensive designers watches in the raid . Relatives of the gang broke down in tears as Judge Nicholas Jones handed down sentences ranging from eight to 15 years in jail at Kingston Crown Court for their involvement in one or both of the Selfridges and Windsor raids. As the lengthy prison terms were read out, some of the defendants patted each other on the back in moral support, while some sat with their head in their hands in the dock. Gang member Connor Groake, who was sentenced for the Selfridges robbery at an earlier date, and fellow robber Sam Curtin were detained by members of the public after crashing their moped as they attempted a high-speed getaway. A total of . 142 designer watches were taken, although 41 were recovered from Curtin . and Groake, and investigators totalled the combined value of the goods . at £1,496,000.

As Curtin and Croake fled the scene on a scooter, a waiter heroically tackled one on them and restrained him until police arrived. Mohamed Hussein, a law student who was working at the time in a pizza restaurant, pinned one of them down until police arrived. At the time, the 29-year-old bodybuilder told the Evening Standard: 'I feel confident anyone would do this. I am no hero. 'Some other guys helped me hold him, while we waited for the police. I wasn’t worried. I used to do boxing.'

Detectives later proved the group had carried out a reconnaissance run to the jewellers in the weeks previously and had aborted an attempt at the raid the day before it was targeted. Sentencing the gang today, Judge Jones described the Selfridges raid as 'a professionally planned and carefully executed robbery'. He said: 'The target of that robbery was Selfridges. The vehicles were stolen in advance and you entered the store half an hour before it closed on June 6 last year. You walked in with your faces disguised by burkas and smashed the jewellery cases with axes. 'At the time Selfridges was busy with shoppers. Members of staff and the public were understandably terrified. One asked a taxi driver to take her ""anywhere"" to get away. The watches stolen had a value of almost £1.5million and, as is inevitable with such wanton destruction, there was damage caused to the store. One hundred of the watches remain unaccounted for. 'Sledgehammers, axes and burkas were also used in the Windsor robbery. The door was smashed, four men entered in burkas and stole Rolex watches. Damage was caused as well. An axe was held over the head by one robber, no doubt to stop any bystanders intervening as they made their escape. These were professionally organised robberies.'

Ritchie Graham, 24, from Islington, north London, was handed a 15-year jail term for being involved in the Selfridges robbery, taking part in a reconnaissance run to the Windsor jeweller’s and being involved in the aborted attempt to rob it. The court heard he had five previous convictions including theft and drug offences. Kris Monaghan, 25, of no fixed address, was jailed for 10 years for carrying out the raid at Selfridges wearing a burka. He has six previous convictions including theft and drug offences.

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . Lord Birt has warned a Scottish broadcaster may not be able to afford all of the BBC's shows . Scottish viewers could lose access to many BBC programmes if they decide to leave the UK in next month’s referendum, its former director general warned yesterday. Refuting First Minister Alex Salmond, who has promised Scots they would keep programmes such as Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who, John Birt said a Scottish broadcaster would not be able to afford all of the BBC’s shows. Lord Birt, who ran the corporation from 1992 to 2000, also warned that the BBC would also suffer under independence, losing a quarter of its funding. Writing in the Guardian, he became the latest high profile figure to come out in favour of the No campaign ahead of the vote on September 18. He said some of Salmond’s claims were ‘make believe’, adding: ‘One reason for Britain’s exceptional creative and intellectual vitality is our genius for founding institutions that channel and foster our national talent. None of these bodies is more effective than the BBC.’ Lord Birt said a new Scottish publicly funded broadcaster, the SBS, would have just ten per cent of the BBC’s current budget and would have to ‘tailor its programmes and services to its modest means.’ He said: ‘Like other broadcasters, I expect the SBS will want to acquire programmes from the BBC, not least those loved by Scottish audiences. The BBC is, thankfully, independent of government so whatever is asserted wishfully in the [Yes campaign’s] white paper, the BBC will have no alternative but to act in the interests of its licence payers and to seek the best possible commercial terms for the sale of its programmes in Scotland, not least because of the financial impoverishment it will just have suffered. ‘And, of course, there may be commercial broadcasters in a new Scotland willing to pay more for the BBC’s most successful programmes than an impecunious SBS…one way or another, after independence, Scottish viewers would have to pay to receive BBC services. ‘Those who will vote for independence identify and expect many gains. But many of the advantages that the most creative and inspiring talents in Scotland have enjoyed for 300 years – of making a massive impact on a big stage to global acclaim – will be lost.’ Lord Birt said that the BBC would immediately lose ten per cent of its income if Scotland became independent. Scroll down for video . Artem Chigvintsev and Natalie Gumede performing on Strictly Come Dancing. The show may be out of reach of any Scottish public broadcaster's budget should the country become independent . But he said the amount it spends on TV and radio would decrease by another 15 per cent because a greater share of the licence fee would be needed to pay for other services such as the World Service. He warned: ‘In the space of just a few years, if Scotland became independent the BBC as we know it would effectively lose a quarter of its funding. Fundamental changes to BBC services would be unavoidable.’ In February, the former Culture Secretary Maria Miller warned Scotland would lose automatic access to the BBC if it became independent. In November, the Scottish Government published a White Paper that promised a new ‘Scot-tish Broadcasting Service’, using the BBC’s assets in Scotland, would continue to air BBC programmes. It said viewers would benefit from similar deals to those in force in the Republic of Ireland, where many BBC shows are screened on local channels. The White Paper said: ‘This will ensure that the people of Scotland will still have access to all current programming, including EastEnders, Doctor Who and Strictly Come Dancing, and to chan-nels like CBeebies.’ Mr Salmond said a Scottish public service broadcaster would be ‘based on the existing staff and assets of BBC Scotland’.","Lord Birt warns Scottish broadcaster may not be able to afford BBC shows .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scientists have hailed the 'incredible' discovery of four new species of sea creature in deep ocean waters off the coast of Scotland. A large sea snail, two kinds of clam and a marine worm were found during Marine Scotland surveys around the Rockall plateau in the north Atlantic. The creatures had previously avoided detection despite decades of research in the area, located hundreds of miles off the north-west coast. A new species of snail called Volutopsius scotae is one of four sea creatures to have been discovered in deep ocean waters hundreds of miles off the north west coast of Scotland . International experts have confirmed the molluscs were previously unknown to science and the discovery is said to be potentially very significant. A cold seep or cold vent is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulphide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs. Despite the term, the temperature of a seepage is not lower than surrounding sea water - in many cases the temperature is slightly higher. Cold seeps develop over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity. Oil and methane seep out of those fissures and emerge over an area several hundred metres wide. Entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make-up of a cold seep. Researchers say the existence of the clams and worm at a single site could indicate the presence of a cold seep, where hydrocarbons are released from the sea bed. A cold seep  or a cold vent is an area of the ocean floor where hydrogen sulphide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid seepage occurs. Despite the term, the seepage is not lower than surrounding sea water - in many cases the temperature is often slightly higher. Cold seeps develop over fissures on the seafloor caused by tectonic activity. Oil and methane seep out of those fissures, get diffused by sediment, and emerge over an area several hundred metres wide. Entire ecosystems can develop around the unique make-up of a cold seep . If confirmed it would be the first cold seep to be discovered in the Rockall area. Jim Drewery from Marine Scotland Science, who oversaw the research on the deep water invertebrates, said: 'The discovery of these new species is absolutely incredible, especially when you consider that the sea snail measures a relatively large 10cm (4 inches) yet has gone undetected for decades. The creatures (Volutopsius scotae, pictured) had previously avoided detection despite decades of research in the area, located hundreds of miles off the north-west coast . This clam named Sorropodon mackayi  say the existence of the clams and worm at a single site could indicate the presence of a cold seep, where hydrocarbons are released from the sea bed . 'The project we were undertaking was designed to provide advice that would help balance both commercial fishing and conservation interests in the Rockall area. 'The potential cold seep and its dependant community of marine life is a great find as it is just the sort of habitat we were hoping to pick up on these surveys. 'Marine Scotland Science has been able to narrow down the location of the potential cold seep to a small area 260 miles west of the Hebrides in the Rockall-Hatton basin. 'Further research is now needed, which would involve going down to take a look at the ocean floor three-quarters of a mile underwater.' Mr Drewery said he was particularly excited by the discovery of the marine worm Antonbrunnia which is the first of its kind to be found in the Atlantic. It was discovered by international bivalve expert Dr Graham Oliver inside one of the clams he was confirming as a new species at his laboratory at the National Museum of Wales. Mr Drewery said he was particularly excited by the discovery of the marine worm Antonbrunnia (pictured) which is the first of its kind to be found in the Atlantic . The worm (magnified head, pictured) has not yet been named and is currently being examined at the National Museum of Wales . Scotland's Environment Secretary Richard Lochhead said: 'Scottish waters cover an area around five times bigger than our land mass and are miles deep in places, and these hidden gems offer a fascinating glimpse of the treasures that still await discovery under the waves. 'The area where these species were found is not currently fished and the confirmation of a cold seep is likely to result in the region being closed to bottom contact fishing.' WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: 'Perhaps only in Scotland would you find people getting excited about something known as a ""cold seep"". 'However, if true, then it is no less important a discovery as the much better known hydrothermal vents, found in other parts of the world. 'They would give us a unique opportunity to observe some species unlikely to be found anywhere else on the planet. 'These latest discoveries underline the need for a precautionary approach in the management and use of our seas.' Both the clams (Thyasira Scotiae, pictured) and marine worm were discovered around 260 miles west of the Hebrides at a depth of about three quarters of a mile . Both the clams and marine worm were discovered around 260 miles west of the Hebrides at a depth of about three quarters of a mile. The sea snails were found in water around a mile deep over an area approximately 80-260 miles west of the islands. The sea snail Volutopsius scotiae and clam Thyasira scotiae have been named after the research vessel MRV Scotia while the clam Isorropodon mackayi has been named after mollusc expert David W Mackay.

A benefits cheat who claimed £40,000 after telling officials she could barely walk has been ordered to repay the full amount after being spotted walking the Great Wall of China. Dawn Pinchen has six months to return the money she was given fraudulently after council officials spotted her holiday photographs on Facebook - or she will be sent to jail. The 40-year-old from Annitsford, Northumberland, collected thousands of pounds in income support and disability allowance over six years after telling officials she couldn't walk 'the length of a car'. Dawn Pinchen posted this photograph of her on the Great Wall of China after telling council officials she could not walk the length of a car . In April, Pinchen was ordered to pay back the money weekly after admitting failure to notify the DWP of a change of circumstance. But after only giving back £1,000, she reappeared in court yesterday where a judge gave her six months to repay the remainder or face going to jail. She has sold her house in order to settle the debt, Newcastle Crown Court heard. In 1994 Pinchen was legitimately claiming benefits, but failed to notify local authorities when her circumstances changed, . Between 2007 and 2013 she continued to claim and was fraudulently given £39,209 in handouts. Pinchen and her husband have sold their home in order to repay the debt . The Department of Work and Pensions discovered her claims were false when she posted photographs of herself on the Great Wall of China on Facebook. Her husband, who made a large sum of money after selling websites, and deposited the money into her bank account, accompanied her on the trip. Yesterday she was told she would face an 18-month jail sentence if the full amount wasn't repaid in time. Her barrister, Tony Cornberg, said: 'Mr and Mrs Pinchen acted quite expeditiously with this. 'The sale of the house is in train, they are two weeks away from exchanging contracts.' In April Pinchen denied prosecution's claims that she had walked along the 13,000 mile wall, dismissing their accusations as 'rubbish'. Alec Burns, prosecuting, told the court: 'On the social media website, Facebook, Mrs Pinchen posted photos of her and her husband on holiday in China. 'There was a photo of her stood on the Great Wall of China.' Addressing the accused, he added: 'You were pictured on the great wall of China, walking.' Sentencing, Judge Penny Moreland QC told Pinchen: 'Benefits are for those who need them and for those entitled.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Tibetan mastiff puppy has been sold in China for almost nearly £1.2million, smashing the previous confirmed record for the world's most expensive dog sale. A property developer paid 12million yuan  for the golden-haired one-year-old at a luxury pet fair in the eastern province of Zhejiang yesterday, local media reported reported. 'They have lion’s blood and are top-of-the-range mastiff studs,' the dog’s breeder Zhang Gengyun told the Qianjiang Evening News, adding that another red-haired canine had sold for 6million yuan. Man's best friends: A model poses with the gold-maned Tibetan mastiff pup, left, that sold at a Chinese luxury pet fair for a staggering £1.2million, and the red pup of the same breed, right, that sold for nearly £583,000 . Enormous and sometimes ferocious, with round manes lending them a passing resemblance to lions, Tibetan mastiffs have become a status symbol among China’s wealthy. The record-breaking animal was 31in (80cm) tall, and weighed 90kg, Mr Zhang said, adding that he was sad to sell the dogs. Neither was named in the report. 'Pure Tibetan mastiffs are very rare, just like our nationally treasured pandas, so the prices are so high,' he said. One red mastiff named Big Splash reportedly sold for 10million yuan (£971,000; $1.5million) to a coal baron from the north of China in 2011, in the most expensive dog sale then recorded. Not only is red considered a lucky colour, but Tibetan mastiffs are thought to be holy animals, blessing their owners' health and security. But it seems that leonine gold now carries a higher premium among wealthy collectors of the rare breed. Luxurious: Enormous and sometimes ferocious, with manes giving them a resemblance to lions, Tibetan mastiffs, which were originally bred to protect temples, have become a status symbol among China's wealthy . Originating with nomadic cultures of Tibet, China, Nepal, Ladakh, and Central Asia, Tibetan mastiffs were bred as guard dogs to protect herds, camps, monasteries and palaces. Their name is in fact a misnomer. The animals are not true mastiffs, but were dubbed so by early Western visitors to China simply because it means 'big dog' - a better name would be Himalayan mountain dog. Despite its plentiful coat, Tibetan mastiffs don't suffer from the usual 'big-dog' smell that affects many other large breeds. Because of the demand for the dogs, breeders have often used unscrupulous means to increase their value. Photos of the animals are often photoshopped to exaggerate desirable features, while some buyers have reported bringing new dogs home only to find they lose their colour and much of their 'hair' after the first bath. The buyer at the Zhejiang expo was said to be a 56-year-old property developer from Qingdao who hopes to breed dogs himself, according to the report. The newspaper quoted the owner of a mastiff breeding website as saying that last year one animal sold for 27million yuan at a fair in Beijing. But an industry insider surnamed Xu told the paper that the high prices may be the result of insider agreements among breeders to boost their dogs’ worth. 'A lot of the sky-high priced deals are just breeders hyping each other up, and no money actually changes hands,' Mr Xu said . Owners say the mastiffs, descendants . of dogs used for hunting by nomadic tribes in central Asia and Tibet, . are fiercely loyal and protective. A . breed not recommended for novice dog owners, they are intelligent yet . stubborn to a fault and require strict obedience training and an . understanding of canine psychology.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . Heartbreaking letters sent by grieving families pining for information about their sons who were killed during the First World War have been unveiled. Army Captain Evan Silk had the grim task of writing to families from the trenches to say their boys had died fighting on the front line. He was not prepared for the response he would receive. Scroll down for video . Treasured: These are just a few of the hundreds of letters Captain Silk received from grieving families after he informed them their son, brother or grandson had died on the front line during the First World War . Hundreds of devastated relatives responded with letters thanking him, asking how they died, and wanting to know where they were buried. Many, he could not answer. But he cherished them for the rest of his life. One letter sent by soldier's mother Annie David, from Cardiff, said: 'You do not know how hungry I am for every scrap of information about my precious lad. 'Thank you so much for sending me the very nice pen ink sketch of my dear son's grave... I am writing for my husband who is still too ill to be told of our loss. 'It is very kind of you to say you will come and see me when you come home - it will be such a very great pleasure to see you.' The letters remained in Capt Silk's wooden Army trunk for the past 100 years - and are now kept safe by his son, former clerk to the House of Commons, Paul Silk. Incredible experience: Capt Silk (pictured left during the war) wrote as many details as he could for families, including sketches of their graves, and received hundreds of thank you letters in return (such as this one, right) Pining for news: This letter was sent in a desperate bid for news about a relative who had been silent of late . Tragic: This Blackpool family lost their son shortly before his 21st birthday, and shared their grief with Capt Silk . Mr Silk, 62, of Crickhowell, Powys, said he knew the letters were important to his father because he kept them safe for so long. He said: 'My father was a young officer writing to soldiers' families who were killed. I don't have the letters he sent out but I do have some of the replies which he received. 'I think: 'Why did my father keep these?' and it must be because he was moved by them. You don't throw things away that are important to you. 'It must have affected him and because of that it affects me. They are quite poignant.' Evan Silk left his home in the small town of Blaina, South Wales, at the age of 25 and was commissioned into the Welsh Regiment as one of the Artists Rifles in 1916 and swiftly rose to the rank of Captain. He witnessed first-hand the horrors of the trenches, went over the top numerous times and fought in the third battle of Ypres. As an adjutant he was responsible for the Welsh Regiment's administrative work - which included answering letters sent by the soldiers' families and writing to break the news of their deaths. One letter tells of a family's concern about not hearing from a Lieutenant James. It reads: 'I am sorry to trouble you in this time of stress and strenuous fighting, but could you possibly let me know anything of Lieut. E James of your glorious regiment. Life at war: Capt Silk (right) joined the Welsh Regiment at the age of 25 and quickly rose to the rank of Captain . Unveiled: His son, former House of Commons clerk Paul Silk, has unveiled the treasure trove for the centenary . 'I have not heard from him for several months and I am anxious about him. Just a field card saying he is well etc. will put my mind at ease.' But the soldier in question had been killed in action three months earlier. Other letters speak of the confusion faced by those waiting at home and knowing little of the horror in the trenches. One poignant message asked Capt Silk to put his trust in God to bring him home safe. It said: 'Dear Evan, God will watch over you only ask him, for he has said if we call on him in the day of trouble he will deliver us so put all your trust in him in all things and he will bring you out safe.' Lots of messages thanked Capt Silk for his kind words when writing to them at such a difficult time. Mr Silk said although he has notes and letters from the war his father rarely talked about his experiences. But he said the messages bring the conflict home to him because of his personal connection. He said: 'I can recognise his handwriting on some of the letters, it brings it that much closer to me. But it's also an alien world, the world of 100 years ago.'","Army Captain Evan Silk had to write to families of soldiers who died fighting .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail online . The mother of a 21-year-old pregnant woman from Illinois who was strangled and then raped by her drunken supervisor has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her daughter's employer. Alisha Bromfield was nearly seven months pregnant in August 2012 when she was murdered by Brian Cooper at a wedding. The victim’s mother, Sherry Anicich, filed a lawsuit Monday accusing Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers of failing to notice 'a pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies' in Cooper. Scroll down for video . Fatal attraction: Brian Cooper, 37 (left), was sentenced last month to two consecutive life term in the 2012 murder of Alisha Bromfield (left), 21, who was seven months pregnant at the time of her death . Innocent life: Bromfield's unborn daughter, named posthumously Ava Lucille, was viable at the time of the murder but she could not be saved . The 37-year-old, who was Alisha Bromfield's boss, failed to take part in anger management counseling required by Grand Flower Growers, according to court filings cited by Courthouse News Service. The lawsuit claims that the man was known to be 'emotionally unstable and violent,’ at times hurling items at employees. Last month, Cooper was sentenced to two consecutive life terms without parole after being convicted in May of two counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Cooper killed Bromfield, of Plainfield, Illinois, when the two were at a Nasewaupee resort for his sister Kellie Stryker’s wedding. After strangling the expectant mother for refusing to be in a relationship with him, the man raped her lifeless body. Defendants: Sherry Anicich's wrongful death lawsuit names Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers, which employed both Cooper and Bromfield . Bereaved mother: Sherry Anicich, Bromfield's mother, claims in her lawsuit that Home Depot and Grand Flower Growers knew about Cooper's violent tendencies but did nothing to protect her daughter from him . Murdered and defiled: The 21-year-old pregnant merchendiser was strangled to death at a wedding, after which Brian Cooper raped her corpse . Bromfield’s unborn baby daughter, named posthumously Ava Lucille, was viable at the time but died as a result of her mother’s murder and sexual assault. According to the lawsuit filed in Cook County Court by Bromfield's mother, her daughter was hired in 2006 as a merchandiser for Grand Flower Growers, a Wisconsin company that supplied blooms to Home Depot stores throughout Illinois. Cooper also worked for Grand, but according to Sherry Anicich, Home Depot was in charge of ensuring the safety of its grower's staff. ‘Home Depot knew or reasonably should have been aware of this pattern of misconduct and violent tendencies on its premises, since Cooper would publicly decry Alisha as a 'whore' and 'slut' and had been known to throw items at employees,’ the lawsuit states. Court filings indicate that Ms Bromfield repeatedly complained to Grand management about Cooper's unwelcome sexual advances, but her words allegedly fell on deaf ears. In her suit, Mrs Anicich alleges that . her daughter's complaints were not only ignored, but her managers even arranged for Cooper to be alone with Alisha. The . slain woman's family are seeking unspecified punitive damages for the . ‘loss of love, support, guidance, affection and companionship’ of . Bromfield and her child, Chicago Tribune reported. During . his trial last June, Brian Cooper's defense was that the alcohol he had . during and after his sister's wedding reception inhibited his ability . to form intent. He has never denied killing Bromfield. Attack: Cooper is accused of strangling Alisha Bromfield and sexually assaulting her body at a Wisconsin hotel . A void that can't be filled: The victim's family are suing for damages, claiming a loss of love and companionship . The civil complaint states that in 2012, Cooper insisted that Bromfield accompany him to his sister's wedding and meet his family. Following the nuptials, the lawsuit claims, Cooper brought Bromfield to a hotel room he had booked where he continued 'his pattern of verbal and physical.' The 21-year-old mother-to-be refused Cooper's advances, sending him into a homicidal rage, the lawsuit states. The inebriated man proceeded to strangle Alisha as she begged for mercy for herself and her unborn baby girl. Once the woman was dead, the lawsuit goes on to say that Cooper undressed and raped her.","Brian Cooper, 37, was sentenced in July to two life terms in the murders of Alisha Bromfield, 21, and her unborn baby .

"By . Darren Boyle . Police have released CCTV footage of a man who attacked and sexually assaulted two women on their way to work in the middle of a busy street. The unidentified attacker is seen on CCTV stalking both women before racing up behind them and dragging them to the ground. The first attack happened on Sunday December 22, 2013 at 6.23am near the Hilton Hotel in Deansgate, Manchester. The first victim is seen walking to work without realising the stalker was following right behind her . Detectives hope some of the people driving past may recognise the attacker responsible for the assaults . The 26-year-old woman was dragged to the ground by the attacker, who tried to forcibly remove her clothes. The woman was walking to work at 6.23am and was on the phone to her boyfriend when the attacker struck. The victim managed to fight off the man who fled the scene on foot. The woman reported the attempted rape to Greater Manchester Police. Fortunately, she was not physically injured as a result of her ordeal. The first victim is seen walking up a flight of steps near the Hilton Hotel in Deansgate, Manchester . The 26-year-old victim is unaware that  a stalker is just ten feet behind her as she walks to work . The attacker closes in on the woman who is talking to her boyfriend on the phone as he creeps up on her . In the meantime, the man is believed to have returned home and changed his clothes before looking for a new victim. Shortly afterwards, the man pounced on a second woman who was also walking to work through Manchester City Centre. The 32-year-old woman as also in the Deansgate area of the city when the man approached her from behind and dragged her to the ground. He then tried to force himself on top of the screaming woman. A passer-by heard the terrified woman and the attacker ran off towards the Castlefields area of the city. The second woman, pictured, is also on her way to work in the Deansgate area of Manchester when attacked . Again the attacker keeps his head bowed as he closes in on his second victim, after changing his clothes . Detective Constable Adam Cronshaw, said: 'Two women were followed and pounced upon by, who we now believe to be the same offender. 'We believe the motive in both incidents was sexual but thankfully neither woman was subjected to a serious sexual assault. 'Given the proximity and timing of both offences it is possible that he has a vehicle or residence nearby which has enabled him to change his clothing. 'We have been making inquiries and efforts to trace this man since the incidents and have previously released a still image of the offender through the media.' The women were both attacked within a short distance of each other on the morning of December 23, 2013 . Detective Constable Cronshaw said: 'We are now releasing the moving footage to highlight his deliberate stalking of the women with a view to encouraging anyone with information to come forward. 'We have managed to capture his movements and face from a number of angles so I am also hopeful someone will recognise him from this. 'I would like to appeal to the public to think back to three days before Christmas: were you out on the Saturday night into the Sunday morning, perhaps on a works Christmas party? 'From viewing the footage this suspect appears to be drunk so I would ask people whether they were with him during a party or night out in or close to the city centre. 'Any information will be treated in strict confidence.' Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. In the grainy footage, the man can be seen closing in on the 32-year-old woman despite passing cars . As she crossed the road, the attacker struck, pulling the terrified woman to the ground before running off . The man spotted his first victim in Deansgate, Manchester city centre on December 23, 2013 at 6.23am .

"By . Mark Bryans . Ferrari president Luca Di Montezemolo has hit out at suggestions Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen will leave the team at the end of the season. Both former world champions have reportedly claimed they could depart the Italian marque following a largely disappointing year. Raikkonen, who rejoined the team from Lotus in September, has amassed just 27 points but speculation around a potential retirement has been quashed. On his way? Fernando Alonso is rumoured to be leaving Ferrari at the end of a struggling season . For two-time world champion Alonso the question is whether he will remain loyal to Ferrari despite that lack of competitiveness at the front of the field but Di Montezemolo has praised both men and insists they will honour their contracts next season. 'We are lucky to have two great champions, who are working with the whole team to get back to being competitive again,' he told the official Ferrari website. 'Of course, as is the case every summer, there is unfounded gossip about alleged problems with senseless rumours bandied about, such as the ones relating to Alonso's contract. We know that the summer heat always produces silly stories. Disappointing: Kimi Raikonnen has collected just 27 points on his return to the Italian race team . 'Our drivers must now relax in order to return in top form. The season is still long and we need Fernando and Kimi to be in great shape.' Alonso has finished in the points in every race so far this season but has yet to record a victory and sits fourth in the drivers' standings - 87 points behind leader Nico Rosberg. Ferrari have not won the constructors' championship since 2008, with Raikkonen the last driver to win the title for the team a year earlier. But Di Montezemolo believes the right steps are being taken to put the team on a more even keel with the likes of Red Bull and Mercedes, who have dominated the previous five seasons. Prancing pony: Ferrari currently sit third behind Mercedes and Red Bull in the constructor's table . 'We are making in-depth changes on both the organisational side, in our approach and culture,' he added. 'We have taken important decisions and have made significant progress, even if, at the moment, the results of all this work are not always visible. 'The aim is to get back to being as competitive as we were before in the shortest possible time, while at the same time putting everything in place so that we can embark on another winning cycle.'

"By . Mark Guidi . Scotland's referees have gone to war with the SPFL after demanding a pay rise – and it could lead to the whistlers voting on strike action. With Rangers, Hibs and Hearts now in the Championship, match officials have claimed it is unfair for them to receive only the £195 standard rate for handling second-tier games while Premiership matches pay out a whopping £840. Now they have asked for a massive hike to bring them into line with top-flight payments. Marching orders: Referees in Scotland may refuse to take to the pitch if the dispute is not resolved . Talks between the authorities inside Hampden and James Bee, chairman of the Scottish Senior Football Referees Association (SSRFA), have reached an impasse but negotiations may well re-open later this week. With finances already tight due to the absence of a sponsor for the football leagues, the SPFL feel it would be wrong to rubber-stamp any pay increases. Instead, they have suggested to the SSRFA that they redistribute the annual pot and categorise games - which would see the £840 payment reduced in order to facilitate an increase for other fees. For example, a Hearts v Rangers Championship game would be a Category A game and receive around £700 but a Premiership game between Hamilton and Ross County would be Category B and be paid £335. Final whistle: With clubs like Rangers and Hibs in the second tier officials claim they should be paid more . But the SSRFA do not agree with that logic and are holding out for a significant overall pay hike for all Championship games, including fixtures such as Cowdenbeath v Alloa. The last resort would be for Bee and his colleagues to vote on the issue which could result in them pulling out of games. It is understood, however, that they only have around 60 per cent of match officials in their union and the bulk are Category Two and Three. All parties do not want a repeat of November 2010 when referees voted to go on strike after claiming they were being subjected to a barrage of criticism and having their integrity called into question by senior members within the game. They had some sympathy back then but it’s unlikely that would be the case this time as many football fans will consider them well enough paid at the moment. Hands up, who want more money? Craig Thompson took charge of Rangers' game with Hearts last weekend .","Second tier referees paid just £195-per-game .

It felt like the end of an era as Thibaut Courtois waited for fans behind his goal to return the ball, and they started to sing his name: ‘T-Bo, T-Bo.’ The king is dead, long live the king. Petr Cech, Chelsea’s undisputed No 1 for a decade, sat among the substitutes, naked without his protective headgear.

Courtois came out for the second half, too. Courtois did not have lots to do but did what was required with polish.

"By . Pete Jenson . Follow @@petejenson . Liverpool look set to complete the signing of Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno in a £12million deal. Brendan Rodgers hopes that Moreno can solve Liverpool's problem left-back position - so is he the man to finally fill this role permanently? Here, Sportsmail tells you more... VIDEO Scroll down to see Alberto Moreno in tears after the Super Cup . Crying: Moreno was in a tearful state as he waved goodbye to Sevilla fans ahead of his Liverpool move . Is he worth it? £12m pounds for a player Sevilla had originally slapped a 30m euros buy-out clause on is very good value and at just 22 Liverpool are buying huge potential. If there was one thing they lacked last season it was an inability to get in behind stubborn defences (remember that decisive defeat to Chelsea during the title run-in) Moreno will open teams up arriving from deeper. But he will be tested defensively and judging from Tuesday night's tears he'll miss home. On the move? Liverpool are on the brink of signing  Moreno (left) in a £12million transfer . And he's a full-back, but with a winger's soul? He is a full-back in the Brazilian sense of the word (that’s pre-World Cup 2014 ‘Brazilian’). He flies forward Dani Alves style and has been used as a wing back and even as a left-winger by Sevilla coach Unai Emery. His influence on the team was nowhere near as great but there are similarities with former Sevilla right-back Alves and now with Barcelona’s other attacking full-back Jordi Alba. Cheerio: Moreno's (top) move to Anfield looks set after Moreno pulled out of Sevilla's UEFA Cup final on Tuesday . Is he highly-rated in Spain and if so why have the big two their not snapped him up? Madrid did take a look but their style is not usually to spend big on homegrown defenders when they can buy attacking players from abroad at three times the price. And Barcelona have Alba - who Moreno will be competing with for a place in the Spain starting XI if he progresses at Liverpool. Vicente Del Bosque capped him last season and rates him highly and Unai Emery gave him his debut aged 19. If Emery and Del Bosque rate him it’s safe to say Liverpool have a player. No go: Moreno was involved in Sevilla training on Monday ahead of  UEFA Super Cup final vs Real . Will he handle the switch? Two years ago he was a Sevilla reserve player. In just two campaigns he has become a first team regular, been capped by Spain, and now earned a move to the Premier League. A lot has happened to him in a short space of time and there will be some adjusting needed. But he will not be alone on the North-West. His former Spain Under-21 team-mate David De Gea will be just a short drive away. In Alvaro Negredo he will have a former Sevilla team-mate close-by too. Philippe Couthinho also speaks Spanish as does his new coach Brendan Rodgers. Emotional exit: Sevilla's Alberto Moreno was in tears after their UEFA Super Cup defeat to Real Madrid . So success or failure? He is going to the right club. Rodgers won’t baulk at his forward forays, he’ll encourage them. This is a player who had never played as a defender until three years ago when he converted from winger to full-back. But he has learned well under Sevilla’s experienced full-back Fernando Navarro. That education will continue at Liverpool and so will the license to overlap. Spectator: Moreno  watched the UEFA Super Cup final from the stands ahead of a Liverpool medical . And he has the temperament to handle the pressure? He will enjoy Anfield. He’s a football fan who grew up watching the thrilling Sevilla side that won back to back Uefa Cups and two Spanish Cups six or seven years ago under Juande Ramos. He stood on the stands of the Sanchez Pizjuan and cheered on Alves and company as a teenage fan. He’ll respond in the right way to the big European nights Liverpool are hoping to have his season.","Moreno looks set to complete a £12million move to Anfield from Sevilla .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Jose Mourinho has no excuses and must deliver trophies to Stamford Bridge this season. That’s the verdict of former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit, who insists Mourinho has received the backing of the club’s board by being able to sign Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas this summer. ‘Jose is not used to being without trophies,’ said the Dutchman, who left the Bridge in 1998 and is now a pundit for Sky Sports. ‘He wants to win something and this year it has to happen. With the squad they have, they need to win something. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Fabregas and Ramires score cracking goals in latest freindly . The time is now: Cesc Fabregas played in Chelsea's win over Ferencvaros on Sunday night . Firepower: Chelsea added Diego Costa to their squad after signing the striker from Atletico Madrid . ‘That’s what Jose wants and the reason he bought these players. He didn’t have the striker he wanted and now he has it. Now it’s time to produce. ‘He wanted a player who could do what Didier Drogba did for him. He was looking for a player with the same style: powerful and strong, with good technique, someone who can hustle the opposition. ‘Diego Costa is that player. Can he do it in the Premier League? We are going to see. Fabregas hustles and works very hard. He makes sure to keep the opposition busy and can score goals.’ Time to deliver: Jose Mourinho failed to win a trophy in his first season back at Chelsea last year . VIDEO Chelsea need games - Mourinho . Drogba himself may miss the start of the season after twisting an ankle in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros. A scan yesterday showed no serious damage to ligaments but Mourinho is unlikely to risk the 36-year-old at Burnley on Monday if there is any doubt about his readiness. The injury is a reminder that Chelsea’s squad remains light on strikers. Samuel Eto’o, Demba Ba and Romelu Lukaku have all been sold, leaving three senior strikers at the club: Costa, Fernando Torres and Drogba. Mourinho spent most of last season lamenting the absence of a goalscoring centre forward. Liverpool were propelled to second place by 31 league goals from Luis Suarez and 21 from Daniel Sturridge. Sergio Aguero hit 17 in an injury-hit season for champions Manchester City and his replacement Edin Dzeko scored 16. The glory years: Mourinho guided Chelsea to two Premier League titles in his first spell at the club . When asked near the end of last season why he thought City had proved so strong, Mourinho cited the quality of Dzeko, their ‘third striker’. Eden Hazard was the only Chelsea player in double figures in the last Premier League season, with 14, ahead of Eto’o with nine. Costa scored 27 times in La Liga as Atletico Madrid won the title and he will be expected to transfer that lethal strike rate to England. No time for excuses: Ruud Gullit believes Mourinho must deliver a trophy this season . ‘Chelsea are stronger and it is a team that could do really well,’ added Gullit. ‘It would be a surprise if they did not do well and with the players they have you can play attractive football. The thing is Man City have improved, Manchester United want to do well and Liverpool have bought a lot of players. All the other teams have improved.’ Sky Sports will show more of the games that matter from the Barclays Premier League, plus UEFA Champions League, European qualifiers, La Liga and Eredivisie on Sky Sports 5, your new home of European football.","Chelsea missed out on winning any trophies last season .

The Premier League season is now just 12 days away... and that means the clock is ticking for you to sort out your MailOnline Fantasy Football team. With a £100million budget you may think the options are unlimited, but that cash needs to fund the purchase of 14 players so a bargain or two can go a long way. Here, Sportsmail give their recommendations on three players that offer a bit of value to supplement your squad's marquee signings: Cesar Azpilicueta, Kevin Nolan and Stevan Jovetic. Celebration: Sportsmail gives you the lowdown on three players to help boost your Fantasy Football score . Cesar Azpilicueta (defender, Chelsea) - Value £6.3m . He's the cheapest option of Chelsea's regular back four from last season - isn't that enough? With Jose Mourinho's side keeping the best defensive record around and being famously tight at the back, the clean sheet points are why you'll want Azpilicueta in your side. The Spaniard's ability to play at on the left and right is a huge plus and his impressive stamina usually means he barely misses a game. Add to that the fact that Mourinho experimented with him on the wing last season and you've got a great defensive pick here. The Blues are early title favourites so those win bonus points should add up in Azpilicueta's favour too. At £6.3million he isn't the cheapest, but in terms of value for money you're unlikely to find many better. Class: Cesar Azpilicueta will rack up the clean sheet and win bonus points with Chelsea this season . You shall not pass: The Spaniard is almost impassable on the flank and should be picked by Jose Mourinho . Good record: Chelsea do well against the top sides so you shouldn't have any high scoring nasty surprises . Kevin Nolan (midfielder, West Ham) - Value £6.6m . He's not popular with everyone, but there's no arguing that West Ham skipper Nolan is effective when he's at his best. Nolan will cost you just £6.6million, a snip compared to some of the overpriced midfield talent going around - and typically guarantees goals. He's a nightmare to play against. He famously links up well with Andy Carroll but with the long-haired striker out he will have to make do with fellow big lump Enner Valencia. His ability in the air should give Nolan a fair few knockdowns and rebounds that he loves to capitalise on. And he scored on the opening day of last season at Upton Park - who'd bet against a repeat when typical late-risers Spurs come to town? Captain marvel: Kevin Nolan might not be liked by all West Ham fans but he is certainly effective . Bonus: The midfielder often plays almost as a second striker so should gain more points for your team . Discipline: You might want to transfer Nolan out further into the season if the bookings rack up . Stevan Jovetic (striker, Manchester City) - Value £9.0m . A fairly average first season in English football has pushed Jovetic's price tag down - and you should take advantage when you can. With Alvaro Negredo injured and Edin Dzeko a player whose form peaks and troughs, the Montenegro striker should finally get a good run in Manuel Pellegrini's side. He has been in excellent form in pre season and a decent double against Liverpool showed he can hack it against the Premier League's best - though that shouldn't be a surprise. He scored against Chelsea in the FA Cup last season after his team-mates failed to do so in the league. If you're picking your team based on last season's stats you could overlook Jovetic, but do so at your peril. It's his turn to light up the Premier League and that can only help your Fantasy team. Good option: With Alvaro Negredo out injured Stevan Jovetic should get his time to shine upfront for City . Eye for goal: The Montenegrin forward managed to break the deadlock against City - not many have done that . In form: Jovetic has been in great form for City during their pre season tour of the United States .","The 2014-15 Premier League season kicks-off on August 16 .

As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. GRAZIANO PELLE IN A NUTSHELL . Southampton fans have every right to mourn the exodus of talent from St Mary's this summer, but in recent signing Graziano Pelle, they also have a reason to hope. The muscular 6ft 4in forward has the physical attributes to torment Premier League defences, and a clinical edge to his game that could make him a huge hit on the south coast. VIDEO Scroll down for Southampton's Pelle finds net for Feyenoord with cheeky mule-kick . Physical presence: Pelle has shown himself to be a handful for defenders in Southampton's pre-season games . New arrival: Southampton completed the £8m signing of Pelle from Dutch side Feyenoord earlier this summer . Last season Pelle scored 23 times in 28 games in the Eredivisie for Feyenoord as they finished runner-up behind Ajax. He also prodived six assists for his team-mates over the course of the league campaign and won on average 5.4 aerial duels a game, while having 4.3 shots per match. His pass success rate - at 69.7% - was quite high for a striker that is often trying to bring others into play. (stats courtesy of WhoScored.com) WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE PELLE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Saints boss Ronald Koeman made the Italian his first purchase after taking the reins at the club, with the Dutch coach confident his former Feyenoord charge has what it takes to fill the void upfront created by Rickie Lambert's move to Southampton. The 29-year-old's phenomenal goalscoring record in recent years at Feyenoord shows he poses a far greater threat than your average target man. There is also huge potential for him to thrive leading the line for Koeman's Southampton side, with Jay Rodriguez - should he stay at the club - set to play just off the imposing frontman. His Fantasy Football price, £8.2m, is another reason why it is worth taking a punt on Pelle. He will be first-choice at St Mary's, particularly with Koeman in charge, and his transfer fee is far lower than some other strikers in the Premier League who are likely to see far less playing time. Rickie Lambert. £9.7m. Cough. In action: Pelle shields the ball against VVV Venlo, left, and, right, beats Toby Alderweireld in an aerial duel .

THE GAME HE PROVED HIS WORTH IN . It's early doors for Pelle at Southampton but the striker has impressed in his pre-season outings for the Saints. On his debut he scored twice in his first 45 minutes on the pitch against KSK Hasselt, and he also put in an impressive performance during Koeman's side's 1-0 win over Swindon, Pelle's first match on English soil for the club. His hold-up play was superb in both, and he also showed his ability in front of goal with a couple of neat finishes in the first game and some shots on target in the latter. Off the mark: Pelle scores his first goal for the club during Southampton's friendly win over KSK Hasselt . Making an early impact: The Italian scored twice in Southampton's 6-0 win against KSK Hasselt . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Koeman believes he has got a rare commodity in Pelle after making the Italian his first signing at St Mary's. He said 'I had Graziano in my team for my last two years at Feyenoord. He scored a lot of goals - more than 50 in two seasons - and they brought a lot of points to the club. 'Goals mean points, and we needed a good player in that position after Rickie Lambert left. 'In terms of his qualities, he's a tall striker with a lot of movement and he's fast. He's a player who gives confidence to the team because he keeps the ball, and he's very dangerous in front of goal.' New man: Southampton boss Ronald Koeman believes Pelle can replicate his Feyenoord form at St Mary's . HE'S A BETTER, CHEAPER VERSION OF... LOADS OF PREMIER LEAGUE STRIKERS .

REMY CABELLA IN A NUTSHELL . Cabella is a 24-year-old French international who can play as an attacking midfielder, winger or wide forward. He has signed for Newcastle United from Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier, where he scored 28 times in 115 matches, in order to provide some much needed creativity to Alan Pardew's side.

(stats courtesy of WhoScored.com) WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE CABELLA IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Points are what Fantasy Football is all about - and Cabella should provide them in abundance on Tyneside this season. Newcastle lacked creativity towards the end of last season and Pardew has put his faith in the Corsican-born midfielder to provide some much needed attacking oompf to his side. The Frenchman is full of tricks and flicks - and has been compared to Toon legend David Ginola and Ballon D'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo in the past - and he loves to provide an assist, with five last season. He was also awarded nine Man of the Match awards, meaning he accrued further points as a result. However, most impressively he added goals to his game in 2013. A return of 14 goals from 37 league matches is extremely high for a midfielder - especially one who will cost just £5.9m in Fantasy Football. On Tyneside: Cabella will provide some much-needed attacking flair to Newcastle this season . Contribution: Cabella scored 14 times in 37 matches in Ligue 1 for Montpellier during the last campaign . THE GAME CABELLA PROVED HIS WORTH IN . It's early doors for Cabella at Newcastle but the striker has impressed in parts during his two pre-season outings for the Toon. In his first match against Malaga he struggled to get into a game which Newcastle lost 3-1 - but his next appearance against Schalke was extremely impressive. The midfielder arrived off the bench after 57 minutes and made a huge impact, scoring in the 72nd-minute with a classy run and finish to make the score 3-0. In fact, Cabella was so impressive he was given the Man of the Match award. Newcastle fans will have been licking their lips after seeing this cameo. Off the mark: Cabella nets his first goal for Newcastle against Schalke after an impressive run and finish . Making an early impact: Cabella has played twice in pre-season and has already won a Man of the Match award . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Newcastle boss Pardew was effusive in his praise for his new signing. The Toon manager said: 'We've worked really hard on this and he's a player we think is important, which is represented in the fee and represented in his commitment to us. I'm just looking forward to seeing an exciting talent. 'He's a player who has been on our radar for a while and he is a marquee signing for us. He represents for us all Newcastle fans love in a player. 'He has flair but also real hard work and commitment. He will bring talent to St James' Park I hope our fans really enjoy.' French journalist Julien Laurens was also full of praise for Cabella when he spoke to the Chronicle. He said: 'The most common thing that is said about him is that he's very much like Ginola. This is because it's true and because he gets the fans excited. 'He is very similar to what Ginola was when he was 24. He is a wonderful player and he is someone that the supporters will certainly enjoy watching.'

"By . Tom White, Press Association . With the cost of watching live football rising every year, one owner of a club is instead offering to pay fans to come through the turnstiles. Jamie Waltham, 33, the owner and manager of newly formed non-league Hull United AFC, says he will give £2 to everyone that comes to watch his team play their first home game. He said that many people in the city feel priced out of watching their much bigger rival Hull City in the Premier League so he wanted to offer an alternative. Generous: Jamie Waltham has offered £2 to everyone who comes to the next Hull United home game . 'Everyone in Hull is really proud of what Hull City have achieved,' he said. 'But I speak to a lot of people who feel priced out and prices go through the roof when you are in the best league in the world. 'I’ve felt for a long time we needed a top non-league club and that’s our goal. Hull City started a long time ago by people playing at a similar level of football so I see this as the beginning of a journey for us and the fans that come along. 'I’m offering £2 to everyone that comes through the door, but if people come in and spend £4-5 then we could make a bit of money. We are doing pints of beer for £2, food at discounted prices and we want it to be as affordable as possible. 'If 500 people come through the door then I’ll pay out £1,000 because I feel that sometimes you have to give before you get back. It’s about offering an alternative and an incentive to come down and watching something a little bit different.' Club runner: The 33-year-old is the owner and manager of the newly-formed non-league side . Having bought the ground Dene Park, Mr Waltham is confident that in five years time they will be a well established non-league team and has set his sights on eventually joining the Football League. And his aim started well as they won their first game of the season last weekend away from home, beating Hessle Rangers 3-0. He said: 'If we get five promotions then we will be in the conference so in five years time I want us to be a top non-league club.

Former Treasurer Wayne Swan gives a scathing account of working with Kevin Rudd, who he describes as 'quick to anger' and difficult to work for, in an explosive new book that reveals why he helped architect the coup that ended Rudd's first stint as Prime Minister in 2010. Mr Swan also paints an unflattering portrait of Mr Rudd in his book, The Good Fight, describing him as being 'prone to vengeful behaviour' and having an 'unstable personality', as well as his treatment of others as 'juvenile'. 'There was a culture of fear and blame that had its origins in Kevin's temperament,' Mr Swan wrote. 'He was often quick to anger and his outbursts were regularly disproportionate to the matter at hand.' The memoir goes on to describe a scene in which Mr Rudd caused thousands of dollars of damage to a regional hotel room after he 'snapped a pen in a fit of anger… and dark ink splattered all over the light-coloured décor'. Mr Swan claimed that Mr Rudd was often prone to such outbursts, which he largely directed at junior staff members, saying: 'The turnover in his office was extraordinary. He burned through staff like a child flicking matches from a box.' In the book, Mr Swan defends the decisions behind the political scuffle that lead to the demise of Kevin Rudd as Australia's prime minister . But temper tantrums and character problems made up only a fraction of the faults that led to Mr Rudd losing his role as PM in June of 2010 by caucus, according to Mr Swan. The book also notes the former prime ministers inability to make definitive decisions and manage his cabinet. Mr Swan wrote that Mr Rudd's constant failure to brief himself appropriately before cabinet meetings, infuriated ministers and wasted their time. The book also descibes Mr Rudd as having an 'unstable personality' and describes a number of instances when his temper flared . He also claimed Mr Rudd would put too much focus on the media or politics surrounding a problem, 'rather, our priorities should have been about the merits of the policy,' Mr Swan wrote. The book repeats, time and time again, that Mr Rudd's behaviour was simply impossible to alter and was slowly and clearly leading to his own demise, so much so that he even questioned it himself, asking Mr Swan openly at one stage, 'Are you with me?'. 'Kevin's own behaviour meant that, once the match had been lit, we now had a raging bushfire. It was on,' Mr Swan wrote. The book repeats that Mr Rudd's behaviour was simply impossible to alter and was slowly and clearly leading to his own demise . He later added: 'Sadly, Kevin had brought these events upon himself and we now had no choice but to make the best of the situation.' Mr Swan also takes time in his book to dispel any notion that he himself wished to claim the role of prime minister. He also describes his on-and-off-again relatiopnship with Mr Rudd who he has known for over 21 years - the two of them becoming close family friends, with Kevin even being named the godfather of Mr Swan's only son.","Wayne Swan's new book, The Good Fight, defends the caucus which led to Kevin Rudd losing his role as prime minister in 2010 .

"By . Lucy Thackray . As she prepares to take on the role of former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, actress Rachel Griffiths has revealed her own opinions about the struggles Australian women have to face both in government and in society. 'We need more women on top and our girls do need more strong role models,' she told Sunday Style. '(My daughter) Adelaide said to me the other day, 'Why do they only show boys' sports on television? It's so annoying!' And that's out of the mouth of an eight-year-old!' The upcoming telemovie, Stalking Julia is in pre-production and is based on Kerry-Anne Walsh’s book The Stalking of Julia Gillard: How the Media and Team Rudd Brought Down the Prime Minister. Ms Griffiths will play our first female Prime Minister during her controversial three years in office. Scroll down for video . Rachel Griffiths says she was shocked to see a recent survey reveal Australia 'well down' on the list of countries for working women . Two years ago Griffiths, her husband and their three young children returned to live in Melbourne after around a decade in the US. Griffiths says that the statistics actually prove that Australia's treatment of women is worse than in many other countries. ‘I read an extraordinary survey that showed Australia was well down the list of best places to be a working woman. It was all empirical – it’s not my opinion,' she told Sunday Style. 'It’s based on pay, on promotion, on family-friendly policies, on some areas still being culturally anti-female. She says that the conditions are made too difficult for most women to enter into Australia politics. ‘I get cross that some very talented women I know who would have been brilliant in office have been approached and are consciously saying no.' Griffiths, who will play former Prime Minister Julia GIllard in Stalking Julia, says parliament is not where 'any smart, successful woman I know really chooses to go and make a difference' Griffiths has never been afraid to make her political beliefs known. In March this year, she appeared on ABC’s Q and A and said that parliament is ‘not where any smart, successful woman I know really chooses to go and make a difference’. Griffiths was arrested in 1997, when she went topless to protest the opening of the Crown Casino in Melbourne whilst she was attending the casino’s opening party. At the time, Rachel Griffiths said that the Victorian government, which was being led by Premier Jeff Kennett, had ‘succeeded in raping our state of its dignity, compassion and sense of community.’ When asked why she had chosen to protest in this manner, she told a journalist ‘if I didn’t flash my tits, you wouldn’t have put me in the papers'. The 44-year-old Aussie actress is currently starring in Channel Nine's House Husbands and is in a campaign for Sportscraft. She and her family, including her two daughters, Adelaide and Clementine and her son, Banjo, are here to stay.","Says it's a fact that Australia is more sexist than other countries .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . Traditional Double Gloucester cheese could disappear from Britain for good - because the breed of cow which produces it is dying out, experts have warned. Farmers claim there are now fewer than 450 Gloucester Cattle left in the country thanks to EU regulations over TB and a lack of interest from breeders. If the breed became extinct it would spell the end of Single Gloucester cheese and 'real' Double Gloucester, which is only made from pedigree cows. Farmers claim there are now fewer than 450 Gloucester Cattle (pictured) left in the country thanks to EU regulations over TB and a lack of interest from breeders . Joe Henson, who has helped protect rare breeds for four decades at Cotswold Park Farm near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said the loss would be 'devastating' for cheese production. Mr Henson, the father of BBC Countryfile star Adam Henson, said: 'It would be heartbreaking if we were to lose the breed. 'Apart from them being my favourite breed there would be devastating consequences - especially for cheeses. 'Both single and double Gloucester cheese have become renowned, not only in England, but around the world. 'Back in the day you wouldn't be able to get milk from Gloucester to London before it went off so they would make Double Gloucester cheese with it instead.' He said one of the primary reasons for the lack of Gloucester Cattle was due to the TB regulations imposed by the EU. The herds are at an increased risk as many of them are kept in Gloucestershire, which is a TB hotspot. Mr Henson said that the breed would survive a lot longer if they could be vaccinated against TB. He said: 'If we were able to give our cattle TB vaccinations then they would stand a much better change of lasting longer. 'Unfortunately we can't do this because of EU regulations. Their rules prohibit the use of TB vaccinations. 'This is because if a cow has been vaccinated against it, when blood is taken from the vaccinated animals it will test positive for the disease.' If the breed became extinct it would spell the end of Single Gloucester cheese and 'real' Double Gloucester, which is only made from pedigree cows. Pictured is cheese maker Diana Smart, 86, from Gloucester (file image) Gloucester cows have always been lower in numbers than other breeds of cattle due to the fact they produce less milk. But the milk they do produce is well-suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat. Single Gloucester cheese is made exclusively from Gloucester cattle milk - meaning it would no longer be produced if the cows were extinct. It has PDO (protected designation of origin) status so it can only be made from Gloucester cattle in Gloucester. Double Gloucester cheese is now widely made from the milk of any cattle, but the extinction of the breed would spell the end for 'traditional' Double Gloucester. Mr Henson explained: 'Double Gloucester can now be made using the milk of other cows but it is not quite the same. 'It would be like making your own champagne at home and calling it champagne - it doesn't quite work.' Clifford Freeman, 50, who has worked with the cattle alongside his father at the family farm near Hartpury, Gloucestershire, since he was just seven, said: 'The number of Gloucester cows has seriously been declining over the years. 'One of the reasons for this is due to the TB regulations that have been brought into play. 'It makes moving bulls around very difficult and so a lot of farmers have given up breeding their Gloucester cattle. Gloucester is a traditional, semi-hard cheese which has been made in Gloucestershire since the 16th century. There are two types - Single and Double - and both are traditionally made from milk from Gloucestershire breed cows. Both types have a natural rind and a hard texture, but Single Gloucester is more crumbly and lighter in texture. The flower known as Lady’s Bedstraw was responsible for the distinctive yellow colour of Double Gloucester Cheese (file image) The flower known as Lady’s Bedstraw was responsible for the distinctive yellow colour of Double Gloucester Cheese. The reason for the two types being referred to as Double and Single is not known but theories include because the creamy milk had to be skimmed twice to make the double variety, or because cream from the morning milk was added to the evening milk. There is also a theory that it was because Double Gloucester cheese is typically twice the height. 'Also back in the 1970s there was lots of enthusiasm to increase the numbers of the breed. However all of those farmers are now in their 80s. 'Single Gloucester cheese can only be produced by people with Gloucester cattle, so without them we wouldn't see it on the shelf any more. 'Double Gloucester can now be made using milk from other cows but it would be a bit like having a Cornish Pasty that wasn't from Cornwall.' Back in 1972 the breed was in danger of dying out - with just 60 bovines left, however a group of dedicated farmers worked to increase the herds to almost 1,000 but the 1990s. Now, the Gloucester breed, which has a white belly, tail and stripe down its spine, is in danger once again with just 450 registered cattle still alive. The milk of Gloucester cows is well-suited for cheese making due to the fact it is high in protein and butterfat. Clifford, a member of the Gloucester Cattle Society, added: 'I would be absolutely devastated if the breed was to die out. 'Not forgetting these cows were also used to test cures for small pox - they are a crucial part of bovine history. 'People need to be given a reason to want to carry on breeding that cattle.'","Traditional Double Gloucester cheese could disappear from Britain for good .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has been pictured visiting a seafood factory shortly after conducting a controversial missile test which has worsened relations with South Korea. In echoes of David Cameron's photo opportunity in a fish market in Portugal last week, Kim inspected the newly commissioned Kalma foodstuff factory in Kangwon province today. Kim was all smiles during the official visit, despite earlier conducting a high-precision missile test that was widely condemned by neighboring South Korea.

Kim laughed and joked with staff from the Kalma factory in the country's southern Kangwon province . Kim is often pictured giving 'field guidance' to the country's workers as part of government propaganda . South Korea protested that one of the missiles was fired just half an hour before the Pope was due to land in the southern nation while conducting his first visit to Asia. The rockets were fired from multiple launchers in the North Korean port city of Wonsan and travelled 135 miles before landing in waters east of the Korean peninsula, a South Korean defence ministry official said yesterday. However, an official from North Korea dismissed the idea that the launches had anything to do with the Pope's visit as 'nonsense'. Kim In Yong, research director at the Second Academy of Natural Sciences, said:'The test firing of ultra-precision high-performance tactical rockets was conducted on the scheduled day and time along with our plan to strengthen our self defensive power. 'Our scientists do not know what the pope has done for the people of the world, and especially for our nation, and we don't feel any necessity to know about it.

The launches preceded the start of U.S.-South Korean military exercises set for Monday. Seoul and Washington say the exercises are purely defensive but North Korea regularly protests against what it sees as a rehearsal for war. In Friday's statement, Kim said the South should call off the drills in order to promote a peaceful atmosphere ahead of the Asian Games, set for next month in Incheon, South Korea. North Korea last fired short-range rockets in late July but has since said repeatedly that the launches are specifically designed as counter measures against those drills. 'Given that the U.S. and the puppet forces of South Korea continue staging nuclear war exercises against us in particular, we will take countermeasures for self-defence which will include missile launches, nuclear tests and all other programmes,' a statement carried by North Korean state media last Friday said.","Kim Jong Un visited fish factory in southern province of Kangwon today .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Next time a relative tells you they can't use a touchscreen, show them this video of a tortoise mastering the skill with ease. Researchers trained four red-footed tortoises to use a touchscreen in return for strawberries and other treats. The animals were able to identify between red triangles and blue dots on the display, and even learnt which side of the screen to press. Scroll down for video . The tortoises were trained to use the touchscreen by researchers from the University of Lincoln. They began by teaching the animals basic touchscreen functions, using their noses. During the main experiment, the animals were trained to peck a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen (pictured) The animals also were able to transfer this knowledge to a real-life, offline experiment. Each trial began by showing the tortoise a red triangle on a touchscreen. Once the triangle was touched, using the tortoise’s nose, it disappeared and two blue circles appeared. If the circle on the designated side was chosen, both images disappeared and a reward was provided through an automatic feeder. If the circle on the incorrect side was chosen the tortoise was given a three-second time out during which the screen remained empty. The trial was then repeated. Each correction trial started with the red triangle. The tortoise received correction trials until the correct choice was made. Professor Anna Wilkinson from the University of Lincoln led the study, alongside researchers from the University of Vienna. The tortoises were called Esme, Quinn, Molly and Emily. During the main experiment, the animals were trained to 'peck' a red triangle in the centre of the touchscreen. When two blue circles flashed, they had to peck either the circle on the left, or the one on the right, to get a treat. The correct side was programmed into the machine. The touchscreen was placed in a rectangular box with white plastic walls and a floor covered with grey, rubber lining. A feeder hole was positioned in the centre of the floor, just below the touchscreen. Once the triangle was touched, using the tortoise’s nose, it disappeared and two blue circles appeared (pictured). If the circle on the designated side was chosen, both images disappeared and a strawberry was dropped through an automatic feeder . Pressing the correct circle resulted in the feeder plate turning, which caused a strawberry to drop into the feeder hole. ‘In recent years red-footed tortoises have been shown to be proficient in a number of spatial cognition tasks,’ explained the researchers. ‘The present study investigated the ability of the tortoise to learn a spatial task in which the response required was simply to touch a stimulus presented in a given position on a touchscreen. ‘The results show that red-footed tortoises are able to operate a touchscreen and can successfully solve a spatial two-choice task.’ The numbers on this chart reveal how many attempts the tortoise took to successfully complete each stage of the training. For example, during 10 sessions, Esme took 10 attempts to correctly press the triangle and the correct circle to receive a treat .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Next time you hold a secret conversation in a secure room, you might want to make sure there aren’t any crisp packets or plants in the line of sight of a window. Scientists have found that using a high speed camera, the vibrations of seemingly inanimate objects like these can actually ‘record’ sounds in a room. The incredible technique can be used to identify music, speech and more just by filming objects and monitoring their tiny vibrations. Scroll down for video . Research led by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has shown that sounds can be identified by monitoring tiny vibrations of objects with a high speed camera. In one experiment the researchers identify words being spoken by filming a crisp packet through soundproof glass (shown) The research was carried out at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in partnership with Microsoft and Adobe by Abe Davis, Michael Rubinstein, Neal Wadhwa, Gautham Mysore, Fredo Durand and William T. Freeman. To reconstruct audio from a video, the frequency of the video samples –-that is the number of frames captured in the video per second - needs to be higher than the frequency of the audio signal. Audio such as human speech has frequencies of thousands of hertz, meaning that a high speed camera that can record thousands of frames per second is needed to identify the audio. In their experiment the researchers used a high-speed camera that captured 2,000 to 6,000 frames per second to identify audio. This allowed them to pick out words in speech and hear fairly clearly songs being played. However, they also showed that the technique can be replicated using a digital camera. These typically shoot video in 60 frames per second so, while their quality could not match that of high speed cameras, ordinary cameras could still pick up some sound. This was shown in an experiment where a regular digital camera manages to record the Queen song ‘Under Pressure’ and have smartphone audio recognition software identify the song when it was played back. The team developed an algorithm that can reconstruct an audio signal by analysing tiny vibrations of objects. For example, in one experiment the scientists were able to recover intelligible speech from the vibrations of a crisp packet filmed from 15 feet (4.6 metres) away through soundproof glass. In another experiment, the researchers show how filming the vibrations encountered by a plant’s leaves enabled them to identify that a song playing nearby was ‘Mary had a little lamb.’ ‘When sound hits an object, it causes the object to vibrate,’ says Abe Davis, a graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science at MIT and first author on the new paper. ‘The motion of this vibration creates a very subtle visual signal that’s usually invisible to the naked eye. ‘People didn’t realise that this information was there.’ The algorithm developed by the researchers is able to analyse the motions of an object as a whole when it's struck by sound waves. As different edges move in different directions, the algorithm aligns all the measurements so that they don’t cancel each other out. The result is that it can then identify signals of different frequencies and play them back. This means speech and music can be picked out and identified from the vibrations alone. The . team used a high speed camera filming at thousands of frames per second . and found nanoscale vibrations corresponded to sounds that had been . played. This meant audio such as music and speech could be identified . from video. In the above experiment a song was recorded in the . vibrations of plant leaves . ‘We’re scientists, and sometimes we watch these movies, like James Bond, and we think, “This is Hollywood theatrics. It’s not possible to do that. This is ridiculous,”’ says Alexei Efros, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California at Berkeley. ‘And suddenly, there you have it. This is totally out of some Hollywood thriller. ‘You know that the killer has admitted his guilt because there’s surveillance footage of his potato chip bag vibrating.’ While the researchers’ technique has obvious applications in law enforcement and forensics, Davis is also enthusiastic about the possibility of what he describes as a 'new kind of imaging'. In ongoing work the researchers are trying to determine the shape and structure of objects from just their visible responses to short bursts of sound. ‘We’re recovering sounds from objects,’ he says. ‘That gives us a lot of information about the sound that’s going on around the object, but it also gives us a lot of information about the object itself, because different objects are going to respond to sound in different ways.’ To clearly reconstruct audio from a video, the frequency of the video samples - that is the number of frames captured in the video per second - needs to be higher than the frequency of the audio signal.

"By . Sophie Goodchild for the Mail on Sunday . A £20,000 heart implant that allows patients to have lifesaving MRI scans – which can damage traditional devices – is now being offered on the NHS. The technological advance means that thousands of people with abnormal heartbeats can now undergo these ‘gold-standard’ health checks without risk. Previously, people with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which send electrical pulses to the heart  to change a fatal rhythm into a normal one, were denied MRIs because they use a magnetic field that can stop the metal leads used in the devices working properly. Lifesaving: Penelope Wybrow, 41, pictured with her daughter Jasmine, has been fitted with the new pacemaker, which is the size of a matchbox and sits just below the collarbone . Currently, more than 6,000 people a year in the UK receive ICDs, although this figure is set to increase after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence updated its guidelines meaning more people now qualify for one. Of these, almost two-thirds will need an MRI scan within ten years of receiving a device. The scans allow doctors to view detailed images of internal organs and blood vessels, and are essential in diagnosing additional heart problems, cancer and even diseases such  as Alzheimer’s. Until now, the powerful magnetic fields and radio waves used by  MRI scanners risked causing the implants to deliver an unnecessary shock or heat up and burn the heart tissue. Instead, people have been limited to less sophisticated screening such as X-rays and ultrasound scans, leading to delays in diagnosis. But the new ICD – the Evera MRI SureScan – allows doctors to carry out MRIs on any part of the body including the heart. Developed . in the US over a decade, the battery-operated device  has special . software to protect  the ICD from the scan’s magnetic field and buffers . any interference. Using a wireless laptop, the doctor can reprogramme the 2in-long  ICD before a scan, ‘blinding’ it  from detecting abnormal heart rhythms during this time. The latest device costs twice as much as traditional implants. Penelope Wybrow is one of the first patients in the world to benefit from the new-style implant, which is the size of a matchbox and  sits just under the muscle below  the collarbone. The 41-year-old has cardiomyopathy, a condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken and weaken over time, making it less able to maintain a normal rhythm. This puts her at risk of the heart stopping suddenly. The mother-of-two, who is a carer for the elderly and for disabled children, was diagnosed in 1996 after suffering blackouts, and she was put on drugs to decrease the activity of her heart. Doctors considered her suitable for this new ICD as her condition  is progressive, so she has a high chance of needing an MRI scan. Penelope, who lives on a canal  boat in Hillingdon, North-West London, said: ‘I feel I could live for ever now. It’s given me complete peace of mind. Before, I was scared of taking any exercise or even picking something up – I couldn’t live my life to the full. ‘But this is like having my own personal paramedic which will respond faster than an ambulance and restart my heart. ‘It also means doctors can perform an MRI, which is vital because they can check if my condition is getting worse and give me treatment at the earliest possible stage. ‘Without it, I would have been  able to have an X-ray, for example, but these don’t give such a clear and detailed picture.’ Her operation was carried out  in April by Dr Mark Mason, a consultant cardiologist at Harefield Hospital in London. Other hospitals now offering the device to patients include Wythenshawe Hospital  in Manchester. During the 45-minute procedure, carried out under local anaesthetic, a small incision is made in the left side of the chest to create a pocket in the muscle to hold the ICD. Two wires leading from it are threaded through the incision into a vein in the upper chest and through this into the top and bottom of the heart’s chambers, where they are embedded into the muscle. The patient is sedated while the heart is stopped briefly to test the ICD. Finally, the incision is closed using dissolvable stitches. Dr Mason said: ‘This device means patients can undergo MRI scans, which are the now the gold standard for diagnosing life-threatening  or disabling conditions such as  spinal problems. Thousands were denied these scans before, which led to delays in diagnosis and treatment. The NHS will also potentially save money through people being diagnosed earlier.’ mrisurescan.com .","New £20,000 pacemaker allows patients to have lifesaving MRI scans .

"By . Ben Spencer . Invasive foreign animals and plants such as oak processionary moths, Japanese knotweed and killer shrimp are a spiralling problem that the Government is failing to deal with, a panel of MPs has found. Ten new alien species are arriving in Britain each year and many cause catastrophic problems, according to Parliament’s green watchdog. The Environmental Audit Committee today publishes a report on the problem, which is costing the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year. The worst foreign intruders that are causing 'catastrophic' problems for he Government to deal with . Some 1,875 non-native species were counted in the UK in 2012, of which 282 had become ‘invasive’, the report found. Newcomers including North American signal crayfish, killer shrimp and zebra mussels are having a huge impact on native species, as well as human health and business, the MPs said. Joan Walley, the committee’s chairman, said there are more non-native species than ever before. Japanese knotweed is causing damage costing £165million to tackle . She said: ‘Not all of these species will become “invasive”, but the ones that do can harm native wildlife, clog up our waterways, cause costly problems for homeowners and sometimes even harm human health. 'It is too expensive to control or eradicate all invasive species, so we have to be smart and pick fights we know we can win. We may just have to live with grey squirrels and rhododendrons in much of the UK, but we can and must control other invasive species – like the killer shrimp devastating eco-systems in rivers and lakes.’ The committee is calling for a change in the law that would give the Government new powers to eradicate invasive species before they become established. The oak processionary moth, left, and killer shrimp, right, are among those species having a huge impact on speices native to Britain . The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits releasing non-native species to the wild, but no one has been prosecuted under the law. The MPs believe that ministers should follow the example set by Scotland’s Government, which has passed laws allowing environment officers to enter any land where they suspect invasive species are creating a problem. Some non-native animals have caused profound change, such as the replacement of red squirrels by grey squirrels in most of Britain. Grey squirrels do £10million of damage to trees a year, the report found, while it costs £165million a year to battle Japanese knotweed. The European Environment Agency estimates invasive species cost EU countries £10billion a year, while it cost £11million to clear just one national park in Wales of invasive rhododendron. Some species also affect health. Giant hogweed has given anglers skin inflammations, while common ragweed pollen causes asthma. The Asian hornet, yet to enter Britain, has killed six people in France. Austin Brady, of the Woodland Trust, said: ‘Continued targeted management of invasive species such as rhododendron and grey squirrels must be supported at government level.’ The invaders can damage ancient woods and carry disease, he said. ‘To leave them unchecked in the long term would be a real failure to safeguard our natural heritage.’","Invasive foreign animals and plants are costing the economy hundreds of millions of pounds a year .

"By . Louise Boyle . and Associated Press . A man convicted as a teenager in the slaying of a special education teacher in 2000 has been released from prison after his murder conviction was overturned on DNA evidence. Lorenzo Montoya, 29, pleaded guilty on Monday to being an accessory in the killing of Skinner Middle School teacher Emily Johnson, then 29, in Denver, Colorado. He was sentenced to ten years in prison but was immediately released because he had already served 13 years and seven months of his life sentence. Four of those years, he spent in solitary confinement. His defense attorney Lisa Polansky told MailOnline today that Montoya 'had no hard feelings' and 'was one of the most gracious people she had ever met'. Scroll down for video . Lorenzo Montoya, 29, hugs his mother outside a Denver court on Monday after his murder conviction was overturned. Montoya was wrongfully convicted of murder at age 15 and spent 14 years in jail . Lorenzo Montoya is hugged tightly by his mother on Monday as he is freed from a Denver prison after 14 years for a crime he didn't commit . Lorenzo Montoya, 29, (pictured fourth left with his family on Monday) was freed after his murder conviction was overturned on DNA evidence after he served 14 years . The lawyer said: 'He's not angry. That's not how he wants to be.' She described the moment Montoya walked out of court as him 'being like a kid all over again'. She said that he had been told about the Internet but was now learning all about it. Montoya planned . to move away from Denver and bad influences from his youth, complete . his GED and learn a trade. Ms Polansky added: 'He's thinking about what he wants to do when he grows up.' Montoya had always denied killing Ms . Johnson or stealing her car but admitted to going for a joyride in the vehicle the following day. Ms Johnson, 29, was beaten to death at her home by Nicholas Martinez, then 16, when he stole her brand-new Lexus. The following day, Montoya, then 14, along with others in the neighborhood, took a ride in the car which Martinez told some people he had bought and to others admitted he had stolen. Montoya was brought in for police questioning over the stolen car in the company of his mother. When she left the room, a detective aggressively hounded the teenager, Ms Polanksy said today, forcing a confession. Montoya's police statement was disallowed at his murder trial. However Montoya, then 15, was convicted of murder and other charges and sentenced to life without parole in an adult prison. He spent four years in solitary confinement. Lorenzo Montoya was arrested aged 14 (pictured left) and later convicted of the murder of special education teacher Emily Johnson, 29 (pictured right) who was found brutally beaten to death in her home in 2000 . The teenager was convicted after the . prosecution convinced the jury that a sneaker print and a Bronco jacket . found in the house belonged to Montoya. However forensic testing carried out by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, at the request of Ms Polansky and her team at the Center For Juvenile Justice, found no DNA belonging to Montoya on either item. Ms . Polansky took on Montoya's case free of charge in 2011 and brought it . back to court by arguing that his initial lawyer had failed him. The 29-year-old was cleared on the new DNA evidence. Montoya . decided not to opt for a new trial, which could have taken several . years to come to court, and took the DA's offer of a guilty plea to . accessory to murder. The . victim's family asked for privacy but have previously said that if Ms . Johnson was alive, she would want Montoya to have a second . chance.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Hundreds of Air New Zealand passengers have been stranded in Hawaii after being caught up in two-day delays. More than 220 holidaymakers have been forced to stay for longer on the stunning US island due to a fault on the carrier’s Boeing 767-300. As well as having their trip extended, passengers have also been awarded £500 compensation for the delays. Stranded: 227 holidaymakers have been stuck on Hawaii for two days due to a faulty plane . A faulty indication system prompted pilots to abort flight NZ09 at takeoff on Sunday. And a number of rescheduled departures have since been cancelled after Air NZ failed to repair the fault. The airline has issued an ‘unreserved apology’ to the passengers and offered compensation.Passengers are set to spend a third night in hotels after being again sent away from the airport this afternoon. General manager of customer experience, Carrie Hurihanganui, said: ‘Due to the lengthy nature of this disruption, the difficulty we've experienced in adequately communicating with customers and the fact we have repeatedly let them down, we have made the decision that in addition to our unreserved apology we will also be compensating each customer $1000 in either cash or Airpoints Dollars. Faulty plane: Air New Zealand has apologised to those caught up in the delay (file photo) ‘Due to an unfortunate combination of events this group of passengers has travelled to Honolulu Airport on three occasions expecting to fly, however, on each occasion the aircraft has been unable to depart because of a series of evolving engineering issues. ‘A part was required and we attempted to source a replacement within the US, however, despite assurances, the right part was not supplied. Fortunately, as a backup, we also loaded the part onto NZ10 from our Auckland Technical Operations base this morning and this will arrive in Honolulu this evening.’ The part will be fitted ‘as a priority’, and the flight, now operating as NZ6889, was scheduled to leave at 7.30am on Tuesday local time. Mrs Hurihanganui added: ‘We are incredibly sorry to have let our customers down and will conduct a full review to see how we could have managed this disruption better.’ Around half of those affected by delays had been transferred to an Hawaiian Airlines flight to Auckland earlier in the afternoon, she said, more than an earlier reported 90 passengers. They will arrive in Auckland tonight.","227 passengers were due to leave on flight scheduled to depart Sunday .

"By . Rachel Reilly . A seemingly fit and healthy 28-year-old died from bowel cancer after doctors repeatedly told her she was suffering from a harmless digestive complaint. Nursery worker Holly Slater visited her doctor several times over an 18 month period, yet doctors did did not recognise her symptoms - which included bloating and abdominal cramps - and mistook the beginnings of bowel cancer for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The cancer eventually spread to her lungs, bones and liver and she died in February this year. To this day, there is no clear reason why she succumbed to the disease -  Holly was fit and healthy and there was no family history of the disease. Scroll down for video . Holly, pictured with her beloved dog Maisie, died just a month after this photograph was taken . Her mother Lynne, 59, says outdated . views to the disease cost her daughter's life - and is calling for . doctors not to ignore symptoms in young people. Because Holly had been diagnosed with IBS, she was prescribed medicine to ease her stomach cramps and laxatives to relieve her . constipation. While . they were very effective in improving her quality of life, they were . also masking the symptoms of a far more deadly problem. Bowel cancer is traditionally associated with old age, with nearly 75 per cent of cases affecting those aged over 65. But over the past decade, the number of cases in those aged under 30 has shot up by an alarming 120 per cent. Experts do not fully understand why this is happening, but it is thought changing diets, with increased fatty and high-calorie meals, are fuelling the rise, although many sufferers, such as Holly, have lived a healthy lifestyle. Holly started noticing a change in her digestion in August 2011, then aged 26. She started to suffer mild bouts of abdominal pain and constipation. ‘The doctor diagnosed her with IBS and at that point, apart from being a bit uncomfortable, it wasn’t really causing any day-to-day problems,’ says Lynne. ‘It wasn’t until the beginning of 2012 that the symptoms worsened.' As time went on, Holly developed frequent trapped wind, constipation and occasionally loose motions. 'But there was no bleeding at all so cancer didn’t cross her or the doctor’s mind.’ Close: Holly and mother Lynne enjoying a glass of wine in summer 2010, a year before she started showing symptoms of her disease . Just weeks after this picture with her boyfriend Jeff was taken in Florida, Holly was hospitalised . The bouts of discomfort were also sporadic, which made the symptoms fit perfectly with her IBS diagnosis. In . the first few months of 2012, Holly visited her doctor repeatedly after . she began to vomit.She was sent for a raft of blood and urine tests, . yet results came back entirely normal. Towards the end of March the pain and episodes of vomiting became more frequent, but Holly had booked a holiday in Florida with her boyfriend Jeff and she was keen to enjoy her herself. ‘She thought the stress of planning the holiday had made the IBS worse,’ remembers Lynne. ‘Her dog had also been diagnosed with cancer which caused more stress.’ Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year. It usually starts in the large bowel but can rarely begin in the small bowel. Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss. It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women. Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly. Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease puts you at an increased risk. The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent. On her return, Holly’s condition continued to deteriorate and in the week before she was hospitalised at St Mary's Hospital, on the Isle of Wight, she visited her GP four times. Doctors prescribed her more laxatives and suppositories but by then, she was vomiting almost continually in spite of taking anti-nausea tablets. A further set of blood tests continued to tell her consultants that she was otherwise well, with no cancer antibodies. Eventually she was referred for an ultrasound, but by the time the appointment arrived in April 2012, she had already been admitted to hospital. At St Mary's Hospital, on the Isle of Wight, she was promptly X-rayed and given pain relief. The X-ray showed that there was an abnormality, but doctors could not ascertain what was wrong. ‘The doctors thought she may have another inflammatory bowel condition called Crohn’s Disease and she was given antibiotics,’ says Lynne. ‘Even up until this point she suffered with none of the classic symptoms of bowel cancer such as bloody stools and diarrhoea.’ Doctors then performed a colonoscopy which showed a tumour in her colon. She was immediately operated on and surgeons removed half her colon, surrounding lymph nodes and fitted a colostomy bag. Holly underwent eight cycles of chemotherapy but her oncologist wasn't confident that the treatment would be successful. Unaware: Despite Holly's declining health, she looked welll even as late as last summer . ‘Throughout this period Holly always tried hard to look her best and she found ways to dress that hid the bag,’ says Lynne. ‘She was always very positive.’ In September a CT scan showed that there was no remaining cancer. ‘She was looking forward to getting back to work and getting back to normality,’ adds Lynne. But tragically, after another scan in January this year, lesions were found in her lungs. Holly, pictured shortly before she died, with dog Maisie . She was sent for another scan which revealed that the cancer had spread to her lungs, liver, to her reproductive organs and her bones. On February 14 Holly was admitted to hospital and given antibiotics and oxygen in a bid to relieve a chest infection she had developed. She was also given a session of palliative chemotherapy. The antibiotics did not work and she was moved to a hospice five days later. ‘She died on the following morning very peacefully in her sleep,’ says Lynne. ‘I was able to stay with her all night and for that I will be eternally gratefully to the hospice. 'Holly did not want to be on her own. In the end her chest infection developed into pneumonia and she was so weak that she couldn’t fight it.’ Lynne is stoical about Holly’s illness, saying that she could not have received 'better treatment: ‘They tried their best to cure her. We had good support from the specialist nurses and both of her consultants.’ But she is keen to raise awareness about bowel cancer in the younger generation because, she says, attitudes need to change: ‘The number of cases in young people are rising and it is very easy to misdiagnose the disease. Bowel Cancer UK is campaigning for more widespread screening and faster diagnoses for younger sufferers. Even after her diagnosis and surgery, Holly, pictured here in May 2012, was keen to get on with life as normal . In the first research into the experiences of younger bowel cancer patients, their  ‘Never too Young’ report alarmingly reveals that just under half of women and ten per cent of men saw their GP more than five times before being referred to a specialist, or being diagnosed as an emergency. In some cases, twice as many women as men had to wait over a year before being diagnosed. Some younger people are at higher risk of bowel cancer because of a strong family history, a genetic condition such as Lynch syndrome or because they have an inflammatory bowel condition such as Crohn's disease. However, many of these people are not receiving the screening they need to detect changes that could lead to bowel cancer, say the charity. 'If you have suffered with digestive problems for six weeks or more I urge you to visit your doctor. Don’t think it won’t be you because figures have shown that regardless of age, you are at risk,' says Lynne. Lynne and the rest of her family – her daughter Carly, 31, and husband Ken,63 – were given colonoscopies after Holly’s death and it was found that there was no genetic cause behind her cancer. There is no history of the disease in her family. 'I'd like to think Holly could still be helping others,' adds Lynne, finally. 'It's what she spent most of her life doing.'

"By . Carol Driver . Ryanair could soon be flying to the Middle East and Russia as part of the budget carrier’s plans for expansion. CEO Michael O’Leary has revealed the airline is looking to develop the business in Cyprus, to use it as a hub for flights to destinations including Israel and Jordan. On Monday, reporting a 152 per cent . surge in first quarter profits, O’Leary said he would be ‘very keen’ to . expand into Cyprus as it was revealed the carrier had submitted an . expression of interest in Cyprus Airways at the request of the Cypriot . Government. Scroll down for video . New direction: Michael O'Leary has announced plans to launch flights from Cyprus . There is ongoing debate surrounding the safety of commercial airlines using airspace above politically unstable countries. Last week, US airlines were forced to pull out of Tel Aviv for 24 hours following a rocket attack, while carriers have rerouted planes flying over Syria - and over war-torn eastern Ukraine following the downing of Malaysia Airline’s flight MH17. Speaking about the airline's plans, Mr O'Leary said he would be very interested in using Cyprus as a base to develop new routes. He explained: ‘We are not particularly interested in Cyprus Airways, which has huge legacy issues and historic losses. ‘We would however be interested in growing our business in Cyprus and we would be very keen to base additional aircraft there.’ The airline could offer budget flights from Cyprus to places like Israel, the Lebanon, Egypt, Russia . International routes from Cyprus to destinations outside Europe, which could include budget flights to Israel, Jordan and Russia, would require a licence to fly beyond the EU’s borders. O’Leary added: ‘If we are going to put aircraft in Cyprus, we would need to have a Cypriot air operator’s certificate (AOC) so we could go from Cyprus into some of the Middle Eastern destinations. ‘The problem for us is that once you go out of the EU we can only fly from Ireland because we go back to being an Irish airline with an Irish AOC. ‘But there are other places where it would make sense to have some flights; from say Cyprus to places like Israel, the Lebanon, Egypt, Russia. So we’re looking at a Cypriot AOC.’ Ryanair was among nearly 20 companies to submit a non-binding expression of interest. The process is a preliminary step towards any eventual binding offer by any bidder. Cyprus Airways has struggled to survive against cheaper competitors and has been loss-making for years despite several attempts at a turnaround. The airline has recently resorted to selling assets to stay afloat, including its slots at London's Heathrow airport. ‘We're happy to work with them on all of that,’ said O'Leary, who has discussed expanding Cypriot tourism with the government.","CEO Michael O'Leary said airline wants to use Cyprus as a base .

"By . Leesa Smith . Confidential documents leaked from Tigerair Australia reveal safety concerns including pilots being issued incorrect flight plans and ‘threatening behaviour’ occurring between crews and other workers. The report prepared for the budget airline’s management shows the crew on the Airbus A320 flight, which was carrying 177 passengers from Sydney to Perth March 3, were inaccurately informed that the aircraft didn’t have any people on board therefore needing less fuel, The Sydney Morning Herald reported. ‘This meant that all the supplied flight plan calculations were based on a flight 14,660kgs lighter than the actual aircraft weight,’ the April 1 report stated. Confidential documents leaked from Tigerair Australia reveal safety concerns including pilots being issued incorrect flight plans and 'threatening behaviour' occurring between crews and other workers . Tigerair and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have launched investigations into the incident after the pilots are reported to have discovered the serious error. It is understood that although the aircraft landed with enough fuel in reserve to meet the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's requirements, it may not have met the airline's minimum standards. The document also divulges that Tiger chief pilot Harry Holling emailed all other fellow pilots last month to warn them about recent reports of crew having ‘heated discussions’ with other staff while on line. ‘There is no place for yelling, aggressive or threatening behaviour… this applies to radio transmissions as well as face to face communication,’ the email stated. The recent collision between the hydro-tow bar and the Tigerair plane was also highlighted in the report with the company’s safety bulletin revealing that the tug driver has no ‘verbal link’ with the flight crew or dispatcher. Tigerair is conducting its own investigation into the incident after management reported the collision to the ATSB which decided not to investigate further. However, Tigerair Australia strongly refutes the allegations made in the article published in Saturday’s Fairfax media. 'Safety was not compromised in any of the incidents mentioned and each of these have been managed as part of Tigerair’s robust Safety Management System reporting processes,' a statement said. 'Safety is Tigerair’s number one priority and we have strict procedures in place to ensure the highest standards of safety are maintained at all time.'

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . What we were told last year was happening to Lewis Hamilton may be happening now. We were informed that he was maturing before our eyes, when, in fact, he was plastering himself in tattoos and ostentatiously taking his dog for a walk along the paddock. It was partly a fabrication of the Mercedes PR machine to portray him in this way. For one thing, Mercedes could not accurately estimate whether he was maturing or not. He had just joined the team. Improved: Hamilton has won the last three races and is well primed for a proper title challenge . So while they solemnly told us that he was more contented, more rounded, more relaxed than ever, some of us thought he was on a voyage of discovery. He was finding his way, having been set free from the confines of his father’s instruction and Mercedes’ guiding control. In order to give him the space, Mercedes were laissez-faire. It may well have been a prudent approach to show him love and then, that fundamental bond being established, exercise some hold over him. That is what they have done in stopping him travelling around the world with his dogs, Roscoe and Coco. It was evidently absurd for a serious sportsman to parade his bulldogs at work. It was a distraction for him, it was bad for their ears and a pain for those who wiped up after them (a job that should, surely, have been carried out by the owner or staff specifically engaged by him for the purpose). It is said that Niki Lauda, the Mercedes boss, is behind the move to confine Hamilton’s pets to home – or kennels, or whatever millionaires do with dogs they leave behind. Rooting for Lewis: Nicole Scherzinger looks on during F1 testing in Bahrain in April . Lauda’s view is in accordance with every serious commentator in the sport. Take Murray Walker’s words to Sportsmail. He said: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog. 'Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s – and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars. 'I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. Whoever said that was OK should be drummed out of the Brownies. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It's utter madness.' Sense has prevailed in the end. Man's best friend: Hamilton brought his dog Roscoe into the paddock regularly last season . Where was Dr Steve Peters, the renowned psychiatrist, as Liverpool crumpled from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 at Crystal Palace on Monday night? In Sheffield’s Crucible Theatre watching another of his charges, Ronnie O’Sullivan, lose the World Championship snooker final to the more mentally robust Mark Selby. The backside was somewhat falling out of the mind-bending business, it seemed. This impression was reinforced by Hamilton’s welcome comments that he perceives no advantage in engaging such services. Mind games: Hamilton says he sees no advantage in using a psychiatrist such as Dr Steve Peters (right) ‘Never,' he said when asked if such as Dr Ceri Evans, a psychologist engaged by his Mercedes team in China three weeks ago, would be working with him. ‘Never needed one and will never have one. So we’ll never speak of it again unless I start going crazy.’ My feeling based on conversations with some of the leading sportsmen of the age is that Hamilton speaks for the majority of them. They see no need for some ‘shrink’ to improve their well-tuned, ultra-competitive minds. I do not decry those who have turned to Peters and his ilk. Victoria Pendleton and Chris Hoy, for two, swear by him. I am just saying – indeed, Hamilton is hinting at the fact – that for most sportsmen their advice is unnecessary. Susie Wolff, the Williams test driver, aka the world’s fastest woman, appears not to be doing her status as an equal-opportunities employee much good in her casting at the football match played annually before the Monte Carlo Grand Prix. To see what I mean case your eyes a long way down the list... Tag: Wolff may not be doing her status as an equal-opportunities employee too much good .","Mercedes have exercised some hold over Hamilton... by stopping him travelling around the world with his dogs .

"By . Rob Waugh . Underground lava flows on Mars have carved out channels beneath the surface - and the long-dead volcanoes have left a network of tunnels in which life could thrive. Distinctive 'pit chains' on the surface of Mars surround the Tharsus Montes volcanoes on the Red Planet - showing that tunnels and cavities have collapsed after the lava flows ceased. Scientists now believe that remaining tunnels - which may have had running water in their million-year-history - could be tempting targets in the search for microbial life on the Planet. The distinctive markings are thought to have formed when underground lava flows carved out tunnels which then collapsed . Topographic map showing the elevations of the markings on the surface . The markings are found next to huge volcanoes on the Martian surface . The thin atmosphere of Mars means that the planet is blasted with 250 times more radiation than Earth - so life on the surface is unlikely. Subterranean tubes, protected from the deadly rays, could provide a 'haven' for life - particularly if water was present. Mars landers have measured surface . radiation around 250 times higher than that found on the Earth, and more . than double that experienced by astronauts on board the International . Space Station. Any caves associated with the . pit-chains may in future provide a possible refuge for astronauts from . the harsh surface radiation. The tubes were detected in  images released from European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter, revealing a series of ‘pit-chains’ on the flanks of one of the largest volcanoes in the Solar System. The images, taken on 22 June 2011, cover Tractus Catena in the Arcadia quadrangle, part of the vast Tharsis region on Mars. This region boasts a number of huge volcanoes, including the three collectively known as Tharsis Montes. To their north sits Alba Mons, also known as Alba Patera, one of the largest volcanoes in the Solar System by area and volume. Pit-chains can have a volcanic origin. Lava streaming from a volcano solidifies on the surface, leaving a molten tube of lava running below. The collapsed tunnels indicate there might be undgerground areas which still exist - and which could offer a haven for microbial life . Once volcanic activity ceases, the tube empties, leaving behind a subterranean cavity. Over time, parts of the roof over the cavity may collapse, leaving circular depressions on the surface. On Earth, recent examples can be seen on the flanks of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii, while on the Moon, Hadley Rille, visited by Apollo 15 in 1971, is believed to have formed in the same way billions of years ago. Another scenario for the creation of the unusual features involves groundwater. On Earth, there are clear examples of similar structures in ‘Karst’ regions – after the German name for a region extending from Slovenia to Italy, where this phenomenon was first studied. Some of Earth’s most famous examples are the network of ‘cenotes’ on the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. These deep natural pits form when the surface limestone rocks collapse, exposing the groundwater underneath. This origin is the most interesting in the context of the search for microbial life on Mars. If there are any cave-like structures associated with the pits, microorganisms could have survived, protected from the harsh surface environment.","Collapsed lava tubes indicate there may be caves under Martian surface .

Experts . have already warned that the condition is set to strike thousands more . older people - even those who were never sufferers in the past. Late-onset . hay fever affects people in their 30s, 40s, 50s and older, and can be . triggered by pollution, stress and even moving home. These . triggers can cause symptoms in people with a genetic predisposition to . hay fever whose immune systems have reached a ‘tipping point’. Professor . Jean Emberlin, scientific director of the charity Allergy UK, said: . ‘They have to become sensitised and more people will reach this . threshold because of the interaction between pollen and traffic . pollution.' Hayfever is caused by allergy to pollens and symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes. Sometimes the sinuses and throat can be affected. Children aged five to 14 years are most affected, followed by people aged between 15 and 24 years old. Maureen Baker, chair of the RCGP, said: 'Each year, seasonal hay fever causes untold misery to thousands of people across the country, especially when we all want to enjoy the warm weather. 'Hay fever is awful but the discomfort should only be temporary and there should be no long-term effects. High pollen count: The number of hay fever sufferers in this country increases every year . 'Whilst in some cases it may be necessary to see a doctor, especially if the symptoms persist, there are many anti-histamine medications that can be bought over the counter at your pharmacist that should provide effective relief. 'Patients that suffer from hay fever can also take simple steps to help minimise their exposure to pollen, such as wearing a hat with a wide brim and sunglasses, and applying Vaseline to nostrils to help trap pollen particles.' Up to 18 million Britons suffer hay fever, with their numbers increasing by almost one per cent a year.","Doctors report seeing almost double the amount of patients than last year .

"By . Matt Barlow for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Arsenal laboured to a goalless draw with Besiktas in the first-leg of their Champions League qualifier in Istanbul. Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba almost embarrassed the Gunners with a shot straight from the kick-off but there is still all to play for in the second-leg at the Emirates, although Arsenal will be without Aaron Ramsey after the midfielder was sent off for a second bookable offence. Sportsmail reporter Matt Barlow was at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium to give his thoughts... Grounds for complaint . Besiktas fans are not fond of their temporary home but they have made a good job of transporting their raucous din and spectacular forest of giant red-white-and-black flags to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium while their historic arena in Dolmabahce, on the banks of the Bosphorus, is rebuilt.

Former Fulham starlet Kerim Frei could be found on the Besiktas bench under his new Turkish identity. Turk that! Former Fulham midfielder Kerim Frei (L) has changed his name to Kerim Koyunlu . The 20-year-old former Swiss U21 international, who was actually born in Austria has a Turkish father and is now a fully-fledged Turkish international and he is known as Kerim Koyunlu. It was considered quite a coup with Fulham lured him from Grasshoppers as a teenager but he was never able to establish himself at Craven Cottage. Room with a view . The eight lane running track afforded Arsene Wenger and Slaven Bilic plenty of room to express themselves, in what must be some of the grandest technical areas at this stage of the competition. Naughty step: Besiktas coach Slaven Bilic was sent to the stands after arguing with the referee Milorad Mazic . Ever-popular Bilic arrived with his rock star denims, hugging well-wishers and staff at the stadium gates, but was into his club suit for the game. However, the former West Ham defender could not control his emotions and was sent to the stands towards the end of the game after arguing with  referee. Life's a pitch . Turkey hope this enormous venue will be earmarked for a key role in the city-hopping Euro 2020 finals but the quality of the pitch last night left a lot to be desired. Bobbly: Arsene Wenger was not impressed by the state of the pitch at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium . Arsene Wenger, a stickler for this kind of thing, was not impressed. From way back in the stands it looked patchy and bobbly and Besiktas were certainly quicker when it came to finding the right rhythm on it. Sign of respect .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . David Cameron has warned that the UK is battling a 'warped and barbaric' brand of Islamic extremism and that 'military prowess' may be needed to stop it . The UK is in a generational struggle against a poisonous brand of Islamic extremism which will bring terror to Britain if nothing is done to stop it, according to David Cameron. The Prime Minister has warned that the West faces having an extremist state on the borders of the Mediterranean if IS extremists succeed in their goals. Cameron has also signalled that airstrikes will not be enough to defeat the terrorist organisation, and has called for  'tough, intelligent, and patient' measures to combat the threat. Writing in today's Sunday Telegraph, Cameron said Britain will have to use its 'military prowess' to help defeat a 'warped and barbaric' movement before UK citizens become the target of attacks. Mr Cameron said: 'The creation of an extremist caliphate in the heart of Iraq and extending into Syria is not a problem miles away from home. 'Nor is it a problem that should be defined by a war 10 years ago. It is our concern here and now. 'Because if we do not act to stem the onslaught of this exceptionally dangerous terrorist movement, it will only grow stronger until it can target us on the streets of Britain. We already know that it has the murderous intent.' The Prime Minister also vowed action on those recruiting for IS in Britain, saying that anyone posting videos promoting the group will be arrested. He also pointed to statistics saying that police officers have already removed 28,000 pieces of terrorist related material from the web, including 46 IS videos. Mr Cameron raised fears that the struggle against the terrorists would last ‘the rest of my political lifetime’. He was speaking as RAF Tornado jets returned to RAF Akrotiri in western Cyprus after carrying out vital ‘recon’ sorties over Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq. No 10 officials denied Mr Cameron was paving the way for British military action in Iraq – which he has repeatedly ruled out. Mr Cameron said that IS setting up an Islamic caliphate in the Middle East was a problem for Britain, and said any action there should not be defined by the previous Iraq was . But diplomatic observers seized on his reference to the 2003 Iraq War, seen by most as a catastrophe for Iraq and Britain, as well as for Mr Blair personally. Government insiders said Mr Cameron’s comments were meant to signal that he refused to accept the Iraq War was the cause of the current crisis – or that Britain had no right to be involved in attempts to tackle it. The Observer is also reporting that senior figures in the Church of England have penned a letter to Mr Cameron attacking his Middle East policy as incoherent and badly planned. Written bythe bishop of Leeds, Nicholas Baines, with the support of the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the letter says policy seems to be dictated by 'the loudest media voice at any particular time'. The note also accuses the Government of abandoning Christian minorities in Iraq feeling extremists in the city of Mosul, while leaping to the defence of Yazidis trapped on Mount Sinjar. Baines writes: 'Does your government have a coherent response to the plight of these huge numbers of Christians whose plight appears to be less regarded than that of others? 'The French and German governments have already made provision [for Christians driven from their homes], but there has so far been only silence from the UK government.'","David Cameron has said 'military prowess' may be needed in fight against IS .

"By . Aaron Sharp . The uproar over an American TV host who bragged about killing a defenceless lion before posing for a picture with its corpse may have persuaded many big game hunters to keep their heads down. But these bloodthirsty beauty queens have come out in support of the practice which was cast into the spotlight by Melissa Bachman, drawing new attention to the popularity of hunting among women. Olivia Nalos Opre, 36, and mother-of-two Mindy Arthurs, 39, have shot more than 70 species - including lion, rhino and bears. Scroll down for video . Olivia Opre, 36, left, and mother-of-two Mindy Arthurs, 39, have shot more than 70 species including lion, rhino and bears. They justified the actions of hunters, saying they are simply 'managing the herd' Olivia Nalos Opre is a one time Mrs America contestant and 2004 Mrs Nebraska winner. Despite travelling the world to hunt, she considers herself a conservationist . Mindy Maples Arthurs says she receives hoards of hate mail accusing her of being a self-gratifying killer, but she actually describe themselves herself as a 'true animal lover' But despite receiving hoards of hate mail accusing them of being self-gratifying killers, the pair describe themselves as true 'animal lovers' and say their kills help conservation. Arthurs, from Arizona, said: 'You can be a hunter an a conservationist at the same time. People think you're just killing stuff but if you don't manage a herd then the whole of the herd will die. 'We are taking care of the big picture. I feel the general public doesn't realise that.' Arthurs, right, said she has been hunting since 2008 when her first kill was a black bear which she executed with one shot. Opre travels the world to stalk her prey, she is pictured in New Zealand having shot a stag, right . This picture of Opre with an African Lion she hunted and shot is reminiscent of the snap which Melissa Bachman posted to global outrage . Mindy Arthurs, pcitured with a 2000lbs buffalo, said she prefers to kill with a bow and arrow as it is more 'intimate' Mindy Arthurs hunts with her family including her children, 14 year-old Alec, far right and and 11 year-old Owen, second from right . The brunette has been hunting since 2008 and opened her account by killing a black bear with one shot. She said she felt 'on fire' and instantly knew she wanted hunting to be part of her life and that of her two sons, Alec, 14, and Owen 11. Arthurs uses both a rifle and a bow-and-arrow to take down game throughout the USA but prefers to use a bow as it is more 'intimate'. She added: 'I enjoy the challenge. I enjoy knowing the prize I'm going after is out there and the excitement that goes along with pursuing it. 'You feel so much respect when you walk up on an animal you have taken. You feel a connection to the animal, a very strong connection.' The pair are avid collectors of 'trophies' and have houses full of their past kills which have been stuffed . Opre has pictures with animals she has simply tranquilized for the photo opportunity. Here she sits next to a sedated White Rhinoceros she darted in Africa . Opre hunted this Gobi Ibex in the Gobi Desert Mountain, Mongolia . Arthurs now has her sights set on being crowned Extreme Huntress 2013. The competition has been organised by Opre, from Montana, who has been hunting since she was 16. In that time she has killed more than 65 species across six continents and earned the world's most prestigious accolade for a female hunter - the Safari Club International Diana Award. The former Mrs America contestant has shot in eight countries across Africa and killed a hippo, a Cape Buffalo and darted a black rhino. But her 'most memorable' hunt was shooting a male lion in Benin in West Africa. She said: 'I hadn't planned on hunting lion but unexpectedly came across one and my professional hunter expressed urgency to react. I shouldered the rifle, shot and missed, encouraging the lion to run hastily into the forest' Arthurs poses with a Bull Elk which she hunted near her family home in Arizona . In on the act: Mindy Arthurs' 11 year-old son Owen posing for a picture with his first hunt, a mountain lion, in Peoria, Arizona . 'Then a herd of angry elephants came out of the forest and charged with intention to kill us. This caused the lion to divert, granting me only a running shot. 'I shouldered the rifle again and hit the lion by giving it a six-foot lead. It was a marvellous shot but the elephants were charging and we had to immediately react and so we shot in the air and shot at the ground to give them a warning and they stopped 20 yards away. 'We went in after the wounded lion and he came running out of the forest to kill me. I shot and reloaded, shot and reloaded and the lion expired at my feet. 'I was the first woman to kill a lion in that country and the celebrations were incredible. It was of significant importance to the villagers who's cattle had been the target of such a beast. It was the hunt that shaped who I am.' Killing runs in the blood for Arthurs, here she is seen posing with her first hunt, a bear, that got her into Boone and Crockett record books at San Carlos Indian Reservation in Arizona . 'Intimate': Athurs believes that killing an animal with a bow and arrow, which she is posing with above, gives her a greater connection to the beast she has executed . Opre and Arthurs, who are both keen taxidermists and have huge trophy rooms, are no strangers to controversy - both in and outside the world of big game hunting. They say they are the targets of both anti-hunting protests and from male hunters who say that blood-sports are no place for women. However, Arthurs, who hunts primarily in the USA, says she is doing nothing wrong and even donates her meat to food banks, while Opre says meat from her kills goes to the indigenous people. Opre added: 'Wildlife abounds because hunters put money back into conservation. Locked and loaded: Opre is less particular about how she kills her prey as she loads up a hunting rifle ahead of hunting . Indiscriminate: Opre with a Roan Antelope, which is one of the 70 species she is estimated to have killed during her time hunting . 'In foreign continents like Africa, we help to drill water wells for the natives and the wildlife. We help to build schools and medical facilities. We create jobs for trackers and skinners. 'As hunters, we are providing the indigenous people with the protein they wouldn't have otherwise. Nothing is wasted; everything goes back into the circle of life. You can go on a photographic safari in Africa for $6,000 or you can take a big game hunting expedition for up to $125,000 - you do the math - who's generating more money for the local economy?' She added: 'I see myself as the most important conservationist there is. Hunters put back so much into the world's great wildlife and make sure future generations can experience what our forefathers experienced.'

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . A couple has been charged with the kidnapping of two Amish girls who went missing Wednesday night from their farm in Upstate New York. Fannie and Delila Miller, ages 12 and 6, reappeared after 24 hours missing when they knocked on a stranger's doorstep 36 miles from their home in Oswegatchie, New York. They have since been reunited with their family. On Friday, local authorities announced the arrests of Stephen Howells II, 39, and 25-year-old Nicole Vaisey. According to the suspects' Facebook accounts, they appear to be a couple. They have now been charged with intending to sexually abuse or physical harm the girls and two counts of first-degree kidnapping. Scroll down for video . Stephen Howells II and Nicole Vaisey have been charged with intending to sexually abuse or physically harm two girls and two counts of first-degree kidnapping . Arrests made: Stephen Howells II, 39 (left), and 25-yeasr-old Nicole Vaisey (right) were arrested Friday in connection to the kidnapping of two Amish girls in Upstate New York . Back home: Amish girls Fannie, 12 (pictured), and Delila Miller, 6, reappeared Thursday night after 25 hours missing. Neither girl had been photographed before their disappearance, per Amish custom . They have been jailed without bond. St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said: . 'The suspects agreed to go to the sheriff's office to be interviewed earlier today and they were arrested after those interviews,' Rain said. Police haven't released more information about the couple, other than to say they were arrested at their home in Herman, NY - 20 miles from where the Miller girls were found in Richville, New York. A neighbor described them as boyfriend and girlfriend to 7News and said three other children lived in the house. On his Facebook page, Howells appears to be a father to three children. It's uncertain whether his girlfriend, Vaisey, is the mother. Two cars were parked on the property, one red and one white, which appear to match descriptions of the vehicles used in the kidnapping. The couple could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted. Thursday night, an Amber Alert was called off when the two children knocked on the door of Jeff and Pam Stinson, 36 miles away in Richville, New York. The couple said the two girls were . cold, wet, hungry and still wearing their traditional Amish garb when . they knocked looking for help, a family friend told ABC News. Jeff . Stinson immediately recognized the girls since he had purchased corn . from Fannie before, and had read news reports about their disappearance. Before driving them home, the Stinsons fed the girls watermelon and juice and said they couldn't stop eating the fruit from hunger. They then drove the Miller girls back to the farm where they were happily reunited with their family. The . Stinsons told police that the girls ducked down in the back seat at one . point during the drive, after noticing their kidnapper's red car parked . on the side of the road. A photo posted to Howell's Facebook shows two cars parked on his property, which seem to match the description of the vehicles used in the kidnapping . Relief: Supporters gather on the porch of the family's house Thursday after the two girls were returned safe . Distance: The above map shows the distance between Oswegatchie, the town where the girls disappeared, and Richville, where they were found. About 12 miles from Richville is Hermon, NY, where the suspects were arrested at their home . An . Amish witness who was passing told authorities that he saw a man put . something in the back of his white four-door sedan and, when he drove . off, the little girls were gone. 'The . girls walked up to a stranger's house, thank goodness they had enough . courage to do that, knocked on the door, and that person took them . home,' District Attorney Mary Rain told ABC News. The girls 'seem to be healthy' after being reunited with family, officials say. The episode left a sense of vulnerability in a community where residents said even small children often walk unaccompanied to school. 'One thing that comes from this is that people learn this can happen in a small town,' Rain said. ""I think the public will take precautions, and that's the sad thing.' Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended. Ritchie said the Amish are responding in a way that may forever change a familiar feature of the local landscape: Some are taking down their roadside stands. 'This has sent a shockwave through their community,' she said. If convicted in the kidnapping, the couple could spend 25 years to life in prison .

"By . Snejana Farberov For Mail online . Four years after Rachelle Friedman became paralyzed as a result of an accident at her own bachelorette party, the North Carolina woman announced that she and her husband are expecting. Friedman, 28, took to her Facebook page Wednesday to share with the world the good news. 'We are going to have a baby!!' she wrote. 'Due date? April 19th. We are elated.' Friedman, who is quadriplegic, is using a surrogate mother - her friend from college Laurel Humes - to carry the baby to term for her. They're expecting: Rachelle Friedman (center), who has been paralyzed since 2010, announced on Facebook this week that come next April, she will be a mother thanks to her surrogate, Laurel Humes (left) Miracle of life: Friedman shared online the first ultrasound images showing her baby developing in her friend's womb . The surrogacy plan has been in the works for months, and Friedman has been anxious for her friend to become pregnant. As recently as last week, Friedman shared a photo on her Facebook page showing her, husband Chris and their surrogate, Mrs Humes, at a fundraiser. The image was accompanied by the status update: 'Crossing our fingers she's pregnant right now.' Just days before making it official, Rachelle Friedman posed with her husband and her friend's first ultrasound printout. 'First family photo,' the elated mother-to-be wrote. Friedman postponed her wedding to fiance Chris Chapman for a year after the shocking accident in 2010 in which she broke her neck after being playfully pushed into a pool. In June, Laurel Humes, 31, a friend of Friedman's from college, volunteered to carry Chris and Rachelle's child after following her old friend's story and hearing how she and Chapman were trying to raise $60,000 to pay for a surrogate. Exicited for the future: The 28-year-old wife and soon-to-be mother has been anxious for her friend to get pregnant with her baby . True love: Chris Chapman waited for a year to marry his fiancee after her horrific accident in 2010 . Friend in need: Humes and Friedman knew one another in college and now Humes is going to carry Friedman's child for her . Friedman's most dearly-held wish was to have a family, and she was elated when doctors told her that despite her catastrophic injury, she would be able to carry a child to term. 'It was very scary,' she told People earlier this summer. 'I knew I was paralyzed and the first thing I asked the paramedics was whether I could have kids. I was ecstatic when they said yes.' However, her joy turned to sorrow when she discovered that medications she must take for her blood pressure can be dangerous to a fetus. After reading a post on Friedman's blog about needing a surrogate, Humes, a stay-at-home mother of one, knew she wanted to help. 'My husband was a sperm donor for some of our friends, a same-sex couple, and that inspired me to think about surrogacy,"" Humes of Asheville, North Carolina, told People. 'I'm really excited,' she said at the time. 'I know Chris and Rachelle will be great parents and I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when they get to hold their baby for the first time.' Doctors have retrieved Friedman's eggs transferred the fertilized embryos into Humes sometime in July. The 28-year-old and her husband Chris, from North Carolina, had launched a crowdfunding campaign in May in a bid to raise money for the procedure, which can cost up to $120,000. Friedman says that although she wants a girl, her husband said he would like a 'fishing buddy.' Her August 13 Facebook post made no mention of the baby's sex. Mother-to-be: Rachelle Friedman and husband Chris Chapman, leave their 2011 wedding reception . Overjoyed: Friedman's eggs were harvested and in July, the fertilized embryos were implanted in Humes . But their prayers were unexpectedly answered just weeks after setting up their page. Chapman said: 'We had a college friend of ours who . stepped forward and wanted to help out. 'She said she'd already been . looking into surrogacy and wanted to help us start a family.' His overjoyed wife added: 'It's amazing, it wouldn't be possible without her. Surrogacy is astronomically expensive, it's crazy.' Touching on the discrimination she faced after announcing she wanted children, she added: 'A lot of . people . . .  don't think someone in a wheelchair can be a mother, that . I'm not physically able to take care of a kid but people underestimate . my abilities. Even with their surrogate stepping in for free, the Chapmans say lawyer fees and other expenses will 'add up.' Their fundraising page remains active, and so far they have collected $14,165 in donations. Desperate times: While the North Carolina native (left, before the accident and right, on her wedding day) is biologically able to have children, her medications would be harmful to a fetus . Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted in May . Friedman has published a book, The Promise: A Tragic Accident, a Paralyzed Bride, and the Power of Love, Loyalty, and Friendship, which delves into her life before and after she became paralyzed. The accident occurred in 2010, . just weeks before her wedding, when the bride-to-be was at her own . bachelorette party with her four bridesmaids. When . the girls decided to take a dip in the hotel pool one night, one of . them pushed her in and she fell too close to the shallow end. 'I broke my neck upon impact, became paralyzed from the chest down and would never walk again,' she told xoJane.com. It took two-and-a-half months of intensive physical therapy for Friedman to rebuild her upper body strength and regain movement in her arms and fingers.

New chapter: Friedman's book tells the story of her life, injury and recovery . 'She . is and will always be one of the my closest friends,' she stated, . explaining that her decision to keep her friend's identity a secret is . something she never once questioned. 'It's not our sisterly bond that keeps . me from saying her name in interviews,' she wrote. 'It's the fact that . she's a human being.' Friedman also revealed that the friend who pushed her into the pool has been instrumental in her journey towards motherhood.

A Colorado mother accused of shooting dead her 9-year-old son in a murder-suicide attempt has been sentenced to 40 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. Lisa Lesyshen, 47, broke down in tears and answered Judge Michael O'Hara through sobs as she entered her plea Monday in Denver. Lesyshen was left paralyzed after shooting Asher Lesyshen-Kirlan and then herself May 29, 2013, at their home south of Steamboat Springs. Scroll down for video . Justice for Asher: Lisa Lesyshen, 47, pleaded guilty and was immediately sentenced to 40 years in prison Monday for killing her 9-year-old son, Asher, in a bugled murder-suicide plot last spring . Murderous: Lesyshen, left, shot her 9-year-old, pictured right, five times in May 2013 after discovering that her  husband was having an affair . She earlier pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to first-degree murder, child abuse resulting in death and domestic violence. Steamboat Today first reported that she intended to change her plea. 'I would imagine that the punishment you experience every day pales to the punishment' called for by the court, O'Hara told her. ‘After consulting with the victim’s family and the investigating agencies, I concluded that this agreement was the best way to bring this tragic case to a close,’ District Attorney Brett Barkey stated in a press release. ‘Our hope is that this outcome brings some measure of justice to Asher and his family.’ Lesyshen's husband, Michael Kirlan, declined to speak at the hearing but afterward said he was satisfied with the sentence and glad there would be no trial. During Lesyshen's preliminary hearing, Kirlan testified that he awoke to gunshots the morning of the shooting, which came two days after his wife discovered he was having an affair, Steamboat Today reported. He said Lisa Lesyshen was worried he was going to abandon his financial obligations to her and their son, which he said he never intended to do.

Lesyshen has been jailed in Denver and attended court hearings there because of her special medical needs. As she wheeled herself out of the courtroom after sentencing Monday, Mrs Lesyshen was seen mouthing the words, 'I love you,' to her parents and brother sitting in the audience, according to CBS Denver. According to court documents, Lisa Lesyshen entered her son's room at around 3am on the morning of May 29, 2013, and shot the boy five times in the head, leg and chest as he slept. The boy's father, Michael Kirlan, was awakened by gunfire and ran to Asher's room, where he came face to face with his wife, who told him, 'I don't know what just happened in there.' When Kirlan saw his son bleeding on the bed, he called out to Lisa asking why she did it. She replied, 'to hurt you,'Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier reported at the time. She then entered her bedroom, and moments later another gunshot rang out. Kirlan called 911 saying his son had been shot and that Lisa Lesyshen had a gun and was telling him to kill her. Deputies arriving at the Routt County home found Lesyshen wounded in the neck and her nine-year-old son dead. The mother left a note for her estranged husband that read, 'Remember you are responsible for what has happened here and you are the person that caused it.' The letter was signed, 'Lisa and Asher.'

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Tasty treat: The FDA said it did not know how many jars had been recalled by Hain Celestial Group . A number of peanut butter and almond butter products have been recalled over fears of a possible salmonella contamination. Hain Celestial Group Inc admitted today that there have been reports of four illnesses that may be related to the nut butters. The affected products were sold under the brand names Arrowhead Mills peanut butters and MaraNatha almond butters and peanut butters. Also being recalled were some lots of private-label almond butter from grocers Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Kroger and Safeway. A total of 45 production lots are affected. They were sold in the US, Canada, the Dominican Republic, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. NSpired Natural Foods Inc, a subsidiary of Hain Celestial, voluntarily recalled the products after routine testing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found the problem. The FDA said it did not know how many jars of nut butters were recalled. The company would not comment. Typical symptoms of salmonella infection are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain. These symptoms generally develop within one to three days of exposure to the bacterium and may last for up to a week. While anyone can become ill from exposure to salmonella, health officials say the risk of infection is particularly high for children, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. While salmonella contamination is usually associated with eggs and poultry, outbreaks have been linked to peanut butter in the past. Most recently, in 2012, peanut butter processor Sunland Inc was linked to an outbreak that spread across 20 US states and affected 35 people. In 2008/09 more than 700 people were affected by an outbreak linked to infected peanuts, while more than 500 have fallen ill over the last year and a half in an outbreak linked to Foster Farms chicken. Precaution: Whole Foods was among the retailers to have jars of almond butter recalled .","Safeway and Kroger also affected as 45 batches of spread are recalled .

Flooding from heavy monsoon season rains in the Phoenix area forced authorities on Tuesday to close several major roads, including a portion of Interstate 17, while elsewhere dramatic scenes were playing out as motorists were pulled from partially submerged vehicles and a helicopter crew rescued stranded residents from a home surrounded by swift-moving waters. A small trailer park was evacuated in a town about 40 miles north of the metro area, and a north Phoenix high school temporarily relocated 12 classrooms of students because of flooding in portions of the building. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for much of the metro area and north of the city where up to 8 inches of rain fell by midday in some of the mountainous regions along the interstate.

Just hours before, Mullins allegedly smashed a window at the drive-through of Family Care Pharmacy on Main Street in Swansboro and went into the building with a bag over his head. Security footage shows he then put a towel over his face in a bid to hide his identity before he pulled out the safe and attached it to the back of his car with the rope around 5.30am, WCTI reported. Witness Carmen Fickling said she saw the suspect's car and open trunk outside the pharmacy around 7.10am on Tuesday. 'You could just tell he was messing with something and having a struggle,' she told WCTI. 'A lot of things crossed through my mind as to what could possibly be going on and none of them were good.

"By . Associated Press . and Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A grandmother who drank lye after a restaurant worker thought it was sugar and accidentally put the toxic cleaning chemical in her tea has suffered extensive internal damage. Jan Harding, a 67-year-old married mother-of-three, is in critical condition and fighting for her life at a burns unit at a Salt Lake City hospital, her lawyer has said. On Thursday, doctors carried out an endoscopy, which involves inserting a tube with a light and camera into the digestive tract, to assess the damage - and it is worst than they initially thought. Mrs Harding has suffered deep, ulcerated burns in her upper esophagus and severe mouth burns, her family lawyer Paxton Guymon said. Improving: Jan Harding, pictured with her husband, is in now in serious condition after accidentally drinking lye at a BBQ restaurant. An employee reportedly thought a toxic cleaning agent was sugar . 'The news was very disappointing and . disheartening for the family,' he said in a statement. 'The burns were . deeper and more extensive than we had hoped.' Mrs . Harding had taken a sip of the tea, which she had poured from a . self-serve beverage station at Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan, . before she spat it out and said: 'I think I just drank acid.' Jan and her husband Jim had gone to the restaurant after attending church on Sunday. Investigators and the restaurant manager have told the Hardings that a worker mistook the cleaning product for sugar and accidentally mixed large quantities of it into the iced-tea dispenser, her lawyer Paxton Guymon said. 'It's disturbing that this kind of toxic, poisonous material would be in the food prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat,' the attorney said at a press conference on Thursday. 'I don't know how something like that can happen.' Police in South Jordan 0 which is about 15 miles south of Salt Lake City - are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the sweet-tea container, but they think it was accidental, Police Cpl. Sam Winkler said. Investigators are reviewing video footage from inside the restaurant and interviewing staff who worked that day and in the days leading up to the incident. Scene: She had taken one sip of the lye-laced tea at Dickey's Barbecue Pit near Salt Lake City, pictured . They have determined Harding is the only victim, Winkler said. It appears she was the first to drink the tea that day, and restaurant employees dumped it out after she was burned, he said. John Thomson, owner of the Dickey's Barbecue South Jordan franchise, said in a statement on Thursday that he's praying for Jan Harding and cooperating with investigators. He said he would refrain from commenting on the specifics of what happened out of respect for the Hardings. His restaurant is one of 400 Dickey's around the country in the Dallas-based chain. Guymon said he will wait for the police investigation to finish before determining what legal action to take. The chemical, also known as sodium . hydroxide, comes in both liquid and powder form. The one the worker . added to the tea was a powder, Guymon said. The . chemical also is in products such as Drano, said Tom Richmond, . professor of chemistry at the University of Utah. 'It would start . dissolving your insides,' he said. Fighting for her life: Harding, left, pictured with one of her daughters, drank the tea at the restaurant following church . Loved: Her family, including her husband Jim, pictured, have been by her bedside in the hospital . Doctors are trying to determine if it caused any tears in Harding's esophagus or stomach, Guymon said. The woman lives in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with her husband of 47 years, Jim Harding. They have three adult children and six grandchildren. Jim Harding and the couple's children are by her side at the hospital, praying for her recovery, Guymon said. They declined to comment through the attorney, who spoke on their behalf. It's unclear if the employee who added the chemical still works at the restaurant or if anyone there faced any kind of disciplinary action. Guymon didn't know, and a Dickey's corporate spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The restaurant has remained open since the incident, said Jeff Oaks, Food Protection Bureau manager at the Salt Lake County Health Department. His office inspected the establishment Monday and found all chemicals properly labeled and separated from food items. Questions: The family's attorney, Paxton Guymon, holds a photograph of Jim and Jan Harding during a news conference last week. He said the restaurant told him an employee had confused the two powders . The health department is awaiting results of the criminal investigation to determine if it should issue any violations. It's unlikely the restaurant would be fined or shut down, Oaks said. The department focuses on education and prevention over punitive measures, he said. Health officials aren't aware of anything like this ever happening in Salt Lake County before. Oaks said restaurant-goers don't need to be worried. 'I believe this to be an isolated incident,' he said.","Jan Harding took one sip of the sweet tea at Dickey's Barbecue Pit near Salt Lake City and spat it out, saying: 'I think I just drank acid'

"By . Ap  Reporter . At least 34 sailors are being kicked out of the Navy for their roles in a cheating ring that operated undetected for at least seven years at a nuclear power training site, and 10 others are under criminal investigation, the admiral in charge of the Navy's nuclear reactors program told The Associated Press. The number of accused and the duration of cheating are greater than was known when the Navy announced in February that it had discovered cheating on qualification exams by an estimated 20 to 30 sailors seeking to be certified as instructors at the nuclear training unit at Charleston, South Carolina. Students there are trained in nuclear reactor operations to prepare for service on any of the Navy's 83 nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers. Neither the instructors nor the students are involved in handling nuclear weapons. 'There was never any question': Adm. John M. Richardson, director of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, says the at least 34 sailors who are being kicked out of the Navy for their roles in a cheating ring did not jeopardize the safety of nuclear reactor operations . After further investigation the Navy determined that 78 enlisted sailors were implicated. Although the cheating is believed to have been confined to a single unit at Charleston and apparently was not known to commanding officers, the misconduct had been happening since at least 2007, according to Adm. John M. Richardson, director of naval reactors. The exact start of the cheating was not pinpointed. 'There was never any question' that the reactors were being operated safely, he said in an AP interview, yet the cheating was a stunning violation of Navy ethics. Richardson said he was 'loaded for bear' at the outset of the investigation, unconvinced the cheating was confined to a single training unit. But he now believes that it had not spread, and that this was one reason that the ring managed to operate so long without being discovered. In addition to the 34 enlisted sailors who were removed from the nuclear power program and are being administratively discharged from the Navy, two more who were implicated as 'minimal' participants had their non-criminal punishment suspended due to their 'strong potential for rehabilitation.' Also, 32 sailors were implicated by investigators but later exonerated by Richardson, and he gave one officer a verbal warning. The officer, whom Richardson declined to identify by name or rank, was not accused of participating in the cheating. He was faulted for 'deficiencies' in his oversight of the exam program, but Richardson said this was not severe enough to merit punishment. The Navy investigation also concluded that commanders were not directly at fault. 'It was not the result of 'wishful blindness,' it said. The 68 implicated sailors are in addition to the 10 whom Richardson said are believed to have been 'at the center' of the cheating ring and remain under investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service. The scandal rocked the Navy, but details until now had remained under wraps as senior Navy officials sought to determine the scope of the cheating — including whether it was happening elsewhere — as well as the root causes and possible remedies. Unlike an Air Force exam-cheating scandal that came to light in January at a Montana base that operates land-based nuclear-armed missiles, the sailors involved in the Navy cheating had no responsibility for nuclear weapons. What if something went wrong? The cheating was uncovered at the Navy's nuclear training school outside Charleston, South Carolina. The sailors were being trained for service aboard nuclear submarines and nuclear aircraft carriers . Navy investigators did, however, find one key link between the two episodes. Their investigation report said 'a triggering event' for the unidentified sailor at Charleston who alerted superiors to cheating on Feb. 2 was media reports a few weeks earlier about exam cheating at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana. 'This increased his concern enough about being caught to outweigh the group behavior of his peers,' the report said, apparently alluding to peer pressure this unidentified sailor may otherwise have felt not to report the misconduct. Richardson said he met individually with each of the accused and heard at least two common themes: a belief that there was little risk of getting caught, and a work environment at the nuclear training site that created stresses and pressures on the approximately 300 sailors who serve as instructors. In an interview in his Navy Yard office Tuesday, Richardson said he is taking steps to ease the pressures and to strengthen ethics training. Richardson said the accused at Charleston fell into two main categories: . —Sailors who cheated on the tests. —Sailors who enabled the cheating by providing answers in advance to others taking the test and tipping them off about what test they would be given. Richardson called the latter group of 10 sailors the ringleaders and said their offenses are considered more serious because they had facilitated the illicit transfer of classified test answers. Mystery remains: An extensive investigation ordered by Admiral John Richardson and led by Rear Adm. Kenneth M. Perry found that an electronic master file of 'engineering watch supervisor' tests and answers was illegally removed from a Navy computer 'sometime before 2007.' Investigators failed to identify who took it or exactly when . An extensive investigation ordered by Richardson and led by Rear Adm. Kenneth M. Perry found that an electronic master file of 'engineering watch supervisor' tests and answers was illegally removed from a Navy computer 'sometime before 2007.' Investigators failed to identify who took it or exactly when. The set of test and answer keys became known among the cheaters as the 'Pencil Files.' These files were secretly passed via personal email accounts, compact disks, thumb drives and other non-official electronic systems. Richardson said the Pencil Files contained all 600 answers to questions on five sets of tests. Also, a 'Pencil Number' was passed to sailors to tip them to which of the five exams they would be given. 'The result was a deliberate scheme to cheat ...,' the report said. It found no evidence of espionage. Exam security was weak. For example, investigators found that the five tests were used in a predictably rotating order and the questions had not changed significantly since 2004, even though written rules require they be changed frequently. NCIS investigators interviewed four people thought to have knowledge of the origin of the Pencil Files. Three of them denied involvement in the scheme and the fourth invoked his right to remain silent and requested an attorney. 'Thus, no further evidence of the origin of the 'Pencil Files' was obtained,' the investigation report said.","Students at the Navy's Charleston, South Carolina nuclear school are preparing for service on nuclear subs and aircraft carriers .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A youth who beat a homeless man to death when he was just 16 and avoided jail for burglary just a few weeks ago has been given yet another let-off. Craig Real, 21, was sentenced to nearly five years for the manslaughter of Big Issue seller Ralph Millward, in Bournemouth, Dorset. But two months after leaving prison this year, he broke into a garden summer house in nearby Poole and stole a TV worth £250. Craig Real, left, was released early from a four year nine month prison sentence for the manslaughter of Big Issue seller Ralph Millward, right, in Bournemouth, Dorset . Rather than being sent back to prison for the raid, he was handed a community order and told to attend a 'Thinking Skills Programme'. Real has now broken the terms of the order by missing an appointment with probation officers. But a judge has allowed him to remain free because it was a single breach of the order. Judge Peter Johnson gave Real a month-long curfew from 8pm to 6am and ordered him to wear an electronic tag. It is the third chance Real has been given since he and two friends beat Mr Millward to death in 2009 when Real was just 16. The trio punched and kicked the helpless victim as he slept outside a Waitrose store in Westbourne, Bournemouth, Dorset, because he refused to give them his cigarettes. Craig Real, pictured, has broken the terms of a court order imposed on him by missing an appointment with probation officers. Real was jailed for manslaughter in 2010 but was freed after serving just half that time. But he failed to keep to a set of conditions of his licence and was rearrested and sent back to jail. In April this year, two months after his release, he stole a £250 television from the summer house of a property in Poole, for which he was given the community order which he then breached weeks later. Judge Peter Johnson was told that Real had difficulty finding accommodation but will now live with his grandmother in Wallisdown. At Bournemouth Crown Court, the judge said he did not revoke the order and send Real into custody because it was a single breach. Local residents took to an online messaging board to express their outrage at the latest sentencing. One wrote: 'Disgusting. This toe rag gets yet another chance. Where's the chance he gave his defenceless victim? Homeless Big Issue seller Ralph Millward was kicked and punched as he slept outside a Waitrose store in Westbourne, Bournemouth, Dorset . 'The legal system needs an overhaul immediately.' Another said: 'There appears to be no justice whatsoever and he's given yet another chance to break his court order again.' Last month Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, reacted with 'astonishment' at Real's sentencing for the burglary. He said: 'This was clearly not his first crime. You don't somehow move into a different category of crime and have your past misdeeds wiped clean.' Conor Burns, the Conservative MP for Bournemouth West, said: 'The fact that he has emerged from prison and is clearly addicted to a life of crime shows the criminal justice system is not working.'","Craig Real was 16 when he was jailed  for beating a homeless man to death .

"By . James Nye for MailOnline . The human face has been officially classed as an organ, paving the way for a future where Americans give permission to allow theirs to be donated to a complete stranger. The agencies which regulate America's transplant system, The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network and the United Network for Organ Sharing, announced the changes in July, bureaucratically streamlining the previously difficult application process. Inarguably the most visible and personal of organs now on the transplant list, the news that facial transplants have become nationalized will invariably raise concerns about the limits of state control over the most emotive body-part of all of its citizens. Scroll Down for Video . Incredible: Here is Virginia native Richard Lee Norris before (left) and seven months after surgeons performed the most extreme face transplant ever. The 37-year-old's face was destroyed after being shot in 1997 . Model star: Richard Norris, 39, appears in GQ this month, talking about the life-changing face transplant he received in 2012 and how it has become a landmark study around the world . On July 3, less than a decade after the first facial transplant was conducted in France, an American's face is now classified as an 'organ' for the purposes of transplantation. However, unlike the liver, heart, lungs or kidneys, which for all intents and purposes are invisible, the face is not considered under the new law to be an organ until it is harvested. The face is now technically referred to as a VCA organ, or a vascularized composite allografts', which means three years on from the nation's first transplant, a whole raft of legal guidelines now exist for state transfer of one deceased citizens face to another living person according to medical blog Somatosphere. Also joining the list are hands, which also previously fell under the . control of the FDA and were only transplanted in experimental surgeries, . like faces. The reason why faces and hands have been classified slightly differently to other body parts is to reflect the sensitivities of the public, uneasy that faces and other personal organs like hands, can be transplanted. With only 21 face transplants ever conducted worldwide, the FDA had classed the surgery experimental. Now, reflecting the growing abilities of medical bio-science, the change in status of the face allows doctors transplanting it access to the global and national network of associations dedicated to transporting the body part efficiently.

Staggering: Face transplant recipient Charla Nash is seen before her injury, and before and after her surgery (L-R), in this combination picture made from photographs released on August 11, 2011 . 'There’s this whole machinery that’s highly efficient and very well trained to do organ transplants, but as it stood with a face transplant...it was like a mom and pop operation,' says Sue McDiarmid, a transplant surgeon at UCLA and chair of the committee with the United Network for Organ Sharing to the Boston Globe. However, McDiarmid is keen to allay fears from the public about their faces now being potential state property. Richard Norris, 38, blew his face-off with a shotgun blast in front of his mother in 1997, while drunk. The blast took off half of his face and Norris was left contemplating suicide during his recovery. In 2012, the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore performed the ground-breaking surgery. Incredibly, in 2014, Norris and his new face found themselves on the cover of August's GQ Magazine, reflecting his incredible recovery. Charla Nash was viciously attacked by her friend's chimpanzee, Travis, in 2009. In 2011, Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston performed the surgery to repair the damage.  Nash, who was left permanently blind, and lost her nose, eyes and lips in the attack, received a ground-breaking face transplant in May, 2011. A team of more than 30 surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, led by Dr Bohdan Pomanhac, painstakingly rebuilt her face. They took the donor's skin, underlying muscle, nerves and upper palate and transplanted the whole face on to Ms Nash's skull. Dallas Wiens became the first American to have a full face transplant in March, 20011 at Brigham and Women's in Boston. The surgery was paid for by the Department of Defense, which gave the hospital a $3.4million research grant for five transplants. Mr Wiens was the third person in the US to receive a face transplant - after James Maki, at the same hospital in 2009 and Connie Culp at the Cleveland Clinic in 2008. A team of more than 30 doctors, nurses and  anaesthesiologists work for 15 hours to replace his face. He suffered life threatening burns after losing control of a lift platform he had been on to repair a church window two-and-a-half years ago. After toppling over his head had slammed into a live power cable that seared off his face. 'We don’t think the general public is at a point now where we can rip off somebody’s face just because they signed a state registry....The policy is you have to have separate, explicit consent from the family for hands and face,' she said to the Boston Globe. Indeed, McDiarmid acknowledges the wildly different psychological process involved with a facial transplant. 'The thought of transplanting such a highly visible personal part of somebody is a very different concept than thinking of putting someone’s kidney in you,' said McDiarmid to the Boston Globe. For most, the idea that their loved ones heart can save anothers life is presently more acceptable than their face being appropriated. Recovery: Dallas Wiens settles into life in Fort Worth, Texas, after undergoing face transplant. Here, he is at home with his dog Seriphim, June 20, 2011 . Experts responding to the news note that from birth we are hard-wired to respond and react to people's faces in a symbolic manner. However, the new classification will allow for far easier transplants of those injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even open up the field for more organs. 'There have been transplants of the larynx, of a whole vascularized knee joint,' said McDiarmid to the Boston Globe. 'There’s been some very few uterus transplants, even some thoughts of penile transplants....It’s a very wide open field.'

'Peters said she was told school officials couldn’t call her Rachel because her birth certificate says Brian. But Peters pointed out the school allows for nicknames to be used,' Peters told The Asbury Park Press. Middletown Schools Superintendent William George said that the school will try and work with Pepe to help her. 'We as a district want to do everything we can as a district,' George said. 'Every child is different and their education and social and emotional well being is my priority. We will work with them to find the appropriate placement.' 'I support this without interviewing this child. It certainly is reasonable. Children with psycho-sexual issues often benefit from a fresh start at a new school,' he said.

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The government wants to recoup benefits paid to the daughters of a man who was declared legally dead and then turned up alive years later. Donald Miller Jr. disappeared in the 1980s, and a death ruling in 1994 allowed his family to get Social Security benefits. When the 62-year-old Miller resurfaced around 2005 - some 25 years after his disappearance - saying he had lived in other states and then returned to Ohio, the government apparently took notice. Miller has tried unsuccessfully to 'undo' his death. Then there were three: Robin Miller, (left) pictured here not long after the disappearance of husband Donald Miller Jr. in 1980, says her family should not have to pay back the death benefits they received after he was declared legally dead . Even as he stood in court last year providing evidence of his existence, a Hancock County judge turned down a request to 'bring him back to life', citing a three-year limit for changing a death ruling. The judge did acknowledge it was problematic. Now the Social Security Administration know that Miller is alive, it wants his two daughters to return more than $47,000 to cover benefits they received as teenagers, plus interest, his ex-wife, Robin Miller, told The Courier in Findlay. Both daughters are now adults with their own families. Robin Miller has not spoken of what happened to the money. Letters about the requested repayments were sent in April, and the family was stunned, she said. 'If anybody has to pay this back, it should be him because we didn't do anything wrong,' she said. Donald Miller, of Fostoria, couldn't be reached for comment, and his attorney didn't return calls from the newspaper. Today: Robin Miller has since remarried - to a man whose surname is also Miller - and is believed to have had another child, a son . A Social Security spokesman, Doug Nguyen in Chicago, said the agency is reviewing Robin Miller's application for a waiver. Robin Miller said the family didn't defraud the government and had taken steps to find Donald Miller after he vanished, including contacting the FBI and hiring a private investigator. 'We honestly thought he was done, dead, gone and out of our lives,' she said. Miller remarried after the disappearance of her first husband and is believed to have had another child, a son. She has expressed sympathy for Donald Miller, describing him as a 'deadbeat dad' who ran away from the pressures of family and fatherhood.","Donald Miller Jr., 62, of Fostoria, Ohio, skipped out on his family in the 1980s .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A government scientist kept silent about a potentially dangerous lab blunder and revealed it only after workers in another lab noticed something fishy, according to an internal investigation. The accident happened in January at the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. A lab scientist accidently mixed a deadly strain of bird flu with a tamer strain, and sent the mix to another CDC lab and to an outside lab in Athens, Georgia. No one was sickened by bird flu, but unsuspecting scientists worked with the viral mix for months before it was discovered. Cross-contamination: An internal probe at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed a new safety breach involving the dangerous avian flu . CDC officials have called the incident the most worrisome in a series of lab safety problems at the government agency, long regarded as one of the most respected public health agencies in the world. Earlier this summer, a lab mishandled anthrax samples and both the bird flu and anthrax labs were shut down. 'We all feel horrible this happened,' said Dr. Anne Schuchat, who oversees the CDC's Influenza Division — which includes the lab where the bird flu accident took place. Because of employee privacy rules, she said she could not name the lab scientist or the leader of the scientist's team, who were both faulted in the investigation report released Friday. She said disciplinary actions are taking place, but she did not provide any details. CDC's release of the report is one of many signs the agency is trying to make things right, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. But he added that the CDC should at least disclose any disciplinary measures, to reassure the public that the agency is taking the matter seriously. According to the report, the lab scientist was doing work with both bird flu strains — the deadly form and a tamer version. Lab rules call for them to be handled separately, and the tasks should take at least 90 minutes. The CDC investigation found the work was completed in 51 minutes. That's a clear indication the scientist took short-cuts, Schuchat said. Main facility: A U.S. government scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, working with bird flu rushed through a procedure designed to ensure safety, allotting only about half the time necessary, in order to get to a staff meeting, health officials said on Friday . The lab scientist told investigators that the work was done in the proper sequence, but noted being rushed to finish the job and attend a meeting. CDC officials say it's possible the scientist worked on both strains at the same time. In February, some of the mixed virus sample was sent to another CDC lab in Atlanta. In March, a shipment of it went to a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory in Athens. For a study, the bird flu virus was given to chickens. The chickens died, prompting USDA staff to take a hard look at the sample and detect the deadly strain. The USDA lab notified the CDC lab in May, and the CDC lab confirmed the finding. But the CDC team leader didn't report what happened to supervisors or anyone else, reasoning that the viral mix was at all times contained in specialized laboratories and was never a threat to the public, the investigation report said. CDC officials were only notified in June after the second CDC lab reported a problem with its sample. Two weeks later, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden was notified. Frieden ordered the flu and anthrax labs closed, an internal review and other steps. The anthrax lab director resigned last month.","Scientist took shortcuts to speed up the work and accidentally contaminated the samples, mixing a deadly strand with a benign one .

Houston Police were called to a house in Hiram Springs at around 1am after an argument began outside among some of the revelers at the 15-year-old's birthday party, one of whom let off a round that struck Dixie Mendez in the head after traveling through a wall. 'I am the one who found her,; said Mendez's friend Karrysha Turner. 'I watched her take her last breath. I just want whoever did this to be found.

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greg for MailOnline . A teenager has admitted to voluntary manslaughter in the death of his 11-year-old half-brother in Southern California last year. Skylor Atilano, 17, made the admission Friday in juvenile court in Riverside County in the death of Terry Dewayne Smith Jr., whose disappearance in July 2013 set off a massive search before his remains were found days later behind his mother's Menifee house. Judge Timothy Freer sentenced the teen to 12 years in juvenile detention, but under the law, he can only be held until age 23. Sentenced; Skylor Atilano admitted to the voluntary manslaughter of his half-brother in juvenile court as part of a plea deal . Disappearance: Terry Smith Jr's body was found in a shallow grave on the family property days after he went missing . District attorney spokesman John Hall says the teen was originally charged with murder, but the case was downgraded in a deal with prosecutors. The teenager didn't speak except to respond briefly to the judge. The boys' mother, Shawna Smith, spoke to reporters about the case after the hearing. She said that despite knowing that Atilano was accepting a plea deal, she was upset to hear him enter a guilty plea. She is still uncertain of what happened the night her younger son died. 'I don't think I'll ever know,' she told CBS Los Angeles, crying. Search: Police and volunteers searched for Terry Smith Jr for four days before his body was found near the home he shared with his family . No closure: The boys' mother Shawna Smith (left) and her partner Dennise Bugna (right) still don't know what happened the day Terry Smith Jr died . All she knows, she said, is that Terry Smith Jr died of blunt force trauma to the head. She believes her younger son died while the boys were rough housing, hitting his head on a coffee table and that her elder son, in a panic, hid his body. 'It was an accident gone awry,' she told NBC Los Angeles. 'And Sky is still my son. I still love him. I give him that unconditional love.' Her partner Dennise Bugna told reporters that she does not believe this boy's body could have lain in a shallow grave on the family property for days without anyone knowing about it. 'The body wasn’t there for three days, bottom line. I know my property. I know my dogs. There’s no way two cadaver dogs could miss that,' Bugna said, reports CBS Los Angeles.

Caught: It took deputies hours to catch the reptile, which managed to break two ropes they were thrown around its head . It was lassoed and removed after a brief struggle. The alligator was taken to a 'more natural habitat' than the school yard. No injuries were reported. 'Somebody thinks today is the first day of school!

"By . Ruth Lythe for the Daily Mail . Follow @@RuthLythe . John Lewis customers were in revolt last night after the retail chain dumped free cake and tea for loyalty scheme members. Up to a million customers are to be stripped of the highly popular perk - introduced as a reward for allowing the high street giant to track their shopping habits - from next month. The My John Lewis loyalty scheme launched in October last year with free monthly vouchers for a pot of tea or coffee and a cake worth £5 in the store’s restaurants for those who signed up. Scroll down for video . Outrage: John Lewis customers with a loyalty card will now have to earn their free tea and cake (pictured) Disappointment: The chain has announced the monthly perk will depend on how frequently they visit the store . But the chain disappointed customers yesterday when it announced the monthly perk will be restricted immediately for new loyalty scheme members - and for existing members from next month. Instead customers will receive tea and coffee vouchers based on how much they spend in John Lewis - and how frequently they visit the store as well as their ‘preferences and purchases’. The news comes after Waitrose, part of the John Lewis Partnership, was forced to issue a profit warning earlier this month, partly because of the popularity of its own loyalty scheme. Shoppers with a myWaitrose card – which was introduced in 2011 – receive a free tea or coffee daily, including cappuccinos, lattes and mochas, even if they do not buy anything else. They also receive a free copy of most daily quality newspapers if they spend more than £5. The gimmick has proved hugely popular and the supermarket is estimated to hand out one million free cups of coffee and nearly one million newspapers every week. The change at John Lewis means some of the scheme’s one million members will now receive vouchers only occasionally or not at all. The loyalty card will still have other perks such as discounts and invites to events and entry to a prize draw. A spokesman for John Lewis said it was restricting the offer because its restaurants become ‘extremely busy in the run-up to the peak Christmas season’. He said: ‘We want to make sure our customers experience the high standards of service they expect from us during this period. Reason? A spokesman for the loyalty card said the restaurant gets too busy in the run-up to Christmas . ‘All My John Lewis member rewards are continually reviewed and the rewards our members receive in future do depend on a variety of factors including shopping frequency, spend, preferences and purchases.’ Loyal customers who had agreed to let the firm track their habits solely because of the monthly treat were angered at the decision. Guy Anker, managing editor at consumer champion website MoneySavingExpert.com, said: ‘There will be many disappointed loyal John Lewis customers – especially existing loyalty card holders. Our site users have told us they feel let down that the offer’s been changed. ‘People are really feeling the pinch and in the run up to Christmas they more likely to have popped into the store for a free cuppa and slice of cake.’ A John Lewis spokesman refused to be drawn on whether its move to cut back on free drinks was down to cost. But free coffees and cakes in big chains have begun to attract wider criticism. Campaigners have argued such schemes force smaller shops out of business, while some traditional shoppers worry that free drinks attract the ‘wrong type’ of customer.","Loyalty card holders previously received free coffee and cake worth £5 .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A revolutionary cream made from silicone claims to dramatically reduce unsightly scars and stretch marks in under a month. Remescar, which works by . covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin, invisible film of silicone, is said to reduce the appearance of skin problems by 50 per cent. The film protects the top layer of skin in its own healing . ‘micro-environment’, sealing in moisture and helping stimulate the . production of collagen, which boosts the skin’s recovery. Remescar, which works by covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin, invisible film of silicone, is said to reduce the appearance of skin problems such as stretch marks and scars by 50 per cent . Stretch marks occur when the skin is stretched extensively over a short time period. The rapid stretching causes the middle layer of skin (dermis) to break in places, allowing the deeper skin layers to show through, forming stretch marks. The dermis is made-up of strong, inter-connected fibres that enable your skin to stretch as your body grows. If part of your body, such as your abdomen (tummy), grows rapidly over a short period, the fibres can become thin and over-stretched and some may break. At the point where the skin fibres break, tiny tears develop which allow the blood vessels below to show through. This is why stretch marks are often red or purple when they first appear. When the blood vessels eventually contract (shrink), the pale-coloured fat underneath your skin will be visible, and your stretch marks will change to a silvery-white colour. Source: NHS Choices . The product also includes beta glucan, a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract . which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds, and . powerful SPF15 UV filters to shield against sun damage. In clinical trials, users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a . 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks on their thighs, stomach and hips in 28 days - and some much sooner. Patients with both existing and new scars, caused by . minor surgery, burns, acne or accidents, who used the treatment, also . reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring. They . said the treatment helped to restore their skin to a more normal colour . and texture, helping scars to fade and diminish. Sensations of burning, . tingling and itching were also reduced. The Belgian scientists behind the product claim it is the 'first medically recognised and clinically proven treatment . for stretch marks to either . reduce existing scars or treat new ones, and help treat and prevent . stretchmarks'. It is the first time that an easy-to-apply silicone treatment has been made available to the general public in Britain. In clinical trials, users who applied the cream twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks on their thighs, stomach and hips in 28 days . Traditional, . professional silicone gel or sheet treatments for scars can often cause . embarrassment to patients because they are visible to others. They are also more expensive and can be difficult for the user to apply. Nine in ten women are affected by stretch marks - narrow streaks or lines that develop on the surface of the skin. Although pregnancy is one of the most common causes, they can also . affect young women who have not had children. Growth . spurts and weight fluctuations can also cause them. While usually harmless but unsightly,  if there are clinical complications with stretchmarks then inflammation or itching can occur, causing pain and infection. The treatment, which comes in a cream or deodorant-style stick, costs between £19.95 and £24.95 at Boots. The cream is a similar formulation to the . stick, but easier for . people with stretch marks to apply on a larger surface area.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A star college footballer has been suspended by his college team, the Oklahoma Sooners, after allegedly punching his date so hard that he broke several bones in her face. Freshman running back, Joe Mixon, 18, seen as the one of the hottest properties in the country, is accused of knocking a woman unconscious with one devastating punch last month. The alleged victim, who suffered a fractured jaw, broken cheekbone, fractured sinus and fractured orbit, claims the argument started after Mixon directed a homophobic comment towards her male friend. Joe Mixon, who has pleaded not guilty to assault, has been suspended by the Oklahoma Sooners for one year . The footballer, tipped for greatness, allegedly punched a woman so hard he broke several bones in her face . CCTV footage of the incident is said to show the woman pushing Mixon. The star footballer, who is 6ft1 and weighs more than 200lbs, reacts by lunging towards her. According to a probable cause affidavit released by the Cleveland County District Attorney's office, the alleged victim then slaps Mixon in the face - to which he reacts by punching her in the face - causing her to fall into a table before hitting the ground. Mixon's defence lawyer, Kevin Finlay, said: 'As we have maintained from the beginning, it is our belief that Joe reacted instinctively after being racially slurred and physically assaulted by a highly intoxicated young woman and her male friend. 'We strongly disagree with the series of events as portrayed by Norman PD. Justice knows no gender bias, and we do not believe that Joe's actions were criminal in nature.' Mixon's lawyers claim their client only acted 'instinctively' after being provoked by racist slurs and physical abuse by a woman and her male friend who they say were very drunk . The year-long suspension means he will miss the whole of his first season at a team with national championship aspirations, being ranked number four in the country. The school has since released a statement saying university President David Boren accepted the recommendation of athletic director Joe Castiglione and coach Bob Stoops to suspend Mixon. Posted on Twitter, it read: 'He will be excluded from all team activities and removed from the team roster. As the university has demonstrated in the past, we are committed to winning the right way. Mixon will be allowed to continue studying at the university and will remain eligible for financial aid . 'As an example to others, OU sets the highest possible standards for its student athletes, coaches and staff.' They added that Mixon would be allowed to continue studying at the university and will remain eligible for financial aid.

"By . Erin Clements for MailOnline . Vale, the name of Savannah Guthrie’s one-day-old daughter, is already ‘trending’. Pamela Redmond Satran, founder of baby name data site Nameberry.com, says that searches for the unusual moniker started picking up as soon as the newborn’s name was announced yesterday on the Today show. She told Today.com that Ms Guthrie and husband Mike Feldman are likely to inspire many other new parents to choose the name too. Scroll down for video . Name game: Savannah Guthrie, pictured at a New York hospital speaking to Today colleagues on Friday, gave birth to daughter Vale this week, and the baby's moniker is already trending . 'I would expect a lot of people to follow suit,' she said. 'I think it’s a great name: it’s simple and everybody can understand it, but it’s really different and unusual as a name at the same time.' Ms Redmond Satran says that Vale is currently so obscure that it's not even included on the Social Security Administration’s extended list of baby names - a name must be given to at least five or more babies in the U.S. each year to make the list. She adds that Vale, an 'old-fashioned poetic term,' reflects two naming trends: place names and nature names (such as River or Forest). 'It’s kind of the anything-goes style of baby naming that has really emerged as parents look for names that both have personal meaning and are really different from what everybody else is named,' she said. Vale Guthrie Feldman, the daughter of Ms Guthrie and her husband Mike Feldman, was born early Wednesday morning. Happy couple: Ms Guthrie and husband Michael Feldman, pictured at a New York event in May, said they chose the name because it was 'pretty, unique but not kooky or weird' The Today host, 42, said: 'We had a few names on the girl list but we had not settled on it. Vale had always been on our list of names we had liked. 'We thought it was pretty, unique but not kooky or weird. . . I don't want to name names but there are some weird ones out there.' Last month, Nameberry released a tally of the most popular baby names of 2014, based on the number of views each one attracted on the site. Pop culture was a major influence on the list, with many names inspired by movie and TV heroines and celebrity offspring.","Vale Guthrie Feldman was born early Wednesday morning .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Richard Shears . and Stephanie Linning . Main suspect: Fishmonger Zulkipli Abdullah, 24, arriving at Kuching Magistrate Court on Wednesday. He was on bail for armed robbery when Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger were attacked, police said . The main suspect arrested in connection to the murders of two Newcastle University students stabbed to death while on a medical placement in Borneo was on police bail for armed robbery when they were attacked, it emerged today. Local police said that they were just days away from passing a file to prosecutors on 24-year-old fishmonger Zulkipli Abdullah when he allegedly stabbed Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22, to death. He was arrested along with accomplices Yeo Kia Sing, a 29-year-old mechanic, and two jobless men, Remy Bin Marjuki, 19, and Abdul Aziz Bin Karim, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. Sarawak deputy police chief Datuk Dr Chair Khin Chung told the Daily Mirror: '[Abdullah] . will face separate charges for armed robbery. We had just finished our . investigation at the point when this attack was carried out.' The four men face the death penalty after 'admitting the crime'. Two . were said to have previous convictions for drugs and armed robbery and . three had tested positive for Methamphetamine, a powerful stimulant also . known as crystal meth, according to a police report. Datuk Dr Chair Khin Chung said that one of the suspects in the group had served two months in prison for possessing drugs. He . said: 'He was in jail for two to three months in 2012. He was caught . with a quantity of drugs in his possession. He served time for it.' Meanwhile, the bodies of Neil Dalton, 23, and Aidan Brunger are due to arrive back in the UK today. They were taken taken to the airport at Kuching last night for a flight through Kuala Lumpur and on to London. Earlier . in the day they had been formally identified by two British friends in . the mortuary of the Sarawak General hospital where they were on a study . programme. ‘As you can imagine, it was a very traumatic and sad job that their friends volunteered to do,’ said a hospital official. British friends of the men have declined to speak publicly about the deaths. Medical . Director Dr Chin Zin Hing told the Mail: ‘A female friend of the two . men had thought about saying a few words in public about them but she . became too upset. Scroll down for the video . Stabbed to death: . Newcastle University students Aidan Brunger (left, outside the Kuching hospital . where he was working) and Neil Dalton (right), both 22, were attacked on a medical placement in Borneo . Death: .

Mr Ran said he and another waiter . tried to help Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger, but they died before an . ambulance arrived 30 minutes later. 'I will never forget it, not as long as I live,' he told the paper. Deputy police commissioner Chai . Khin Chung said yesterday that police had completed their inquiry, as . the men had confessed and they would now be passing on their evidence . for prosecution. Accused: Police arrest Remy Bin Marjuki, one of the four suspects, on suspicion of murder at his home in Kuching, Malaysia. Police said that one of the men arrested had previously served jail time for drug possession . 'We have finished our investigation, the crime has been solved,' he said. 'The suspects have been apprehended and they have admitted the crime. We have recovered the weapons from the crime. 'We . are waiting for the corpses in the hospital mortuary to have the . post-mortem carried out. We have all the major evidence in our hands . which we will send to the prosecution.' He said the two students had got into . an argument with the men on the table next to them in the bar and after . leaving on foot, they were followed by car and then attacked from . behind. He added that the tragedy was very unusual for the city as it is 'always very peaceful'. It has been reported that two Irish medical students were assaulted just days before the stabbings. The hospital where Mr Dalton and Mr Brunger had been working is providing counselling to other students since the tragedy. Flowers are laid at the site of where the pair were killed .

'We now have two members of staff who have arrived in Kuching, they have met up with the students and are trying to smooth the way with the authorities to make things as easy as possible so they can do what has to be done and then get back home again. 'Of course they're very, very upset, medical students are a close community anyway and they were out there with friends and colleagues from their course and it's such a tragic thing to have happened.

"By . Richard Spillett . and Jack Crone . A British investigator and his American wife have been jailed in China today after being convicted of  illegally trading the personal details of Chinese businessmen and officials. Peter Humphrey, 58, was fined £19,000 and sentenced to two years and six months in a Chinese prison for 'illegally obtaining private information', after which he will be deported. His wife, Yingzeng Yu, 61, must serve two years and pay a fine of £14,500. It is unclear whether or not she will also be deported on completion of her jail term. Jailed: British corporate investigator Peter Humphrey leaves the the Shanghai No.1 Intermediate People's Court inside a police vehicle in Shanghai after receiving sentence of two years and six months . The pair worked for companies in the Far East - including Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline - and helped firms screen potential business partners or employees. Speaking before their verdict was given, Humphrey and his wife offered a closing statement to the court, in which they expressed deep regret for their actions, the South China Morning Post reports. Humphrey spoke about his childhood love and fascination of China and claimed he longed to be part of its development. He also said that he had always supported anti-corruption in the country. He stated: 'My wife and I still love and respect China passionately.' As part of the prosecution's case, Shanghai police claimed that several dozen reports prepared by Humphrey and Yu for corporate clients contained information that 'seriously violated the legitimate rights of citizens'. This morning, Humphrey said he purchased information from three Chinese investigators who obtained it from law firms and other sources, according to a trial transcript released by the court in Shanghai. Peter Humphrey has been found guilty of trading personal information of Chinese citizens after a trial in China today . 'We would ask other consulting companies to help us and they could help us obtain the personal information of Chinese citizens,' Humphrey said. According to the transcript, Yu said she did know that the consultants her and her husband's firm hired to get the data had done so illegally. 'In other countries, we were able to conduct similar checks, including personal information and private transactions, legally through courts,' said Yu. 'If we had known that it was illegal, my husband and I would have destroyed all traces of this information.' Humphrey and Yu worked under contract for British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, which is accused in a separate case of bribing Chinese doctors and hospitals to use its products. Their arrest last August coincided with an investigation of Glaxo, but authorities have not indicated whether the two cases are linked. The probe came as Beijing tightened controls over information and prompted warnings that investigation of legitimate matters might be curtailed. A conviction appeared almost certain after Chinese state television showed Humphrey last year apparently saying he used 'illegal means' to obtain information. Humphrey told the court this morning that he bought information from Chinese investigators, according a transcript from the trial . Humphrey is helped to his seat in court by a policeman today to give evidence in a case linked to alleged corruption at pharmaceutical giant, GlaxoSmithKline . Earlier, the couple's teenage son, Harvey, expressed his anguish at the prospect of them not being home for the start of his university career. The 19-year-old, who has been allowed to watch the trial of his parents from the public gallery, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'They've been in prison for about 13 months now, almost 14 months. I think it's likely you are going to have a lenient sentence. 'The justice system in China usually works better for the defendant if he or she pleads guilty. 'So I'm cautiously optimistic about that and - touch wood - hopefully they'll be free to join me in the UK when I start university.' The information said to have been gathered by the couple could have been used to reveal links between people and companies. This can be vital to foreign firms in a Chinese business world dominated by behind-the-scenes personal connections. Humphrey and Yu's firm, ChinaWhys Ltd, said on its website it specialised in 'discreet risk mitigation solutions' and investigations 'walking multinationals through the labyrinth of opportunity, risk and unfamiliar cultural environment'. According the court transcript, Humphrey said he got information for companies from Chinese investigators . A photo released by the court shows Humphrey (centre left, wearing black) and Yu (wearing red) being charged . At the time of their August 16 arrest last year, Shanghai police said they were investigating 126 people on suspicion of improperly gathering personal information and had detained 35. Few details of the other cases have been released. On Friday, Humphrey complained that Chinese authorities had translated his use of the word 'monitoring' in a report as spying. He said most of his firm's information came from the Internet or talking to employees of clients' companies. 'We never engaged in such behavior as stalking or spying. If our clients wanted us to, I would tell them, better not,' he said. Beijing began tightening control over corporate information in early 2012 after Chinese companies were hit by disclosures about possible financial misconduct. Possibly in response to that, regulations issued in February 2012 prohibit government agencies from disclosing financial or commercial information about a company without its permission. The couple's son, Harvey (right), attended court this morning and says he is optimistic they will soon be freed . Police vehicles bring Humphrey into Shanghai's Intermediate Court this morning ahead of the trial . That made it harder for companies to investigate potential Chinese partners or acquisition targets to find liabilities or conflicts of interest. Known as 'due diligence,' it is a common practice in other countries. Other companies that supply information also are under pressure. In January 2013 four Chinese employees of a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp, which provides credit and other company information, were sentenced to prison on charges of improperly buying personal data of Chinese citizens. The company was fined one million yuan (£95,000). Also in 2012, communist leaders were embarrassed by news reports that disclosed details of the family wealth of Xi Jinping, the new ruling party leader, and Wen Jiabao, who was prime minister at that time. Humphrey has worked as an investigator for the past 14 years in Asia, focusing on white-collar crime prevention and fraud investigation, according to his company's website. It said Yu has worked for or advised companies in the United States, Hong Kong and China in technology, medical products and other industries over a 25-year business career.

"By . Claudia  Joseph . It took our adult investigator just a few minutes to register with the fake identity of a 13-year-old girl 'Clo' (pictured). Almost instantly, the profile was inundated with sexual messages . It has recruited millions around the world with promises of easy flirting and rapid ‘hook ups’. But The Mail on Sunday can reveal the popular dating site Tinder is exposing children to explicit and inappropriate adult conversations and potentially placing them at the mercy of sexual predators. Created just two years ago, the Tinder app is a runaway success, claiming to make seven million matches a day worldwide. It works by beaming pictures of nearby potential partners to a phone or tablet and inviting an instant‘yes’ or ‘no’ verdict. A million Britons have signed up in the past two months alone, while celebrity users include Katy Perry and Sheridan Smith. The site is said to have revolutionised the world of casual sex – yet it is openly recruiting children as young as 13. We can also reveal that: . In fact, it is disturbingly easy for adults to masquerade as teenagers on the app. It took our adult investigator just a few minutes to register with the fake identity of a 13-year-old girl. From then on, they were free to ‘rate’ other teenaged members. As Claire Lilley, head of online safety at the NSPCC, warns: ‘These apps can make a young person vulnerable to potential abusers knowing their current location as well as personal details such as where they live, socialise, work or study.’ For our investigator, the torrent of sexual messages began as soon as she registered. ‘U wanna swap pics?’ asked one. ‘Go on. Just bra. It’s just for me, no one else. I’ll go first if u want.’ Another suggested the girl prepare for a ‘bumpy ride with lots of potholes’. ‘So… nudes?’ asked a third. Whether these messages were being sent by teenage boys or adults was not clear. Most parents would be shocked in either case. Another person claiming to be 16 said: ‘F****** tired. Been planting hedges all day for the last three days x.’ He worked on a hill farm, he explained, continuing: ‘Getting chonged [high on drugs] and drivingtractors, whats not to love?’ Tinder . says it has comprehensive safeguards in place, pointing out that to . sign up, you must first belong to Facebook, which has its own . registration process. On . giving their age, new Tinder users are directed either to the main site . or a section specifically for 13-17-year-olds. But the process is . worryingly simple to circumvent. Scroll down for video . Our investigator bought a pay-as-you-go mobile and set up a fake Facebook account for a girl called Clo using a photograph of herself as a teenager. This was all she needed to create her fake Tinder registration. The sexual dangers posed by the internet to young people cannot be under-estimated. Tesco deliveryman Darren Jeffries, 48, posed as a 17-year-old Justin Bieber lookalike to scourthe internet for teenagers who he would sexually assault. He has now been jailed for 33 years. The dangers are magnified as the technology advances. Young users now link it to their social media sites, including picture sites such Instagram, where you can post photos and videos, and Snapchat, which lets users send pictures that are supposed to disappear after being viewed by the recipient. Some vulnerable youngsters even give out their email addresses and mobile phone numbers. And there is every danger that some Tinder members might be even younger than 13. Children have demonstrated an ability to circumvent the electronic barriers erected by adults. According to a recent Childline survey, around 60 per cent of teenagers have been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves, four in ten admitted creating an image, a quarter saidthey had sent one and an incredible 15 per cent revealed they had sent it to a total stranger. Seven per cent of Tinder’s ten million users worldwide are under 17. Giving children warnings is one thing, persuading them to stay away is another. Few other sites have the thrilling directness of Tinder. Pop star Lily Allen caused speculation about the state of her marriage after revealing she was using the site, while England cricketer Monty Panesar, it is alleged, invited a blonde backpacker he met on Tinder back to his hotel room after losing to Australia in the Ashes. According to a recent Childline survey, around 60 per cent of teenagers have been asked for a sexual image or video of themselves. Seven per cent of Tinder's ten million users worldwide are under 17 (library image) But it is for children that Tinder’s temptations cause most concern. As the NSPCC’s Claire Lilley adds: ‘We can’t turn back the clock – internet and social media use is now commonplace among children and young people, and many use it in a positive way to learn and socialise. ‘But verifying the age of a user is difficult. Consequently, although some platforms are designated for younger users, there is the very real risk of harmful contact with adults. ‘This lack of adequate safeguarding is putting children at risk – service providers and website owners must make it as easy as possible for young people to report upsetting content and behaviour, and take swift action to tackle it.’ Conservative MP David Selous, a father of teenage children who campaigns for strong families, said he was horrified at what our investigator encountered. ‘I would absolutely have concerns about 13-year-olds on Tinder,’ he said. 'A huge danger of being pursued by paedophiles' ‘It is very young and huge care needs to be taken. There are many other ways for them to meet boys and girls safely.’ So far, however, the newly minted millionaires behind the app have been unwilling to tackle the darker side of their invention. Tinder was set up in August 2012 by three American university graduates Justin Mateen, Sean Rad and Jonathan Badeen. They launched it by hosting a party where students downloaded the app at the door, and soon found they had an enormous success on their hands. Users are asked to flick through the profiles and pictures of other members and rate them for sexual attraction. If you swipe left or hit a cross symbol, the profile disappears with ‘NOPE’ stamped across their forehead. Swipe right, or hit the heart, and it says: ‘LIKED.’ Mutual right swipes result in a match, with a prompt to either send a message or ‘Keep playing!’ A ‘swipe right’ has already entered the global language of dating. After two years, Tinder boasts an average 500 million swipes a day. Users typically log on 11 times daily. ‘We realised there’s an inherent tension that exists between people,’ founder Sean Rad said at the time of launching. ‘You’re either going after a relationship, and you’re the aggressor, and you feel like you’re prone to rejection – or someone’s going after you, and you feel bombarded and annoyed, which means you have to do the rejecting yourself.’ Justin Mateen added: ‘As humans, we have this innate desire to meet people. In the past, social networks were concerned with connecting you with distant members of your network of friends. ‘Tinder is all about connecting you with new people. ‘And we find that valuable, especially because we’re constantly running around and don’t have time to slow down and meet people.’ From wealthy Iranian Jewish  families, both Rad and Mateen  were included on the Forbes 2013  30 Under 30 List. Their company is now valued at £3 billion. Rad, 27, now has a high-profile girlfriend, Alexa Dell, 20, daughter of computer billionaire Michael Dell. She is known as ‘Tinderella’. In a prepared statement, Tinder said: ‘There will always be people that will try to violate our terms of service. We have security measures in place that keep the Tinder ecosystem as authentic as possible. ‘Users are able to block and report anyone that is engaging in inappropriate behaviour. ‘We delete any profile that violates our terms of service.’ Tinder’s founders clearly believe that locating their app within the world of Facebook keeps it safe enough. Mateen says: ‘There’s nothing wrong with 13 and 17-year-olds making friends on Tinder. ‘It all goes through Facebook, so  if Facebook does a good job of  verifying their data, we can rely on their service.’ Facebook commented: ‘People have to be 13 to sign up to Facebook. In addition, communication between parents and young people about their use of the internet is vital.’ And MP David Selous added:  ‘Parents and schools really need to start alerting children to the dangers of potentially being groomed, courted and pursued by paedophiles who are posing as people of their own age group. ‘It is a huge danger.’","Tinder dating app claims to make seven million matches a day worldwide .

A retired businessman was killed when his sit-on lawnmower plunged into a ditch and trapped him underneath. John Russell Cadwallader, 82, was cutting a lawn in Oswestry, Shropshire, when his vehicle toppled into the ditch, an inquest heard. Mr Cadwallader was doing the garden work for his son, who was renovating the property, when the accident happened on May 6. Shrewsbury Coroners' Court heard how his wife Gwyneth, 72, drove to the house after her husband didn't come home. She found him trapped underneath the lawnmower. She said: 'When he failed to arrive home I drove out to my son's house and found him. I thought he had been knocked out.' Philip Tyler, a coroner's officer for Shropshire, told the hearing police were called to the accident and 'found the deceased underneath an upside-down lawnmower in a ditch'. He said: 'Paramedics attended the scene and pronounced life extinct at 7.34pm. Police were satisfied there was nothing untoward and listed the death as non-suspicious. 'A post-mortem revealed that the deceased died from asphyxiation.' The hearing returned a verdict of accidental death. In a family statement released after his death, Mr Cadwallader's sons John, 51, and David, 48, said: 'This has been a sad loss to the whole family and he leaves behind his wife, two sons and daughter-in-laws and three grandsons.

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Increase: The number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years, according to official figures . The number of operations cancelled on the day they were due to go ahead has hit its highest total for nine years, according to official figures. In a sign of mounting pressure on many NHS trusts, it has emerged that between April and June 15,661 scheduled operations were cancelled at the last minute for non-medical reasons. That is the highest since the same three months in 2005 when 15,690 operations were cancelled on the day they were supposed to be carried out. But the Department of Health said the proportion of operations cancelled at the last minute is only 0.8 per cent, around the same as in previous years. It said the proportion has not changed because doctors carried out more than half a million more operations this year than in the same period eight years ago, driven by the ageing population and medical advances. Labour blames increases in the number of patients attending accident and emergency departments for the rise in cancelled operations. This spring the vast majority of patients affected had their operation rescheduled within a month, but 800 were left waiting longer. The data, published by NHS England, relates to elective operations – scheduled in advance – not emergency surgery. In the same quarter of 2006 the number of cancelled operations was only 12,548. In spring 2011, the year after the Coalition came to power, it was 12,780. NHS guidance states that common non-medical reasons for cancelling an operation include lack of ward beds available, the lack of an available surgeon, anaesthetist or theatre staff; an emergency case needing the theatre, equipment failure, or lack of a critical care bed. Last week figures from NHS England showed there are now 3.2million people on NHS waiting lists for operations, with some being forced to wait more than a year. The total is the highest since the target of treating 90 per cent of patients with 18 weeks was introduced six years ago. Concern: A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) said it was important to reduce the waiting list for operations responsibly, while the Labour party's Andy Burnham (right) said hospitals are 'full to bursting' Ministers admit it may not be met again for months while the backlog is cleared. But a spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was important to reduce the waiting list responsibly – rather than try to meet the target by prioritising simple procedures rather than complex but life-changing operations which take longer. Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘Not only are people waiting longer for operations, increasing numbers are facing the appalling anxiety and indignity of preparing for treatment only to be let down just hours before surgery. ‘Hospitals are full to bursting, with record numbers in A&E, and this is threatening to drag down the rest of the NHS.’ An NHS England spokesman said: ‘NHS England believes all cancellations should be avoided wherever possible. However, the level of cancellations remains low, in the context of the millions of operations performed in the NHS each year.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The number of operations cancelled in this quarter has remained steady at less than 1 per cent of all elective admissions, despite the fact that the NHS is responding to significantly increased demand by performing more than half a million more operations now than in the same period eight years ago.’","A staggering 15,661 operations cancelled on day they were scheduled for .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Warning: Publishing individual surgeons' death rates could lead to doctors turning away 'high-risk' cases, according to Stephen Westaby (pictured) Publishing individual surgeons’ death rates could lead to doctors turning away ‘high-risk’ cases, according to a heart surgeon. Stephen Westaby says that giving the public access to such data shifts the emphasis from ‘patient care to self preservation’. In June last year, health officials launched the first ‘performance outcomes’ for doctors. The information – central to Government plans for a more transparent NHS – aims to show patients how well consultants working in a number of specialities across England perform against their peers. Patients can see the number of times a consultant has carried out a procedure, their mortality rates and whether or not they are performing within the ‘expected range’. The initiative aims to 'shine a light on variation and unacceptable practice', NHS officials said at the time. But writing in the British Medical Journal, Professor Westaby, a consultant cardiac surgeon at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, argues that most deaths are related to ‘team dynamics’ and hospital infrastructure rather than the competence of individual surgeons. 'To the public, surgeon-specific mortality data (SSMD) reflect surgeons’ technical competence,' he says. 'Yet in reality team consistency and operating theatre practice supersede individual performance. Publication of SSMD diverts attention from deficiencies in NHS infrastructure. 'An . understanding of why patients die allows something to be done about it; . attributing a pile of bodies to an individual surgeon does not.' Publishing mortality data 'has not improved patient choice, waiting lists, equipment, staffing or team consistency,' he says. Professor Westaby says that soon after surgeons’ death rates were published in parts of the US in the 1980s ‘risk-averse behaviour’ was ‘widely documented’. He adds: ‘The answer was to avoid high-risk patients.’ Surgery: In June last year, health officials launched the first 'performance outcomes' for doctors (file picture)","Stephen Westaby warns against releasing individual surgeons' death rates .

Costs have soared 50 per cent in eight years as obesity and unhealthy lifestyles lead to more of the illness, particularly type 2 diabetes. The latest report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre shows that 123,000 prescriptions for diabetes are handed out every day in England – some 45 million a year. This is up from 27.1million in 2005/6 when data was first collected. Scroll down for video . The NHS spends £10billion caring for patients with diabetes, which is 10 per cent of its entire annual budget . The NHS now spends £803million a year on treatments such as insulin and pills to control blood sugar – a tenth of its entire drugs bill – compared to £514million eight years ago. But this doesn’t include the far greater costs of the illness incurred by hospital stays, amputations and treatments for kidney failure, heart disease and strokes caused by diabetes. Overall, the NHS spends £10billion caring for patients with diabetes, which is 10 per cent of its entire annual budget.

"By . John Hall for MailOnline . Yet another revolutionary tradition has been broken in Cuba - a lawmaker voted 'no' in parliament. And it wasn't just any lawmaker. Mariela Castro, the daughter of President Raul Castro and niece of Fidel Castro, gave the thumbs-down to a workers' rights bill that she felt didn't go far enough to prevent discrimination against people with HIV or with unconventional gender identities. While it is the first time in living memory that anybody can remember a lawmaker voting against a bill, critics say the vote has more to do with Castro's unassailable position, rather than a changing attitude towards democracy on the island. Precedent: Mariela Castro gave the thumbs-down to a workers' rights bill that she felt didn't go far enough to prevent discrimination against people with HIV or with unconventional gender identities . None of the experts contacted by The Associated Press could recall another 'no' vote in the 612-seat National Assembly, which meets briefly twice a year and approves laws by unanimous show of hands. 'This is the first time, without a doubt,' said Carlos Alzugaray, a historian and former Cuban diplomat. He said even measures that were widely criticized in grass-roots public meetings, such as a law raising the retirement age, had passed unanimously in the Assembly. Few in Cuba were even aware of the vote until after the measure was enacted into law this summer, at which point activists publicized the vote by Castro - the island's most prominent gay rights advocate. Arturo Lopez-Levy, a Cuban analyst who lectures at the University of Denver, suggested it might 'open doors for other important initiatives.' Mariela Castro herself seemed to hint there could be more debate in the assembly. 'There have been advances in the way things are discussed, above all the way things are discussed at the grass-roots level, in workplaces, unions and party groupings,' she said in an interview posted in late July on the blog of Francisco Rodriguez, a pro-government gay rights activist. 'I think we still need to perfect the democratic participation of the representatives within the Assembly,' she added. Campaigner: Mariela Castro is Cuba's most prominent gay rights advocate. Few on the island were in Cuba were even aware of the vote until after activists publicized it this summer . Others are skeptical it will set a precedent. 'I would say that this is more a sign of what Mariela can get away with than a sign of what your everyday parliamentarian can get away with,' said Ted Henken, a professor of Latin American studies at Baruch College in New York. In her crusade for gay rights, Castro has often taken stands that challenge the social status quo, while firmly supporting the Communist government. The new labor code bans workplace discrimination based on gender, race and sexual orientation. But it has no mention of HIV status or gender identity. 'I could not vote in favor without the certainty that the labor rights of people with different gender identity would be explicitly recognized,"" Castro said in the blog interview. Raul Castro himself has been slowly shaking up Cuba's system by allowing some limited private-sector activity and scrapping a much-loathed exit visa requirement. He's made it clear, though, that the Communist Party will continue to be the only one permitted. Mariela Castro is the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro (left). In recent years, her uncle Fidel Castro (right) - president between 1961 and 2011 - has expressed regret about past treatment of gays on the island . The vast majority of Assembly members keep their regular jobs and are not professional lawmakers. Laws are generally drafted by a handful of legislators and discussed with Cubans before being presented to parliament. There was no response to requests for an interview with Mariela Castro, who heads Cuba's National Center for Sex Education, an entity under the umbrella of the Health Ministry. She has spoken in the past about wanting to legalize same-sex unions, though concrete legislation to that effect has not materialized. That LGBT rights is even a matter of debate is a sign that much has changed since the 1960s and '70s, when gay islanders were routinely harassed and sent to labor camps along with others considered socially suspect. In recent years, Fidel Castro expressed regret about past treatment of gays, and today Cuba's free and universal health care system covers gender reassignment surgery. But activists say old attitudes and prejudices die hard so the LGBT community needs more legal protections. Rodriguez and about 20 others from Project Rainbow, a group that advocates for sexual diversity, recently sent a public letter urging Mariela Castro to introduce legislation to amend the labor code. 'These are not minor details,' Rodriguez said. 'They are social problems we have in contemporary Cuba.'","Mariela Castro voted 'no' to workers' rights bill over discrimination concerns .

"By . Corey Charlton For Mailonline . One patient played chess, watched movies and checked their emails during a nine-and-a-half hour hip replacement operation . A NHS trust has been criticised for a plan to install iPads into operating theatres, allowing patients to watch movies, play chess or check their emails while being operated on. The pilot scheme, which could be rolled out across 46 operating theatres in the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, could cost taxpayers more than £18,000 if funded by the NHS. In a pilot trial, patients at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre in Oxford have watched their . favourite films, surfed the net and checked their emails during 10 hour local anaesthetic surgeries. The pilot scheme is hoped to help distract people from often lengthy regional anaesthetic surgery, which requires absolute stillness. However, Dia Chakravarty, political director at The Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Taxpayers will wonder if this really is the best use of their money when necessary savings are having to be made across the public sector. 'People expect their taxes to pay for doctors and cancer drugs. 'The trust's decision to spend money on iPads will leave hard-pressed families wondering if the trust has got its priorities right.' One of the first patients to try the scheme watched a film, checked emails and played chess during a nine-and-a-half-hour hip replacement and lower limb orthoplastic surgery. With the lowest range iPad retailing at £399, purchasing enough iPads to cover each of the trust's operating theatres would cost £18,354. However, the trust has not specified what sort of tablet would be used if it were to go ahead on a larger scale. The trial, was held at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (pictured) in Oxford .

"By . Dan Bloom . Pop icon Kate Bush has been criticised for a comeback poster of herself being rescued from the sea which was released as the search continues for missing flight MH370. The 55-year-old singer wears a lifejacket in choppy waters in the image, released yesterday for the long-awaited announcement of her first live gigs for 35 years. But the the timing of the poster's release led some to claim it was inappropriate - for which the singer apologised today. 'The timing is really unfortunate,' she said. 'There . is absolutely no connection with the current tragedy that is heading the . news and I apologise from the bottom of my heart if this has in any way . upset or at all offended anyone.' Inappropriate? Fans on Twitter questioned the timing of this photo released to promote Kate Bush . Questions: Twitter users began to ask about the photo and its unfortunate timing with the search for MH370 . Am I the only one? Twitter user @KrisDeSouza questioned whether the shot was 'a little inappropriate' Missing: The last known image of the Boeing 777 Malaysia Airlines jet, which is still missing after two weeks . Apology: The singer explained the origin of the photo today on her website, saying it represented the narrative of her 1985 conceptual piece The Ninth Wave in which a woman is lost at sea . In the statement on her website, she added: 'I am rather concerned at some comments that have been passed on to me and I . feel I should clarify my position. 'The image that was chosen to . advertise the shows originates from a conceptual piece called The Ninth . Wave that was released in 1985. 'It is about a woman who is lost at sea . but is rescued in the end. Months ago I thought that, as part of the . show centres around this musical piece,  it would hopefully make a . dramatic shot.' Bush's publicist confirmed the photo was taken before the jet disappeared. The photo sparked debate on Twitter before the statement, where one user wrote: 'She must have shot this pre-publicity photo before the Malaysian Airlines jet went missing, right?' Another said: 'Am I the only one who thinks that given the missing Malaysian plane, Kate Bush posing in a life jacket at sea is a little inappropriate?' One Twitter user condemned it as 'poor timing' which should have been picked up while another suggested it might be 'genius marketing' and a 'conspiracy'. Others defended Bush, who famously avoids the public eye and has not played live since 1979. One fan said the criticism was an 'absurd comment', another simply wrote 'for f***'s sake' and one rightly speculated that the photo was a hint Bush would play her 1985 seven-track concept piece The Ninth Wave. Disagreement: Several users questioned the logic of the photo - though one said criticism was 'absurd'. Another thought the photo could be a hint she would perform seven-track concept piece The Ninth Wave . Individual style: Kate Bush at the height of her fame, left, and when she was made a CBE by the Queen last year . Argument: One joked that it was genius marketing and a conspiracy. Another just said: 'For f***'s sake' The singer will play a 15-night residency with the title Before the Dawn at London's Hammersmith Apollo in August and September. The venue was not chosen randomly - then known as the Hammersmith Odeon, it was the scene of her last gig on 14 May 1979. Tickets will go on sale next Friday at 9.30am for the dates and booking lines are expected to be indundated. If punters buy the maximum allocation of four tickets each, there will be fewer than 14,000 sets available for one of the most venerated British acts of the last 40 years. Kate Bush soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18. The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill. No answers: Royal Australian Air Force officer Michal Mikeska in the search for missing flight MH370 yesterday . Media scrum: Acting Prime Minister of Australia Warren Truss speaks to the media at an airbase in the search . Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style. On her website the singer added: 'I . was working all day yesterday and so was totally unaware of the . reaction, apart from friends who'd told me it had all gone bonkers. 'I . am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly . positive response from everyone. Thank you!' The fate of flight MH370, meanwhile, remains a mystery two weeks after it vanished between Malaysia and Vietnam with 239 passengers on board. Despite dozens of theories circulating about its disappearance, there is still confusion over what happened to the jet. Today Chinese authorities said they had spotted 'suspicious' object measuring 72ft by 42ft and floating in the remote search zone of the Indian Ocean.","Photo features 55-year-old singer in a lifejacket looking up to the camera .

Among the famous names embarrassed by pranksters was Monaco's Colombian striker Falcao. With the footballer apparently just days away from sealing a mega-money move to Liverpool, one Arsenal fan did his best to sour any future relationship with fans of the Anfield club. Simply by changing his Twitter profile name, the unidentified user was automatically sent a signed photograph that read: 'Liverpool are w****. Never stop believing, Falcao.' Another footballer made to look highly offensive by Twitter users was Cesc Fabregas, whose 'personalized' photograph was changed to read: 'I spread Ebola. Appreciate your support, Cesc.' Immature: The prank was not just reserved for high-profile footballers - even Usain Bolt was caught out . Wrong: Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus had his 'personalised' Puma message altered too . The prank was not just reserved for high-profile footballers, however - even the fastest man in the world was caught out by the hijinks. A photograph that appeared to be signed by Usain Bolt was changed to read: 'I'm erect. Forget the pack, follow your instincts.' Despite inadvertently offending their fans around the world, Liverpool are understood to remain keen on signing Falcao - although they are expected to face tough competition from Juventus. The Italians are apparently in favour of a loan deal and are considering the sale of Fernando Llorente to Valencia - although the Spaniard is not overly keen. Real Madrid also maintain an interest in Falcao but would need to sell another non-EU player before being allowed to sign the Colombian.","Group of the world's biggest sporting names were subject of Twitter prank .

"By . Julie Lawson Timmer for MailOnline . She's a mother of two who met her husband Dan, also a father of two, on an internet dating site and married him just a year later. But with two separate families to 'blend' and a pair of former spouses to factor in, making it work hasn't always been easy. Here author and parenting expert Julie Lawson Timmer reveals how she turned her very modern marriage into a loving blended family. Happy family: Julie Timmer Lawson with her husband and children at a Michigan American football match . All grown up: Julie with her husband Dan and their children shortly after their wedding in 2003 . With less than a year to go until two of our children head to university, my husband Dan and I have been reflecting on our blended family, began in a backyard ceremony on a sunny September day in 2003. The day we married, 'The Bigs' (my son and Dan’s eldest daughter) were six and 'The Littles' (my daughter and Dan’s youngest daughter) were three and two, respectively. Now, The Bigs are 17 and poised to move away for university after graduation next June, and The Young Ladies (who now prefer not to be called 'little') are 15 and 14. We’ve been together so long now that the internet dating site that brought us together boasts over a million marriages. I’m not sure how many of those involve children but I would guess the answer is plenty since the internet is one of the few meeting places single parents can find time to travel to. Certainly, Dan and I made some mistakes in combining our two families. But, we came up with some good ideas early on and I think those outweighed the errors. From the start, we found ways to make things 'our family’s'. My children are with us full-time, but my stepchildren are only here half the time and attend school according to their mother’s address, not ours. This meant that from the beginning, our city felt divided, and two kids were always leaving our house, knowing the rest of us were still there. So, Dan and I made the big decision to buy a weekend home on a small lake a few hours north of town and we spent most weekends and all holidays at 'our cottage', a place we arrived at, and left, together every time -- all six of us. We quickly attached a number of family traditions to the cottage -- family hikes and snowshoe expeditions, wearing goofy orange hats during hunting season. Friends: 'The Littles' were encouraged to enjoy each others company by their parents as were their siblings . Close: Julie's son and Dan's eldest daughter, both 17, will leave home to go to university next year . These were . all things we could easily have done in the city but Dan and I decided . to make them cottage-only treats, as part of our strategy to make the . place seem more magical, and more 'ours'. We . developed some family traditions in the city, too. We live in Ann . Arbor, where the University of Michigan is located, and where Dan earned . his graduate degree. He very quickly passed his fanaticism about Michigan sports on to me and the four kids, and our family still loves belting out the fight song and dressing in team colours on game day, whether we have tickets to attend or not. We got a family dog, too, and Jake the arthritic rescued labrador became an instant source of shared love and concern. We also joined a church none of us had been to before, so we’d have something in town that was 'ours' outside the house. We promoted communication. Another family tradition we started was our monthly 'family meeting', which begin with each person taking a turn to say something nice about everyone else. Next, we opened the floor to whoever had an issue to discuss, and in our family’s meetings, these tended to fall into two categories: one, all four kids lobbying for something and two, one or more raising an issue of perceived unfairness, often with blended family undertones. Category . one discussions led to household changes and often to more family . traditions. The Bigs or Littles, or all four combined, lobbied for . things like later bedtimes and raises in their allowance. To . our delight, they also came up with terrific ideas like spending each . child’s 13th birthday in Chicago and the invention of 'Special Night' where Dan takes each child out alone for dinner and an activity. Category two discussions also led to helpful changes, either in the kids’ perceptions or in Dan’s and my behaviour. The . meeting ground rules (take turns, use 'I' messages) allowed for . respectful and productive discussion, even about thorny stepfamily . issues. Altogether: Julie and Dan made a point of ensuring all four children were present for family holidays and treats . We never split up along biological lines. If we had to take two cars to an event, or divide up over a dinnertime or a weekend, we took care never to split up into 'us' and 'them'. Instead, I would take The Littles while Dan took The Bigs, or we’d divide on gender lines. Related, we never (and I mean never) did any big, fun thing unless all four kids were present. Mostly, we didn’t want any of them to ever feel left out but also we liked that the subliminal message would be that fun things happen when we’re all together. As for the things we did wrong, I suppose that will make a terrific article for our children to write  one day. But, no matter how long a list of missteps they might list, our failures were inadvertent. If we got some things wrong, it wasn’t for lack of effort, or caring, or love.

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . 'Britain's vainest man' has applied for free Botox for life on the NHS - and also wants an operation to have his ears pinned back. Sam Barton, 22, has told doctors that he needs the free cosmetic treatment to combat the anxiety over his appearance that his 'new-found fame' has provoked. The wannabe celebrity from Four Oaks in Sutton Coldfield says his symptoms have got worse since he made national headlines earlier this year by revealing how he had received a free £5,000 nose job on the NHS in a bid for the perfect looks. Scroll down for video . Free beauty treatments: Sam Barton, 22, wants botox on the NHS and would also like his ears pinned back . Now he wants Botox and the ear operation approved by the health service. Sam said: 'I went to see my doctor on Monday to sow the seeds in his head, I now have an appointment in September to discuss having free Botox treatment. 'Since I was in the newspapers people recognise and stare at me more and it makes me sweat a lot through anxiety. 'I have over 20,000 followers on Twitter and I do get trolled sometimes by some nasty individuals. 'I am very self-conscious about my appearance and I have told the doctors that I need to have regular Botox treatment to keep up my appearance and to make me feel more confident and less self-conscious. Surgery: Sam was previously granted a free nose job on the NHS by pretending to be upset about his looks . 'After they have agree to fund my Botox treatment on the NHS I will then apply to have my ears pinned back, as one sticks out a lot.' If Sam is given the go-ahead from the NHS, the Botox treatment will cost around £3,000 per year for six injections every two months. He defended his NHS request and said: 'I don't smoke or take drugs or drink to excess so I am not a drain on the NHS like some people who come into hospital with alcohol or health problems due to smoking. 'I think I am well within my rights to get what I can. If they say no to me I will simply book an appointment the next day to see another doctor. I will get what I can.' Transformation: Sam has had almost £33,000 worth of cosmetic surgery in a bid to look more like Joey Essex . Big ambitions: Sam is hoping his newly transformed looks will give him a route to the fame he craves . Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent  £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. Sam is also planning to go to a cosmetic clinic in Belgium in December to receive vaser lipo surgery, so he can have a permanent six pack and will also get his jaw realigned while there but is funding that treatment himself.","Sam Barton, 22, claims he needs Botox because of anxiety about fame .

"By . Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia . Viewers and refugee advocates have accused Channel Seven of broadcasting a 'racist' advertisement for its popular Border Security program. The network was swamped with criticism on social media after it broadcast a promo for Wednesday night's show featuring a man of Asian descent being questioned by Australian immigration officials. As the man burps repeatedly, a narrator asks 'what's wrong with Mr Wong' and Kung-fu style sound effects play in the background. The words 'something's wrong with Mr Wong' also appears in an 'Asian-style' font. Scroll down for video . A still from the controversial advertisement for this Wednesday's episode of Border Security. Australian authorities confront the so-called 'Mr Wong' (pictured). Some viewers criticised the television commercial's use of an Asian-style font as 'tacky'. Officials (top right) are pictured confronting Mr Wong (bottom left), who arrived in Australia holding a Korean passport. Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said the 'racist stereotypes' in the advertisement were reminiscent of White Australia Policy era attitudes. 'The Border Security ad is a disgraceful use of racial stereotyping that attempts to both play to, and encourage, racist attitudes,' Mr Rintoul told Daily Mail Australia. 'Even the title of the Border Security segment harks back to the attitudes associated with the immigration policies of White Australia,' he continued. The verdict was equally dire for Seven on social media. 'WTF is this, 1950s Australia?' Twitter user SCO tweeted. Sydney viewer Roy Tan wrote: ' ""What's wrong with Mr Wong?"" + tacky 1960s font? That's the best ur creative team can think of? @Channel7 bringing #racism back' 'Can you be anymore racist?' added user vibrantlymundy. Audrey Chan, an Arts/Law student at the University of NSW, tweeted: 'What's wrong with Mr Wong?' Channel 7 is what's wrong. Reflecting racial stereotypes isn't the way to go'. Pained? 'Mr Wong' appears to struggle through some medical difficulties as he is questioned by Australian officials. An Australian official confronts Mr Wong as he appears to struggle with medical difficulties. Mr Wong was brandishing a passport from the Republic of Korea when he arrived in Australia. 'JL' added: 'Not sure which is worse - @channel7 Border Security promo headline ""What's wrong with Mr Wong"" or the tacky asian font it was written in.' Many Seven viewers could only express their shock. Chloe Rose said 'channel seven you've outdone yourself'. Teresa Hunyh wrote: 'Australian border security actually went there ""what's wrong with mr wong"" '. Other Seven viewers were so angered they said they lodged formal complaints about the ad with commercial TV industry body Free TV Australia. Mixed reactions: Some viewers were scathing, while others noted it was not the most 'PC' or politically correct way of advertising a program. 'Channel 7 is what is wrong': Viewers fire up over the Border Security advertisment. One viewer asks: 'WTF is this, 1950s Australia?' Border Security: Australia's Front Line is consistently one of the Seven Network's most popular prime time programs. Samuel Lockwood, lead guitarist of Australian band The Jezabels, told Daily Mail Australia the advertisement's 'cheap stereotypes' fired him and his partner up so much they both made complaints. 'I've got a lot of Asian friends, being Australian, and it just made me really sad and angry at the same time,' Mr Lockwood said. Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane said a number of viewers had raised their concerns about the commercial with him. 'I can understand why some people may find it offensive on racial grounds,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'The advertisement’s portrayal of race should be open to debate.' 'As a general principle, Australia is a multicultural society and we should be mature enough to avoid gratuitously humiliating or degrading people on the grounds of race,' he said. In 1947, Ben Chifley's Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell famously quipped 'two Wongs don't make a White' in Parliament. The remark was considered symbolic of Australia's anti-Asian immigration policy at the time. Hosted by Amazing Race frontman Grant Bowler, Border Security is consistently one of Seven's biggest rating prime time programs. According to the OzTam ratings, last week it garnered an audience of 975,000 viewers in the five major capital cities. That made it the top-rating program behind the major news and current affairs shows and Channel Nine's prime time heavyweight The Block. The Seven Network were approached for comment but did not respond to Daily Mail Australia's questions by deadline.

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . The publication of a Government report into the Muslim Brotherhood has been delayed amid fears the findings will upset Britain’s allies in the Middle East. David Cameron ordered the investigation into whether the hardline Egyptian political group should be classified as a terrorist organisation. The Prime Minister asked Sir John Jenkins, the UK’s ambassador to Saudi Arabia, to carry out the inquiry after coming under pressure from Gulf states including Egypt and Saudi Arabia to ban the group. Scroll down for video . A Downing Street spokesperson said the report would be released publicly in due course . The senior diplomat was tasked to look at whether the Muslim Brotherhood was plotting attacks in the Middle East from Britain. But the report has concluded that the group should not be outlawed in Britain – alongside high-profile Islamist extremist group al-Muhajiroun – because there was little evidence members were involved in terrorist activities. However, concerns about a backlash from Middle East allies led ministers to stall publication for several weeks, according to the Financial Times. One well-placed source said: ‘Sir John will say that the Brotherhood is not a terrorist organisation. The Saudis and Emiratis will then be very upset with us.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister asked government officials to look at what the Muslim Brotherhood stand for, how they intend to achieve their aims and what that means for us in Britain. ‘That work was completed at the end of July. Work now is now going on across government to consider the implications of its findings. We have said we will make the findings public in due course.’ Since the report was commissioned, the UK has become concerned about financial support for the Islamic State, the Islamist fanatics formerly known as Isis, which has reportedly used private money from the Gulf to over-run parts of Syria and Iraq. The Muslim Brotherhood, which dates back to 1928, was once Egypt's oldest, best organised and most successful political movement. The Muslim Brotherhood's leader Mohamed Morsi was elected president of Egypt during the Arab Spring but was then deposed and jailed last year in an army-led coup . Its leader Mohammed Morsi was elected president of Egypt during the Arab Spring but was then deposed and jailed last year in an army-led coup following weeks of protests. In March, 529 Brotherhood members were sentenced to death by a court in Cairo, as part of a violent crackdown on the group. The group was blamed for attacks including the murder of three tourists in Sinai in February. Following the coup some Brotherhood leaders are reported to have fled to London, leading to concerns that they may be coordinating their next move from here.","Publication of David Cameron's Muslim Brotherhood report delayed .

"By . Associated Press . A woman who flew from San Jose to Southern California without a ticket was sentenced to 177 days in jail Wednesday after acknowledging that she violated her probation by returning to the Los Angeles airport. Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was found wandering through airport terminals after a judge ordered her to stay away from the facility, said Frank Mateljan, spokesman for the city attorney's office. While ordering the sentence, Los Angeles Superior Court Commissioner Alan Rubin scolded Hartman for wasting law enforcement resources at an airport that accommodates more than 65 million travelers a year. Jail time: Marilyn Jean Hartman appears in court Wednesday afternoon in the airport courthouse in Los Angeles. Hartman, 62, was found wandering through airport terminals after a judge ordered her to stay away from the facility, said Frank Mateljan, spokesman for the city attorney's office . 'Recently we had shootings here, somebody killed here at LAX. There have been in the past bombing attempts,' Rubin said. 'I want and I intend to have police resources to be used in those kinds of matters. Not this.' Safe place: Marilyn Jean Hartman has a history of mental illness and has said that she feels safer in airports than on the streets . Hartman's public defender Larissa Cesareo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Hartman previously made repeated attempts to sneak aboard flights at other airports, according to authorities. Airport police spotted her at LAX without a ticket on August 7, a day after a judge placed her on probation for two years for sneaking aboard the Southwest Airlines flight from San Jose to Los Angeles. At Mineta San Jose International . Airport, Hartman tried at least three times to get to a plane before she . finally went past a security screener who was busy checking a family's . documents, law enforcement officials said. Her boarding status was discovered once the Southwest flight landed in Los Angeles, the officials said. Hartman . later pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and . unlawfully entering Los Angeles as a stowaway on an aircraft. A judge . ordered her to stay away from LAX unless she had a valid ticket. Outside . the courthouse last week, Hartman said she would never try to sneak . onto a plane again. 'It was stupid, and it is something I don't want to . repeat,' she said. Still, . Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said he had a feeling . the woman 'with a fixation on flying would return to LAX, so police . passed out fliers with her picture. 'She was seen wandering through several terminals today in what appeared to be a scouting mission,' he said on Monday. Hartman was arrested for violating terms of her 24-month probation, which was issued after she pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of willfully and unlawfully entering the city as a stowaway on an aircraft. Repeated attempts:  Hartman was sentenced to 18 months probation for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound flights earlier in the year . In . February, Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation in San Mateo . County after being arrested for attempting to board three Hawaii-bound . flights at San Francisco International Airport on three separate days. Her . breach of security at the San Jose airport caused federal officials and . the airline to launch investigations. It also prompted criticism of the . airport in light of the trespassing of a teenage boy who stowed away in . the wheel well of a Hawaiian Airlines flight and survived an arduous . journey to Maui. Hartman, who authorities say has a . history of mental illness, has now been arrested eight times for . trespassing at airports this year - though this is the first time she's . been caught after successfully boarding a flight. She . said last week that homelessness drove her to take 'desperate . measures,' and that she feels safer being in airports than in the . streets. San Mateo County District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said that Hartman has no family and has never married. According . to a her blog, found by the San Francisco Chronicle, she has lived in . sketchy motels and squalid apartments from Seattle to San Diego in the . last few years. Records . indicate Hartman was arrested November 6, 2010, at the Lihue Airport in . Kauai after trespassing into the baggage claim area, the Chronicle . reported. She was charged with simple trespass, but failed to show up . for court hearings - and remains the subject of a bench warrant. Plane fixation: Hartman tried at least three times to breach airport security before she was able to get through a checkpoint without a boarding pass at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday, August 4 . According . to the newspaper, Hartman said in her blog that she had successfully . hopped a plane once before. She was found out and detained - but later . released without charge. In May - after being arrested seven times at San Francisco International Airport - Hartman was placed in a mental treatment program but she stopped attending last month. 'She declined all of our efforts to offer her assistance,' Wagstaffe said. 'And we tried all of the alternatives we had because we weren't interested in locking her up on our end.' Then she went back to the San Francisco airport, but Wagstaffe's office declined to file charges after her seventh arrest in July for another failed attempt. On Monday, Hartman was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. She was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department.","Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, has been sentenced to 177 days in prison for violating her probation .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . Today, 20,000 rugby fans from 127 countries will cheer them on to victory at the Stade Jean-Bouin stadium in Paris. No, we're not talking about Owen Farrell, Chris Robshaw and Dylan Hartly, but a plumber, special needs teacher and youth manager who spend their free time playing for the England women's rugby team. While little is known about these incredibly committed women, they, unlike the aforementioned men's team, juggle day jobs with their sporting commitments. Challenge: Today will see the women's England Rugby team, pictured with men's captain Chris Robshaw, take on Canada in the World Cup final at the Stade Jean-Bouin stadium in Paris . Today, their profile is set to sky-rocket as they take on Canada in their fourth successive World Cup final - and they're feeling confident. With a half-century of Test appearances already, the next grand ambition is a collective one. England suffered an agonisingly narrow defeat in the home World Cup Final four years ago to finish as runners-up to New Zealand for the third consecutive tournament but Gary Street’s squad are hell-bent on making it fourth time lucky. Game face: Today will see the likes of Katherine Merchant, pictured, take on Canada in the World Cup final - and the team are feeling confident . 'I remember the 2002 World Cup when there was barely any recognition. You wouldn't have known a World Cup was going on. But this year the support we're getting and the recognition the sport is getting is amazing, the viewing figures just keep going up and it's just looking really good for the sport and for women in the sport,' Marlie Packer, 24, from Yeovil told The Observer. Packer, a flanker, works full-time as a plumber and while she admits juggling the two commitments is 'a bit tricky', she's lucky because her employer is very good to her. Joining her on the pitch is Margaret Alphonsi MBE. The 30-year-old flanker, along with Lawrence Dallaglio, Will Greenwood and Jonny Wilkinson, is an ambassador for the men's Rugby World Cup 2015 and works as a manager at Youth Sports Trust in the week. Alphonsi has received numerous personal awards in her distinguished career, which has seen her claim seven successive Six Nations titles, six in Grand Slams, but a World Cup honour has proved elusive. Part-time job: Like many of the team, England's Emily Scarratt (right) has to juggle another job - she is a 24-year-old PE Assistant in the week .

Alphonsi, who is playing in her third World Cup, said: 'I've been very fortunate to have got the accolades that I have and all the recognition, which is brilliant. 'But the real reason why I wanted to get into the sport and play for England was to be world champion. It would mean the world. 'That's one accolade I haven't got. That's what I want for the team, as well as an individual thing.""I want people to recognise us as the best team in the world. 'It's great to see recognition for what are some fantastic athletes,' she said. 'The standard of women's rugby across the world is just getting better and better.' Success story: Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances . Becky Essex, a 31-year-old lock/back row, said she'd love the opportunity to play rugby full-time. The special needs teacher says she hopes the sport is going in that direction and hopes that girls aren't put off by the seemingly risky nature of the game. 'This is a fantastic sport and we're just grateful to be able to play for our country, it's a tremendous honour,' she said. Prop Rochelle 'Rocky' Clark is the most-capped player in the squad with 91 appearances - she is also Head Coach of the Chesham Stags and Bucks New University and, in what time she has left, is also a personal trainer. 'Short for Rochelle is Rocky and I got my first cap out in Canada where the Rockies are. It's quite apt really,' Clark said. Clark hopes for 'third time lucky' in 2014. 'We were really close in 2010 and it could've gone either way,' she added. 'That disappointment makes me even more hungry to win this one. I've got four years more experience to take into it.' Clark is often compared to Jason Leonard for her longevity. She added: 'The first goal is to win the World Cup, then the second goal will be to get 100 caps. When we come into next season and the Six Nations I'll think about that.'

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Crazy, stupid love: Alicia Walicke stole a bottle of $3.99 wine so she could see her boyfriend in jail . A Texas woman drunk on love allegedly stole a bottle of $3.99 wine - so she could get arrested and see her boyfriend in jail. Alicia Walicke, 22, of Cedar Park, was charged with misdemeanor theft after stealing a bottle Mad Dog 20/20 from a Shell petrol station, before sitting in the forecourt and drinking it while waiting for the police to show up. When they got there, she told them that her boyfriend had been arrested hours earlier, and she wanted to go to jail so she could see him. The arrest warrant, obtained by the Austin American-Statesman, said: 'Her boyfriend was arrested earlier that evening and it was her fault, so she wanted to make things right and go to jail.' Walicke was taken to Williamson County Jail, and released on bail after paying a $5,000 bond. Police in Cedar Park, 15 miles north west of Austin, did not immediately identify the boyfriend or say whether the woman saw him. Mad Dog 20/20 is the slang term for a flavoured, fortified wine made by Mogen David, and is described by the Urban Dictionary as being 'as majestic as the cascading waters of a drain pipe.' The incident echoes other stupid thefts, such as one in 2012, when Houaka Yang, from La Crosse, Wisconsin, stole a camera which he then used to film a video introducing himself and admitting he took the item. Yang stole the camera from the car of Republican state Senate candidate Bill Feehan. When police recovered it and returned it to its owner Chris Rochester, who worked for Feehan, he discovered the bizarre message, which also included a tour of the man's house, and uploaded it to YouTube. 'This is my house, yes, and a stolen camera that I stole. But it's OK, the cop won't figure it out,' Yang embarrassingly predicts in the clip.

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . A 19-year-old man was killed trying to stop his drunk friend from getting behind the wheel of a high-performance car after a country concert. Joe Ianzano, 19, from Florida, was clinging to the rear spoiler of his friend's car when it slammed into a palm tree on Saturday at around 11pm, sending him flying. He suffered a severe head trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Coconut Creek police sergeant, Henry Cabrera. Joe Ianzano, 19, from Coconut Creek, Florida, tried to stop his intoxicated friend from driving home, but was killed when the car  slammed into a palm tree on Saturday . His grandmother Barbara Ianzano said: 'It was a courageous act, but Joey was like that. He would put himself on the line. He would do things like that. This time, he was too courageous.' She said her grandson had been trying to block the car, but his friend — who has been identified by sources as Patricio Javier Arias — managed to get in. 'Joey was saying - you can't drive. You can't drive. You are too drunk,' said Mrs Ianzano. 'I think he was trying to stop Pat, but he peeled off and took off.' After it hit the tree on the 5300 block of Flamingo Place, the car drove across a driveway and hit another three cars before it came to a stop. The high-performance car smashed into a palm tree on the 5300 block of Flamingo Place, Coconut Creek . This is the site of the car crash where Joe Ianzano lost his life trying to stop his friend from drink driving . The teenager was about to start school to become a firefighter. His family said he was a hunter and athlete who loved his big truck and was willing to give his life to do the right thing. Cousin Alisha Lynne said: 'The night of the accident he went to a country concert with his friends, which he had been looking forward to for months. When it was over, Joey drove his back to his house and one of his friends jumped in his car with the intention to drive home. 'Joey could tell that he was too drunk to drive and begged him not to but his friend wouldn't listen. So in a last ditch effort to save his friends Joey grabbed on to the car desperately trying to get him to stop. 'He was the most genuine and selfless person I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He was my little cousin but I looked up to him like he was my older brother. 'My whole life I have always tried to imitate the ways that he was able to brighten up an entire room with nothing more than his presence. 'His trick was that no matter who and no matter what he always put the needs of others before his own. This is sadly the reasoning behind his death.' A Joseph Ianzano Memorial Fund has been started and it has raised $1,410 so far.","Joe Ianzano, 19, from Florida, died trying to stop his friend drink driving .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . This is the shocking moment a sea lion is sent spinning 20ft into air after being smacked by a killer whale's tail. A group of anglers in Ketchikan, Alaska, saw one of the ocean's strongest predators in action when they filmed the sea lion being tossed in the air. The sea lion tried to escape the 20ft mammal by hiding under a fishing boat on Friday August 15, but moved on after a few minutes. Scroll down for video . A group of anglers in Ketchikan, Alaska, captured the moment a sea lion was thrown 20ft in the air after being knocked by a killer whale's tail . One of the anglers is heard saying: 'He's swimming the wrong way.' As the sea lion starts swimming for his life, a powerful tail knocks him out of the water and tosses him through the air. The startled mammal spins above the water around a dozen times in little over a second before splashing back down. It is unknown whether the sea lion survived the ordeal. The sea lion tried to escape the killer whale by hiding under the fishing boat, but moved on after a few minutes . The Anglers Adventures of Ketchikan group posted the video and said: 'This morning near Ketchikan, Alaska, a sea lion was hiding under our fishing boat because he was being stalked by a killer whale. When we decided to leave the area the whale attacked the sea lion and tossed him 20 feet into the air.' The YouTube video has attracted more than 214,390 views. Killer whales are sophisticated and effective predators of marine mammals and regularly attack sea lions. Around 32 species have been recorded as killer whale prey, from examining stomach contents, scarring on the prey's body, or feeding activity. Groups even attack larger members of the cetaceans group, including minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales. They use a number of clever techniques to catch their prey, including their powerful tails to disable their intended victim. Data from Icelandic killer whales indicate that an average-size male is about 5.8m to 6.7m, 19 to 22 ft, whereas females average between 4.9m to 5.8m, 16 to 19 ft long.","Video captures moment killer whale flips sea lion 20 feet out of the water .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Hundreds of balloons and discarded metal canisters found during the V Festival clear-up have revealed the widespread abuse of 'laughing gas' by teenage music fans. Increasing numbers of revellers were seen taking legal high nitrous oxide at the Hylands Park site in Essex - unaware of its potentially lethal effect, especially if used in confined spaces. The gas, either carried in balloons or inhaled directly from a canister, leaves users feeling euphoric and relaxed with some people experiencing hallucinations. Thousands of tonnes of rubbish including balloons and discarded metal canisters, which carried legal high nitrous oxide, are being collected by volunteers at V Festival . Nitrous Oxide, known as 'laughing gas' or 'hippy crack', is carried in balloons or inhaled directly from canisters . More than 72 people were arrested at this year's festival, including seven for selling 'legal highs' such as laughing gas. Volunteers from St John Ambulance treated around 500 people over the course of the weekend and 10 people were taken to hospital. With the last tired revellers heading home this morning, the operation to clear the Chelmsford site is well under way.

Amongst the litter, there was overwhelming evidence of the increased use of laughing gas amongst festival goers. Scientists from the government's Centre for Applied Science and Technology will analyse samples of substances found at the Chelmsford event, including nitrous oxide. One teenage festival-goer said: 'We're all using it. It's legal and makes you feel good, so what's the problem? 'There were loads of people doing it here - you only have to look at the amount of people carrying balloons around to realise that. 'It's safer than taking ecstasy and cheaper than cocaine so that's why it's everywhere.' Essex Police, Essex County Council, Trading Standards and Chelmsford City Council issued a joint warning this week ahead of V Festival in Hylands Park and Brownstock Festival in Stow Maries. Donna Martin, substance misuse trainer for the Drug and Alcohol Partnership, said: 'I strongly urge festival-goers this summer to take the advice that legal highs could at best ruin your festival experience and at worst be fatal to you or your friends.'

Heartless thieves stole money from a family during a car boot sale that was raising money to help their 18-month-old baby get vital treatment for a spine condition. Jamie Cummings from Cardiff was recently diagnosed with scoliosis which causes the curvature of the spine. His family have been busy trying to raise up to £40,000 in case he needs treatment before the recommended age of two-years-old. Scroll down for video . Jamie Cummings has been diagnosed with scoliosis at just 18-months-old and his family are aiming to raise £40,000 for surgery. He is pictured here with his father  Matthew Cummings and mother Ellie Griffiths . They organised a stall at a car boot sale at Bessemer Road in Grangetown, Cardiff,  selling items which had been donated to them. But thieves managed to get into their locked car through a window which was slightly ajar, grabbed the float money and took some of the morning's takings which were in the glove compartment. Jamie's aunt, Nicola Wheten, 31, said: 'We are absolutely gutted, we're so devastated.' 'It was probably between £50 and £100. We had about £50 in change which we took ourselves.' 'Everyone has been so supportive. The community we live in is very good.' Thieves stole between £50 and £100 from Jamie's family during a car boot sale at Bessemer Road (pictured) in Grangetown, Cardiff . They did raise some money after the theft but failed to cover their outgoings. Ms Wheten said doctors did not initially think the curve in Jamie's back was skeletal but when physiotherapy showed no improvement and the curve got worse the scoliosis diagnosis was made. 'It's sort of all happened within the last month,' said Ms Wheten. She said that since then the family, including Jamie's father Matthew and mother Ellie Griffiths from Llanrumney, have been fundraising in case they have to pay for treatment. They had already been to two car boot sales and organised fun days and raffles - raising almost £3,000 so far. 'It's just a lot of hard work and it's just frustrating,' said Ms Wheten.

"By . Sarah Michael For Daily Mail Australia . Shoppers have been warned to check for surcharges before using tap and go card machines after supermarket chain ALDI was caught charging customers without disclosing it. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took action against the discount supermarket company after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores. ASIC also found that ALDI failed to disclose the 0.5 percent surcharge it charges consumers for paying by credit card in some of its stores. Scroll down for video . An ALDI supermarket in Sunbury, Victoria. The chain has been caught charging customers for using tap and go machines without disclosing it . Under the ASIC Act retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges, or create the impression that surcharges do not apply, may be considered 'misleading or deceptive'. Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go. 'Most people don't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that,' Mr Godfrey said. 'What we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level, and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on. 'The surcharge at ALDI is not excessive, but I don't think it's great they're charging a surcharge on a debit facility, so people's savings accounts.' Mr Godrey said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go. Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go . 'I think it's always important to ask - as you've seen with ALDI, you might assume there isn't a surcharge because Coles and Woolies don't have one,' Mr Godfrey said. 'If you're going to use tap and go you should charge ask what the surcharge will be, then ask for a surcharge free option.' ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges. 'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said.

"By . Sara Malm . Twisted: Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi, 36, is accused of keeping a woman as a sex slave for 18 month . A 27-year-old woman has been freed after 18 months in captivity as a sex slave in south-central Idaho. The woman told police she was kidnapped by Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi, 36, who locked her in his booby-trapped house in Buhl, Twin Falls County, where he raped her and forced her to take drugs. She claims to have been beaten with a hammer ‘more times than she could count’, and that her kidnapper would put a rope around her neck and lead her around the house ‘like a dog’. She told said her kidnapper forced her to smoke meth once or twice a week and sometimes held a gun to her head. The woman managed to escape from the house last month, despite Ayala-Arizmendi rigging the home with electrical wires, chains and metal gates. Oscar Ayala-Arizmendi was taken into custody on Tuesday and has now been charged with first-degree kidnapping and rape and possession of a controlled substance, with bail set at $1 million. Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs said on Thursday that following the woman's report, police worked to collect enough evidence to make the arrest. Authorities searched the house near U.S. Highway 30 and reported finding chains and locks mounted to walls and floors, chains on exterior doors, a handgun, and an electrical wire system intended to shock anyone trying to escape. Twin Falls County Sheriff's Detective John Koning told Times-News the woman reported having been beaten with a hammer and piece of wood ‘more times than she could count.’ The woman said failed escape attempts resulted in additional beatings. She reported that at night, Ayala-Arizmendi would lock the two of them in a bedroom made secure with a metal gate fastened and locked to the inside of the door. She said she was forced to use a wastebasket as a toilet. Detective Koning said detectives found a metal waste can with urine in it. Act of evil: Ariel Castro, who later killed himself in prison, kidnapped three young women and held them captive for a decade until one of them escaped last May . The woman said she believes she left the home three or four times over the past six months, but would always return on threat of harm or death. Police have not elaborated further. Authorities say they photographed a bruise on the woman's leg she said happened the day she escaped. Koning said the house also had security cameras mounted around it, with monitors in the bedroom. The case echoes that of Ariel Castro who kidnapped Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus between 2002 and 2004 and held them prisoner in his home in Cleveland, Ohio for more than a decade. The three women were locked in his house, sometimes chained to the wall, raped, beaten and subjected to endless psychological abuse. Their horrendous ordeal ended in May last year when one of the women, Amanda Berry, escaped with her six year old daughter, fathered by Castro. Two days later, on May 8, Castro pleaded guilty to 937 criminal counts of rape, kidnapping, and aggravated murder. One month into his sentence he committed suicide in his cell . Ben Andersen, Ayala-Arizmendi's public defender, has yet to respond to calls. His next court appearance is scheduled for May 23.","Woman, 27, escaped after 18 months in captivity as a sex slave .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . and Will Payne . and James Rush . The body of an 87-year-old woman, who has been missing since her husband was found murdered at their Georgia home, was found in a lake today. Shirley Dermond's body was discovered in Lake Oconee. After husband, Russell Dermond, was found dead on May 7, police feared she had been abducted. Mr Dermond, 88, was found decapitated in the garage of their $1 million Great Waters home, not far from where his wife was discovered. Tragic find: Shirley Dermond's body was found in a lake on Friday afternoon. Police have been searching for her since May 7, when her husband, Russell, was found murdered in their $1 million home . Sources told 11 Alive that a fisherman had discovered the elderly woman's body near a dam on Friday afternoon, . Investigators said they still have no leads on the murder of Mr Dermond, and his head has still not been found. They had offered a reward of up to $20,000 as police began an extensive search effort to try to find Mrs Dermond, and her husband's killer. Investigators . in Putnam County, Georgia, are completely baffled by the gruesome crime . and no one can understand why anyone would want to harm the beloved . elderly couple. A coroner said Mr Dermond was dead before his head was removed, and had possibly been shot or struck with a large object. His wife was never a suspect in the murder, and police believe she was abducted by the killer. Nothing was taken from the couple's home and their car keys and cellphones were left behind. Gruesome: Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at the couple's exclusive lake-front home on May 7 . Discovery: Officers dredge a lake during the search for Shirley Dermond. Her body was found by a fisherman . Earlier this week officers began dredging a lakes and woods near the couple's home for clues. One . of the Dermonds' three heartbroken children, Keith said the family had . been trying to come up with a possible motive, but they say their . parents didn’t have a single enemy in the world. Before his mother was found, 55-year-old Keith, from Jacksonville, Florida, told MailOnline: ‘We are . completely devastated ...The . thought of her suffering is just unbearable. ‘Each . hour that goes by, my brother, my sister and me are becoming more . resigned to the fact that we may never see her again and we may never . know what happened. ‘If . she is still alive, we can’t imagine what she is going through. The . human spirit is incredibly strong… but it has almost got to the stage . where we hope she is with our father, just to ease her suffering. ‘Whoever did this was so sick in the head that I just can’t imagine it.’ Russell Dermond was last seen on May 1 at a supermarket not far from his home in the gated Reynolds Plantation east of Atlanta. Concern: The alarm was raised when the couple failed to turn up to a Kentucky Derby party . Shirley . Dermond had started the next day’s newspaper crossword puzzle, but no . one had taken the couple’s May 3 mail out of their mailbox.  That same . day, last Saturday, the Dermonds failed to show up at a friend’s . Kentucky Derby party. Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills has said financial and phone records . have not turned up anything to suggest the Dermonds would be the target . of criminal activity. Sheriff . Sills has been forced to deny rumors that Mr Dermond – whose body was . found in his garage - was in a witness protection program and may have . been killed by mobsters. He . has also said there was no evidence that the brutal crime was in some . way linked to the murder of the couple’s son Mark in a drug deal gone . wrong in 2000. Mark . was shot in Atlanta as he apparently tried to buy crack cocaine . on his birthday. Troy Major was convicted and sentenced to life . imprisonment for murder. He . was also hit with consecutive terms of 20 years for aggravated assault . and five years for possession of a firearm during the commission of a . felony. He has tried to appeal twice, but both attempts were denied.","Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found at his home on May 7 .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Laura Cox . The 12-year-old Maine girl sensationally accused two years ago of killing a three-month old baby has agreed to a plea deal that will see her avoid the original charge of manslaughter. Kelli Murphy when first charged in the death of three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway in July 2012, but will only have to admit to committing an unspecified misdemeanor to avoid spending the rest of her life in jail. Murphy was found last year incompetent to stand trial by a state forensics investigator after multiple exams, according to the Portland Press Herald. The plea deal has been agreed to by prosecutors but still needs a judge's approval. Tragic: 12-year-old Kelli Murphy may escape a manslaughter charge for the 2012 death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway (pictured) 'There will be admissions to lesser charges,' Deputy Attorney General William Stokes told the paper. 'The goal of this, which has been the goal from the very beginning, is that the juvenile will be subject to conditions and to counseling, supervision, treatment for a lengthy period of time, so that the issues that she has can be addressed,' he added. The charges stem from a night in which the baby's mother stayed over Murphy's house with her baby while babysitting the then-10-year-old only to wake up and find her toddler dead. An autopsy and toxicology performed on the baby found . large quantities of the same prescription medication Murphy took to control her Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The deal comes after the baby's mother Nicki Greenaway called for charges against Murphy's mother Amanda Huard. She said the woman was neglectful in watching Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway, and that she should be held liable for her conduct. The state disagreed. 'Legally speaking, it’s not possible,' Stokes said. 'One of the things we have to prove in any death is causation, and we don’t have any evidence that [Huard] caused anybody’s death.' The juvenile petition against Murphy . contained no additional details about the case, including Brooklyn's cause of death, but the baby's mother, Nicki Greenaway, claims to have been told her child was suffocated. When Greenaway saw her daughter for the first time at a funeral home, the baby had a black eye, bruises on her nose and marks that looked like fingerprints on her cheeks, she said. 'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said a notice delivered to the mother in the weeks after her child's death. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.' Deputy Attorney General William . Stokes told the Portland Press Herald that prosecutors are not pushing . for Murphy to be tried as an adult, so she will not get a jury trial. If the case goes to trial a ruling will be made by a judge who deals with juveniles. But the deal tentatively agreed to is an effort to avoid even that. 'Nothing can bring back the baby,' Huard's lawyer John Youney told the paper. 'The best we can do is look out for the well-being of my client’s child.' Gone too soon: Baby Brooklyn died while in the care of Murphy and her mother . Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system . Murphy had already been labeled as a . danger to children before Foss-Greenaway's death, according to documents from the DHHS which detail . that she suffers behavioral problems, including oppositional defiant . disorder, ADHD and attachment . disorder. Former tenants of Huard's house also claimed Murphy also harmed their baby. Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have . named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's . hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures. Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. Tenney and Hopkins were living with in the basement of Huard's home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported. They say the girl was alone with . their daughter in June 2012, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and . Tenney was out at work. The . couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy . interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with . diaper changes and bathing. When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating. 'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.' As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 'She . was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she . rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 . seconds.' The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on. Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed. Shock: Ashley Tenney (left) claims Murphy was also responsible for her daughter Jaylynn's (right) hospitalisation in June . 'If her head went to the left her arm . went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high . and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.' In . Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's . house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity . disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system. So . much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been . dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the . medication on her own. In . the days following the scare Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new . place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had . deliberately hurt their own. She . said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's . bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, . others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them. The . couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and . Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four . were told that the girl should not be given care of young children. But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight.","Kelli Murphy was only 10-years-old when first charged in the 2012 death of three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway .

"By . Andrew Young In Praia Da Luz, Portugal . Madeleine McCann was three when she vanished from the Mark Warner Ocean Summer Club resort in Praia da Luz . A former Scotland Yard commander has urged British police to search an abandoned well just 875 yards from the apartment where Madeleine McCann vanished. The Mail on Sunday has established that the uncovered shaft is on scrubland used as a campsite by Roma gipsies – and has been overlooked by Portuguese police. Hidden from the nearby road, the well drops 30ft down to 12ft-deep water. ‘It is clearly known to locals and possibly to local criminals as a place to discard evidence from petty crime, such as handbags and other unwanted stolen items,’ said Roy Ramm, who served 27 years with the Metropolitan Police force and, as Commander of Specialist Operations, dealt with serious crime, from murder to rape and human trafficking. He added: ‘Whoever abducted Madeleine knew the local streets, alleyways and scrubland and used that knowledge to avoid detection.’ Three years ago British police began a new investigation into the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine – the daughter of Kate and Gerry McCann – who vanished from their holiday apartment in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz in May 2007. Met officers recently searched scrubland near the resort, but they have not examined the well. Local authorities only allowed British police to check areas where ground anomalies picked up by aerial surveys might indicate a grave site. Location: An aerial photograph showing the McCanns' apartment in Praia da Luz, the abandoned well and the search area, which does not include the well . Mr Ramm said: ‘If this had been a Yard-led inquiry from the outset, there is no doubt that the search would have been wider and more effective than that conducted by the Portuguese police. 'The well would have been searched thoroughly at the time, probably by using divers to get to the bottom of this very difficult and dangerous shaft.’ Mr Ramm added: ‘The Portuguese authorities have come a long way in letting the Yard conduct any inquiries, but they need now to take the final step and ensure the Yard team can conduct a really thorough search wherever they want. And in my experience that should include the well.’ Both Scotland Yard and the Portuguese police declined to discuss whether the well had featured in their investigations. Local residents said they could not recall ever seeing any police activity in its vicinity. From where Madeleine was snatched, her abductor could reach the well by walking 400 yards through empty back streets, climbing a low metal gate and continuing the rest of the way over scrubland. The Mail on Sunday revealed last month that a prime suspect may have worked at a water treatment plant just 220 yards from the well. Heroin addict Euclides Monteiro, who died in 2009, was suspected of kidnapping Madeleine in a botched burglary after mobile phone records placed him near the McCanns’ apartment when she disappeared. Last Tuesday, at the request of British officers, local police quizzed four Portuguese suspects – including Russian-born Sergey Malinka, 29, who was questioned as a witness in 2007. British police sat in on interviews, but sources suggest they led to no new developments. The well is on land owned by two wealthy British property developers, who were unaware of its existence until The Mail on Sunday contacted them last week. The plot includes a derelict farmhouse surrounded by rubble and  litter, including a pile of English paperback novels. An old mattress inside the tumbledown building  suggests someone once slept there. One of the owners, who asked not to be identified, said: ‘If they want to search on the land we have got no problem with it. We are not going  to stand in anyone’s way, but no one has contacted us.’ The McCanns’ spokesman said yesterday: ‘Kate and Gerry continue to have full confidence in the work being carried out by the Met Police but will not comment on it.’","Ex-Scotland Yard detective urges police to search scrubland used by gypsies .

The picture is of Emmerli Wilcoxson - who stole a cop car and led police on a 130mph chase before screaming into their radio as she crashed the vehicle and caused a pile-up. The 40-year-old was stopped while high on synthetic marijuana on a street in Atlanta, Georgia, after police claimed she matched the description of a woman reportedly armed in the area. Not a pretty picture: Emmerli Wilcoxson's haggard and bruised mugshot after she was arrested following high-speed crash on Sunday . Amazingly, she managed to steal the police's patrol during the incident in Cobb County on Sunday.

The two cars collided with two more vehicles before crashing into a concrete partition, the New York Daily News reports. Emergency workers transported Wilcoxson to a local hospital after the crash on Sunday. She was treated for head trauma before being taken to the Cobb County Jail the following day. Looking utterly dejected and bruised after the reckless car theft - Wilcoxson will not be savouring the photo taken by police. A witness to the crime, William Michael Jones, said: 'We saw two police cars coming. They were going at a high rate of speed.

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . These photos show the terrifying moment a lemon shark opens it mouth to reveal the rows of razor sharp teeth it uses to devour its prey. As wildlife photographer John Chapa, 41, swims just inches from the bait, the shark shoots towards him, its enormous jaw gaping as it prepares to snatch the meal straight from his assistant's hand. Mr Chapa, pictured here in waters off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, takes groups of tourists on trips to see the formidable creatures - allowing brave holidaymakers the chance to get up close and personal during dinner time. The lemon shark opens its mouth to reveal rows of razor sharp teeth just inches from wildlife photographer John Chapa's head . The hefty lemon shark snatches the bait from Mr Chapa's assistant, Cameron Nimmo, during a diving trip . The shark swims off with the free meal during a dive in waters off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, this month . For a fee of $100, they can dive with the sharks and have their photo taken with it - just as it tears its meal to pieces. His friend, diver Cameron Nimmo, 26, sets up the shots for him by holding out bait right in front of his camera. Mr Chapa, from Miami, said: 'Timing is important - it's really fast. Their mouths are open and closed in a second. Cameron will release the bait just in time and the shark is pretty much right in my face. 'Usually I keep the shutter pressed, and I'll take five shots - the fourth one is the usually best and shows the shark's mouth completely open.

'The sharks are very careful and not clumsy at all - they know you're not the food and turn once they've got the bait.' Mr Chapa has been on around 800 dives and spends an average of 50 minutes with the sharks each time. He added: 'I had to psych myself up to do it the first time - you can't go down there and freak out, it's dangerous. The sharks grow to around three metres long and have been known to weigh up to 180kg . Lemon sharks are so-called because their yellow-brown pitted skin can have the appearance of lemon . 'A girl freaked out once and bolted for the surface but all the sharks followed he - she thought they were attacking her but in reality they were following her to see why she was freaking out. 'I've been surrounded by 30-40 lemon sharks at a time, they don't bite you - they come up and bump you but don't bite intentionally. 'They know you're not on the menu - they know the bait is food and then turn away once they have it.' Lemon sharks are so-called because their yellow-brown pitted skin can have the appearance of lemon. This helps them to blend in against sandy sea floors where they can lay motionless. Lemon sharks are bottom dwellers, preferring the tropical shallow waters of coral reefs, mangroves, bays and estuaries. Shallow waters, such as the lagoon in Bimini, provide the protection from larger sharks the pups need, whilst also offering rich hunting grounds. They are short-nosed and stocky sharks with a powerful bite. They have adapted to withstand different salinities in water and have been known to travel up rivers in freshwater. They can grow to around three metres in length and can weigh up to 180kg.","Wildlife photographer, John Chapa, 41, offers feeding time tourist trips .

An injured passenger involved in a car crash that killed three people has revealed that his dunk driving friend laughed 'psychotically' before speeding off the road. Trevor Rodgers also claims that when  William Daniel Cady was asked to slow down by the five people in the vehicle he responded by saying 'I'll drive this f***ing car however the f*** I want'. The group of six had been to three bars around San Diego before piling into the Cadillac Escalade on the night of January 10. Mr Rodgers said Cady, 25, was driving 'pretty fast' as they exited northbound Interstate 805 and took the transition ramp to westbound state Route 52 on the way home to Clairemont. He said: 'When we came around the turn, I noticed that the whole vehicle kind of lurched, like when you take a turn at unsafe speed. 'At that point we got scared - we asked him to slow down. He was laughing like it was a big joke. We were going really, really fast.' After cursing at his five passengers, Cady soon lost control of the SUV, San Diego Superior Court heard. The vehicle veered off the road and up a dirt embankment before rolling over several times as it was hit by other cars, . Wreckage: The crumpled remains of the SUV are inspected by California's Highway Patrol officers on route 52 . Four of the passengers were hurled from the vehicle as it spun, with two of them -  Taylor Bednarski, 29, and Shon Gilliam, 23, both of San Diego - being killed in the process. A third passenger, 35-year-old Jeffery Becker, of Kern County, died in the crumpled wreckage. He was the only person in the SUV wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, according to the California Highway Patrol. Mr Rodgers' testimony came on the first day of a preliminary hearing held to determine whether enough evidence exists for Cady to stand trial on felony charges that include gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. Dead: Taylor Bednarski, 29, (left) and Shon Gilliam, 23, (middle) were killed after being thrown from the vehicle, while Jeffery Becker, 35, died in the car while wearing a seatbelt . The witness, 26, was also seriously injured in the crash, suffering a broken ankle, arm and pelvis - which required him to remain in hospital for 15 days. Cady suffered black eyes and a neck injury - which have since healed. California Highway Patrol Officer Brad Clinkscales testified that he visited Cady in the hospital on January 13 and left a digital recorder in the room after the patient declined to talk to him, 10news reports. Broken: Cady looks dejected as he appears in court with black eyes wearing a neck brace earlier this year . On the tape, Cady was heard saying that he could not believe he had killed three people and that he would surely go to prison. On the recording he says: 'Oh my God, my life is over. I've done it to myself. Why? I'm a bad person. I hate cars. Cars are no good.'

Desperate to slow down: Shon Gilliam (left) and Jeffery Becker (right) pleaded with Cady to slow the car down before both being killed in the crash on Route 52, San Diego . They refused - instead moving on to another bar. Speaking at San Diego Superior Court, she claimed she never served Cady but that it seemed like he was 'under the influence of something'. She said: 'He was stand-offish, had clammy hands, was kind of sweaty-looking, wasn't interacting and was on his phone. 'He looked kind of angry, irritated.' Cady's defence counsel has highlighted that the barmaid did not serve him any alcohol and say their client is sick with guilt and grief.

"By . Michael Zennie . A vigilante has taken it on himself to enforce parking rules on the streets of his crowded Queens, New York, neighborhood - by tagging the offending cars with spray paint. The anonymous vandal marked up at least two cars in Glendale with rude messages this weekend. One message, scrawled across the door panels of a perceived offender, read 'Park right s-bag.' The other tag blared: 'Learn to park s***bag!' Rude: A vigilante marked up two cards with angry messages because he believed they were taking up too much room on the street . Neighbors say parking in the area is a nightmare - but it doesn't excuse what the vandal did . WCBS-TV reports that the vigilante likely thought the cars were taking up too much space on the street and had not left enough room for others to park. Residents of Glendale say on-street parking is a nightmare - but that doesn't give the vandal to right to tag other people's cars with paint. 'Nobody has a right to touch your property,' neighbor Dorren Pratt told WCBS. She said she saw one of the cars that had been hit by the vigilante and she didn't think the driver had done anything wrong with their parking job. Suspect: This is believed to be the vandal, captured here on surveillance cameras carrying what appears to be a can of spray paint . 'There was no way another car would have fit there. A smart car was even too big for it,' Ms Pratt told the station. The driver of one of the tagged cars told WCBS that she knows hard difficult it is to find a spot in the neighborhood and she didn't think she would being inconsiderate. Surveillance cameras on a nearby school captured an video of the man who appears to be carrying a can of spray paint.","Vandal in Glendale, Queens, targeted two cars that were taking up too much space on the street and not allowing others to park ."
"By . Sarah Griffiths For Mailonline . Siri can make life easier when it comes to setting an alarm or making a call on an iPhone, but Apple’s personal assistant also has its limitations when it comes to trickier requests. Now, the original creators of Siri are working on a superior artificial intelligence system called Viv. They say that it can handle more complex requests than the present generation of personal assistants - Siri, Google Now and Microsoft’s Cortana, for example. The original creators of Apple's Siri PA (pictured) are working on a superior artificial intelligence system called Viv, which can handle more complex questions than the current generation of smartphone helpers . Viv, which gets its name from the Latin for ‘live,’ can analyse the nouns in a sentence to provide more helpful answers than current PAs, according to its creators who are based in San Jose, California. The founders of the start-up, Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, told Wired that Viv teaches itself, unlike Siri for example, which only performs actions programmed by Apple’s engineers. The computer scientists envisage that its capacity to learn and provide help to users is limitless. So it will be able to answer users' complicated queries using its cloud-based 'brain' when it launches. It can do this by analysing different nouns in a sentence to formulate an answer, creating code as it goes long without the need for any programmers. Viv could one day predict people’s needs as it learns more about them and analyses nouns in sentences to provide answers to complex questions, which current smartphones (pictured) can't handle . Viv analyses the nouns in a sentence when a person speaks into a smartphone. For example, if someone told Siri that they are on their way to their brother’s house and need to pick up cheap wine to go with lasagne, they would probably get no response, or at best would see one useful place marked on a map. But Viv would isolate the words ‘lasagne’, ‘wine,’ ‘brother’ and ‘house’ to formulate an answer, perhaps offering maps of the house and shops, as well as wine suggestions. It learns as it goes, generating code and could one day anticipate people’s needs. Viv is an open system so businesses and apps will be able to become part of its ‘brain’. The founders said, that if someone told Siri that they are on their way to their brother’s house and need to pick up cheap wine that goes well with lasagne, they would probably be met with no helpful response. At best, a current PA would show a local wine store on a map. But Viv would isolate the words ‘lasagne’, ‘wine,’ ‘brother’ and ‘house’ to formulate a helpful answer. This could be offering wine suggestions as well as where to buy the chosen product. Viv could one day predict people’s needs as it learns more about them, so that someone slurring ‘drunk’ into their smartphone would be assisted by Viv automatically calling them a cab home. Unlike Siri, Viv is an open system and will let businesses and apps become part of its ‘brain’ after it launches. Its creators hope that Viv could one day be embedded in all sorts of everyday objects that are connected to the internet – as well as smartphones. While Viv sounds impressive, Google, Facebook and Apple are all competing to build the most intelligent next-generation PA  and only time will tell how advanced their offerings will be.","San Jose start-up has created a next-generation PA called Viv, meaning live .

"By . Michael Zennie . Someone has run up the white flag on one of New York City's most famous landmarks. Commuters on Tuesday morning were greeted with a pair of billowing white banners atop the Brooklyn Bridge after vandals stole Old Glory and replaced them with ones that had been bleached. The flags appeared to have faint traces of stars and stripes on it. It was revealed this afternoon that the flags were defaced by vandals who bleached  them. The vandals tacked aluminum covers on to the lights that illuminated that flags, so that the top of the bridge towers looked dark. As a result, the white flags were not discovered until daybreak. EarthCam video of the bridge shows that the first tower went dark about 3.35am. The second tower went dark seven minutes later, indicating the heist was at least a two-person job. Scroll down for video . Whitewash: This photo shows that the flags above the Brooklyn Bridge appear to have been bleached American Flags - the stars and stripes are faintly visible . Surrender? A vandal replaced the American flags atop the Brooklyn Bridge with white banners on Tuesday - the international symbol for surrender . No one knows why or how the flags were hoisted above the Brooklyn Bridge. Officials called it a major security breach . So far, the NYPD has no clue who is . behind the flags or why they were hoisted above the bridge - though they . don't believe it has any connection to terrorism or politics. 'This . may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at a . statement,' John Miller, Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence of the . NYPD, said this afternoon. Several officers scaled the bridge and were seen lowering the flag on the Manhattan side around 11am as traffic inched along the bridge. The bridge is one of the most heavily secured landmarks in the city, constantly monitored by surveillance cameras. Police patrol cars are also stationed at both ends of the bridge. Detectives are reviewing security footage in an attempt to determine who put up the white flags - and how they gained access to the span. The support towers are 273-feet tall and it's unknown how the thieves managed to climb them without anyone noticing. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams blasted the vandals who took the American flags. The Manhattan side of the bridge blinked out at 3.35am as a vandal covered the lights illuminating the American flag . By 3.42am, the lights above both towers on the Brooklyn Bridge were out . By 11am, NYPD officers had taken down the white flags. They were later replaced with new American flags . They promptly hoisted up an American flag - atop the bridge - replacing the Old Glory that was stolen from the New York icon . It's unclear how the vandals slipped past the police officers and security cameras guarding the bridge . 'If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone’s idea of a joke, I’m not laughing,' he told the New York Post. 'The public safety of our city is of paramount importance, particularly our landmarks and bridges that are already known to be high-risk targets. We will not surrender our public safety to anyone, at any time.' In April, New York artist Brendan Fagan - aka Justin Supine - scaled the Ed Koch-Queensboro Bridge and planted an art installation at the top. He was later arrested and charged with reckless endangerment and criminal trespass.","Vandals managed to slip unnoticed past police officers and surveillance cameras guarding the Brooklyn Bridge early Tuesday and install white flags .

"By . Associated Press . and MailOnline Reporter . ABC News reporter Elizabeth Vargas has returned to a recovery center to be treated for alcohol dependency. The '20/20' anchor said in an emailed statement Sunday that she checked into a facility this weekend while on vacation. 'As so many other recovering alcoholics know, overcoming the disease can be a long and incredibly difficult process,' Vargas, 51, told Page Six. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . ABC News reporter Elizabeth Vargas, who anchors '20/20',  has returned to a recovery center to be treated for alcohol dependency . Elizabeth Vargas appeared on 'Good Morning America' in January to publicly discuss for the first time her addiction to alcohol, which she had been keeping a secret for many years. 'I am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos. 'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.' ‘You become so isolated with the secret and so lonely, because you can’t tell anyone what’s happening,’ she explained. ‘I started thinking “Well, you know, I’ll only drink, you know, on weekends,” she said with a laugh. ‘I’ll only drink, you know, two glasses of wine a night. I won’t drink on nights before I have to get up and do “Good Morning America.” But those deals never work.’ Vargas used wine to treat her anxiety and deal with the stresses of her work. ‘That’s exhausting, to live like that. And it becomes very easy to think “I deserve this glass of wine. I’m so stressed out …,”’ she said. When Vargas finally decided to enter rehab, she and her husband told their sons that she was suffering from an alcohol allergy. ‘I didn’t want to use the word “disease” with them, even though that’s how it’s classified by the medical profession,’ she said. ‘It’s too scary, you know, the connotation for them is disease is something deadly.’ Vargas admitted that even now it is hard for her not to drink, but she has been relying on prayers, meditation and a great support system to conquer her urges triggered by stress. ‘There are lots of people who feel a lot of stress,’ she said. ‘Not everybody turns to a glass of wine or three like I did, or four, like I did on some occasions. What I learned to do when I was away was to feel the feelings.’ She concluded: 'Alcohol for me is no longer an option.' She says she's committed to battling the disease and apologized for letting down her family and co-workers. 'I feel I have let myself, my co-workers and most importantly my family down and for that I am ashamed and sorry,' she added. The network said in a statement that it supports Vargas and looks forward to having her return to ABC News. 'Nothing is more important than Elizabeth’s health and well-being and we stand squarely behind her,' ABC spokeswoman Heather Riley told Page Six. 'Our thoughts are with Elizabeth and her family and we look forward to having her back at ABC News when she feels ready to return.' Vargas announced in November 2013 that she was in rehab. She acknowledged in an interview that aired in January on 'Good Morning America' that she was an alcoholic and it took years for her to admit it. She said she had suffered panic attacks since she was a child and dealt with the stress by drinking. Vargas is married to Grammy Award-winning musician Marc Cohn, best known for his song Walking In Memphis, and the couple have two sons, 10-year-old Zachary and seven-year-old Samuel. Vargas is also stepmother to Maxwell and Emily, Cohn's children from his first marriage. In 2005, Cohn was shot in the head during a carjacking attempt in Denver, Colorado. The musican survived and made a full recovery, but the traumatic event has left its mark on their family. 'Long . after the physical wounds are healed, I think my husband's going to . really be struggling with the psychological effects of what happened,' Vargas said in an ABC News interview. Vargas . is a well-respected television journalist, getting her start at . Chicago's WBBM before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for . Dateline. Vargas smiles during a taping of 'Good Morning America' with her sons, Zachary and Samuel Cohn . ABC News said it supports Vargas and wants to have the anchor back on air when she feels ready . She was named co-anchor alongside David Muir of ABC's investigative news program 20/20 in 2004. The New Jersey native won an Emmy in 1999 for her coverage of the Elian Gonzalez immigration case. Vargas' husband, Cohn, was the only one who knew about her struggles with alcohol, and when he finally confronted her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' while acknowledging that he was right. When asked about the cause of her addiction, Vargas revealed that she has been suffering from severe anxiety since she was a little girl. Coming clean: Vargas, 51, appeared on Good Morning America to speak out about her battle with alcohol addiction . Vargas' father served in the Vietnam War in the 1960s, and she recalled that when her mother would leave the house to go to work, she suffered daily panic attacks that carried into adulthood. The journalist recalled how one time she even had a panic attack on air while anchoring a live news show on Chicago's WBBM, where she got her start before joining NBC News in 1993 as a correspondent for Dateline . It took her a long time to seek treatment because Vargas said she did not want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily life. Vargas recalled that her ‘aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a '20/20' segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it. 'Alcohol for me is no longer an option,' Vargas said.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Even if you have parental controls set up on your computer, your children might still be at risk from porn and other adult content, an investigation has revealed. Extensive tests, carried out by technology magazine PC Pro, have revealed that only three of the 15 most popular web filtering services - both free and paid-for - actually blocked 100 per cent of porn sites the testers tried to visit. This means 80 per cent of packages are leaving children potentially at risk of viewing adult material while they browse the web. PC Pro tested 15 of the most popular web filters to discover only three blocked 100% of porn. It also tested each filter using pro-anorexia, pro-suicide, gore and gambling sites, as well as sites classed containing 'hate' or 'tasteless humour' There are two basic ways of protecting children from inappropriate online content. Network-level filters block sites before they reach your browser meaning every device used to visit that site will block it. 'Client-based controls' should be installed on every PC, but can . provide additional protection beyond web filtering. According to PC Pro, software-based . systems are more flexible because a user can set restrictions . for different family members. Users can also create bespoke black and whitelists of which links to block. This means that even if a site isn't considered to contain adult content, if a user doesn't want their child visiting it, they can block it automatically. Some software-based packages also included time-limiting features, too, while others can restrict games . and videos based on age ratings. As well as sites considered to be pornographic, PC Pro additionally tested each filter against sites classified as containing gore, gambling, pro-anorexia and pro-suicide, hate and tasteless humour. More than 150 sites were tested, yet not a single package blocked every instance of explicit, adult or inappropriate content. Norton Family was the best performing package of the lot and was the PC Pro Labs Winner. PC Pro also recommended Blue Coat's K9 Web Protection kit. The worst performing sites in tests were MetaCert and OpenDNS Basic. They blocked a total of 88 per cent and 60 per cent of porn sites respectively - all other sites scored above 90 per cent. MetaCert failed to block a single gambling, gore, pro-anorexia or hate site. AVG Family Safety and Windows Live Family Safety also didn't block any gambling sites. In tests, each product’s percentage score represents the proportion of sites of each type it blocked. In all but the false-positives category, a higher score indicated better protection. False-positives are when a service believes a site is inappropriate when it isn't and blocks it anyway. Net Nanny fared slightly better against offensive sites than the winner Norton Family, but its very high false-positive rate knocked it down the table. PC Pro results . PC Pro table continued . At the bottom of the rankings, OpenDNS and MetaCert delivered 'flawless performance' in the false-positives test, but were branded 'useless overall' by the testers because of 'their repeated failures to block non-family-friendly sites.' PC Pro's Technical Editor Darien Graham-Smith said: 'The results of this month’s web-filter tests aren’t exactly reassuring. Time and again we saw graphic pornography sail through supposedly strict filters, while harmless news and reference pages were blocked. 'Such failures shouldn’t be a surprise. No doubt some human intelligence feeds into the filtering process, but with more than 600 million websites in existence, and an estimated 100,000 new onesspringing up every day, it simply isn’t possible to inspect every site manually.' PC Pro set up each product or service on a clean Windows 8 laptop before setting the strictest filtering rules on each, that didn't rely purely on whitelisting. This meant they could identify any holes in each package’s filtering system. They then attempted to visit 145 websites that were deemed inappropriate and shouldn't be accessible to young children. This included 74 pornography sites or image searches, plus a selection of sites promoting gambling, 'gore', suicide, anorexia, 'hate' and tasteless humour, as well as web proxies. Proxy services can be used to reveal the contents of blocked sites. The full list of sites is available from PC Pro's website. They also tried to visit 18 sites that shouldn’t be blocked, including support pages for physical and mental health issues, teen magazines and other inoffensive sites such as the BBC homepage. If one of these was blocked, it was considered a 'false-positive'. The total number of objectionable pages allowed through the filter, minus any false positives, determined the Filtering score PC Pro awarded to each package. They also awarded a Features score, representing the range and usefulness of features on offer; plus scores for Ease of Use and Value for Money. The overall score was an average of these, weighted towards filtering performance. He continued that it’s important to approach web filtering as only one aspect of a home internet strategy and that parents should also communicate with their children and warn them how to handle inappropriate content if they find it. 'It’s a good idea to have this conversation even if you do enforce a whitelist: kids are inquisitive, and while they may not run into transgressive material at home, they will experience it through friends and via personal mobile devices.' The PC Pro tests concentrated on PC-based filters but web filters can also be added to mobile devices.

"By . Ben Spencer . Myth? Scientists claim the myth that humans only use 10 per cent of their brains was made up by early psychologists . It is a concept that has been repeated so often that it has almost become accepted wisdom. But the old saying that human beings use only 10 per cent of their brains is actually a myth, scientists say. The fallacy forms the central concept in Scarlett Johansson’s forthcoming blockbuster, in which she plays a character who ‘learns’ to use her entire brain. Lucy, a sci-fi to be released next month, features Johansson using her newly discovered brainpower to develop lightning quick reflexes and even to control time. In the film, directed by Luc Besson, Morgan Freeman plays a neuroscientist who says: ‘It is estimated most human beings only use 10 per cent of the brain’s capacity. ‘Imagine if we could access 100 per cent. Interesting things begin to happen.’ But real-life neuroscientists are unimpressed. Barbara Sahakian, professor of clinical neuropsychology at the University of Cambridge, said the idea that we only use a small percentage of our brain ‘doesn’t make any sense’. The entire brain is active and in use all the time - the neurons, the nerve cells involved in thought - are always doing something. Different regions of the brain are used for different bodily functions, such as seeing, hearing, speaking and controlling muscles. The idea that 90 per cent of the brain is just unused does not stand up to analysis, Professor Sahakian said. She thinks the 10 per cent figure was simply plucked out of the air by early psychologists before it was famous in Dale Carnegie’s 1936 book, How to Win Friends and Influence People. Incorrect? The myth is the subject of a new Scarlett Johansson sci-fi thriller but scientists rebuke the idea . Sam Wang, a neuroscientist at Princeton University in the US, thinks the myth has been perpetuated by the self-help industry. People like to believe the 10 per cent myth so they can hope for self-improvement, he suggests, and the concept of working hard to ‘expand the mind’ is an attractive one. It is also a concept believed by 65 per cent of Americans, according to a survey last year by the Michael J ox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research - 5 per cent more than believe in evolution.","Myth that we only use part of brain 'doesn't make sense', scientists say .

Wearing a blue suit, tie and glasses, the convicted sex offender arrived at the North East Surrey Crematorium in Morden in a blacked-out white Renault van at around 2.15pm. Clifford, 71, was brought out from the van 300ft from the cemetery chapel in handcuffs, flanked by security guards, before walking indoors for the service. Scroll down for video . Thumbs-up: Max Clifford leaves his brother's funeral today in a prison van at North East Surrey Crematorium . Handcuffed: Max Clifford, pictured with his daughter Louise (right), was allowed out of prison today to attend his older brother's funeral at the North East Surrey Crematorium in Morden . Clifford is currently serving an . eight-year jail sentence after being found guilty at Southwark Crown . Court in central London in May of a series of indecent . assaults on victims as young as 15. His brother, . Bernard Clifford, died on Wednesday, August 6, and the funeral began at . 2.40pm. A group of security guards waited by the white van as other . guests arrived for the service. Clifford stood laughing and smiling with family and friends following the 30-minute service. The paedophile received hugs and kisses on the cheek from other guests. Clifford's . right hand was cuffed to a suit-wearing security guard as he spent 10 . minutes speaking with people outside the chapel. He shook hands with . guests using his left hand and appeared relaxed. Let out: Clifford, 71, is currently serving an eight-year jail sentence after being found guilty of indecent assaults . Getting out: A group of security guards waited by the white van as other guests arrived for the service . Security guards in prison uniform patrolled around the crowd as Clifford stood speaking with people. Smiling and waving to the other guests, he was then led back to the waiting prison van. Clifford then received a final hug by the vehicle from a woman. He stepped up into the back of the van, which was then driven off the site - but not before he gave photographers a thumbs-up. Clifford . - who is at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire - was jailed for the . indecent assaults carried out between 1977 and 1984, using his . celebrity connections to lure women. A . man who saw Clifford arrive at the service said: ‘I saw him come out of . the side of the van wearing handcuffs. There were a few big guys with . him. He went inside and is sat down in there now.’ Taken in: Wearing a blue suit, tie and glasses, Clifford was brought out from the van 300ft from the cemetery chapel in handcuffs, flanked by security guards, before walking indoors for the service . The . Ministry of Justice said it does not comment on individuals, but a . spokesman said prisoners need to apply to attend a funeral and the . prison assesses risk to the public. It . also looks at the prisoner's relationship to the dead person. If . permission is granted, the prisoner is normally escorted to the funeral . by staff. In a statement . handed out by his daughter Louise, Clifford wrote: ‘This is not the . right time or the right place to discuss my situation. ‘I . am here purely to pay my tribute to my brother Bernard, or Bunny, as I . always called him. Bernard always was to me the serious and political . one of the family. Outside: Clifford stood laughing and smiling with family and friends following the 30-minute service . ‘He was a kind and caring man who had strong views and opinions and always stood up to be counted. To me he was just a wonderful and caring brother and friend. ‘I am here because I naturally wanted to be and most importantly because Iris and all of the family asked me to be here. My attendance here today was allowed by the Governor of Littlehey Mr Taylor, for which I am very grateful.’ Bernard Clifford . was a former mayor of Merton and served on Merton Council as a Labour . councillor for the Ravensbury ward in Mitcham and Morden. He was said to have got his brother his first job in publishing as an editorial assistant at The Eagle. In the 40 minute service, during which Bernard Clifford was cremated, his wife Iris, and other relatives remembered his life. Simon and Garfunkel's Sound of Silence played as the coffin was lowered. Family: Clifford outside Southwark Crown Court with his daughter Louise, a month before his sentencing . Passing . sentence at London’s Southwark Crown Court, Judge Anthony . Leonard told Max Clifford his personality and position in the public eye . were the reasons his crimes were not revealed earlier. The . judge said that due to the historic nature of the offences, Clifford . was charged under an act from 1956, which set the maximum term for each . charge at two years. Under . later legislation passed in 2003, the maximum term would have been 10 . years, and for the worst instances would have been charged as rape or . assault by penetration, which attract a maximum life term. The . former celebrity agent, who branded his accusers ‘fantasists’, remained . defiant ahead of his sentencing, saying: ‘I stand by everything I have . said in the last 17 months.’ Clifford has lodged an appeal against his sentence. Max . Clifford, who was born to an electrician and former maid in 1943, . carved out a hugely successful career for himself prior to his arrest. Raised . in south London, he left school at 15-years-old with no qualifications . and quickly landed himself a job as a reporter on his local paper. It led to his first job in PR, which would help him become the country’s most infamous publicist over time. Disgraced PR Guru Max Clifford (pictured in 1992) was particularly well-known for his involvement in celebrity 'kiss-and-tell' stories for tabloid newspapers and represented a number of high-profile clients over the years . He . spent years building up his contacts book and soon his PR empire . represented a host of high-profile figures from Simon Cowell and Jade . Goody to Gary Glitter and Freddie Star. He . was particularly well-known for his involvement in ‘kiss-and-tell’ stories for tabloid newspapers and represented a number of clients . including Rebecca Loos – who alleged to have an affair with David . Beckham. With a £3million . mansion in Surrey’s stockbroker belt, homes in the Cotswolds and . Marbella and with a Rolls-Royce complete with a personal number plate . (100 Max), Clifford made the most of his £1million-a-year salary. However, . his career and reputation took a sudden downfall in December 2012 when . he was arrested by detectives from Operation Yewtree. He was charged the . following April with a string of indecent assaults. Clifford (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court earlier this year) was jailed for eight years for a string of indecent assaults between 1977 and 1984 . The . investigation, Scotland Yard's inquiry into historic allegations of . sexual offences, was prompted after claims were made against the late DJ . Jimmy Savile. After his arrest in 2012, Clifford was invited on to ITV’s Daybreak, where he claimed he was the victim of a ‘witch hunt’. Throughout the subsequent trial, he showed no ounce of remorse and regularly displayed a nonchalant and arrogant approach. He . was jailed for eight years at Southwark Crown Court in May after a jury . found him guilty of eight counts of indecent assault against teenage . girls and young women between 1977 and 1984. The . judge said that if the offences had taken place today – since . sentencing guidelines were toughened in 2003 – Clifford would have been . regarded as a multiple rapist for which he would have been locked up for . life. The maximum sentence for indecent assault at the time was two years. The . 71-year-old committed the offences after luring and 'degrading' women . through his celebrity connections during his high-profile career. Sentencing . Clifford, Judge Leonard said: 'The reason why they were not brought to . light sooner was because of your own dominant character and your . position in the world of entertainment which meant that your victims . thought that you were untouchable, something that I think you too . believed.' For Clifford’s . eight offences, the judge gave him a series of sentences of 12 months, . 18 months, 24 months, six months, 21 months and 15 months, some to run . concurrently and some consecutively, to arrive at a total of eight . years. He is now serving his . sentence at Category C Littlehey jail in Cambridgeshire and has lodged . an appeal to the Court of Appeal against his sentence.","Allowed out of prison to attend funeral at North East Surrey Crematorium .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Have you ever looked at photos of your partner's ex, or stalked their work colleagues on Facebook or Twitter? According to new research more than 80 per cent of us do this on a daily basis. The study, carried out by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, found the average Briton spends a total of 3.5 days a year looking at the profiles of strangers, a practice dubbed 'stranger stalking.' Men were found to most likely look at random profiles . of people they find attractive, whilst women were more likely to check . on potential new partners of their exes - and 14 per cent of Brits admitted to setting up fake profiles to check up on people anonymously. A study by VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, found 80% of people 'stranger stalk' online. Men were most likely to look at random profiles of attractive people, while women regularly checked new partners of exes. Some 14 per cent of Brits admitted to setting up fake profiles to check up on people anonymously . Checking up on ex-partner’s new love interests - 72 per cent . Browsing random profiles of attractive individuals - 64 per cent . Unknown friends and family of partner - 48 per cent . Work colleagues of partner - 27 per cent . Strangers with similar interests (found through Facebook groups or hashtag) - 19 per cent . The site polled a total of 2,704 UK adults - 1,336 females and 1,368 males - aged 18 and over on their specific social media habits whilst online. Over 80 per cent admitted they regularly looked at the profiles of strangers on sites including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Researchers then asked those taking part in the poll to name the various groups of individuals they would 'stranger stalk' via social media on a regular basis in the order of how often they did so. Checking up on an ex-partner’s new love interest came top with 72 per cent. Browsing random profiles of attractive individuals was second with 64 per cent, while half admitted browsing the profiles of unknown friends and family of their partner. Almost a third said they also look at the work colleagues of their boyfriend or girlfriend. In last place, 19 per cent of people said they looked at the accounts of strangers with similar interests, found through Facebook groups of hashtags, for example. Of the respondents who claimed they would check up on their ex-partner’s love interests, the majority, 66 per cent, were women. Furthermore, of those who said they browse random profiles of attractive people, men were almost three times as likely as women to be doing this on a regular basis.

A quarter of respondents confessed that through online views of attractive or similarly minded individuals, they had managed to form successful romantic relationships in real life . George Charles, spokesperson for VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, made the following comments on the results of the findings: . 'When first looking into this study, I must admit I didn’t expect the results to be quite so high, particularly when it came to those admitting they check their ex’s new partner profiles. 'Yet once one takes into account just how many romantic and platonic relationships are formed, and then finish online and over social media, it doesn’t seem as surprising.' 'I think just about everyone who has recently dealt with a break-up can appreciate how overwhelming the temptation can sometimes be not to spend hours and hours scouring the internet for information on how they are dealing with it. 'Having said that, it is of some concern that 14 per cent of respondents admitted to creating fake profiles in order to 'stranger stalk' on social media. I would strongly suggest some of those people log off their computers for now!'","The average Briton spends 14 minutes a day 'stranger stalking' online .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . James Wignall, 16, was left 'staggered' after police called at his home to speak with him about his skipping 'frightening' his neighbour's horses . A teenage boxing champion has been visited by police following claims he was scaring horses by skipping in the street. James Wignall said he was left 'staggered' after officers accused him of frightening his neighbour's horses as he trained in the country lane outside his home in Croston, near Chorley, Lancashire. The 16-year-old, who has won 14 of his 17 fights so far including a North West title, said: 'I thought it was a joke at first. Two officers came out - just for that.' The visit came on a Saturday evening - the busiest night of the week for Lancashire's police force. And it came just months after the constabulary confessed they were they were no longer attending certain categories of crime including 'routine' burglaries. Personal visits have now been replaced with telephone calls. James, who is back in full training after taking time out of the ring for his GCSEs, regularly spends up to 45 minutes exercising with the rope outside his front door. His mother Carol said: 'It is crazy. Surely the police have much better things to be doing on a Saturday night than chasing up a complaint like this. 'I couldn't believe it when I opened the door and they were standing there. It is not as if he is breaking the law.' James, whose last fight was a victory over Tyson Fury's cousin Walter, took to the street with his skipping rope because his garden is not big enough. He said: 'You need a hard surface - grass is no good. But I've been in the road skipping for years. It is not as if I just started. 'The horses were in a field opposite, behind a huge hedge. I wasn't aware I was spooking them. There are tractors thundering down this lane and they don't seem scared of those. 'I'm not making a lot of noise and, as far as I'm aware, it's not against the law because this is a public highway. The teenage boxing champion, who has won 14 of his 17 fights, said police were concerned that his skipping in the country lane by his house in Croston, near Chorley, Lancashire could scare horses in a nearby field . 'And it is not like I'm just messing about. I'm serious about my sport. I'm back in the ring in September and my ambition is to turn professional one day. 'First I'm hoping to box for England and then Great Britain.' Mrs Wignall added: 'James has been boxing since he was eight. He's been skipping in the street for all that time too. Then, completely out of the blue, we get a visit from two officers saying he's been upsetting the horses across the road. 'I just find it bizarre. He's a good boy and he is dedicated to his sport. It's not as if he's hanging around street corners at night.' A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'Two officers made a reassurance visit to the address. They spoke to both parties involved and no further police action was deemed necessary.'","James Wignall said he was 'staggered' when two officers attended his home .

"By . Kieran Corcoran for MailOnline . Convicted: Lucy Worthington, pictured above at court, sent 'sinister' messages to PC Christopher Stoddart and his wife . A disgraced detective convicted of harassing her ex-lover - who worked for the same force as her - has been sacked. Lucy Worthington, 28, sent a string of text messages, letters and voicemails to a fellow officer and his wife after the end of a six-month affair. She was dismissed for gross misconduct this week after a court found her guilty of two counts of harassment. At a later hearing she was fined £500 and for gross misconduct this week as she was told she had tarnished her 'impeccable' record. Worthington had been working as a detective constable at Wilmslow CID when she met PC Christopher Stoddart, who was married. Manchester Magistrates' Court heard how the pair began a sexual relationship in January 2012, which, ended when Worthington became pregnant. She then started sending PC Stoddart a text messages threatening to tell his wife Christine about the affair. After having the baby at the end of 2012, she later told PC Stoddart, 47, he was the father - a claim which was later disproved. She then turned her attentions to his wife and used a pay-as-you-go phone and anonymous online accounts to disguise where her 'sinister' messages were coming from. Describing the impact of the harassment on Mrs Stoddart, prosecutor Ruth Mann said: 'This had a devastating effect on her.' Worthington, Sandbach, Cheshire, was convicted of harassment earlier this month, and received her sentence this week. As well as the fine, she was made subject to a restraining order, which stipulates that she cannot contact either Mr or Mrs Stoddart, nor go near their home. Affair: Worthington, who was a detective, fell pregnant during her relationship with PC Stoddart - and falsely claimed he was the father of her child . Guilty: Worthington was convicted of two counts of harassment at Manchester Magistrates' Court . District Judge Mark Hadfield told her: 'This should not be taken as an indication that these offences are not serious - they are. 'Your behaviour involved various types of communication. 'You have lost your career, which you started shortly after leaving school and had had some success at.' Tim Ashmole, defending, said she had previously had an 'impeccable' record during her ten years with the police. After the hearing, a Cheshire Police spokeswoman said: 'Following an internal disciplinary hearing, Lucy Worthington has been dismissed without notice for gross misconduct.'","Former detective Lucy Worthington had affair with PC Christopher Stoddart .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . These touching pictures show baby chimpanzee Velu clinging to his mother for protection as he joins the rest of his family for the first time. With his fresh pink face, the eight-week-old and his mother Heleen were integrated into the Budongo Trail enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo today. The baby pure Western chimpanzee – an endangered species – is the first to be successfully reared in Scotland for 15 years. Eight-week-old baby Velu is pictured clinging to his mother Heleen (left) as he is welcomed at new enclosure . Heleen had been gradually integrated into the Budongo Trail enclosure at Edinburgh Zoo but today was the first time baby Velu met his 18 other family members, who are originally from a zoo in the Netherlands . He can be seen tentatively clinging to his mother while the rest of the chimps in his family’s complex hierarchy swung on ropes and scavenged for food, . Though small and relatively bald at the moment, Velu will soon have a head of dark, spiky hair – but will probably stay tiny for another five years. His mother Heleen is from a group of nine chimps who arrived at the zoo from the Netherlands in 2010. The Dutch chimpanzees originally started life in a research laboratory, then were rehomed to Beekse Bergen Safari Park before moving to Edinburgh, where they live in the Budongo Trail enclosure. After a shaky start, Heleen is said to be a ‘great mother’, grooming and protecting Velu who has been accepted by the other 18 chimps. There is some doubt over the paternity of Velu, but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the group, Louis or Rene, is the father and a test is due to be carried out in the future. Sophie Pearson, team leader at the Budongo Trail, said: ‘We are delighted with the arrival and successful integration of Velu into our chimpanzee group. ‘Still very young, Velu will look like a baby for another five years or so. He currently has a beautiful pale, pinky-coloured face which will darken as he gets older and has a mass of spiky hair. The baby pure Western chimpanzee – an endangered species – is the first to be successfully reared in Scotland for 15 years and while small and relatively bald Velu is expected to grow a mass of spiky hair . Doubts remain over the paternity of Velu, but zookeepers believe one of two senior males in the group - Louis or Rene - is his father. They will find out  when they do a paternity test, which is due to happen in the future . Heleen (pictured cradling baby Velu) had a tricky start but is said to be coping extremely well with motherhood and zookeepers say she is a ‘great mother’, grooming and protecting Velu who has been accepted by the group . ‘At Edinburgh Zoo we are extremely proud that Heleen is successfully raising Velu and that he has been accepted into the group. ‘Chimpanzees learn from experience - they see their mothers and other group members give birth and raise youngsters - but unfortunately we suspect that Heleen did not have this experience in the earlier part of her life. ‘However, after a tricky start, Heleen is coping extremely well and developing into a great mother - she is nursing, grooming and protecting her baby.’ Chimpanzee groups have a complex social hierarchy and can be a volatile species, so staff at the zoo had to take care when reintroducing Heleen and Velu to the group. Zookeepers intervened as little as they could but had to bottle-feed him in the first few days as Heleen (right) showed little interest in Velu (clinging to her) The birth has boosted Heleen’s status in the group and Velu will probably grow to inherit his mother’s ranking, the zoo said. ‘After the birth, we slowly integrated Heleen and her baby back into the main chimpanzee group - starting first with other females and her closest male allies, then building up to them both going back into the main group,’ Ms Pearson said. ‘This has been successful to date and, although chimpanzee babies are always vulnerable, we are confident Heleen is fully integrated back into the group and has a lot of support from her chimp friends. ‘Hand-rearing a chimpanzees has a huge impact on the individual as they are extremely intelligent with complex needs. A hand-reared chimp may, in fact, never fully be an independent chimp. ‘With this in mind, keepers intervened as little as possible - Velu had to be bottle-fed by keepers for a few days at the beginning of his life because Heleen put him down and showed little interest in caring for him herself. ‘However, he was never out of Heleen’s sight and she was able to watch him being fed until she decided she wanted to take him back, which she did, to everyone’s delight.’ Chimpanzees are found in the rainforests of west and central Africa and staff at Edinburgh Zoo have tried to recreate the habit in the Budongo Trail enclosure. It features three pods which vary in degrees of temperature, light and humidity to reflect different conditions of the rainforest. ‘Chimpanzee babies are absolutely gorgeous and the great thing about them from a visitor’s point of view is that they stay babyish for a very long time,’ Ms Pearson said. ‘A baby chimp doesn’t really start growing up until they are five years old, so he’ll be on his mother’s back and be very playful and look cute for several years.’","Eight-week-old baby Velu and his mother Heleen joined rest of family today .

"By . Alex Lazcano For Daily Mail Australia . Sometimes love is just matter of timing - just ask this New Zealand couple. Mark Trenberth realised his dream to become engaged to his girlfriend during a reverse bungy ride in Auckland on Saturday but there was just one problem - she beat him to the punch. Unaware that her boyfriend was preparing to propose when the ride was over, Katrina Genefaas popped the question herself while the bungy was in motion. Love is in the air, as pair separately propose to each other on reverse bungy. Ms Genefaas could not believe that her boyfriend Mark Trenberth had the same thought of proposing on a thrill ride. Looking slightly nervous Ms Genefaas turns to her boyfriend and says, 'Babe, you know I love you, and you know I'd do anything with you ... Will you marry me?' The look of shock is clear on the New Zealand man's face who cheekily replies 'No' as he giggles and pulls out his own engagement ring. And not to be trumped - he proposes back. 'She took it out of my mouth, really,' Mr Trenberth told The New Zealand Herald. 'I said 'no' at the start because I was shocked. I wasn't expecting it.' 'I was really, really, really scared about doing the bungy and what we said to each other was pretty lame,' Ms Genefaas said. The New Zealand couple were engaged on August 16 on on a reverse bungy in Auckland, New Zealand. The 27-year-old service manager of City Autos Limited had planned his proposal for earlier when the couple were snowboarding. 'I was going to go ahead and go down on my knees and get her to stop in front of me. But she couldn't learn to stop, so I missed out on that one,' he said. Ms Genefaas parents had received phone calls about each person's proposal plans and managed to keep their lips sealed. 'They did really well,' the bride-to-be said of her parents, who were babysitting the newly engaged couples son while the pair got engaged.

A 12-year-old boy was six hours from death when a blister on his foot became infected and sent him into toxic shock after he wore shoes without socks. Family members prepared to say goodbye to Macenzie Campbell after his organs began to fail and his body shut down. His mother Joanne, 38, thought the potentially fatal infection started from a verruca and had applied a treatment, but the next day his foot had swollen and a red rash spread all over his body. She rushed him to a doctor, as his temperature soared, and he was immediately admitted to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Staff warned him he may not survive and he phoned family members to say his goodbyes after the rash began turning black and his organs started shutting down. The schoolboy said: ‘It was terrifying. 'I wasn’t only scared for myself, I was scared for my family. 'It had seemed like a normal blister, but I gradually started to feel worse and worse. ‘I felt sick, everything was blurry and my heart was racing. I didn’t know what was going on.’ His grandmother, Kate Campbell, said: ‘We thought we were going to lose him. 'He was ringing all of us in case he didn’t make it. ‘We were told afterwards he was only a few hours from death. 'The sepsis was gradually shutting his body down.

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . The Selters bottle was found corked aboard the shipwreck  and tests revealed it contained alcohol . The world's oldest bottle of mineral water discovered on board a recovered shipwreck from the bottom of the Baltic Sea had been refilled with alcohol - and it's still perfectly safe to drink. The sealed 200-year-old  'Selters' water stoneware was found by researchers exploring the F-53-31 shipwreck in Gdańsk Bay, near the Polish coast in June. It was submitted for testing to uncover whether it contained original Selters water and preliminary analysis found it had a 14-per cent alcohol distillate – which could be vodka or gin diluted with water. Selters is a supplier of high-quality carbonated water, first discovered about 1,000 years ago in the Taunus Mountains area in Germany. It was one of the oldest types of mineral water in Europe, with many claiming that a few sips of the water, also known as 'fluid treasure', can boost strength and health. Tomasz Berdnarz, an underwater archaeologist from the National Maritime Museum, led the search on the shipwreck. He said: ‘The bottle dates back to the period of 1806 to 1830 and has been recovered during the works on the F-53-31 shipwreck, or the so-called Glazik – which means small rock in Polish’. The 12 inch (30cm) flask is believed to have been manufactured in Ranschbach, Germany - about 25 miles away from the Selters water spring. The bottle and its contents were sent to the J.S. Hamilton chemical laboratory in Gdynia, Poland at the beginning of July and the final results are expected to be completed early next month. Mr Berdnarz told Poland’s Ministry of Science and Science Education: ‘This means it would not cause poisoning. Apparently, however, it does not smell particularly good’. The springs of this mineral water went dry in the beginning of the 19th century and the characteristic stoneware bottles became rationed goods. In 1896, a group of enthusiasts from Selters organised a quest in order to find springs of the legendary water. Nowadays it is sold as a luxury product, with glass bottles replacing the original stoneware ones, but the water quality is believed to be the same as it was when the water was first discovered. Researchers also found fragments of ceramics, a small bowl, a few pieces of dinnerware, stones and rocks. Scroll down for video .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Growth: Support for a 'Yes' vote in the Scottish referendum has risen by four percentage points in the past month, despite fears that Alex Salmond's policy on currency is 'unconvincing' Support for a 'Yes' vote in the forthcoming Scottish referendum has risen by four percentage points in the past month, despite fears that Alex Salmond's policy on currency is 'unconvincing'. The Scottish National Party leader favours a formal currency union with the rest of the UK, but has failed to tell voters what would happen if Westminster refuses to allow an independent Scotland to keep the pound. However, new opinion polls published one month before voters in Scotland cast their vote on September 18 have shown that support for independence is growing. With just weeks to go until the referendum, both polls showed that a majority of decided voters want Scotland to stay within the UK alongside England, Wales and Northern Ireland. But there is an increasing amount of support for the Yes campaign, and the still-undecided voters hold the balance. A poll for the Scotland on Sunday . newspaper put support for UK membership at 47 percent, up 2 points; . support for independence at 38 percent, up 4 points; and undecided . voters at 15 percent. 'Yes is continuing to gain ground and success on 18 September is within Scotland’s reach,' Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland told Scotland on Sunday. 'The . poll also shows that among those who were undecided last month and have . now made up their minds, they have come to Yes by a margin of two to . one.' Mr Salmond has faced criticism over his plans to keep the pound and during his televised debate with Alistair Darling, the leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, failed to answer questions on what his 'Plan B' for the country's currency would be. The . First Minister has said dropping the pound 'implies settling for what's . second best' - and insists there will be a deal on a currency . union with the rest of the UK. He has also reiterated his threat to refuse to pay Scotland's . share of the national debt if he is barred from using the pound. The UK Government and the main Westminster parties have already ruled out Scotland being allowed to continue to use the Bank of England as its . central bank. Alternatives to a currency agreement would be a separate Scottish . currency – either pegged to the pound or with a flexible exchange rate - . joining the euro, or using the pound unilaterally in the way that East . Timor and Panama use the U.S. dollar. Video courtesy of Yes Scotland . Questions: Salmond has faced criticism for plans to keep the pound and during his televised debate with Alistair Darling, the leader of the pro-UK Better Together campaign, failed to answer questions on what his 'Plan B' for the currency would be . In the Scotland on Sunday poll, more than half of the 1,005 adults questioned (52 per cent) said they thought the Scottish Government's currency plans were 'unconvincing', while a further 22 per cent said they were undecided. And just 19 per cent of those quizzed said they believed Mr Salmond had won the debate held earlier this month, with 42 per cent saying Mr Darling had emerged the victor. 'With just two weeks to go until up to a . million people cast their referendum vote by post, people are realising . that Alex Salmond and the SNP cannot even answer basic questions like . what currency we would use if we walked away from the UK,' said a Better Together spokesman. Another . survey commissioned by the pro-independence campaign found 46 percent . support for the UK, 42 percent for independence, and 12 percent . undecided. Both polls had error margins of three percentage points. After the long-running referendum . campaign, Scots will finally go to the polls next month to answer . the question, 'Should Scotland be an independent country?' Uncertainty: Labour MP Jim Murphy highlights Mr Salmond's unwillingness to give details of what could happen if Scotland is unable to keep the pound with this Better Together poster . The . Yes campaign, led primarily by the Scottish National Party, believes the . nation would be strengthened by independence, but the UK government is . opposed to the breakaway. Turnout in the historic ballot is . widely expected to be high and it has been suggested by Mr Salmond that as many of 80 per . cent of those registered to vote will choose to do so. Pope Francis, Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Li Keqiang and more than 200 public figures from the arts and media, including Mick Jagger and Eddie Izzard, have also previously made comments widely seen in support of the Better Together campaign, while earlier this year, Barack Obama said he wanted to see the UK remain 'strong, robust and united' during a joint news conference with David Cameron at the G7 in Brussels. Yes campaigners claimed Mr Cameron was involved and said it showed the 'growing desperation' of the pro-Union campaign. Harry Potter author JK Rowling also donated £1million to the Better Together campaign against independence, while earlier this month, more than 200 public figures from sport, cinema, television and literature wrote an open letter to the people of Scotland in advance of next month’s referendum which says: 'Let’s stay together'. Among those who signed the letter were Sir Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench and Stephen Hawking. Meanwhile, those who have come out in favour of separating as a new country include Sir Sean Connery, comedians Kevin Bridges and Russell Brand and actor Brian Cox.","Majority of decided voters still want Scotland to stay in the UK .

The cat, which vets have renamed Dribbler, was brought in as a stray by a woman who found him looking thin and hungry in her garden in Lichfield, Staffordshire - but a microchip revealed he was registered in Spain. Vets still have no idea how the intrepid cat was able to make his trip across Spain, France and the English channel - a journey which would take 24 hours to drive. Scroll down for video . A perfect mystery: Vets in Lichfield have no idea how Dribbler managed to make his way across Spain, France and the English Channel - a journey which would take 24 hours to drive . Feeling better: The woman who found Dribbler said that he looked thin and hungry when she saw him in her garden in Lichfield Staffordshire. He is now fit and healthy again after a month of care . The black-and-white cat, which always drools slightly, was taken to Pool House Veterinary Surgery in Lichfield, where a scan of his microchip revealed that he had come from Spain, though vets were unable to trace an exact address. Emma Wood, a nurse at the practice, said: 'We have absolutely no idea how Dribbler got to England. 'He was dropped off by a member of the public who found him in their garden and said he looked a bit thin. 'We've checked his microchip which is registered in Spain but there is no way of knowing who he belongs to. 'He's got a blue velvet collar on but there are no contact details on there either.' The cat, believed to be 10 years old, has . been given his new name as an old jaw injury means he can't stop . dribbling when it comes close to mealtimes. Plenty of cuddles: Veterinary nurse Emma Wood, pictured left with veterinary surgeon Katie Dow,  said that Dribbler is still a 'really friendly feline' - even after his 1,500-mile trip from his home in Spain . Ready to eat: An old jaw injury means that Dribbler's mouth hangs open slightly and leaves him with a little patch of drool on his chin - especially when he gets hungry before mealtimes . It is thought that it was injured in a car accident that left it with a . fractured jaw which vets believe was never properly treated. Despite the injury, the intrepid cat hasn't been put off his food and is now back to full health after being cared for almost a month. Ms Wood said: 'He doesn't seem to be in pain with his mouth. He still eats a lot and it is quite cute when he gets excited before meal times and starts drooling. 'After all he's been through, he's still a really friendly feline. All he wants is cuddles.'","Cat was found looking thin and hungry in a garden in Lichfield, Staffordshire .

Wildfox has taken on the Eighties vibe with its eight-piece collection, launching November 15. And Lord & Taylor will launch a 12-piece line of Barbie-themed sleepwear inspired by the Fifties and Sixties era on November 14. 'What we’re trying to focus on is that Barbie is a brand much bigger than an 11-inch fashion doll,' Mattel's senior vice president Jessica Dunne told WWD, adding that it's all part of the brand's mission to re-establish Barbie is a modern day fashion icon. Never a doll moment: Mattel has partnered up with Forever 21, Wildfox (pictured, its Eighties bikini) and Lord & Taylor to launch three collections, all inspired by items from Barbie's wardrobe throughout the ages . Forever 21's line encompasses sportswear, outerwear, cosmetics and accessories; and boasts acid pinks and bold graphic designs; priced between $3.90 and $24.90.

"By . Naomi Greenaway . Could switching on the TV prevent you from switching off? After a long, stressful day at work, kicking back in front of the TV might seem like the best way to unwind. But a new study found that rather than helping us relax, watching TV can make us feel more worse than when we started. The study, by researchers at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Germany, and VU University Amsterdam, found that people who had high stress levels after work and watched TV or played video games didn't feel relaxed or recovered, but instead had high levels of guilt and feelings of failure. The study, titled 'The Guilty Couch Potato', surveyed 471 participants about how they felt after work and what media they had use to unwind. They found that people who were particularly tired after work showed a higher tendency to feel they had 'succumbed to their desire' when describing their TV or gaming use. This group of people also reported that their TV watching had prevented them 'taking care of more important tasks'. In other words, instead of taking enjoyment from switching on the box or playing games, this hard-working bunch felt guilty about it. 'These feelings of guilt diminished the positive effects of media use and reduced recovery and vitality after media use,' reports the study, which has recently been published in the Journal of Communication. The results also found a surprising paradox: people who were most exhausted and therefore could have benefited most from relaxing in front of the TV, actually benefited least because they felt most guilty and took their TV habit as a sign of their own self-control failure. This research sheds new light on the effects TV and gaming. Previous studies have found that this sort of media use helps us to detach from work stress and to relax. Research has also found that winning in a computer game or watching a thought-provoking movie gives people a feeling of control during leisure time, which in turn makes them feel more energized and can even increase cognitive performance. Leonard Reinecke, one of 'The Guilty Couch Potato' authors says of their findings, 'It demonstrates that in real life, the relationship between media use and well-being is complicated and that the use of media may conflict with other, less pleasurable but more important duties and goals in everyday life.' So next time you're heading for the couch after work, think before you flick.

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . As one of the quieter members of Atomic Kitten, Natasha Hamilton doesn't usually hit the headlines. But the claim that the pregnant singer is planning on eating her own placenta after giving birth to her fourth child later this year is guaranteed to catch a few people's attention. Natasha, 32, is expecting her first daughter with 5IVE singer Ritchie Neville, 34, and after being told about the supposed health benefits, has decided she will get the body part made into pills to eat after the birth. Scroll down for video . Natasha Hamilton, 32, is planning on eating the placenta of her fourth child after she gives birth . In a blog for BabyCentre, the star said: 'I initially felt pretty squeamish about it all, but once I heard the benefits for the mum I really wanted to do it. 'For those of you who haven’t heard about it, it is where your placenta is taken away after birth, it’s dehydrated and ground into a coarse powder and then placed into small capsules to be taken as a daily supplement. 'I was told this would help replace lost hormones more quickly, help to fight against post-natal depression (PND) and also boosts milk supply. 'The messy, gross side is taken away and you are given a daily vitamin, this appealed to me far more than adding raw placenta to a smoothie to be honest. The star,  pictured here with her three sons (pictured from left to right: Alfie, Harry and Josh claims to have suffered from severe Post Natal Depression in a previous pregnancy . 'And I didn’t fancy bringing my own placenta home in a Tupperware box and having to dry it out and chop it up myself! 'As I’ve suffered with severe PND in the past and struggled with getting a good milk supply, I will take anything harmless if it prevents me getting PND again.' The star isn't alone - actresses January Jones and Alicia Silverstone has both admitted to eating their placenta after giving birth. In good company: Natasha isn't the only celeb to be interested in eating placenta, both January Jones (left) and Alicia Silverstone  (right) also consumed it in pill form after the births of their children . Alicia said earlier this year: 'Someone gifted me my placenta in the form of a pill, they encapsulate it. 'I thought that's harmless, I'll try it. 'And I have to tell you that I really loved it."" 'I've got to the point that my husband said: ""Did you have your happy pills today?'' 'And I was really sad when they were gone, it really helped me' But the practice could soon be forbidden under new rules from the European Food Safety Authority, something that Natasha Hamilton is campaigning against. She wrote in her blog: 'The EFSA  is trying to class it as a “novel food” and in the process taking away our rights to nourish ourselves with something that has come from our own body. 'I was appalled. I understand that there are hygiene issues, but surely these companies that agree to take them away are fully aware of how to store a placenta? 'I have followed this story closely and signed a petition with change.org that IPEN have issued along with a lengthy dossier to the EFSA and they are now awaiting a response on their final decision.'","Natasha, 32, is pregnant with her fourth child .

"By . Bianca London . You've heard about the Protein Princesses - women working out . multiple times per week - but there's a new breed of gym bunnies giving the likes of fitness fanatic Millie Mackintosh a run for her money. Middle-aged men are forging a new unofficial cult of gym-goers being dubbed MAMILs (middle aged men in lycra), who are becoming obsessed with going to the gym to bulk up. This breed of over 40s now represent more than one in ten of the nation’s bodybuilders and they're inspired by muscular role models . including Hugh Jackman, 45, Gerard Butler, 44, and current ‘Hercules’ actor, 42-year-old . Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson. Scroll down for video . Is he the MAMIL posterboy? Hugh Jackman, who stars as Wolverine, has inspired a new breed of over 40s who love to bulk up at the gym . A new survey of over 2,000 people who work out regularly found that 40-somethings are the fastest growing age group of people who have taken up bodybuilding in the last 12 months. These so-called MAMILs are taking up bodybuilding partly to battle the onset of middle-aged spread (76 per cent), but also as a way to improve their long-term health (66 per cent). Just under a quarter (23 per cent) say they have taken up bodybuilding as a way to improve their performance in other sports. The survey also revealed that over a . third (36 per cent) of these men take daily work out supplements, such . as protein shakes, to maximise the effectiveness of their workout. Buff Butler: A new survey found that 40-somethings are the fastest growing age group of people who have taken up bodybuilding in the last 12 months and they want to look like Gerard Butler, left . Hugh Jackman, who will reprise his role as Wolverine in Days Of Future Past, told the June issue of Men’s Health about how he prepped before stripping off. The 45-year-old works out all the time, and it seems he upped the ante before showing off his hunky body in all its glory. He told . them: ‘It’s interesting. I’ve been fascinated myself that I don’t want . to completely do nothing. This morning, including this [photoshoot], . I’ve trained twice. ‘I’m . betting that for the next five or 10 years, I’ll still get asked to do . stuff where I have to be physical. It’s tempting to just go and do yoga, . or swim, or play tennis. But being skinny, I’ll lose the muscle like . that. I know how hard it is to get back.’ Bulking out: The survey also revealed that over a third of these men take daily work out supplements, such as protein shakes, to maximise the effectiveness of their workout and look like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, left . Hugh added: ‘And by the way, it’s harder . at 45 than it was at 30. Even now, I’m noticing the weight starting to . go down. You have to work hard. It sucks.’ Patrick Dempsey, 47, is also an avid gym goer and lifts weights every week, as well as cycling most places. He's frequently spotted riding, and told Men's Health that he likes to get in about 100 miles a week. A spokesperson for Bodybuilding Warehouse, who commissioned the survey, said: 'It’s great to see that men aged 40 and above are not viewing their age as an excuse to slow down, but as an extra motivation to look after their fitness and overall well-being. 'Working out four times a week or more is an excellent way to maintain health, prevent middle age spread and maintain a positive mental attitude.' Fit over forty: Matt Damon, 43, left in 2014 film Elysium, and 62-year-old Liam Neeson, right, stay fit over forty . Health, Physique Transformation and Sports Conditioning Specialist Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health & Performance, said: ‘It’s brilliant that more and more men over 40 enjoy looking, moving, feeling and performing at their best by exercising regularly. The benefits are wide-ranging and unequivocally backed by science. Here are my top 4 benefits of regular exercise for men over 40. 'Regular exercise increases sexual drive, activity and satisfaction. Physical endurance and muscle tone improve sexual function and exercise jump-starts the sympathetic nervous system, which increases blood flow down-below to keep your ‘equipment’ working properly. Short bouts of intense exercise increase testosterone, which stimulates sexual desire. For example, men over 50 who work out regularly have a 30 per cent lower risk of impotence than those who don't. 'Plus, most people lose 10% of their aerobic capacity each year after the age of 30. However, men who work out regularly have more energy, strength and endurance than non-exercisers. 'Exercising reduces stress and anxiety by diminishing electrical activity in tense muscles, which makes you less hyperactive and jittery. Moreover, your body releases endorphins after you work out which boost your mood and promote relaxation. 'The best reason of all to work out regularly is that it reduces your risk of many serious and potentially deadly diseases, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, colon cancer, stroke, heart attack, and arthritis. Video Source YouTube . Rich Sturla shares his top tips... Rich Sturla, Owner and Director of Personal Training at Results Health and Performance . Maintain a High Protein Intake - As you age, your ability to digest protein gradually declines, requiring a higher protein intake than you needed when you were younger. Choose the Right Activities - Find training movements and/or sports that you can do safely, and ideally, succeed at. Switch to using a Buffalo Bar for Squats and Close-Grip or Neutral-Grip Bench Presses instead of wider grips. Reset Your Expectations - Base your expectations on your current status and rate of progress, not on what you did ‘back in the day’. Sure, always try to beat last year's personal records, but what really counts is what you can do currently. Restore Optimal Testosterone Levels - Short bouts of high intensity exercise increase testosterone, which has profound effects on energy, recovery, body composition, and overall mood. For the older man, developments in the pharmaceutical field are accelerating at pace here. I'm referring to the increasing use of Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT), which is legal, medically supervised, safe, and a lot easier to do than most guys think. Take counsel from an expert in this field before pursuing this route. Ruthlessly Maximize Training Economy - As we age, it takes longer to recover from workouts and it also takes longer for injuries to heal. Instead of thinking, ‘What else could I do?’ think, ‘Will I really benefit from doing this?’ Make sure that the exercises you choose are safe, effective, and not redundant. Specialize, But Don't Be ‘Bad’ At Anything - As an older exercise enthusiast, you shouldn't let any physical quality or capacity erode to ‘bad’ levels. Even if you can Deadlift 200kg, it is unacceptable to get winded after climbing a few flights of stairs, or to be unable to touch your toes while maintaining a good back position. If you allow yourself to think or say anything that ends with ‘...for my age’, stop. Don't miss my point - if you’re 40-plus, your body isn't the same as it was in your 20's. It's most certainly different, but not entirely in a bad way. In most respects many can be fitter and more capable than ever. Prime Yourself to Train - Perform a dynamic mobility warm-up before you train to reduce aches and pains, lengthen typically tight areas and strengthen classically weak areas to prime your body to train. Use this Foam Roller Self-Myofascial Release routine (see video above) to release tension and restore muscle tissue quality across your entire body. Then, perform either of these Two Dynamic Mobility Warm Up routines (see second and third video) before your main workout for peak performance.","Men over 40 love getting bulked out at the gym .

It made a bizarre spectacle as women clad in expensive ball gowns lifted their skirts and ran into the waves as regular swimmers gawked at the debauchery. And men ripped off their bow ties and cummerbunds and threw top hats in the air as they ran full pelt into the water.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Horrific: A 14-year-old girl was walking through a park shortly before 9pm when a boy, 15, pounced on her leaving her unconscious (file image) A 16-year-old boy has been jailed for beating and raping a 14-year-old girl so severely that she was left in a wheelchair with the brain capacity of an eight-year-old. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pounced on the schoolgirl as she walked through a park shortly after 9pm. He hit her with a bottle, kicked her and raped her, leaving her unconscious. The girl was taken to Addenbrookes' Hospital in Cambridge with severe head injuries and at the time she was not expected to survive. After three major brain operations, she has recovered but now has a mental age of eight and uses a wheelchair. Luton Crown Court heard the boy, aged 15 at the time, repeatedly hit the girl on the head with a bottle while kicking her. Pleading guilty to rape and grievous bodily harm with intent, he was sentenced to a discretionary life sentence at Luton Crown Court on Friday. He will serve a minimum of six and a half years in a young offenders unit. Judge Michael Kay said: 'Even the most case-hardened judge can be confronted with a set of facts that still have the capability to shock. This is one such case.' Describing his actions as 'sickening and abhorrent', the judge told the teenager: 'I predict you will spend considerably longer in custody than the minimum term.' Emergency services were called to the park shortly before 9pm on January 19 after the girl was found unconscious. Prosecutor Beverly Cripps told the court the boy was armed with a knife when the pair met in the park. Soon after he carried out the 'ferocious' attack. After beating her he dragged her to a quiet area of the park before raping her, she said. The boy - who was known to his victim - then took her mobile phone to make it look as though she had been mugged, the court was told. Sentenced: The judge at Luton Crown Court branded the boy 'abhorrent' as he handed him a life sentence . Detective Inspector John Arthur, of the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'Due to the thorough investigation the boy had no option but to confess his guilt. 'The young victim was known to him and he left her unconscious in a cold dark park after violently assaulting her. 'The boy's behaviour on that night leaves me in no doubt that he is an extremely dangerous person.' 'The victim will need constant care and she will always need her family's support due to the injuries she has suffered but I hope that today's sentencing will go some way in helping them start to look forward.'","16-year-old boy, then 15, pounced on girl in a park in Luton, Bedfordshire .

Scary: German Rolf Buchholz, 55, holds the Guinness World Record for the most piercings. But his appearance apparently put the wind up Dubai airport officials who barred him entry as they thought practised the dark arts . Mr Buchholz, who has 453 piercings, 278 of which are around his genitalia, had his passport stamped and approved at the airport, but was stopped before entering customs. He later tweeted: 'The immigration thought I am black magic. Stupid people.' [sic] and conceded that his appearance may have had something to do with it. 'I have two horns. I think that was also a problem for me in Dubai,' he said. As a result, the IT expert's scheduled appearance at the Cirque le Soir nightclub in Dubai's Fairmont Hotel on Friday was cancelled. The club opened in 2011 and promises a little bit of everything: 'Stilt walkers, midgets, contortionists, tattooed dancers, jugglers, drummers ... magicians and fire eaters,' according to its website. Alcohol flows freely in Dubai bars and clubs, which are typically attached to hotels, and revellers dress just as chicly and skimpily as they would in the West. But while Dubai is far more laid-back than nearby Saudi Arabia or Qatar, traditional Islamic values remain strong, particularly among members of the local population who are far outnumbered by foreign residents. Mr Buchholz was due to perform at the Cirque le Soir nightclub before he was barred entry to the Islamic city . Actions deemed insulting to local values, including public displays of affection, public intoxication and disrespect for religion, can lead to fines and jail time. Jad Lahoud, the executive director of Pragma Lifestyle, the company that runs the Dubai branch of the club, said in a statement that it was 'a shame that Rolf couldn't join us this time.' 'Cirque le Soir Dubai always strives to bring unique entertainment and concepts to the UAE, however we will always act in line with the laws that govern this nation,' he added. Buchholz tweeted shortly after he was ordered to leave that he would never come back to Dubai. But by Sunday, he seemed to be reconsidering. He said he would be happy to return if he had government assurance he'd be let in. Rolf Buchholz, who has 453 piercings and two horns, said he hoped he would be let into Dubai in the future .","Rolf Buchholz holds the Guinness World Record for the most piercings .

"By . Damien Gayle for MailOnline . and Associated Press . The Pope sheepishly asked thousands of nuns and priests to skip their vespers today after he run behind schedule on a busy day touring South Korea. Francis had three consecutive meetings in Kkottognae, a religious community which cares for disabled people, but by the time he hit the second, he was running out of time. 'I've got a little problem,' he told the crowd of 5,000 nuns and priests who had come to see him give a vespers service in Latin and Korean. Scroll down for video . Never skip your prayers... unless the Pope tells you to: The Pope sheepishly asked thousands of nuns and priests to skip their vespers today after he run behind schedule on a busy day touring South Korea . 'If there's one thing you should never do, it's skip your prayers, but today we'll have to do it and I'll tell you why: I came by helicopter, and if we don't take off in time, there's a danger we might smash into a mountain.' Thankfully for Francis, the crowd erupted in laughter once his apologies in Italian were translated into Korean. The Pope had already today celebrated a Mass before about 800,000 people in Seoul, during which he beatified 124 Korean martyrs. He told the hordes of Catholics who turned out for his open-air Mass that their ancestors' willingness to die rather than renounce their faith two centuries ago was a model for Asian missionaries today. The streets leading up to Seoul's iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with Koreans honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church here in the 18th century. Pope Francis swings a thurible as he takes part in an open-air mass at Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul where beatified 124 early Korean martyrs in front of a massive crowd that the Vatican estimated at 800,000 . The streets leading up to Seoul's iconic Gwanghwamun Gate were packed with hordes of Korean Catholics honoring the lay Catholics who founded the church in the country during the 18th century . Korea's church is unique in that it was founded not by foreign missionary priests - as occurred in most of the world - but by members of Korea's own noble classes who learned of Christianity by reading books about it. These early Catholics were killed in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Joseon Dynasty, which tried to shut the Korean Peninsula off from Western influence. Police in Seoul declined to give an estimate of the crowd size, but the Vatican said about 800,000 people had turned out. The number was significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Korea's 50 million people. The Mass kicked off a busy day for Francis as he passed the halfway mark of his five-day South Korea visit. Later he travelled to Kkottognae and prayed briefly at a monument to aborted babies. It was a strong albeit silent gesture from a pope who prefers to stress other aspects of church teaching rather than emphasize hot-button 'culture war' issues like abortion. The Mass in Seoul, though, was one of the highlights of his trip, providing Francis with an opportunity to stress how the lessons of Korea's early martyrs were relevant today for Korea's church, which is small but growing and is seen as a model for the rest of the world. 'They were willing to make great sacrifices and let themselves be stripped of whatever kept them from Christ - possessions and land, prestige and honour - for they knew that Christ alone was their true treasure,' he said. 'They challenge us to think about what, if anything, we ourselves would be willing to die for.' Pope Francis rides the popemobile, through the crowds towards the Gwanghwamun Gate . The numbers who turned out to see the Pope were significant given that Catholics represent only about 10 percent of South Korea's 50 million people . Francis praised in particular the fact that laypeople were so crucial to the church's foundation and growth in Korea - a theme he stressed later in the day when he met with leaders of Korean lay movements. The church is counting on such laymen and laywomen to spread the faith in Asia, which the Vatican considers the future of the church. The main reason for Francis' visit to South Korea, in fact, was to attend an Asian Catholic youth festival; the church sees such rallies as a crucial way of inspiring the next generation of Catholics to evangelise. 'Today as ever, the church needs credible lay witnesses to the saving truth of the Gospel,' Francis said, stressing in particular the need for their outreach to focus on the poor and most marginalized. A collective cheer erupted from the masses when Francis declared the 124 'blessed' - the first step toward possible sainthood. Many of the women in the crowd wore lace veils; others sported paper sun visors with 'Papa Francesco' written across them, protecting them from the overcast, hazy skies. The scene was impressive, with thousands of people neatly packed into fenced-in sections leading away from the altar, which was set up in front of Gwanghwamun, the south gate to Gyeongbokgung palace, with mountains looming above and the presidential Blue House on the lower slope. Police in green vests stood guard along the barricades and volunteers handed out water to guard against the warm, humid temperatures. A child looks away in terror as the Pope strokes her head while riding through the crowds in Seoul . Worshippers hold prayer beads as they attend the mass lead by Pope Francis at Gwanghwamun Square . 'I'm so thankful that the pope visited South Korea,' said 75-year-old Yu Pil-sang, a Catholic who was trying to get a glimpse of Francis just outside the police barricades. 'But I'm so sorry that all the ways to see the pope are blocked. I came to hear at least his voice.' En route to the altar before Mass, Francis stopped his open-topped car so he could get out and bless a group of families who lost loved ones in the sinking of the Sewol ferry in April, in which more than 300 people, most of them high school students, were killed. On his white cassock, Francis wore a yellow ribbon given to him by the families a day earlier when he met with them privately to try to console them. 'We want the truth,' read a yellow banner, a reference to the families' demands for an independent inquiry into the sinking. Officials said 400 families had been invited to the Mass. The main figure in the group that was beatified is Paul Yun Ji-Chung, who was born in 1759 and was among the earliest Catholics on the peninsula. He was beheaded in 1791 - the first Korean martyr - after he violated the traditional Confucian funeral rites for his mother. In all, the Joseon Dynasty killed about 10,000 Catholics for refusing to renounce their faith. Pope Francis prays as he arrives at the martyrs' shrine at Seosomun in Seoul, the place where in the 18th and 19th century unrepentant Catholics were publicly executed . Historians say Korea's early believers were struck by the idea of a religion that preached universal equality in divine eyes at a time when the nobility's discriminatory hierarchical system brutally exploited ordinary people. St. John Paul II canonized another 103 martyrs during a visit to South Korea in 1984. Francis began his day by praying at a monument in Seoul commemorating the martyrs on the site where many of them were killed. Even non-Catholics turned out for the Mass, impressed by Francis' humble gestures and call for South Koreans to pay more attention to the poor than their own material gain. 'I do not know much about Catholics and South Korea's Catholic history, but it seems that the pope is making sure to reach out equally to everyone,' said Eom Yae-sung, 49, a Protestant who said Francis had inspired her to make changes in her own life. 'I plan to do volunteering and a lot of sharing so that when I look back at my life 10 years from now, I will think that the pope's visit motivated me to change,' Eom said.","Pope holds up Korean martyrs as models for church's expansion in Asia .

A spokesman said: 'There are 19 flood alerts in place, meaning flooding is possible. 'High spring tides continue today, bringing a risk of wave overtopping and spray in places, particularly when strong gusts of wind coincide with the time of high tides. 'Over the last week Environment Agency teams have been out on the ground, ensuring coastal flood defences are ready, rivers can flow freely and clearing trash screens. 'Since August 11 we've received reports of 15 properties flooded from coastal flooding. We will continue to support local councils as they respond to surface water flooding.'

Braving the rain: Many people had to embrace the sudden downpours after getting caught out in the bad weather as they went about their day in Durham city centre . Temperatures are expected to plunge across the country next week with cold air from Scandinavia causing chilly winds and pushing the mercury close to freezing. The Met Office said the mercury could drop as low as 2C (35.6F) in Scotland by Monday with the rest of the UK shivering in lows of around 8C (46.4F). Forecaster Helen Chivers said an area of low pressure would also bring more rain and chilly winds to much of Britain. She said: 'What is left of Bertha is now over Scandinavia, the low pressure that formed on Sunday and Monday is still causing a northerly air flow down across the country. 'On Saturday a new area of low pressure will move across Scotland during the day bringing more wind and rain and on Sunday it will continue to be breezy and showery. 'The low stays anchored over the North Sea next week and we will have a cool northerly wind blowing across the country. 'It will feel quite chilly at times at the start of next week with temperatures dropping off at night.'

Rain, rain, go away: More than a third of the average rainfall for August fell across many parts of the country today, particularity in the south-east and Durham (above) Leon Brown, forecaster for The Weather Channel, said the cooler outlook is thanks to a shift in position of the jet stream. He said the cold flow of air could hold out for up to a fortnight, making for a miserable August Bank Holiday. He said: 'We are entering a cool phase of weather across the UK, and for that matter also much of northern and central Europe. 'The jet stream has shifted so that low pressure will prevail to the east of the UK and winds will predominately be from a northerly direction for the next couple of weeks. 'Temperatures may be 3 to 4 degrees Celsius below normal next week.

Tug boat captain Paul Sydney, 66, was returning to his vessel on a Zodiac-style inflatable dinghy after going to fetch a takeaway dinner with three crew members. Mr Sydney and a British colleague were tipped into the water when the wave hit them just after 7pm yesterday evening at the entrance to Almeria Port in south east Spain. Tug boat captain Paul Sydney was tipped into the water when a wave hit the dinghy he and a colleague were in just after 7pm yesterday evening at the entrance to Almeria Port in south east Spain . Colleagues hanging onto the stricken dinghy managed to get a life ring to the survivor. But they lost contact with Mr Sydney and his body was pulled out of the water half an hour after the accident by a passing police boat as a coastguard rescue vessel was scrambled. The crew's tug boat, GPS Battler, had stopped in Almeria for engine repairs after dredging work in Menorca. It was due to set sail for Galicia in north west Spain once the repairs were complete. A spokesman for the local coastguard said: 'They had left the tug to fetch food in an inflatable and were hit by a larger than normal wave as they returned which overturned the dinghy. 'The two Brits were thrown into the sea and maintained contact with each other for about 15 minutes as they tried to swim back to the boat.
