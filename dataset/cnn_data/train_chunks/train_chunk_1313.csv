"Saturn, around of 900 million miles from Earth, is the second largest planet in our solar system. Orbitting it are 62 moons and, since its arrival in 2004, Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which has been sending back images and data on some of them, and the planet itself. And now, in a series of enhanced images from the spacecraft, the detail and beauty that was previously hidden in some of the photos has been revealed. Croatian programmer Gordon Ugarkovic  added colour and touched up the snaps to reveal new details. In the images the gas giant Saturn and its moons are featured. Here is Titan (background) and Rhea, with the former 2.038 million km from Cassini and the latter 1.329 million km . The amazing new photos were created by Croatian computer programmer Gordan Ugarkovic. He highlights a stunning array of features on the gas giant and its moons including Titan and Dione. The latter, for example, can be seen with pockmarked craters across its surface. In another image, it is seen dwarfed by the much larger Titan, as Cassini made a rare pass that saw the two align. The hazy atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan is also revealed in stunning detail, with a noticeable ‘thin blue line’ between where the atmosphere ends and space begins. And Saturn is also given some additional treatment, with the huge planet and its rings seen partially lit up by the sun. Writing on his Flickr page, Mr Ugarkovic said he created the images because he was ‘somewhat underwhelmed by the frequency the Cassini Imaging Team releases colour composites.' The majestic Saturn is seen here with part of the planet lit up, while the rings of dust can also be seen encircling the planet. Titan can also be seen above the planet in the top right. The faint greenish colour to the left of the planet is residual camera glare that could not be removed . Here the surface of Enceladus can be seen in exquisite detail, with the sun also lighting up part of the moon. It's thought it may have an ocean of water underneath its surface . Dione is seen in front of Titan. The distance to Titan in the image is 3.163 million km, and the distance to Dione is 1.611 million km . He continued: ‘The images you see here are (more or less) calibrated images that were released to the Planetary Data System. The downside of the PDS is the data releases are delayed about nine months in order to give the imaging team priority over analysing data. ‘Other than that, the PDS data allow more accurate reconstruction of colours and brightnesses over the histogram-stretched jpeg images.’ Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest in the Solar System after Jupiter. The planet was named after the Roman god who also lends his name to Saturday. The gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of Earth. While just one-eighth the average density of Earth, its larger volume means Saturn is more than 95 times bigger than Earth. The planet's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron, nickel and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer gaseous layer. The planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on Jupiter but slower than on Neptune. The prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs. They are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust. There are 62 known moons - 53 of which are officially named - orbiting the planet. Titan is Saturn's largest and the Solar System's second largest moon - bigger even than Mercury. The small irregular moon Epimetheus is seen here from a distance of 104,500km. The moon has a radius of about 130km, while several craters on its surface are larger than 30km . The atmosphere of Titan is seen here, which is often said to be the most Earth-like place in the solar system aside from our planet. The moon is also known to have liquids on its surface in lakes and seas . In recent months Cassini has revealed some fascinating insights into the Saturnian system. Towards the end of November, Nasa announced that the spacecraft had created the most detailed maps yet of several of Saturn’s moons. These included the icy surface of Enceladus, which may have a liquid ocean underground, and the bizarre ‘tow-toned’ world of Iapetus. Cassini also spotted the glint of the sun on the surface of one of Titan’s lakes - confirming the presence of liquids on its surface. And data released today suggests that there are sand tunes on Titan that may have been shaped by the moon’s wind. Cassini mission around Saturn will continue until 2017, when it will be sent crashing into gas giant’s atmosphere to prevent it contaminating any of the nearby moons as its fuel runs out.","Croatian programmer Gordon Ugarkovic improved Cassini's images by adding colour and touching up photos .

"Parents could one day wave goodbye to the school run and pack their children off in a driverless car, a transport minister has predicted. Claire Perry said she has a 'vision' of futuristic vehicles picking children up in the morning and bringing them home at 3.30pm. But she warned of the dangers of relying on technology which could be vulnerable to a cyber attack. Scroll down for video . The future? Trials of driverless cars are to start in four towns next year, including Milton Keynes (pictured), with ministers predicting they could take over the school run . The first major trials of driverless cars in the UK are expected to begin within weeks. Bristol, Greenwich, Coventry and Milton Keynes will all host autonomous driving projects that will run for between 18 and 36 months starting from January 2015. Ministers hope to make Britain a world leader in the technology. Google has unveiled a computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route. Miss Perry told MPs she wants driverless cars to be seen as 'assisted technology' and not 'zombie robot taxis'. Giving evidence to the transport select committee, she said: 'My personal view, I think it's incredibly exciting because there is an opportunity to use time and capacity more effectively. 'We are short of capacity in terms of roads in this country, we are all short of time. Anything we can do to use capacity more intelligently and preserve safety and give people more time is a good thing.' She added: 'I have a vision of the school run driverless car where you put your children in and wave them off to school and then they come back at 3.30pm. 'Driverless buses – I know it makes everyone nervous – but anything you can do to make mass vehicles more cost effective would be interesting as well. So I think there is huge potential, but we are on an evolution.' Google has unveiled a computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route . Transport minister Claire Perry said she has a  'vision' of futuristic vehicles picking children up in the morning and bringing them home later . Coventry and Milton Keynes: Engineers involved in the Autodrive Programme will develop infrastructure to best work with autonomous cars navigating real roads. Driverless pods will ferry individuals around pedestrianised areas of Milton Keynes. Greenwich: The Gateway project will test automated electric shuttles buses and robotic valet parking. Bristol: The insurance implications of driverless vehicles will be explored by the Venturer consortium. The programme will also look at how cars cope with the city's challenging terrain and how they are received by the public. As part of the trials, Milton Keynes and Coventry will share the UK Autodrive programme, which involves Ford, Jaguar Land Rover as well as a number of universities and engineering consultancies. They will test self-driving cars on real roads as well as lightweight self-driving pods designed for pedestrianised areas in Milton Keynes. It is hoped that testing driverless cars in a real-world environment will help lead to greater levels of understanding of the vehicles and will allow the public to imagine how the cars could fit into everyday life. The Institution of Engineering and Technology has predicted that within 15 years there will be vehicles taking people and freight across the country without drivers. Miss Perry conceded that there are concerns about the security of web technlogoly which could be targeted by hackers. But she added: 'The challenge overall is more about cyber security. The more we are all dependent on cyber information to work out where we are to the road network, to have the road networks communicating that there is a particular breakdown and that is a huge challenge across Government and society.'","First major UK trials of technology to start in four towns next month .

"An insider trading investigation has been launched into Ted Kennedy Jr's former company. The Marwood Group, a healthcare-focused consulting firm co-founded by Kennedy, received notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this week. The agency's staff officially notified Marwood that it plans to recommend to the full commission charging the company with civil insider trading. Ted Kennedy Jr was elected to the Connecticut state Senate in November, having left The Marwood Group in January to seek political office . Kennedy said the company is cooperating fully with SEC investigation into the allegations. The investigation has focused on alleged government information passed on to Marwood clients in 2010 about a new prostate-cancer treatment developed by the company Dendreon. 'I understand the SEC's concerns about the flow of government information, especially given the public's desire for more transparency,' Kennedy said in a statement. 'While I have never been named or questioned by the SEC, I understand that my former company, the Marwood Group, has cooperated fully with the SEC's requests over the last three and a half years.' Kennedy, the 53-year-old son of the late Senator Ted Kennedy, was elected in November to Connecticut's legislature. He is the nephew of President John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. He served as president of Marwood for 12 years before leaving in January. He announced his candidacy for the state senate in April, and takes office in January. Marwood spokesman Michael McKeon denied any insider trading and said the company has been surprised by the allegations. 'We are very surprised because if you look at the facts there is no tipper, no materiality and clearly no financial benefit for anyone. In fact the whole premise is absurd,' McKeon said. Marwood has offices in New York, Washington, DC, and London. An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation. Should formal charges be filed, it could be the first case in which regulators treat political intelligence, non-public information from a government source, in the same way as illegal insider information, expanding the current definition of what constitutes an illegal trade.

"Sex change approved: Robert J. Kosilek, now known as Michelle Kosilek, sits in Bristol County Superior Court in 1993 in New Bedford, Mass., where Kosilek was on trial for the May 1990 murder of his wife . A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a judge's ruling granting a taxpayer-funded sex change operation for a transgender inmate serving a life sentence for a murder conviction, saying receiving medically necessary treatment is a constitutional right that must be protected 'even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox.' U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf ruled in 2012 that the state Department of Correction must provide sex reassignment surgery for Michelle Kosilek, who was born Robert Kosilek and is serving a life sentence for the killing of his wife in 1990. The Department of Correction challenged the ruling, arguing Kosilek has received adequate treatment for gender identity disorder, including female hormones, laser hair removal and psychotherapy. Prison officials said those treatments have eased the stress and anxiety felt by the 64-year-old Kosilek, and they brought in experts who supported their argument that it was unnecessary to heed advice from independent medical experts who recommended she undergo the sex change surgery as the next step in treating her gender identity disorder. The Department of Correction also argued it was concerned about protecting Kosilek, who's in an all-male prison, from sexual assaults if she were allowed to complete her transformation into a woman. But judges cited a prison security review conducted after Kosilek lived safely as a woman with male prisoners, wearing women's clothing, using women's cosmetics and taking hormones that caused her to develop breasts. They said no security issues cropped up. As Robert: Robert Koselik is led out of the New Rochelle, N.Y. courthouse on May 24, 1990 . U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals Judges O. Rogeriee Thompson and William Kayatta Jr. said in their ruling that courts must not shrink from their obligation to enforce the constitutional rights of all people, including prisoners. 'And receiving medically necessary treatment is one of those rights, even if that treatment strikes some as odd or unorthodox,' they wrote. One member of the three-judge appeals panel, Judge Juan Torruella, disagreed, saying in a separate opinion the ruling went beyond the boundaries of protections offered under the Eighth Amendment. Still, Kosilek's lawyer Joseph Sulman said they were very happy her right to receive the treatment was affirmed. 'This decision is really about more than sexual reassignment surgery,' Sulman said. 'It's about the state's requirement to treat all prisoners equally regardless of their gender identity or regardless of the circumstances.' Kosilek was convicted of killing Cheryl Kosilek, a volunteer counselor at a drug rehabilitation facility who thought she could cure his gender identity disorder. Mug shot: Robert Koselik's original May 1990 file booking photo provided by the New Rochelle Police Department . Kosilek first sued the Department of Correction in 2000. Two years later, the U.S. District Court judge found Kosilek was entitled to treatment for gender identity disorder but stopped short of ordering surgery. Kosilek sued again in 2005, arguing the surgery was a medical necessity. Kosilek's attorney Frances Cohen had previously said the surgery, which can cost more than $50,000, would be paid for under a contract the Department of Correction has with its medical provider. She said the contract is based on the number of inmates, not the number of medical procedures provided, so the surgery wouldn't increase the state's costs. Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick had no immediate comment on the appeals court ruling or whether a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was possible, a spokeswoman said. The Department of Correction was reviewing the court decision. Boston-based legal group Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders said that in a civilized society there's 'a baseline of care that has to be provided to all prisoners, including prisoners who are transgender.' 'We hope that Michelle will now get the treatment that she desperately needs,' said Jennifer Levi, director of GLAD's Transgender Rights Project.","The ruling paves the way for Robert Koselik's transformation to Michelle Koselik to be funded with taxpayer dollars .

"For men who do not yet want children but hate condoms, or for those that can’t face a vasectomy, there may soon be a new option when it comes to contraception. Scientists are working on a substance called Vasalgel – an injectable ‘barrier’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm, called the vas deferens. The gel works like a filter to stop the passage of sperm while allowing other fluids through, but unlike a vasectomy, it is easily reversible. Scientists are working on a substance called Vasalgel – an injectable ‘barrier’ that seals the small tube that carries sperm, called the vas deferens, as a new alternative form of contraception . It is being developed at the Parsemus Foundation, based in San Francisco. The long-acting, non-hormonal contraceptive would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy, where gel is inserted in the vas deferens, rather than cutting the vas, as done in a vasectomy. ‘If a man wishes to restore flow of sperm, whether after months or years, the polymer is flushed out of the vas with another injection,’ the company says. It is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy, as opposed to a replacement for condoms, because it would not protect men against sexually transmitted infections. While it is not yet ready for humans, animal trials in rabbits and baboons have proved that it’s effective, and that a second injection dissolved the barrier, enabling animals to regain their fertility. Elaine Lissner, director of the Parsemus Foundation, told Yahoo that Vasalgel is similar to, and as effective as the female IUD - an intrauterine device better known as the 'coil' that's inserted into a woman's uterus - for preventing pregnancy. ‘So far, it’s even a little better,’ she said. laine Lissner, director of the Parsemus Foundation,said that Vasalgel is similar to, and as effective as the female IUD (pictured) - an intrauterine device better known as the 'coil' that's inserted into a woman's uterus - for preventing pregnancy . Vasalgel would be injected into a man's vas deferens - the tiny tube that carries sperm. This would require a procedure similar to a non-scalpel vasectomy. Once installed, it would work like a filter to stop the passage of sperm, while allowing other fluids through. If a man wants to become fertile again, another injection would be required to dissolve the polymer gel. The gel is intended as an alternative to a vasectomy and could be used in place of a condom, although it would not protect a man from STIs. The science behind the gel has been tested in India for 20 years in the form of a polymer contraceptive called Risug, which is in advanced clinical trials. Currently, only local men near the study sites in the country have tested it and reversibility studies have not yet been tried on humans. The foundation bought the rights to produce a gel-barrier make contraceptive that could be sold in the West and have changed the formulation. ‘The goal is to have it on the market as an alternative to vasectomy as soon as possible, with the first clinical trial expected to begin in 2014,’ it says . The gel could mean that vasectomy’s may no longer be needed which can have complications and side effects, such as pain, infection and bleeding. Male fertility expert, Dr Jamin Brahmbhatt, Co-Director of The Pur Clinic, welcomes a new contraception option for men, but is cautious because the injection site is so tiny. He fears that scarring from the injection of the barrier, could stop a reversal. ‘Since there’s no long-term data on this, there’s no guarantee about the effectiveness of a reversal,’ he said.","Scientists in San Francisco are working on a substance called Vasalgel .

"Astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal, for the first time, how supermassive stars are born. A Spanish team reported the eclipsing of a star system, known as MY Camelopardalis, when they saw two huge stars circle in a very close orbit. The star system is nestled within a small open star cluster, named Alicante 1, located about 13,000 light-years from Earth. Astronomers have spotted two monster stars about to merge in a stunning event that could reveal, for the first time, how supermassive stars are born (artist's impression pictured) Our sun is a relatively rare star in its isolation. Most of the stars in our galaxy have been formed in binary or multiple systems, some of which are ‘eclipsing’. Currently, the stars in My Cam are moving around each other at speeds of 621,000 miles (1 million km) per hour and are estimated to be no more than two million years old. Each has a radius around 700 times bigger than the Earth's, but turns on itself at about the same time. By watching the two stars with the 7.2ft (2.2 metre) telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. By watching the two stars with a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory, researchers were able to find out the temperature and shape of each of the stars. Pictured is an artist's impression of a binary star system . The stars, which each have 38 and 32 times the mass of our sun, are also thought to complete orbits of each other in under 1.2 days. This means that their outer atmospheres are already touching and interacting, and are so close to each other that scientists believe they will eventually merge into one. The resulting star is estimated to have at least 60 times the mass of the sun, according to the study by the University of Alicante. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other.Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups . You can call them celestial orphans, stars flung out of their galaxies in colossal collisions that have occurred in space for billions of years. These forsaken stars may be far more common than anyone ever realised. New observations from suborbital rocket launches and an orbiting observatory show that as many as half the stars in the universe may be this kind, scientists said in November. They found that the dim light these stars produce from the far reaches of the cosmos equals the amount coming from all the galaxies. The data was collected during 2010 and 2012 flights of a Nasa suborbital rocket with the Cosmic Infrared Background Experiment (Ciber) measuring background fluctuations in a compilation of all the light emitted by stars and galaxies in the universe's history. The researchers then checked the findings using Spitzer Space Telescope, an orbiting infrared observatory. The data indicated huge numbers of orphan stars, previously undetected, populate what had been thought to be the dark spaces between galaxies. So how did billions of stars become orphans? Violently, to say the least. Galaxies like our Milky Way are made up of stars, dust and dark matter bound together by gravity. As galaxies drift through space, they periodically crash into each other. Stars and the other galactic stuff can merge together in these mash-ups, but some stars that were born and resided in these galaxies are stripped away and cast as debris into the cosmic wilderness. The phenomenon of the orphan star has been well known. Astronomers have witnessed tidal streams of stars being stripped away from colliding pairs of galaxies. Scientists are unsure what will happen next, but any merger is likely to be rapid and explosive, releasing massive amounts of energy. While it won’t create a ‘hypergiant’ star, astrophysicists hope that by seeing the merger of such close binary stars, they can better explain how extremely massive stars form. Hypergiants may be 100 or more times more massive than the sun, and emit hundreds of thousands of times more energy. Although extreme stars such as these are believed to have been common in the early universe, today they are extremely rare - the entire Milky Way galaxy contains only a handful.","Event could reveal, for the first time, how supermassive stars are born .

"Eddie Redmayne has been widely praised for his portrayal of renowned physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, a film that portrays the first steps in his career and his diagnosis with motor neurone disease. The new movie, which has already been tipped for awards season success, is based on Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, and Eddie has even been tipped for an Oscar. So who is Eddie Redmayne and how did he make the leap from gawky Eton schoolboy to esteemed actor and model? Scroll down for videos . Big star: Eddie Redmayne last night attended the UK Premiere of The Theory Of Everything, within which he plays renowned physicist Stephen Hawking. He's been tipped for an Oscar, so who exactly is Eddie and how did he make it? It seems that 32-year-old Eddie, who was born in London in 1982, was always set for success. He attended Eton College, where Prince Harry and William and David Cameron were educated, and was house captain. He went on to study History of Art at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated in 2003 with a 2:1. Clearly keen to pursue a career in musical theatre, he joined the National Youth Music Theatre, and his first appearance was at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre  in 2002. Cast: Actress Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne were joined by Stephen  and Jane Hawking, who they play in the film, on last night's blue carpet . Set for an Oscar? The film, which has already been tipped for awards season success, is based on Wilde's book Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, and Eddie has been tipped for an Oscar . Critics were quick to notice his talents. He was awarded with Outstanding Newcomer at the 50th Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2004 and Best Newcomer at the Critics’ Circle Theatre Awards in 2005. After making his mark on the stage, he moved into TV with a role in BBC's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, The Pillars of the Earth, and  Birdsong. His acting abilities landed him huge film roles in The Good Shepherd, Savage Grace, The Other Boleyn Girl and Black Death. Two of his major roles were playing Colin Clark in the drama film My Week with Marilyn and Marius in Les Misérables. Despite his stellar acting career, in an interview with Elle Magazine, Eddie Redmayne said he has struggled to be recognised as a serious actor after his initial modelling success. 'I read a review recently that said, ""Who knew Eddie Redmayne was more than just a pout?""' he told the publication. 'You think, ""Nice, you’ve recognised that, but at the same time that’s 10 years of work you’ve just dismissed as pouting.""' Luckily for Eddie, Hawking is his biggest fan and said he was so taken by the actor's performance that at times he mistook Eddie for himself. 'I thought [he] portrayed me very well. At times I thought he was me,' he told The Independent. 'I think Eddie’s commitment will have a big emotional impact.' Sorry, ladies! Eddie is engaged to publicist Hannah Bagshawe and the pair are currently planning their wedding . Meanwhile, Eddie's personal life is proving just as noteworthy as his acting work - he's busy planning his wedding. Following his June engagement, the actor has been working with Hannah on their perfect day. He recently told E! News: . 'The plan is a winter wedding. We're in the thick of that at the moment... We're doing our best.' In June, a representative for the British star confirmed the news of his engagement to the financial publicist. The Les Misérables star reportedly proposed to his long-term love while on a romantic holiday, US Weekly revealed. 'He had been planning on it for a while,' a source told the magazine. 'They have a very relaxed and supportive relationship. They seemed to have always known they were going to spend the rest of their lives together.' Professional poser: Eddie, pictured in a Burberry campaign with Cara Delevingne, said he has struggled to be recognised as a serious actor after his initial modelling success . Pals: The pair had some serious on-screen chemistry in their Burberry SS12 campaign - one of Cara's first major fashion coups - and the pair remain good friends . Big role: In 2011, he starred in My Week With Marilyn alongside friend and fellow Brit actress, Emma Watson . Where it all began: Eddie seen modelling for Rowan Yarns in 2004 when he was 22, left, and winning the Milton Shulman Award for Outstanding Newcomer at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards in 2004 . Hannah attended the University of Edinburgh where she obtained an MA in English Literature and French. An engagement announcement was posted in The Times, which read: . 'Mr E.J.D. Redmayne and Miss H.J. Bagshawe. The engagement is announced between Edward, son of Mr and Mrs Richard Redmayne of London, and Hannah, daughter of Mr Nicholas Bagshawe and Mrs Caryl Bagshawe, both of London.' While he is preparing to walk down the aisle now, Eddie's love life has been colourful and he's been linked to some of tinsel town's most beautiful and talented women. Young star: Eddie Redmayne in a theatre production at the Almeida Theatre before he became a Hollywood name . He was linked to actress Carey Mulligan in 2011 but neither commented on the romance. A year later it was rumoured that he was seeing Taylor Swift after they met when Taylor auditioned for Les Miserables. He later denied the rumours saying: 'We had a chat behind the stage for seven minutes. Even by my standards, that’s a pretty brief relationship!'. He starred in a Burberry campaign with Cara Delevingne in 2012 and people were quick to comment but neither ever commented on the supposed chemistry. In 2013, he was linked to Amanda Seyfried after the pair seemed close at a Les Mis photocall and at an awards shows. Eddie is extremely well connected and is often seen hanging around in London with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Douglas Booth, Benedict Cumberbatch, Sam Claflin, Daisy Lowe and Jamie Dornan. Famous friends: Amanda Seyfried, Eddie Redmayne and Anne Hathaway attend the NBCUniversal Golden Globes  after party . Last night, in an especially poignant moment for Redmayne, he was joined by Hawking in front of photographers as the pair prepared to watch the early years of his life played out on film. Largely centred on the former couple's relationship, it covers the period from Hawking's days as a PhD student at Cambridge until 1989 when he was named a Companion of Honour by the Queen. Speaking on the blue carpet, the 32-year-old actor admitted that despite having crossed paths with the professor during his own student days at Cambridge, he still felt starstruck at the prospect of playing him. He said: 'I'd been a student at Cambridge and seen Stephen across campus, heard his voice, but I was pretty ignorant so when I read the script, everything was a revelation. 'Stephen and Jane let Felicity and I into their lives, so we felt an enormous amount of responsibility to get it right.'

"Angelina Jolie has become the latest celebrity to fall victim to the Sony Pictures hackers. In what appear to be more leaked e-mails from the corporation - published by Gawker - Angelina is allegedly branded a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' by movie producer Scott Rudin. The e-mail claims  Angelina was displeased to learn that David Fincher was going to be directing the upcoming Jobs biopic as opposed to a re-make of Cleopatra that she would play the lead in, and was pressuring Sony to get him to direct her film. Scroll down for videos . Harsh words: Angelina Jolie, pictured at the Unbroken premiere in London on November 25, was viciously slammed by producer Scott Rudin in alleged e-mails leaked in the recent Sony hacking scandal . Letting loose: In one email, Rudin (left) writes to Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal (right) that Jolie is a 'spoiled brat' Arguing over: David Fincher, pictured in Rome in January 2012, was originally set to direct Jobs, which was the subject of Rudin and Pascal's e-mails . Angelina then reportedly becomes the hot topic of conversation in a fiery exchange from February this year between Jobs producer Rudin, 56, and Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal. Rudin appears to refer to Angelina as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' before viciously slamming her in multiple e-mails allegedly leaked in the recent Sony hacking scandal. '[Jolie] is upset about us giving david jobs she wants to talk,' Pascal, 56, reportedly tells Rudin in a leaked e-mail dated February 27. But he apparently had no interest in discussing the matter with the Maleficent star, saying, 'She’ll survive it. I don’t want to waste my time on this.' Later that day, he appears to have sent another e-mail to Pascal, which read, ‘YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.’ She appears to respond with, 'Do not f**king threaten me.' Close friend: Jolie's husband Brad Pitt (above) has worked with Fincher numerous times before, on films such as Seven, Fight Club and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button . At odds: The emails seem to make it clear that Rudin (left) and Pascal (right) have a very toxic relationship . It is claimed that Rudin proceeds to criticize Angelina a number of cutting remarks, and the idea of the movie altogether. The alleged email states: 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won’t tell her that you do not like the script — which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN’T EITHER — this will just spin even further out in Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don’t.' Among other things, Pascal apparently says in her more civil response, 'You know Eric and she have always wanted David and I have been the one saying no for two years. I have asked you to talk to her with me and you don't want to deal with it.' The Eric being referred to is likely Eric Roth, who wrote the script for the remake and previously worked with Fincher when he penned The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. However, this allegedly caused Rudin to launch into yet another tirade in which he appears to insult the Unbroken director some more. 'If you engage in this again, we will end up losing Fincher on the one we want him to do and will be stuck with shoving him onto a movie with no script that, underneath it all, you know in your heart and your brain should never be made,' he apparently writes in the email. 'I'm not remotely interested in presiding over a $180m ego bath that we both know will be the career-defining debacle for us both. 'I'm not destroying my career over a minimally talented spoiled brat who thought nothing of shoving this off her plate for eighteen months so she could go direct a movie. I have no desire to be making a movie with her, or anybody, that she runs and that we don't.' He allegedly goes on: 'She's a camp event and a celebrity and that's all and the last thing anybody needs is to make a giant bomb with her that any fool could see coming. 'We will end up being the laughing stock of our industry and we will deserve it, which is so clearly where this is headed that I cannot believe we are still wasting our time with it.’ Keeping calm: Angelina did not seem at all bothered by the leaked emails when she was photographed out in Los Angeles on Wednesday . Also attacked: Megan Ellison, the 28-year-old producer of American Hustle (seen above with the film's stars Amy Adams, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence) is called a 'bipolar lunatic' in one email . Coming back: Ellison later took to Twitter to respond to the leaked email and comments made by Rudin . In the end Rudin may have been right, as Fincher did indeed leave the Jobs picture, something Pascal seemed to realize when she received an email blast from entertainment site The Wrap that alluded to behind the scenes problems with Fincher and the studio over the Jobs film. After the site wrote that he was leaving the film, Pascal wrote Fincher saying, 'WTF.' Fincher attempted to diffuse the situation by making a comment about another story in the blast, the announcement that Girls star Adam Driver had landed the role of the main villain in the upcoming Star Wars film. 'Adam Driver is a terrible idea,' responded Fincher to Pascal's email. The Wrap was right however, and now Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, will direct Jobs, a film that recently lost its star, Christian Bale, and replaced him with Michael Fassbender. Wooed: Emails appear to show producers attempting to convince Leonardo DiCaprio to star in Jobs . Jobs drama: Christian Bale (left) was originally star in the Jobs biopic, which will now star Michael Fassbender (right), whose genitalia is the subject of one email . Ouch: Kevin Hart (above) is called a 'whore' by one studio executive after requesting more money to promote his film on social media . This after the studio aggressively tried to woo Leonardo DiCaprio in a series of emails that also leaked, saying it would be great for him and Boyle to be working together again 15 years after they filmed The Beach. The emails also reveal that in addition to his talent, people at Sony are also impressed with Fassbender's penis, with producer Michael De Luca allegedly claiming in one email that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.' As for Rudin's notorious rage, the producer also seems to have it out for Megan Ellison, the 28-year-old daughter of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison who has quickly made a name for herself by producing Oscar worthy fare such as American Hustle, Her and Zero Dark Thirty. Rudin appears to describe her as a 'bipolar 28 year old lunatic' in one email. Rudin and Pascal meanwhile seemed to have parted ways as well, with Universal now set to produce Jobs. Another set of emails that leaked reveal that Kevin Hart received $3million to do his last film for the studio, likely Think Like a Man Too, and that his team demanded more money for him to promote the movie on social media. This did not sit well with studio executive Clint Culpepper, who wrote to Pascal in an email, 'It's not as if we paid him 3M and 4M respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated. We paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy.' He then calls Hart a 'whore.' A representative for Jolie did not immediately respond when contacted by MailOnline. Sony hackers release aliases used by stars including Daniel Craig and Natalie Portman . Sony Pictures' embarrassment over leaked details of its business deepened  as hackers released the aliases used by its stars to travel incognito. The cache of confidential documents leaked from Sony's archives includes the assumed names actors and actresses use to check into hotels and book car services. Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Ice Cube and Jessica Alba will all be forced to switch their pseudonyms after their details were published online by the so-called Guardians Of Peace hacker group. The new leaks also reportedly include contact details, including phone numbers, for the likes of Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Tom Hanks, as well as film budgets, scripts, details of legal claims and private employee information. Contact details: The secret aliases and contact details of Hollywood stars - including, from left, Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman and Brad Pitt - are among the latest documents stolen by hackers from Sony Pictures . The latest batch of leaked files includes a folder containing 'publicity bibles' for many recent Sony Pictures releases which include phone numbers and email addresses for cast and crew on film sets, Fusion reports. They reveal that Tom Hanks sometimes travels under the pseudonyms 'Harry Lauder' or 'Johnny Madrid'; Tobey Maguire goes as 'Neil Deep'; while Jessica Alba adopts the rapper-esque name 'Cash Money'. North Korean officials have denied accusations they are behind the hacking raid on Sony Pictures, despite increasing evidence apparently linking the pariah state to the attack. But they called it a 'righteous deed'. A theory has been that North Korean hackers targeted the film company out of anger at the release of The Interview, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen as TV reporters hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. Yesterday a missive apparently posted by the hackers on code-sharing site GitHub Gist demanded Sony 'stop immediately showing the movie of terrorism which can break the regional peace and cause the war!'","New emails released as the result of the Sony hack detail the behind the scenes drama surrounding Angelina Jolie's upcoming film Cleopatra .

"She might be a member of one of Europe's leading royal dynasties but Queen Letizia of Spain is happy to forgo most of the trappings. The 42-year-old arrived for a cancer charity event this morning on foot, having been dropped off in a nearby car park alone and without security guards. Despite the lack of frills, she was every inch the style queen in her Tyrian purple coat and fashionable aviator sunglasses. Low key: Queen Letizia arrives for a meeting held by the Spanish Association Against Cancer in Madrid . Carrying a black briefcase, the royal looked businesslike as she made her way into the meeting held by the Spanish Association Against Cancer, a charity of which she is patron. Her low key approach is yet another sign of the increasingly Scandinavian style of the Spanish monarchy, which has so far seen Felipe prioritise being seen as 'normal' over the lavish lifestyle enjoyed by his father King Juan-Carlos. His latest move came last Thursday, when he banned senior royals, including himself, his two daughters and Letizia, from accepting expensive gifts. The new rules, which also apply to Juan-Carlos and his wife Queen Sofia, come into effect on New Year's Day and are intended to avoid 'compromising the dignity of the institution'. Felipe's move comes after his father's reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance - not helped by his habit of accepting gifts that included an €18m (£14m) yacht. Alone: She was dropped off in a nearby car park ahead of the event and arrived without a security detail . Businesslike: She teamed her Tyrian purple coat with a pair of fashionable aviator sunglasses . New look: Husband King Felipe recently banned any member of the Spanish royal family from accepting gifts . Fortuna, which Juan-Carlos was forced to stop using last year in a nod to austerity, became a regular plaything of the Spanish royals, who used it during summer holidays in Mallorca. Felipe's new-look Spanish monarchy is closer in style to the Scandinavian system, which sees members of the royal family live relatively low key lifestyles. As part of his drive to modernise the institution, the 46-year-old royal also banned members of his family from working in the private sector and insisted that all must behave in an 'exemplary manner' likely to 'earn citizens' appreciation, respect and trust.' Despite boasting fewer staff and less money than their British and Spanish counterparts, the Norwegian, Danish and Swedish monarchs and their families do accept gifts, although like the British royals, most have to be declared. Transformation: King Felipe is attempting to remodel the Spanish royal family along Scandinavian lines . Change: His move comes after King Juan-Carlos' reign was blighted by accusations of extravagance . In the case of the UK royal family, gifts either become part of the Royal Collection and are displayed during the summer exhibition season or are donated to the relevant museum or institution. Although the Queen is yet to benefit from a free flight or a yacht like Juan-Carlos, she has received a number of unusual gifts on state visits, including a collection of shells, a set of lacrosse sticks, sunglasses, a pair of sandals, pineapples, eggs, a box of snail shells, a grove of maple trees, a dozen tins of of tuna and 7kg of prawns. The Queen has also been given a number of horses, among them her favourite mount, Burmese, and a series of exotic animals, including a canary, jaguars, sloths and an elephant called Jumbo, all of which were given to London Zoo.","Letizia, 42, was attending an event on behalf of a Spanish cancer charity .

"Corporations are doing nothing to attract workers under 35 because millennials have a reputation for being workplace divas. A new survey conducted by Duke University and CFO Magazine found that millennials are thought to need more management in the workplace and are also known for leaving jobs at the drop of the hat. Unfortunately for millennials they are making much less money than their parents did and the economy is still slowly crawling its way out of an economic recession. The brunt of the stick: Not only is the economy tearing its way out of an economic recession, corporations are doing nothing the employee workers under 35 who they view as disloyal and entitled . Least employed: Millennials have the highest unemployment rate of all generations but also the highest rate of part time employment . CBS reports that the recent report surveyed more than a thousand chief financial officers worldwide and while some of them had good things to say about millennials other's expressed their disdain for the younger generation. 70 per cent of CFOs surveyed said that millennials were more tech savvy than workers over 35. 21 per cent said that millenials were more creative than the typical employee. Millennials are also willing to work for less money than their older counterparts. Despite being great with computers and creative, millennials were also thought to have a sense of entitlement. More than half of CFOs said that millennials were disloyal to their companies. 46 per cent said that millennials had a sense of entitlement, and 27 per cent said millennials were more interested than their own personal development than the development of the company as a whole. Low earnings: Despite not earning very much right now millennials believe they will make more money in the future if they are able to find a job . Fickle: Millenials are more likely than other generations to switch jobs and stay employed for under a year . The report also states that companies aren't adapting to the mobile and tech savvy generation of creatives. Only 21 per cent of companies make work hours flexible for their employees, only 17 per cent are allowed to work from home, and only 10 per cent are changing the corporate culture. CBS reports that is millennials were to stay at their jobs longer then companies might be more accommodating. A report conducted by the department of labor found that millennials had an average of 6.2 jobs by the time they were 27. The report found that they stayed in all of those jobs for less than a year. A study by Fidelity found that millennials stay with a job for three years on average. Unfortunately female millennials have it the worst it seems. CFOs said in the survey that they didn't believe there were enough women who had the skill set necessary to serve on the board of a company. On a lighter note CFOs said that they were starting to feel better about the economy. They believe that both employment and wages will increase by 3 per cent in the coming years.","While corporations believe millennials are tech savy and creative they had  some caveats about hiring employees under 35 .

"A Connecticut family had all but lost hope Wednesday they'd be together for the holidays after a pre-dawn fire swept though their duplex home leaving four unaccounted for. The front of the two-family building on the Connecticut River was left burned out with a partially collapsed roof and charred interior walls. Neighbors called 911 just after 6am after hearing an explosion. A friend of the survivors told the Hartford Courant the fire may have been started by a Christmas tree. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Family friend Jessica Rozalski (at left as she stood in front of the home's remains) told reporters Wednesday the names of the presumed dead in a pre-dawn Connecticut blaze . Sad: Among the dead according to Rozalski was Cathy Armes (pictured). Rozalski says the blaze may have been started by a Christmas tree . Matriarch: Rozalski said another apparent victim was Orise Handfield (pictured) Jessica Rozalski told the Courant that two of the survivors from the right side of the 100-year-old house were her friend Laurie Johnson and her son Richie Handfield. Handfield was airlifted to a hospital for treatment for burns to his lungs. Missing from the right side of the house, Rozalski told the Courant, were Johnson's son Josh Johnson; Laurie Johnson's mother, Orise Handfield; Orise Handfield's daughter, Cathy Armes; and another male victim named David. 'It's sad. It really is,' Rozalski said as she stood on the street outside the home with a friend. 'I've known them my whole life and now it's possible they won't be here no more. I don't know what to think.' Firefighters responded to the fire at about 6:15 a.m. Wednesday in Enfield, about 20 miles northeast of Hartford. Josh Johnson, grandson of Orise Handfield, was also presumed dead. Not pictured is a fourth apparent victim, another grandson of Orise Handfield's . Explosion: A fire truck sits at the scene of a fire  Wednesday morning in Enfield, Connecticut that authorities were alerted to at 6:15am when a neighbor called to report having heard an explosion . Intense: Firefighters work at the scene Wednesday morning after getting the fire contained. Authorities had to wait to enter the building after it partially collapsed under the intense heat . Fire department spokesman Mark Zarcaro says the four missing people range in age from 40 to their late 60s. A woman and her two sons, who are about 19 and 12 years old, lived on the south side and escaped to safety, said the woman's sister, Lisa Lape. Lape said she saw a story about the fire on TV and Facebook and rushed to the scene from her home in Bristol. She ran up to firefighters and told them her sister, Mary Lapane, lived there. Lape said her sister was in the shower when she smelled smoke and was able to escape with her family. 'She's in shock,' Lape said of her sister. 'She's OK. We're going to get through this.' Zarcaro says part of the second floor collapsed into the first floor, and firefighters have been trying to stabilize the building before entering. Startling video from the scene shows flames raging at the top of the home. Footage shot later shows a plume of smoke streaming from a window near the roof. 'The flames were raging throughout the building and we had more than 20 firefighters battling the fire from four or five of our fire companies,' said firefighter Sean Clifford, of the Hazardville fire station. 'This was one of the worst I've seen here.' It was on the second side where the fire burned most intensely. It was also from that side that four remained unaccounted for. Smoke continued to our from the home as late as 9:30am .

"Jenson Button's manager has hinted that the 2009 world champion is ready to turn his back on Formula One. McLaren are openly pursuing a reunion with Fernando Alonso, who left so acrimoniously after his spat with Lewis Hamilton in 2007. Jenson Button is expected to leave If McLaren sign Fernando Alonso, who is leaving Ferrari after five years . Should the British team sign the Spaniard, who is leaving Ferrari after five years, it is likely to spell the end for Button with McLaren expected to stand by their young protege Kevin Magnussen. Button, 34, has more points than his team-mate, but has been outqualified in nine of the 16 races so far, and was urged to ‘try harder’ by chairman Ron Dennis ahead of July’s British Grand Prix. ‘McLaren aren’t sure what they’re doing and what their line-up will be,’ said Button’s long-serving manager Richard Goddard. ‘Jenson is an incredibly competitive racing driver who wants to race. ‘He’s too good to sit at the back of the F1 grid, so he either gets a competitive car in F1 or he goes to get one elsewhere.’ Button has been urged to ‘try harder’ by McLaren chairman Ron Dennis ahead of July’s British Grand Prix . One alternative for the Englishman, a 15-time race winner, is the world endurance championship, the series Mark Webber defected to after retiring from F1 last year. It is understood the 34-year-old has already held talks with Porsche. ‘Jenson is still focused on F1 but would only want to be in one of the top teams. So we’re always open to talking to anyone,’ added Goddard. ‘The world endurance championship is a formidable series that is gaining strength and Mark going there has added a lot.’ l Pirelli have changed their tyre choice for the Brazilian Grand Prix after Felipe Massa branded their original decision ‘dangerous’ and ‘totally unacceptable’. After consulting with all 11 teams, they will now run the soft and medium compounds at the recently resurfaced Interlagos track.","2009 world champion Jenson Button set to leave McLaren .

"My aim heading to Germany was firstly to extend my lead in the championship over Lewis Hamilton, and then win what is my second home race after Monaco, so it was very special to win for myself and for Mercedes as it is one of the most important grands prix on the calendar for the team. Almost the entire Mercedes-Benz board was there, and after all the difficult times we went through as Mercedes in the first couple of years of the team, it was important to send out a good message. It was a picture perfect weekend for me, but not for the whole team given the problems we suffered on the other car. But for me I had no such worries, securing pole position and then winning the race. Good to be home: Nico Rosberg celebrates winning the German Grand Prix . Winner: Rosberg (second right) celebrates on the podium with Valtteri Bottas (left), Lewis Hamilton . VIDEO Rosberg uses local knowledge to triumph . It was really very emotional and it was great with all the support from the home fans. It was also nice that World Cup winner and Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski came to watch the race with our CEO Dr. Zetsche in the garage and to support me just as I had cheered him on him when he was representing Germany in Brazil, so that was really very cool. Given Lewis's brake failure in qualifying and subsequent crash, I knew it would be an easier race, but I didn't prepare any differently. I would have got more pleasure out of the victory if it would have been a gloves-off battle with my team-mate, but of course it was a very special win nevertheless, so heading into this weekend's race in Hungary I am very happy. After the win in Hockenheim, I celebrated with the team afterwards, and there was some really hilarious stuff going on. We were dancing together in the garage so that was a lot of fun, but with back-to-back races, there hasn't been a lot of time to take in the victory. As we headed away from the circuit in our car some fans pulled alongside us on the motorway, and they were going crazy. They slid open their van door and started singing 'this is a winner, this is a winner.' We took a video of their chanting, and its awesome to see how much fun they get out of me winning, being a German driver in a German car in Germany. A lot of people were really excited about it so it was great to witness that enthusiasm first hand. Unfortunately . the number of fans who attended the German Grand Prix was down on . recent years, and my impression was that people's racing enthusiasm has . decreased because of what has happened to Michael Schumacher. Hockenheim . was a place where Michael had so much success and I think all the . spectators have been hit by what has happened to him, and the condition . he is now in. I think that has maybe taken some excitement away from . racing. Obviously, we all still hope Michael makes as good a recovery as . he can. Ahead of the race there was lot of drama over the crash helmet we designed to celebrate Germany winning the World Cup. I had planned to put the World Cup trophy on the top of my lid, but I got a call from football's governing body FIFA to say that it was not allowed and that I must remove it because it is a trademark. Change: Nico Rosberg wasn't allowed to carry an image of the World Cup on his helmet for the race . Losing ground: Hamilton is now 14 points behind his Mercedes team-mate in the standings . Trouble behind: Rosberg leads the way as Massa crashes at the first corner . That was bit of a weird one. I removed it however, and everything was OK but it is incredible all the things that you have to think of. We never even took that into consideration when we designed the helmet! We quickly changed the concept and replaced the trophy with four stars to represent each of Germany's World Cup successes. This weekend I am deciding which helmet to run - whether it is the one I wore to victory in Germany or my usual one - so, I have asked the fans on Facebook to vote. Let me know what one you think I should wear at the Hungaroring. I go into this weekend's race very confident because I have a great car. I know that every track we go to, if I deliver I have the chance of being on pole and winning the race, and it does not get any better than that. These are exciting times, ones that I can share with the team, and are well deserved. We went through some tough periods, but now we are getting the success we deserve which is nice to see. I look forward to the remainder of the season. Toto Wolff made some comments earlier this week that it would be unfair if the championship was won at the last race as a result of the new double points system. The concept is really artificial, I don't like it and that is a pity, but that is the way it is and we have got to accept it. Winning is winning, and obviously I will be happy if I win this year's championship whatever the circumstances. Support: Toto Wolff's wife offered her sympathy to her injured husband on Twitter . Ahead: Rosberg dominated the race in Hockenheim, leaving rivals to battle for second and third . Accident: Mercedes GP Executive Director Toto Wolff (right) was involved in a cycling shunt . Talking of Toto, he will be in the garage this weekend despite what happened earlier this week. He and a number of the team were involved in a cycling shunt on the River Danube during a team building event. I did not take part, so I wasn't there, and I only joined up with the team for the dinner afterwards but it was a pretty big incident and a few guys were hurt. Toto suffered broken bones but, by the time I had arrived for dinner in the evening, there was already a lot of banter flying about, jokes were being made about the crash, and a lot of people were laughing about it, so that was nice to see as it shows how tight we are as a team. After this race, we head into the summer break; a four-week period before the next grand prix at the end of August in Belgium, which I will spend with friends, family and I plan to go to Ibiza. But before that, on Thursday night, I hosted a team BBQ where I invited all my mechanics out here in Hungary. They work their butt off for me so it is really important to spend some private time together. Happy: The German Grand Prix winner hosted a BBQ with his friends and mechanics in Hungary .

"Half of women and 43 per cent of men are taking a drug prescribed by their doctor, it was revealed yesterday. A study into the nation’s pill-popping habits, the first of its type, found the most prescribed medicines were cholesterol-lowering statins, followed closely by drugs to reduce blood pressure and aspirin. Twice as many women – one in nine – as men use antidepressants. Scroll down for video . A study into the nation’s pill-popping habits, the first of its type, found the most prescribed medicines were cholesterol-lowering statins, followed closely by drugs to reduce blood pressure and aspirin . In all, the report showed an average of 18.7 prescriptions per person in England in 2013, costing the NHS in excess of £15billion a year. According to the latest Health Survey for England by the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the number of prescription drugs increases with age. More than half those aged 65 and over are taking at least three medicines and more than a third aged 75 plus take at least six medicines. Dr Jennifer Mindell, reader in public health at University College London and one of the report’s authors, said the figures should be taken in context as people were living longer and in better health than ever, which may be partly due to drugs used both for prevention and treatment of disease. GPs said ‘strict and robust monitoring systems’ ensured patients only got drugs when absolutely necessary. Half of women and 43 per cent of men are taking a drug prescribed by their doctor, it was revealed yesterday . The report is the first nationally representative assessment of drugs actually being taken by people in the community, rather than within the healthcare system. As well as those on long term medication, it includes those who were on a short course of antibiotics but represents a daily picture of the use of drugs. Overall, 50 per cent of women had taken at least one drug during the previous week compared with 43 per cent of men. More than a fifth of men and nearly a quarter of women were taking at least three. Most frequently used drugs were statins to cut cholesterol – taken by 16 per cent of men and 12 per cent of women – and medication to reduce high blood pressure (14 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women). Painkillers were taken by 12 per cent of women, just ahead of antidepressants (11 per cent). Middle-aged women were most likely to need antidepressants – 16 per cent of 45-64 year old women are on them – along with 17 per cent of the poorest women compared with 7 per cent of the richest. Cholesterol lowering statins, pain relief and anti-depressants among the most commonly prescribed drugs . The most commonly prescribed single medicine was simvastatin (40million prescriptions) for high cholesterol followed by aspirin (31million). Dr Mindell admitted it was hard to tell from the figures whether growing use of drugs meant hypochondriacs were also on the increase. She said there had been big changes in statin use, for example, with millions more eligible to take them today than a decade ago. Depression rates were generally higher among women than men because they were more willing to seek medical help. Dr Maureen Baker, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said: ‘Prescribing is a core skill for GPs and patients can be assured that their family doctor will prescribe medication only when necessary and where other alternatives have been explored. GPs also have to adhere to strict and robust monitoring systems. ‘We have an ageing population and more patients are presenting with complex and multiple conditions including mental health issues and this is reflected in today’s figures.’","Statins, pain relief and anti-depressants are most commonly prescribed .
Cost to the NHS was more than £15bn a year, out of a total budget of £100bn .
Almost a third of the total were for drugs for cardiovascular disease .

"Rangers chairman David Somers has admitted the club announced a misleading attendance figure for Saturday's clash with Cowdenbeath. The club announced midway through the second half of the Scottish Championship fixture that 28,137 fans had turned out at Ibrox. That figure for Rangers' 1-0 win would have been the Glasgow giants' smallest home attendance for a league game since Graeme Souness' first season in charge 28 years ago. Rangers chairman David Somers has admitted the club announced a misleading attendance figure . The club announced midway through the second half  that 28,137 fans had turned out at Ibrox . But now Somers has said the true figure was 10,000 fewer than the number given out on Saturday. The acting executive chairman told the Daily Record: 'The 28,000 included season-ticket holders who were not there. In reality Saturday's attendance was around 19,000.' Sources close to the club contacted the Scottish newspaper to insist the actual attendance was between 15,000 and 16,000 with one ticket office staff member saying it was 15,902. Rangers announced losses of £8.3milllion last month and also say they would need a similar figure to see the club through the rest of the financial year. Auditors Deloitte signed off on the latest results but warned there remains 'material uncertainty' over the club's ability to continue as a going concern. The Rangers board's attempts to balance the books have been hit by large-scale supporter unrest. The true figure was actually at about 19,000, admits Somers, after season ticket sales were included in figure . Season-ticket levels dropped from around 36,000 holders in 2013-14 to just 17,000 by the start of the current campaign. Further disappointing results have been registered by Ally McCoist's side, including the shocking Petrofac Training Cup loss to Alloa. The club confirmed on Wednesday morning that Norman Crighton has left his role as a Rangers director. The 48-year-old joined the board 12 months ago and represented Laxey Partners - the club's biggest single shareholder with a 16.32 per cent stake - on the PLC board. A statement released to the London Stock Exchange said: 'The Company announces that Norman Crighton has left the Board of Rangers with immediate effect.' The Rangers board take their seats in front of a protest banner on Saturday at an empty-looking Ibrox . Rangers have seen their crowd figures crash this season. Fans unhappy with the way their club has been run and frustrated by the performances of Ally McCoist’s team have decided to vote with their feet. Here, we chart the fall in the Glasgow club’s dwindling match-day support. Rangers 1 Kilmarnock 0, February 18, 2012 - crowd: 50,268 . Just six days after former owner Craig Whyte plunged the Scottish champions into administration a capacity crowd turned out to show their support. Rangers 3 Celtic 2, March 25, 2012 - crowd: 50,191 . There was another full house as the Ibrox men hosted their Old Firm rivals for the last time before their liquidation crisis. Rangers 5 East Stirling 1, August 18, 2012 - crowd: 49,118 . Despite being forced to start again in the Third Division, the Light Blue faithful again turned out in their droves. Rangers 1 Hearts 2, August 10, 2014 - crowd: 43,683 . Two years of boardroom squabbles, a season-ticket boycott and insipid displays from their team began to bite as Rangers opened the Championship season with almost 7,000 empty seats. Rangers 8 Clyde 1, August 18, 2014 - crowd: 11,190 . The supporters stay away as Ibrox is barely a fifth full when Rangers thrash Barry Ferguson’s Bully Wee in the second round of the Petrofac Training Cup - the club’s lowest attendance for 29 years. Rangers 1 Cowdenbeath 0, December 6, 2014 - crowd: 28,137 (Official); 19,000 (Unofficial) Although the club originally announced there were just over 28,000 in attendance, chairman David Somers later admitted just 19,000 fans showed up for the Championship clash with the Blue Brazil - the lowest league crowd at Ibrox since 1986.","Rangers admit the club announced a misleading attendance figure .

"Hereford United have been suspended 'from all football activity' by the FA, leaving the future of the iconic club shrouded in uncertainty. The club, famous for producing one of the FA Cup's best-loved giantkillings, were expelled from the Football Conference in June after missing a deadline to pay football creditors, and have been playing in the Southern Premier League. Now Hereford and club official Alan McCarthy have been punished for failure to comply with regulations under the owners' and directors' test. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Hereford's famous FA Cup giantkilling of Newcastle . Hereford's class of '72, including Ronnie Radford (top left), celebrate victory against Newcastle . Newcastle keeper Wille McFaul is left grasping at thin air as Radford's shot whizzes past him . Hereford United, also known as the Bulls, have been hit by another punishment from the FA . 'Having failed to comply with the orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission, both Hereford United and Alan McCarthy are suspended from all football and football activity with immediate effect,' an FA statement read. 'The club and Mr McCarthy, Officer of Hereford United FC, were ordered to fully and correctly comply with their obligations under the Owners’ and Directors’ Test Regulations by 4pm on Thursday 4 December 2014. 'Following consideration of a document submitted by the club, the Independent Regulatory Commission gave the parties until 4pm on Monday 8 December 2014 to submit further documentation to satisfy the orders of the Commission. 'Having failed to provide the requested further documentation by the deadline, both Hereford United and Mr McCarthy shall remain suspended until such time as the order of the Independent Regulatory Commission has been complied with to the satisfaction of the Commission. 'The FA understands the importance of football clubs to their local communities and will continue to work with all relevant parties to ensure senior football returns to Hereford at the earliest opportunity, although this will be contingent on the club complying with the Regulations and subsequent orders of the Independent Regulatory Commission.' Cash-strapped Hereford were expelled from the Football Conference in June for failing to pay creditors . The club have been based at their Edgar Street home since 1924 but now face an uncertain future . Hereford stand 15th in the Southern Premier League and their results so far this season will stand until the club responds to their latest punishment, at which point the FA will consider their options. Should the club become insolvent action will need to be taken by the FA. Hereford were due to visit Dunstable Town on Saturday. Meanwhile, BBC Hereford & Worcester have reported that Bulls chairman Andy Lonsdale has taken over the club from previous owners - Alpha Choice Finance, which was headed by McCarthy. Alpha Choice Finance said the move was made after 'many weeks of harassment and misinformation,' according to the Hereford Times. Lonsdale has promised a million-pound investment in the struggling club, which is expected at the High Court on Monday to contest a winding-up order. Despite mostly languishing among the lower reaches of the Football League, Hereford will be remembered for one of the FA Cup's most famous giantkillings. Few gave the then non-League team a prayer in their FA Cup third round replay against Newcastle United in February 1972. Things looked even bleaker when Malcolm Macdonald put Newcastle ahead with just eight minutes left of the match, which was played on a quagmire of a pitch. But Ronnie Radford scored with a bullet shot from 30 yards with five minutes remaining to spark a pitch invasion, then a 2-1 extra-time win and also a generation's love affair with football. Legendary BBC commentator John Motson, during his first full season working for Match Of The Day, helped the game into football folklore as he said: 'No goalkeeper in the world would have stopped that.'

"West Ham United's transformation under Sam Allardyce was recognised on Friday when he was named Premier League Manager of the Month after three straight league wins in October. There was a double celebration for the east London club too as Diafra Sakho, one of a number of exciting new arrivals in the summer, was named the league's Player of the Month after scoring a goal in each of the three victories. The award for Allardyce, 60, represents a remarkable turnaround for the manager who was booed and jeered by many West Ham fans last season for what they took as unimaginative boring football, and an uninspired final 13th place finish in the table.

"Michael Clarke fought through the pain of a back injury to score a century and lead Australia to 517-7 against India on a rain-interrupted second day Wednesday of the first Test. The Australia captain made 128 - his 28th Test century - while Steve Smith made a career-best unbeaten 162 to put the hosts in a powerful position. Clarke returned to the crease after retiring hurt on 60 on Tuesday with a flare-up of his chronic back and hamstring injuries. He also had to work through the emotional challenge of playing for the first time since the passing of team-mate and close friend Phillip Hughes, who died after being hit by a ball during a domestic match.

Clarke set himself the task of honoring Hughes' memory, and became the third centurion of the innings after Smith and David Warner, who made 145. All three centurions were state teammates of Hughes for New South Wales, and had come up through the ranks with him. Smith was on 98 when rain washed out the morning session after only 56 minutes. He went to his century from the first ball after the resumption and, like Warner, emotionally acknowledged Hughes, fans, and teammates before embracing Clarke. His innings helped Australia get back on top after India captured three quick wickets late on day one to put itself back in the match.

It was just nice to form a big partnership with (Clarke) who batted beautifully as well. 'He was obviously struggling a little bit with his injury but he got through that, and did a great job.' Rain also forced Clarke to wait longer for his century. He was 98 and only 11 balls had been bowled in the second session when rain again chased players from the field. The sense of thwarted expectation was so great that fans booed as the players left the field for the longest of the day's rain breaks.

India bowler Ishant Sharma reaches to his bowling starting point at the start of the second day's play . A tribute to Hughes was displayed on the big screen as both teams and fans took part in a 63-second applause in Adelaide in memory of Phillip Hughes on the first day's play . When they returned almost two hours later, Clarke took a single from Varun Aaron to advance to 99, then another single to reach his century. Tears flowed for Clarke and team-mates, as they have so often in the past two weeks since Hughes' death. Clarke has shouldered the load as captain, being a spokesman for the team, and a supportive presence for his family. His achievement on Wednesday may have been cathartic for the Australian team, its captain and its fans, who, when Australia reached 408 - matching Hughes' cap number - rose to their feet to offer their personal ovation. Between rain showers, Australia added 163 runs for the loss of Clarke's wicket and a declaration was likely overnight or early Thursday to allow its pace bowlers to start fresh without needing to bat.","Michael Clarke scored a century for Australia on day two of the first Test .

"Alvaro Medran announced himself to European football by scoring during Real Madrid's 4-0 win against Ludogorets. But who is the 20-year-old Spanish midfielder? Sportsmail's resident Spanish expert Pete Jenson takes a look. Who is Madrid’s latest start turn? Alvaro Medran isn't 21 until next March and already he's a Champions League scorer. Born in Cordoba, he was missed by the biggest local club’s scouts but Madrid brought him to the capital. How long has Ancelotti had his eye on him? Alvaro Medran scored for Real Madrid during their 4-0 win against Ludogorets in the Champions League . The 20-year-old is congratulated by his Galactico team-mates at the Bernabeu on Tuesday night . When he was a Real Madrid C player last season Medran was already getting games for the B-team in Spain’s second division. Last summer he was taken on the pre-season tour, largely because Madrid bulked the squad out with youth-teamers because only 10 senior players were back from World Cup duty. But he impressed enough in training Stateside to debut against Inter Milan in Oakland. This season he has been a regular for the B-team but has already played 90 minutes in the Spanish Cup for the first time. What’s his profile? He has been likened to Isco and can certainly offer plenty going forward as five goals for the B-team show. He can play as a No 10 or in Madrid’s 4-3-3 either side of the central midfielder. He played to the left of Illaramendi in Real Madrid’s second-leg 5-0 cup win over Cornella last week. Medran has been likened to one of Real Madrid's other attacking midfielders, Isco . Manager Carlo Ancelotti has been keeping a careful eye on the midfielder in recent months . So there will be no stopping him now? A Champions League goal doesn’t always make for a Real Madrid career. Roberto Soldado scored in the competition while coming up from the youth team but had to leave the club to make a career for himself. But Ancelotti is a big fan of Medran and for as long as the Italian is at the Bernabeu he will have a chance. With James Rodriguez and Luka Modric currently out injured he is closer to the first team than ever. He will play out the rest of the season in the B-team if Madrid sign Lucas Silva in January, but he is expected to tour with the first team against next summer.","Alvaro Medran scored against Ludogorets on Tuesday night .

"Aaron Ramsey feels Arsenal should not fear anybody in the last 16 of the Champions League after his 'best goal' helped silence the critics as the Gunners won 4-1 at Galatasaray. The 23-year-old's sensational long-range half-volley - which was so good it was applauded by the home fans at the Turk Telekom Arena and started debates about great goals on social media - made it 3-0 after half an hour. Arsene Wenger's men delivered a commanding Tuesday night display in Istanbul with a much-changed side, showing no hangover from Saturday's 3-2 defeat at Stoke, which left them sixth in the Barclays Premier League. Aaron Ramsey (second left) celebrates after scoring a stunning goal against Galatasaray on Tuesday . Ramsey's superb effort added to his neat finish inside the area after 11 minutes, and followed Lukas Podolski's earlier opener for the visitors. It proved a popular talking point on Twitter, with Arsenal forward Yaya Sanogo looking flabbergasted after the ball flew into the top corner. At the other end of the pitch, goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny put his head in his hands in disbelief at what he had just witnessed. Wenger, meanwhile, had quipped in his post-match press conference, he felt to shoot from such a distance was 'not the right decision, but he proved me wrong!'. Ramsey had remained modest in his initial reaction, but having seen the sublime finish replayed over and over again, the Wales midfielder hailed it as the outstanding strike of his career so far. 'I have just seen it back, and I thought it was a lot closer, but it was quite far out and definitely my best goal now,' Ramsey said on www.uefa.com. Ramsey (left) fires a long-range shot towards goal as Arsenal take on Galatasaray in Istanbul . Galatasaray goalkeeper Sinan Bolat fails to stop Ramsey's thunderbolt into the top corner . Despite the impressive victory, Arsenal, who had surrendered a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht on the fourth Champions League match day, were unable to secure top spot in Group D, with Borussia Dortmund going through to Monday's draw as seeds. That means Arsenal could again face one of Europe's heavyweights in the knock-out stages next year, such as defending champions Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris St Germain or Bayern Munich. Ramsey, though, believes the Gunners - who expect to be boosted by the return of Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil by the next set of Champions League fixtures in February - can go into any such tie with confidence. 'We have done well, have qualified, we nearly came top of the group, but we finished off in style and hopefully now we will get a nice draw,' he said. 'On our day, we are capable of giving anyone a game, hopefully the draw is a bit more kinder to us this time.' Ramsey also scored Arsenal's second goal as he slots his shot past Bolat at the Turk Telekom Arena . Ramsey celebrates the first of his two goals in Istanbul as Arsenal ran out 4-1 winners . Both Ramsey and midfielder Mathieu Flamini were taken off at the break with minor muscle problems, but they are expected to be available for Saturday's tea-time kick-off against Newcastle at the Emirates Stadium. Podolski has been linked with a January move away from Arsenal following a lack of first-team opportunities. The German forward, who scored his second goal on the break deep into injury time, was happy to be back in action and helping the team. He told Arsenal Player: 'I had the chance to play and I always want to score, give assists and play well. 'For me it was important to play 90 minutes and keep going. It is not always easy to come in and do well, so it was good for me to do that.'","Aaron Ramsey scored a stunning long-range effort on Tuesday .

"England’s improbable quest to get back into this series was hampered by rain in Sri Lanka’s hill-country, but not before Chris Woakes confirmed his World Cup spot with six wickets. The match will resume on Thursday at 2.30pm local time (9am in the UK), with England needing 240 on a turning Pallekele track to reduce the deficit to 3-2 in this seven-match series. Since Sri Lanka have included four spinners in their team – including Sachithra Senanayake for his first game since remodelling an illegal bowling action – it will not be straightforward. Chris Woakes, celebrating getting Kumar Sangakkara, took six wickets in Pallekele . Woakes acknowledges the crowd after taking his fifth Sri Lankan wicket . Steven Finn celebrates taking the first wicket of the day after having Kusal Perera caught at slip . Tillekeratne Dilshan is bowled by Chris Jordan after a typically expansive innings . Woakes jumps for joy after dismissing Mahela Jayawardene, his first wicket of a fruitful innings . But the England management will take heart from the performance of Woakes, whose figures of six for 48 mean he can now boast two of England’s three six-wicket hauls in one-day internationals. Woakes claimed six for 45 at Brisbane in January 2011, but England’s best one-day analysis remains an unlikely six for 31 by Paul Collingwood against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge in 2005. And with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both set to return from injury in time for the World Cup, and Steven Finn having put his confidence-sapping Ashes tour behind him, the form of Woakes will convince England they can match other teams for seam-bowling depth in Australia and New Zealand. Woakes’s first spell had been a below-par three-over burst costing 17 after Finn had removed Kusal Perera third ball for a duck, caught by Chris Jordan at second slip. Alastair Cook then brought Woakes back for a two-over burst that produced the prized scalp of Mahela Jayawardene, driving carelessly to the reliable Jordan, this time stationed at a widish first slip. But it wasn’t until his final spell that Woakes cashed in. In 2.5 overs he claimed five wicket for 19 runs, including Kumar Sangakkara, caught at deep midwicket by Joe Root after a typically classy 91. Jeevan Mendis was caught and bowled after top-edging a pull on to his helmet, Senanayake was bowled, Thisara Perera caught at deep midwicket, and Ajantha Mendis bowled middle stump first ball. It meant Sri Lanka failed by six balls to bat out their 50 overs. If Woakes picked up the wickets, he was grateful to James Tredwell – back in the side after missing out on the last two games so the selectors could take a look at Ben Stokes. Tredwell conceded only 33 in 10 high-class overs and trapped Lahiru Thirimanne lbw for just eight – a useful retort to his puzzling omission from the fourth game on a turning pitch in Colombo. Sangakkara plays the ball through the covers on the way to his 91 . Sachithra Senanayak, the controversial spinner back in the Sri Lanka side, is bowled by Woakes .

Chris Jordan continued his rise with the prize scalps of Tillekeratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews, but the England attack again let themselves down by bowling too many wides. The 15 they sent down here took their tally for the series to a scandalous 56. Sri Lanka, in one innings fewer, have conceded 22. But that will all be forgotten on Thursday if England’s batsmen – minus Alex Hales, who has been left out for the returning Cook – can chase down the runs.

"Brendan Rodgers must take the blame for Liverpool's elimination from the Champions League, according to former Reds boss Roy Evans. The Merseysiders failed to qualify from Group B after being held 1-1 at home by Basle on Tuesday night when a win was needed to progress. Rodgers admitted his side didn't deserve to win and Evans believes the Liverpool boss got his tactics against the Swiss side. Steven Gerrard looks forlorn after the final whistle as Liverpool are knocked out of the Champions League . Brendan Rodgers must take the blame for Liverpool's defeat to Basle, according to former boss Roy Evans . Evans, speaking to the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on talkSPORT, said: 'The way we approached the game was a bit negative for me. We started the game - a game we needed to win – with a really low tempo. We didn't put them under pressure and I'm thinking, ""Go for them"" 'If you need to win, why not put them under pressure from the word go? We waited until we were down to 10 men with 20 minutes to go and then we throw everything at them. We nearly got there but why not do it from the start? That's the only gripe I've got. 'You can be too tactical, you can over think the whole thing. Sometimes you need to think, ""OK, we need to win this one game, go out and go for it"".' Basle players celebrate  as they begin to sense an upset at the home of the five-time European Cup winners . Gerrard and Lucas Leiva trudge back to the halfway line after the Reds fell behind through Fabian Frei . Evans managed Liverpool for four years before resigning in  1998 following the arrival of Gerard Houllier . Former Liverpool defender Steve Nicol believes the defeat and early elimination from the Champions League may have cost Rodgers his job and said: 'If things don't change then ultimately Brendan will pay the price. If this team keeps performing the way it is, I don't think they will have any other option [but to sack Rodgers]. 'We are not even halfway through the season yet and I'm guessing most people don't expect Liverpool to get into the top four. 'The biggest surprise is how bad the performances are. The result against Basle was a complete disaster on so many levels. The performance level, the fact they are out of the Champions League and the fact they now go into the Europa League, which is going to do nothing but harm them in the Premier League. 'You really wonder where this team is going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better and somehow it has turned the other way. It is a team that is completely rudderless. If you watched the game against Basle and the game against Sunderland, they don't look to have any imagination going forward, and defensively they look at odds. This is just a desperate time for Liverpool.' Head here to Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"Behrang Safari, the villain of the piece in Liverpool's Champions League exit, has insisted he did not dive to get Lazar Markovic sent off and claims he was 'bleeding from the mouth' after the incident. With Liverpool already trailing 1-0 to Basle in a game they needed to win to qualify for the knockout stagea, Serbian winger Markovic was sent off on 61 minutes - just 16 minutes after coming on - after flailing an arm in Safari's direction. The contact with the Basle defender was minimal at most as Markovic tried to escape his marker's attention, but when asked by Swedish newspaper Sportbladet if he had been caught, Safari insisted: 'Yes, yes of course. I was bleeding from my mouth.' Lazar Markovic pushes out his right arm towards Behrang Safari's face in the 61st minute of the match . Players crowd around Safari as he stays down after the contact from Markovic . The 29-year-old Swede added that he did not realise Markovic had been sent off until he was surrounded by angry Liverpool players. 'I wouldn’t have gone to ground if he hadn’t hit me. I am not the kind of player who dives,' Safari said. 'It was a bit strange, I didn’t realise that it was a red card first. 'I thought the referee had blown his whistle because it was a head injury and I thought I was going to give the ball to the Liverpool players afterwards. 'But then I noticed that the Liverpool players were angry with me.' Head here to Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers disagreed with the decision to send off the former Benfica forward. 'I thought the sending off was really disappointing decision by the referee,' he said. 'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that, his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.' Liverpool equalised on 82 minutes through a Steven Gerrard free-kick but could not find the winner that would have sent them through to the last 16 in Basle's stead.","Liverpool knocked out of Champions League after drawing with Basle .

"A year that promised so much has unravelled and left Liverpool with nothing other than cause for regret. The return to the Champions League was supposed to propel Liverpool back into the big time but their feeble exit at the group stage, with just five points and five goals to show for their six matches, has been like slipping from heaven into hell. Here, Sportsmail looks at the key dates during 2014 that have seen Liverpool's fortunes plummet. Brendan Rodgers' season with Liverpool has unravelled and left them with nothing other than regrets . April 20: Norwich 2-3 Liverpool . To think this was just eight months ago. Having beaten Norwich 3-2, Liverpool moved to within seven points of lifting the title. Brendan Rodgers had challenged his side to smash through the 100-goal barrier but, amid all that giddiness and euphoria, one key fact had been overlooked - Liverpool had automatically qualified for the Champions League. 'It was an incredible victory and big congratulations to the players,' Rodgers enthused. 'We can't finish lower than third and that guarantees Champions League football. 'I don't think anyone would have expected that. It shows the magnitude of the effort we have put in and the quality we have shown.' Liverpool striker Luis Suarez celebrates scoring against Norwich during the 3-2 win in the Premier League . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard celebrates as his team win 3-2 against Norwich on April 20 . Brendan Rodgers was looking to orchestrate another Premier League title charge this season with Liverpool . June 27: Adam Lallana arrives, Liverpool ready to sell Luis Suarez . The key date in Liverpool's summer. Having already brought in Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana becomes their most costly signing of the window on this day at £25million and they bid to sign Lazar Markovic from Benfica. What is more significant, however, is the fact Liverpool come to the conclusion that they are ready to sell their talisman, Luis Suarez, to Barcelona. The fee is good but the 31 goals he scored will not be easily replaced. Adam Lallana became Liverpool's most costly signing of the transfer window at £25m as they splashed out .

Liverpool finally signed a headline-grabbing centre forward. Mario Balotelli comes in at £16m and reveals his ambition is to win the Champions League at Anfield. Only three weeks earlier, though, Rodgers had 'categorically' said Liverpool were not interested in the Italian and the move smacks of desperation after they had missed out on Alexis Sanchez and Loic Remy. On the same day, Manchester City put Liverpool in their place, comfortably beating them 3-1. Balotelli, laughing in the stands, has struggled to fill the void left by striker Daniel Sturridge's injury at Anfield . Ankle ligaments - England vs Republic of Ireland (May 2013) Ankle ligaments - Missed nine games (December 2013) Thigh - during England training (September 2014). Missed six weeks . Calf - during Liverpool training (October 2014). Missed three weeks . Thigh - during Liverpool training (November 2014). Out for six weeks . September 5: Daniel Sturridge injured with England . During an England training session at St George’s Park, Daniel Sturridge – on whose shoulders there is great responsibility – damaged his thigh. It was an enormous blow for Rodgers, who needed the striker to take over Suarez’s mantle. He was expected to be out for four weeks but, almost three months on, he has not kicked another ball. With Fabio Borini out in the cold, Balotelli toothless and Lambert’s endeavour not enough, Liverpool’s struggles revolve around their lack of threat. Teams find them easy to play against. Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and will remain out until next year due to a thigh injury . The striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with England earlier this season in September . Sturridge scores for Liverpool during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on the first day of the season . October 1: Basle 1-0 Liverpool . The return to Champions League football had been tense and only a late Steven Gerrard penalty had secured three points against Ludogorets. They had gleaned no confidence, however, and they were wretched in Switzerland, losing 1-0 to Basle. Their performance was as startling as their garish yellow shirts. With two games against Real Madrid looming, Liverpool were on the back foot. ‘We came to win and I expected a win so it was very disappointing,’ said Steven Gerrard. ‘We didn't deserve anything. We were too soft all over the pitch. It hurts to say they wanted it more. We were second best against an OK team.’ Marco Streller scored the only goal of the game to seal three points for Basle in their Champions League tie .

With the season threatening to go into freefall and none of the new recruits making a significant contribution, Liverpool go to Crystal Palace – scene of their implosion in the title race in May – needing a win to boost confidence levels before they head to Bulgaria for a crucial game against Ludogorets. What they produce is something out of Rodgers’ nightmares. Palace win 3-1 and Liverpool bear no resemblance to the free spirits they once were. ‘This is more than just a poor start – there's something wrong,’ says Jamie Carragher. ‘Something isn't right. Last year when they came here, we said they were mentally and physically weak. Nothing has changed.'

December 9: Liverpool 1-1 Basle (out of the Champions League) They may have drawn the game but the result against Basle felt like the worst defeat of all for Rodgers and his team. Liverpool did not deserve to get through and their performance at Anfield was a sorry footnote to a European campaign that started poorly and got progressively worse. They did not learn and everything looked like it was too much for them. Rodgers picked the wrong team in Madrid, his defence could not hold out in Bulgaria and failed to produce when it mattered.

"Mauricio Pochettino hopes Emmanuel Adebayor will be able to return to Tottenham next week after the club allowed him to travel back to Togo for 'personal reasons'. The Spurs boss has confirmed the striker has flown back to his homeland to clear up a personal matter, and sources close to Adebayor insist it is due to a seriously ill family member. Pochettino expects Adebayor, who made the request to fly back home, to miss Sunday's visit to Swansea - but hopes the player can return to the club's north London HQ next week. Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been allowed to fly home from Istanbul by the club . Adebayor celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Tottenham against Newcastle in October . Mauricio Pochettino says the striker will miss the clash with Swansea but hopes he can return next week . 'I think that will be back before the Christmas period,' Pochettino said on Wednesday. 'We hope that he sorts his problem, I don't know how long he will be out but I hope he can start training soon. 'Yes, this is an important time, but we have to understand that players are people and need to fix problems. 'We know we have a lot of games, but the first thing is if the player is okay. We might miss three or four days of training with him but you win a lot because the problem is always in his mind and its difficult to break the cycle.' The Premier League club are certain to qualify for the Europa League knockout stages from Group C, alongside their Turkish opponents, and avoiding defeat would ensure they finish top. Adebayor has made 12 appearances for Spurs this season, but the former Arsenal frontman has not played since the November international break when Togo failed to qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. While Adebayor has endured struggles on the field; he has also had problems off it. The 30-year-old Togolese forward has struggled for form in a Spurs shirt this season . The former Arsenal striker shows his frustration during Tottenham's loss to Stoke in November . Adebayor reacts after a near miss against Aston Villa as the forward continues to struggle for form . In November, Adebayor's older brother Kola claimed the striker had been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch. Kola, 42, a truck driver based in Bremen, Germany, told the Sun on Sunday: '[Emmanuel] has been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well. 'They have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him. My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again.' Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition. Adebayor was then moved to deny accusations from his sister Maggie that he had kicked their mum Alice out of his house in Africa because he thought she had performed curses on him. Maggie claimed on radio station Peace FM in Ghana that the Premier League striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year. She said their mum was selling 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' to provide for her family however the star says his mother left the house of her own accord. Adebayor, takes on Algeria defender Essaid Belkalem for Togo during the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations . Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house. 'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing. 'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone. 'I bought a $1.2million house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?'

'I came on to the scene in the 2010 season and I played a lot of games, barely missing one, before this injury. 'So while it has been very difficult for me, in some ways it has been good for me to take a step back, have a look at things and try to work on my game.

"Afforded his first Champions League start of the season, Arsenal outcast Lukas Podolski took just three minutes to serve his case for more regular inclusion. In fact, so far has Podolski fallen in the pecking order at the Emirates, the Germany star has collected a World Cup winner’s medal in the time since he last took part in a Premier League match from the outset. But in Turkey on Tuesday night he reminded manager Arsene Wenger of his merit, arrowing home a ferocious drive with his first opportunity to put Arsenal on their way to a 4-1 victory over Galatasaray – the strike clocked nearly 80mph. Lukas Podolski hammers home Arsenal's opener early on against Galatasaray on Tuesday night . Podolski only offered a muted celebration after his first goal having made a rare start for Arsenal . His celebration, rather muted and moody, said much of his state of mind right now – this is what I can do, boss, any chance? It was his aggression which then paved the way for Arsenal’s second goal and, just for good measure, he crowned the win in the final minute, bookending a fine performance with two goals. That effort, though, left an impression, bursting from deep, swapping passes with a team-mate before coolly slotting into the bottom corner. This time, it evoked a smile. The goal was about skill, about desire, about proving a point given the platform to do so. The Germany forward coolly slots his second goal past Galatasaray goalkeeper Sinan Bolat . Just last month, a frustrated Podolski groaned: ‘I have to speak to [manager Arsene] Wenger because the situation at the moment is not good for me because I have to play, so we will see what happens. ‘I am happy at Arsenal and happy in London but the only thing is I don’t play. I don’t get the chance to play. I play always 10 to 15 minutes. I cannot be happy with this.’ All the while, Arsenal have struggled and Wenger’s position remains under intense scrutiny. Summer signing Alexis Sanchez has carried the Gunners for much of the campaign, without his 14 goals Wenger could well have been chased out before now. Sanchez is finding the back of the net every 133 minutes – there is only one player on the books with a better ratio this term, and that man is Podolski. Podolski has a better goals-per-minute ratio this season than any other player on Arsenal's books . Podolski, 29, has scored 31 goals in 55 starts for Arsenal in the last two-and-a-half years . Podolski applauds the travelling Arsenal fans at the end of the match . VIDEO Wenger pleased with 'dangerous' Arsenal . In the 300 minutes made up largely of second-half cameos and, of course, his 90 in Istanbul, the 29-year-old has scored three times. Indeed, from a total of 55 starts for the club, he has plundered 31 goals. That return makes for better reading than any of his offensive colleagues in north London. Yet still, Wenger appears not to trust a player who has won 121 caps for the world champions. The French boss maintains that the former Bayern Munich forward is not for sale in January and, after his exploits in midweek, admitted he was playing at a ‘strong level’. Strong enough for a start?

"The government's own watchdogs tried to hack into HealthCare.gov earlier this year and found what they termed a 'critical' vulnerability — but also came away with respect for some of the health insurance site's security features. Those are among the conclusions of a report released Tuesday by the Health and Human Services Department inspector general, who focuses on health care fraud. The report amounts to a mixed review for the federal website that serves as the portal to taxpayer-subsidized health plans for millions of Americans. The government's own watchdogs say they tried to hack into HealthCare.gov earlier this year and found what they termed a critical vulnerability . So-called 'white hat' or ethical hackers from the inspector general's office found a weakness, but when they attempted to exploit it like a malicious hacker would, they were blocked by the system's defenses. HealthCare.gov had some advance warning of the hacking attempt — a date range, but not specific times. HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis said the agency did not take additional precautions during that period. The report came on the heels of the massive breach at Home Depot stores, which affected 56 million credit and debit cards. The inspector general's office released a public version that summarizes detailed findings delivered to the Obama administration. It concludes that more work needs to be done to bolster security. Last week, the congressional Government Accountability Office released similar conclusions after its own review. HealthCare.gov was hacked this summer by non-government employees after the government conducted it's own tests but the administration said no consumer information was stolen. Instead, hackers installed malicious software that could have been used to launch an attack on other websites. 'We have not had any malicious attacks on the site that have resulted in personal identification being stolen,' Tavenner told Congress last week. Marilyn Tavenner, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week that no consumer information was stolen when Healthcare.gov underwent suffered a hack from outside the government this summer . HHS' inspector general found that the administration 'has taken actions to lower the security risks associated with HealthCare.gov systems' and consumers' personal information since the site first launched. But the auditors said they 'remain concerned' about the use of encryption technology that is not certified to meet certain government standards. Encryption refers to the encoding of data traveling back and forth between consumers and HealthCare.gov to make it more secure. In its formal response, the administration said it has taken other actions to resolve the encryption issue. The inspector general's office tried to break into HealthCare.gov in April and May. Experts used a technique called 'vulnerability scanning' and also conducted simulated attacks. 'Scanners simulate an outside malicious attack on the system and may identify ... vulnerabilities that could put a system's security at risk,' the report explained. 'Scanners use the same techniques as hackers, so the scanners test the security from an outside perspective.' HHS itself also runs similar scans regularly, part of its own security program. The hackers from the inspector general's office found one 'critical' vulnerability, described as a flaw that would let an attacker take over the system and execute commands, or download and modify information. But the office said that when its 'white-hat' experts attempted to mimic what a malicious hacker might try next, they were blocked by the system's defenses. Separately, the review also found two critical vulnerabilities in databases that support the website. Specific descriptions of the flaws were not released, but apparently none has been exploited by hackers. HealthCare.gov serves 36 states, while the remaining states run their own enrollment websites. The federal site had numerous technical problems when it was launched last fall and for weeks it was unworkable for most consumers. At the time, technical experts within HHS were concerned that full security testing could not be completed because the system was undergoing so many last-minute changes. Nonetheless, Medicare administrator Marilyn Tavenner issued a six-month security authorization for the site, keyed to an action plan for reducing risks. The inspector general's office also probed security for two state-run health care websites, the Kentucky exchange and New Mexico's small-business portal. It found that Kentucky, seen as a national model, sufficiently protected consumers' personal information. But there were some weaknesses in who had access to the system. White-hat hacking of New Mexico's site revealed 64 vulnerabilities. The office said it will keep monitoring security on HealthCare.gov and state sites.","A report released by a Health and Human Services inspector found that more work needs to be done to bolster security on the site .
Government watchdogs were otherwise happy, however, with the improvements to security that have been made to the site since its launch .

"At first glance, these stunning artworks look like the real life animals they portray. But a closer inspection reveals they are paintings made on a somewhat unusual canvas by a talented painter who transforms humans into amazing animals. From alligators to foxes and even owls, artist Shannon Holt, 39, paints every hair and fleck  on to models to turn them into wildlife. The incredible paintings, which take anywhere between six to 12.5 hours to complete, are part of her Florida Wildlife Series. Scroll down for video .

"Secretary of State John Kerry asked Congress on Tuesday for new war powers in the fight against the Islamic State, but said lawmakers should not limit U.S. military action to Iraq and Syria or prevent President Barack Obama from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary. 'The president has been crystal clear that his policy is that U.S. military forces will not be deployed to conduct ground combat operations against ISIL,' Kerry told a Senate committee, using the administration's preferred name for the terrorist group. 'It doesn’t mean that we should pre-emptively bind the hands of the commander in chief or our commanders in the field in responding to scenarios and contingencies that are impossible to foresee,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Secretary of State John Kerry asked  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force agreement that would give the Obama administration broader powers in its fight against ISIS . Obama has been unvarying in his statements on ground troops, stating on multiple occasions that he would not allow U.S. forces to become mired in another war in Iraq, even as his military advisers have admitted that a time may come when the president will have to put boots on the ground. The White House said on Wednesday that there is actually one instance in which the president already did 'commit ground troops...in a combat role in Syria.' Over the summer Obama ordered a rescue mission of American hostages, and that included boots on the ground, the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said. If Congress were to ban 'the use of combat troops, the president's hands would be tied, and he wouldn't be able to order a mission like that' in the future, Earnest claimed. 'And that is what we're seeking to avoid,' he said. Further explaining the administration's request, Earnest said, 'It's impossible for us to imagine all of the contingencies that could occur.' 'The president's been very clear that he does not envision a scenario where he is going to commit substantial U.S. ground troops in a combat role in Iraq or in Syria,' he said. In the battle against the Islamic militants, Obama has been relying on congressional authorizations that former President George W. Bush used to justify military action after 9/11. The Commander in Chief has insisted that he had the legal authority to send about 3,000 U.S. troops to train and assist Iraqi security forces, and launch hundreds of airstrikes against targets in Iraq and Syria since September. Critics say the White House's use of post-9/11 congressional authorizations is a legal stretch at best, however, and Kerry on Tuesday appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to tell lawmakers what sort of war powers the administration would like to see lawmakers include in a new Authorization of Military Force Agreement. The White House is now backing the creation of a new AUMF limited to the current military campaign that would, as Earnest said today, 'move the US away from a permanent war.' Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat and the the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined legislators from both sides of the aisle in lamenting that if the White House wants a new AUMF, it should have sent suggested language to Congress months ago. Nevertheless, the New Jersey senator said that, 'Congress, rather than the executive, has the responsibility and the authority to authorize military action and to declare war,' and it should not accede that power to the president by doing nothing at all. 'We are the check and balance on executive power, regardless of who that executive is. And if we abandon that role, then we will have done a grave disservice to the American people,' he said. Similarly, his Democratic colleague Tim Kaine of Virginia said Congress ought to pass new authorization immediately. Kaine said he doesn't want Congress to go home for the holidays while there are U.S. service men and women fighting overseas and risking their lives without putting their imprint on the conflict. 'We are at war,' Kaine said. 'Congress has been silent about this.' CodePink protesters held up anti-war placards as Kerry testified before the committee. The Obama administration officials asked Congress on Tuesday to grant the president the authority to put boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS if necessary . Menendez said he would call for a committee vote on a new authorization later this week. Yet few expect that Congress will approve new war powers before the end of the lame-duck session this year. The legislature is scheduled to recess for the holidays on Friday and will not resume activities until the first full week in January, when Republicans will  take control both the Senate and the House. 'Whatever passes out of committee this week is not going to become law,' Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the incoming chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday, recognizing the time constraints. He said the committee also wants to hear from intelligence and defense officials before its makes a decision. Kerry said the administration believes a proposal drafted by Menendez is a good starting point, but that the administration seeks some important changes. Generally, Kerry said the administration is seeking an authorization that does not include a geographical limitation. 'We don't anticipate conducting operations in countries other than Iraq and Syria, but to the extent that ISIL poses a threat to American interests and personnel in other countries, we would not want an AUMF to constrain our ability to use appropriate force against ISIL in those locations if necessary,' he said. The secretary of state said 'it would be a mistake to advertise to' the Islamic State militants that they have safe haven outside those countries. However, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a probable Republican presidential candidate, said he could not vote for any authorization that did not have geographic restrictions. 'That is a very scary and very wrong-headed message to be sending to the Middle East,' the libertarian lawmaker said. 'You are sending a message to the Middle East that no city is off limits.' Paul has proposed legislation of his own to the Senate that would formally declare war on ISIS and give the Obama administration the authority to put American troops in combat  in 'limited operations.' The one-year resolution would terminate a 2002 AUMF the Obama administration has been deriving its authority to attack ISIS from and introduce a one-year sunset into the other. Kerry said Tuesday that the confrontation against ISIS will not be over quickly, however, and that while the administration does not seek an open-ended authorization, it wants it to include a provision that would allow for it to be extended. Kerry debated back and forth with senators from both parties about the differences between what Congress is proposing for the AUMF and what the Obama Administration wants. Senators told Kerry that the administration should have come to Congress with its list of demands months ago . Menendez's resolution would limit operations to three years and allow ground forces in some circumstances. It also would compel Obama to provide Congress with a comprehensive strategy and repeal the Bush administration's 2002 Iraq war authorization. Kerry said the administration would agree that any new authorization would supersede the 2002 authorization. Moreover, Kerry said the administration wants to make sure that any authorization does not  too narrowly define militants found alongside ISIS because it would, for example, make it difficult for the U.S. military officials on the ground to identify enemy forces. Arizona Sen. John McCain, a strong critic of Obama's foreign policy in Iraq and Syria, called the hearing a 'kind of charade' because the authorization was not expected to become law before the new Congress starts in January. He said Obama needs to present a draft authorization to Congress in January. 'He should lead and tell us what that authorization should be,' McCain said. McCain further criticized the Obama administration for not giving the Syrian opposition the military equipment and weapons it needs to fight against Syrian President Bashar Assad who is 'slaughtering' his people.","Obama has stated on multiple occasions that he would not allow U.S. forces to join combat missions against ISIS, for any reason .

"It broke to Aaron Ramsey, 30 yards out and all alone; the Welshman sauntered up before unleashing the sort of effort stunning for its sereneness rather than overriding power. Tuesday night's finish - away at Galatasaray in a game Arsenal cruised through - ranks as one of the best in Champions League history. But where does it stand against the net-bulgers and fluent team moves witnessed since the competition's inception? Sportsmail takes a look. Aaron Ramsey celebrates after scoring his second goal of the night against Galatasaray . 20. Alan Smith (Leeds vs Lazio - 2000) Just look at that Mark Viduka flick. The big Aussie held off his marker on the edge of the box, waiting for the onrushing Smith - who'd started the move in midfield - and the striker poked home in the Stadio Olympico. Alan Smith was as cool as you like as he swept Leeds into a lead away at Lazio back in 2000 . 19. Stelios (Olympiacos vs Porto - 1997) The opening game of the 1997 Champions League, and Olympiacos set about gaining points. Porto attacked, the hosts broke and there was Stelios - he of Bolton fame latterly - to scream in an effort from 30 yards. 18. Shunsuke Nakamura (Celtic vs Manchester United - 2006) This was beauty personified. The Japanese stood over the ball at a hushed Celtic Park with the scores goalless before sending that pocket of Glasgow wild as they beat Sir Alex Ferguson's United. Shunsuke Nakamura bent a wicked free-kick over the Manchester United wall at Celtic Park in 2006 . 17. Dejan Savicevic (AC Milan vs Barcelona - 1994) Two to the good in the Champions League final, Savicevic put the game beyond Barcelona with a wonderfully weighted lob before Marcel Desailly wrapped up a 4-0 win. AC Milan's Dejan Savicevic celebrates scoring his team's third goal against Barcelona in the 1994 final . 16. Oscar (Chelsea vs Juventus - 2012) Back to goal, Oscar only needed one touch to take himself beyond Andrea Pirlo and Leonardo Bonucci before bending a wicked effort into Gianluigi Buffon's top corner. Oscar had clipped the ball beyond Andrea Pirlo before this effort soared into the Juventus net in 2012 . 15. Lars Ricken (Dortmund vs Juventus - 1997) The break was one in the '97 final, but Ricken didn't have an awful lot of options. Thirty-five yards out, he opted to audaciously chip Angelo Peruzzi in the Juventus goal and clinch victory for the Germans (and Paul Lambert). Lars Ricken scored this 35-yard lob as Dortmund went on to clinch the 1997 Champions League title . 14. Thierry Henry (Arsenal vs Sparta Prague - 2005) Nudge the ball out of his feet running the wrong way, stopping in his tracks and curling a shot with the outside of his foot across the goalkeeper. Classic Henry. Thierry Henry was in an improvising mood as he swept an effort home for Arsenal at Sparta Prague . 13. Paul Scholes (Manchester United vs Panathinaikos - 2000) What a team goal this was. Pass, pass, pass. Thirty later and Scholes caps a glorious move with a deft lob. What United fans would now give... Paul Scholes finished off the Manchester United move with this deft lob against the Greeks . 12. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (PSG vs Anderlecht - 2013) You could quite easily compile one of these lists for Ibrahimovic himself, but this has to be his best European strike. A few strides before viciously lashing home from way out. Zlatan Ibrahimovic plundered home this effort against Anderlecht in Brussels last season . 11. Marc Overmars (Barcelona vs Liverpool - 2001) There haven't been many better teams goals scored in the Champions League and this was all the more impressive given Barcelona were away at Anfield. Marc Overmars dances beyond Liverpool's Polish goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek in November 2001 . 10. Claudio Lopez (Valencia vs PSV - 1999) Technique, poise and power: the best goal Lopez ever scored. A long direct ball from halfway dropped over the Argentine's shoulder and he volleyed left-footed across the goalkeeper into the top corner. 9. Aaron Ramsey (Arsenal vs Galatasaray - 2014) So this is where Ramsey's effort makes Sportsmail's top 20 - a goal Arsenal fans will be talking about for some time. 8. Lionel Messi (Barcelona vs Real Madrid - 2011) Messi's individual brillince is unquestioned, but the magnitude of this Clasico makes his slaloming run through the Real Madrid defence all the more elegant. Lionel Messi completed his weaving run at Real Madrid by sliding beyond Sergio Ramos in 2011 . 7. George Weah (PSG vs Bayern Munich - 1994) Never a man to appear rushed, Weah beat a number of the German defence at his own pace before firing beyond keeper Oliver Khan at his near post. George Weah gallops over a Bayern Munich defender on his way to scoring a brilliant solo goal . 6. Dejan Stankovic (Inter Milan vs Schalke - 2011) An example of Manuel Neuer getting his rush goalkeeping role wrong but Stankovic still had to control a volley from the halfway line to get the ball above the stopper and into the San Siro net. Dejan Stankovic wheels away after scoring from the halfway line against Manuel Neuer's Schalke . 5. Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United vs Porto - 2009) Forty yards from goal away from home, three yards of space and only one outcome. An absolutely unstoppable strike. Cristiano Ronaldo scored from way out when Manchester United played at Porto five years ago . 4. Zinedine Zidane (Real Madrid vs Bayer Leverkusen - 2002) Another goal from a final and this was superb. From a standing start, Zidane took Roberto Carlos' looped cross on with his wrong foot and volleyed in at Hampden Park. Zinedine Zidane's volley in the 2002 final at Hampden Park is one of the greatest ever scored . 3. Juninho (Lyon vs Bayern Munich - 2004) Potentially the greatest free-kick taker of all time, Juninho beat Khan from 35 yards with a shot which was forever above the line of the crossbar and had the goalkeeper sprawling so far to his left that he bashed his head on the post. Lyon's players celebrate with Brazilian Juninho after his thumping free-kick away at Bayern Munich . 2. Ronaldinho (Barcelona vs Chelsea - 2005) Just marvel at the footwork. On the edge of the box at Stamford Bridge, desperately needing a goal at 3-1 down, the Brazilian shimmied his right foot this way and that before clipping a ball around Petr Cech. Ronaldinho had Ricardo Carvalho completed bamboozled by his footwork at Stamford Bridge in 2005 . 1. Mauro Bressan (Fiorentina vs Barcelona - 1999) The ultimate display of control. There a ball broke just inside the Barcelona final third during a scrappy piece of play and the midfielder - who only found the net twice for Fiorentina - performed a stunning bicycle kick to tee up a six-goal thriller. Rivaldo and Luis Figo scored for the visitors as the teams drew 3-3 in the group stage.

"An alleged Islamic hate preacher has been arrested over claims he is the terror mastermind who recruited the two Austrian jihad 'poster girls' and more than 160 others who joined ISIS.

It is claimed they now want to return home - but it is too late . The valuables had all been provided by Muslims radicalised by the preacher and his cronies in a network that reportedly extended across the country and into the rest of Europe. His arrest has been seen as a major blow against the terrorist group's activities. According to security forces, Ebu Tejma, whose real name is Mirsad Omerovic, not only recruited the two girls that became the public face of jihad - but was also involved in a further 166 defections of European youngsters to fight in holy war. It's also claimed he raised a 'significant' amount of cash for terrorists. Security service insiders claim that he was not only one of 200 leading jihadists, but was also one of the leaders of the so called 'Bosnian cell' based in the Meidling district of Vienna that was 'one of the most important logistic and financial support centres for jihadist activities in Europe', according to a 'Vecernje novosti', a local newspaper in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Austria has been concerned for years over fears that the country was becoming a hub for terrorist activities after inviting thousands of Muslim refugees into the country during the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. The moved provided a fertile breeding ground for Ebu Tejma and his network. The influential Austrian newspaper the Krone, claimed that 'there was scarcely a single recruit in Europe for Jihad in which he and his group were not involved'. Originally from the small Serbian town of Tutin, Tejma was known in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a preacher of hatred and intolerance, who very soon found himself allied with the extreme form of Islam known as Wahabism. According to Austrian anti-terrorism authorities, Tejma appeared on their radar more than three years ago, when he began uploading videos onto his YouTube channel. Hate preacher: Tejma would approach fathers at Friday prayers and tell them it was their duty to provide wives for fighters in Iraq and Syria, it is claimed . Although officially unemployed, he was observed driving expensive fast cars. For the past two years, intelligence officials have been tapping his communications, monitoring his phone calls and building up a picture of his network - which then prompted the arrests on Friday November 28. One of those connections is allegedly a direct line to the caliph of ISIS terrorism, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Investigators saw a constant stream of Salafist Muslims while monitoring the Altun Alem mosque during their operation on Tejma. Salafism is the fastest-growing Islamic movement in the world. It is rooted in the 19th century where it emerged as a way of combating the spread of European ideas and values. But in recent years, it has come to be associated with the jihad of extremist groups that advocate the killing of innocent civilians. Security services recorded a constant stream of Salafist preachers, often accompanied by Mujahedin fighters travelling up from Bosnia and Herzegovina, to the mosque and the imam has been appearing in online videos revealing that it is every Muslim's duty to join jihad if an Islamic state is under attack from non-believers. It is not even necessary to ask parents for permission, because even that normally essential parental duty takes second place to the duty to fight. This is exactly what happened in the case of Samra and Sabina, who left only a note for their worried parents. It was at underground mosques like these that the teenage girls were recruited and the signs were there that they were in danger even before they fled. Messages painted on the walls at school urging fellow believers to follow the call to jihad were traced back to the girls. Nobody heeded that warning until their parents discovered the notes in their bedrooms. 'Don't look for us, we have gone to fight in the holy war.' Vanished: The girls disappeared one day and just left notes to their parents in their bedrooms. 'Don't look for us, we have gone to fight in the holy war', they read . Jihadi brides: The two girls in their new life in a pic posted online. They attended sermons given by Tejma . Meanwhile, Samra and Sabina attended Tejma's sermons - in which he said it was a woman's duty to support men fighting jihad. Tejma would even approach fathers attending Friday prayers to tell them that he had many contacts looking for wives. Samra and Sabina were radicalised within a few short months and travelled to Syria to marry jihadists.Both girls have now revealed they made a mistake, and desperately want to return home. But they are married already, and also both reportedly pregnant, so the chances of ever returning home or indeed seeing their parents seem remote. Tejma and 12 others were picked up in the raids involving hundreds of officers. They have been remanded in custody for a further two weeks while the investigations continue. According to state prosecutor Hansjoerg Bacher, the charges they are being investigated over are on suspicion of membership of a terrorist organisation, in 'connection with the recruiting of young people for the civil war in Syria'. The lawyer for Tejma denies all the charges while police and prosecutors sift through the evidence, and begin questioning his associates. Publicly they say they have struck a major blow against a likely terrorist network - but the arresting officers are clearly worried that there may be others at large.","Ebu Tejma, 33, who lived in Vienna on benefits arrested over claims he recruited 166 young Europeans to join jihad for ISIS .

"When astronomers first discovered huge sand dunes on Titan a decade ago, they were baffled by their discovery - because Titan's winds were thought to be too timid to create them. But now scientists, using a wind tunnel on Earth, have discovered a remarkable process may be taking place that explains how they formed. Based on their research, the team discovered that on rare occasions the winds suddenly change direction and increase their speed by 50 per cent - but why they do this is, in itself, a new mystery. Scientists in Arizona have found an explanation for sand dunes on Titan. They say the moon's winds occasionally reverse and increase in speed. In this image the dark lines are dunes crawling across the surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon . Of the more than 150 moons in the solar system, Titan is the only one known to have an atmosphere, and in turn winds, on its surface. It also has windswept dunes on its surface that are more than a mile (1.6km) wide, hundreds of miles long and up to 300 feet (90 metres) high - about the size of Big Ben. But the appearance of the dunes on the surface  was a mystery, as not only were the winds thought to be too weak, but they also formed in the opposite direction to Titan's steady east-west wind. The latest research could finally explain this puzzling mystery of Titan - and it may explain winds on other bodies as well. The experiment was carried out by a team of scientists using a high-pressure wind tunnel at Arizona State University's Planetary Aeolian Laboratory. On Titan, where the surface temperature is -180°C (-290°F), the 'sand' is probably unlike sand on Earth, Mars or Venus. From the Cassini observations and other data, scientists think it is composed of small particles of solid hydrocarbons (or ice wrapped in hydrocarbons), with a density about one-third that of terrestrial sand. In addition, Titan's gravity is low, roughly one-seventh that on Earth. Combined with the particles' low density, this gives them a weight of only about four per cent that of terrestrial sand, or roughly as light as freeze-dried coffee grains. After two years of many models and recalibrations, the team discovered that the minimum wind on Titan had to reach speeds of 3.2mph (5.1kph) to move the sand. But this is 50 per cent faster than the average speed of wind on Titan's surface - suggesting their must be a hidden process taking place. 'Our models started with previous wind speed models, but we had to keep tweaking them to match the wind tunnel data,' said Dr Devon Burr from the University of Tennessee. 'We discovered that movement of sand on Titan's surface needed a wind speed that was higher than what previous models suggested.' From the experiment, and other atmospheric models, it has been deduced that the wind must reverse twice during a Saturn year - which is about 30 Earth years. The reversal happens when the sun crosses over Titan's equator, causing its atmosphere - and the winds - to shift. This not only causes the wind to blow in the opposite direction - west to east - but also increases its speed by the required 50 per cent, for reasons unknown. And the shift must occur very briefly, according to Dr Burr, which may explain why the Cassini spacecraft currently in orbit around the Saturnian system has not been able to detect this atmospheric phenomenon. Of the more than 150 moons in the solar system, Titan is the only one known to have an atmosphere, and, in turn winds, on its surface. It is seen here, covered in thick clouds, approaching the limb of Saturn (upper left), by the Cassini probe as it approached the Saturn system . The latest experiment was carried out by a team of scientists using a high-pressure wind tunnel, shown, at Arizona State University's Planetary Aeolian Laboratory. They used 23 different types of sand to come to the conclusion that wind speeds on the moon must occasionally increase in order to create the dunes . Dunes begin to form when the wind picks up loose particles from the ground and drives them downwind. A key part of understanding dunes is to identify the threshold wind speed that causes dune particles to start to move. Geologists have found threshold speeds for sand and dust under various conditions on Earth, Mars and Venus. But for Titan, with its bizarre conditions, this had remained unknown - until now. The scientists led by Dr Burr began their study with carefully designed wind tunnel experiments. 'We refurbished the high-pressure wind tunnel previously used to study conditions on Venus,' Dr Smith of Arizona State University explained. Titan's windswept dunes on its surface  are more than a mile (1.6km) wide, hundreds of miles long and up to 300 feet (90 metres) high - about the size of Big Ben (stock image shown) The high-pressure wind tunnel at Arizona State University's Planetary Aeolian Laboratory, shown, was originally built to simulate winds at the surface of Venus, where atmospheric pressures are about 90 times greater than on Earth. After modifications, it became the Titan Wind Tunnel . To recreate in the tunnel on Earth the wind conditions on Titan, the scientists had to increase the air pressure in the wind tunnel to about 12 times the surface pressure of Earth. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's 'water' is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. Dr Burr dedicated six years to refurbishing the defunct Nasa high-pressure wind tunnel to recreate Titan's surface conditions. She and her team then turned up the tunnel's pressure to simulate Titan's dense atmosphere, turned on the wind tunnel fan, and studied how the experimental sand behaved. Because of uncertainties in the properties of sand on Titan, they used 23 different varieties in the wind tunnel to capture the possible sand behaviour on Titan. And they compensated for the low density of Titan 'sand' and the moon's reduced gravity through numerical modeling. For simplicity, the wind-tunnel modeling ignored some factors, among them whether Titan dune particles are sticky. If they are, the paper's scientists note, then it will take yet-stronger winds to get the particles moving, and the contrasts will be even greater between the normal east wind pattern and the stronger west winds that shape the dunes. The new results should help in understanding atmospheric forces on other icy moons and planets with very thin or thick atmospheres, such as Neptune's moon Triton, Pluto or on comets. They can also help us better understand movement of particles in fluids in general. Particle flows are important in a wide range of situations, including coal-mine or grain-elevator dust explosions, environmental pollution and lubricants. Cassini radar has previously seen sand dunes on Saturn's giant moon Titan (upper photo) that are sculpted like Namibian sand dunes on Earth (lower photo). The bright features in the upper radar photo are not clouds but topographic features among the dunes .","Scientists in Arizona have found an explanation for sand dunes on Titan .

"A group of Merseyside nurses were treated to a Christmas surprise by Everton manager Roberto Martinez at Goodison Park on Tuesday. Taken on a tour of the stadium by club legend Graeme Sharp, the 28 nurses -  all Evertonians - were initially  at the home of the Blues under the pretence they were attending a corporate event. However, if one surprise wasn't enough, they were greeted by Toffees boss Martinez when they reached the Goodison dressing room. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez surprise nurses at Goodison Park . Everton manager Roberto Martinez surprised a group of nurses at Goodison Park on Wednesday morning . Martinez and Everton ambassador Graham Stuart (right) pose with nurse and 'Blue Hero' Mandy Cunningham . Each nurse received a 'Blue Hero' award and special gift from the Spaniard. The group were also invited for a special three-course dinner in the club's premier Dixie Dean Suite to reward them for their remarkable dedication to caring for the region's most vulnerable. Martinez said: 'It's one of those days that we, as a football club, are so proud to be able to give some good feeling back to many, many special people. What they do on a daily basis is so important and so vital for everyone in the community, for everyone in the city and Merseyside as a whole. 'For us to highlight many Evertonians that are special with their commitment and time on a daily basis and affecting so many families in the right manner and in special times is wonderful. Working in a hospital is a significant time for anyone, it always shocks you when you have to be in a hospital and people like the Blue Heroes that we recognise today make that time different and what they give back is quite unique. Martinez poses with the group of nurses who were handed a special gift from the Toffees boss . 'We've been delighted to be able to recognise them for what they do and wish them a very special Christmas.' Every hospital across the region was asked to nominate nurses who were fans of the blue half of Merseyside as Everton continue their 'Blue Crimbo' campaign, which sees the Toffees rewarding deserving members of the local community. The Toffees, already through to the knockout stages of the Europa League, host Russian side Krasnodar on Thursday night in their final group match.","Nurses received special gifts as part of Everton's 'Blue Crimbo' campaign .

"John Galliano, who was sacked by Dior in 2011 for a series of racist and anti-semitic offences, is getting set to unveil his first collection for Maison Martin Margiela. The shamed designer will showcase his first couture collection for the Belgian brand in London on January 12, according to WWD. According to a statement from the Gibraltar-born British fashion designer, the new collection will be presented 'exceptionally around tea time'  during London Collections: Men. Scroll down for video . Shamed Dior designer John Galliano (left) last week at the British Fashion Awards with his boyfriend Alexis, announced he'll present his first couture collection for Maison Martin Margiela in London next January . The reason he's coming home? He wants to go back to his 'formative years and his beginnings in the industry - and it is intrinsically related to the city’s traditional tailoring history and heritage', he says. The fashion site reports that around 100 fashion editors and friends of the designer are on the guestlist and anyone who misses it can see the collection by appointment during Paris couture week. John Galliano was hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiela in October after being sacked by Dior. The British designer, 53, was asked to leave his job at Dior after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he 'loves Hitler' and that her parents should have been 'gassed'. He then allegedly ranted to an Asian man sitting with her: '****ing Asian b******, I'm going to kill you.' Two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-Semitic abuse at the hands of the designer. Shamed: Fashion designer John Galliano sporting a clean look to publicise his new appointment; Right: Arriving at court in 2011 following a video which emerged of him spewing anti-Semitic and racist abuse . Face of Dior, Natalie Portman, was among those outraged by his remarks. At the time the Oscar-winning actress said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way. 'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' Dior owners LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders. He was later charged in court and given suspended fines of 6,000 euros (£5,250). Since then, Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013. A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his John Galliano brand, which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group. But Renzo Rosso, president of Only The Brave (OTB) group, which owns Maison Martin Margiela as well as jeans brand Diesel, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, would prefer not to dwell on the past. He said in a statement at the time of Galliano's hiring: 'This appointment marks a new era in the history of the Maison.' He also described Galliano as 'a visionary and non-conformist'. The line's founder Martin Margiela left his fashion house in 2009. Before that he kept a very low profile, rarely giving interviews. When he did, he preferred to do so in writing, and he would generally sign Maison Martin Margiela rather than his own name. Offended: Former Dior fashion designer John Galliano on the catwalk; Right: Face of Dior actress Natalie Portman was amongst those who found his comments deeply offensive . His brand's products did not carry the Belgian fashion house's name but visible white stitches instead as a signature. 'They hired the most visible designer to replace the most invisible designer, which is very ironic and funny and from that point of view, very much in the spirit of Maison Martin Margiela,' said Bea Ercolini, editor-in-chief at the Belgian edition of Elle fashion magazine. Since Margiela left, the label has been led by a team of designers. OTB acquired Maison Martin Margiela in 2002 and the brand, which now makes around 100 million euros in annual sales, has been profitable for just under three years. In 2013, OTB made total revenues of 1.6 billion euros.","Will show during London Collections: Men in January .

"It has all the elements of a traditional Christmas dinner from turkey and sprouts to roast potatoes, parsnips and pigs in blankets... but there's one big difference. This festive feast is served in a hot dog bun. The Christmas Dinner Dog is the invention of Mike and Emily Edge owners of the Splendid Sausage Company, Manchester and their head chef Samuel Longhurst. Scroll down for video . Chef Samuel Longhurst puts the finishing touches to Splendid Sausage Company's Christmas Dinner Dog. The £10 dish has a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll, topped with pulled buttered turkey, sprouts, bacon and chestnuts with Worcestershire Sauce. The structure is then drizzled with homemade gravy . The trio developed the idea from the 'Sunday Dinner Dog' they had been serving as a special every Sunday. The £10 dish consists of a beef and horseradish sausage in a white roll, topped with pulled buttered turkey. Next a 'sticky mix' of sprouts, bacon and chestnuts with Worcestershire Sauce, which helps hold the dish together, is added. Miniature roast potatoes and honey-roasted parsnips and carrots are then perched on top and three skewers inserted - two with mini Yorkshire puddings and stuffing balls and one with a pig in a blanket. The whole structure is then drizzled in hearty homemade gravy. Mini roast potatoes, honey-roasted parsnips, carrots, mini Yorkshire puddings, stuffing balls and a pig in a blanket complete the rest of the 1,500-calorie hot dog . Mike Edge, owner of The Splendid Sausage Company, serving the Christmas dog to customer Angela Fox . Mr Edge said: 'The Christmas Dinner Dog has been our most popular special by far. We've even had couples coming back especially to order it again. 'We love making themed dishes and we wanted to create an entire Christmas dinner in a hot dog but we knew we couldn't just chuck the sprouts on. 'It took a few goes to get right - some of the ingredients are quite high up in the finished structure so it overbalanced a few times until we started using the skewers.' Mr Edge and Mr Longhurts have also created a vegetarian version of the dish - a veggie sausage wrapped in seaweed, minus the bacon and pig in a blanket. While it sounds fairly gut-busting, Mr Edge says it's been popular with men and women alike and is by no means a 'man versus food' meal. He added: 'It's not especially calorific because it's not a huge dish, but I'd guess it contains about 1,500 calories which is the same as the average Christmas dinner. 'It's a manageable portion; i's not like you have to force feed yourself. Most people order a side dish too, like our Eggs Benedict fries. 'We wanted to try out something Christmassy but stay true to our hot dog roots. 'The dish was added to the menu a couple of weeks ago and we'll serve it up until we close for Christmas on the 23rd December.

"Off the coast of Australia, Killer whales are well and truly living up to their vicious name. Not content with preying on fish, seals and sea lions, orcas have been spotted attacking and killing Humpback whales, as well as Spinner dolphins. Researchers witnessed at least 22 individual attacks on Humpback groups near Carnarvon - and on at least 14 occasions the prey was killed and left to mercy of opportunistic sharks. Not content with preying on fish, seals and sea lions, orcas (pictured) have been spotted attacking and killing Humpback whales and Spinner dolphins. Researchers witnessed at least 22 individual attacks on Humpback groups - and on at least 14 occasions the prey was killed and left to mercy of nearby opportunistic sharks . The observations were carried out by Robert Pitman and his colleagues from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). They identified 19 Killer whales from three groups attacking Humpback calves, and in total, they witnessed 22 individual attacks on the Humpback groups. South African scientists have made four separate observations of individual Antarctic fur seals sexually assaulting adult king penguins as they tried to resist. Each of the four recorded sexual incidents showed the seal chasing, capturing and mounting the penguins. They then attempted to copulate for between two-and-a-half minutes and six minutes, before they are seen resting and trying again. The average copulation time was five minutes. Experts suggest it may have become a learned behaviour, because the incidents have occurred with different fur seals. And the incidents may continue, but the reasons why the seals have started to exhibit this behaviour are not known. The researchers speculated that the seals may be sexually inexperienced, or frustrated, or it may be an act of aggression. They may also have difficulty recognising female seal partners. They additionally used satellite tagging to follow an adult female up and down the western coast of Australia near Shark Bay. During a six-day period, the female and her group attacked eight Humpback calves, and at least three of these calves were killed. The team also spotted the Killer whales preying on Spinner dolphins, and during one particularly violent attack, the whales managed to kill two of the dolphins. The whales’ success was attributed to the fact they hunt in groups. Following a number of attacks on the calves, the bodies were torn apart by Great White and Tiger sharks in the area. ‘These events are so infrequently observed that documentation of even individual attacks continue to appear in the scientific literature,’ said Mr Pitman in Marine Mammal Science. ‘The prevalence of presumed killer whale tooth rake marks on the flukes and flippers of nearly every large whale species has been cited as evidence that attacks might, in fact, be fairly common.’ During the attacks, Mr Pitman and his team also spotted a number of defensive techniques adopted by the Humpback whales. They used coral reefs as a form of shelter and protection, and the mothers were also seen pushing their calves into shallower water. Mothers were also spotted lifting the calves out of the water and throwing them onto their backs to keep them out of harm’s way.

While others fought back using their tails, or travelled with ‘escorts’ - males that accompany the mother and calf through the water. ‘Humpback “escorts” vigorously assisted mothers in protecting their calves from attacking killer whales, and a white shark,’ said the team. ‘This expands the purported role of escorts in humpback whale social interactions, although it is not clear how this behaviour is adaptive for the escorts.’ Overall, the findings support the notion that Killer whales routinely hunt and eat other whale species.

During a six-day period, the female and her group attacked eight Humpback calves, and at least three of these calves were killed . ‘Reports of killer whales preying on large whales have been relatively rare, and the ecological significance of these attacks is controversial,’ continued the researchers. ‘We report on numerous observations of killer whales preying on neonate humpback whales based on reports we compiled and our own observations. ‘Overall, our observations suggest that humpback calves are a predictable, plentiful, and readily taken prey source for killer whales and scavenging sharks for at least 5 months a year.","Researchers tracked Killer and Humpback whales off the coast of Australia .

"Manchester United defender Chris Smalling will be out for two weeks after injuring his groin in Monday night's win at Southampton. The England centre halfl will miss Sunday's crunch clash with Liverpool in the Barclays Premier League at Old Trafford, the following week's visit to Newcastle and maybe the Boxing Day clash with Newcastle at home. Smalling's injury was the latest in a long line of muscle problems to afflict Louis van Gaal's squad this season, leading to suggestions there is a problem with the United manager's training methods. Chris Smalling will be out for two weeks after an injury sustained at Southampton on Monday night . Smalling is the latest in a long line of absentees at United, who have struggled with injuries all season . Former Manchester United assistant boss Mike Phelan has blamed Van Gaal’s fitness regime for the catalogue of injuries after  Smalling became the club’s 43rd casualty of the season. United are currently also without summer signings Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Luke Shaw, while Rafael and Phil Jones have just returned to training. Phelan, who spent 12 years working alongside Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, believes Van Gaal’s decision to bring in his own fitness specialist Jos van Dijk to oversee first-team training at the start of the season and give Tony Strudwick a broader role has led to the injury pile-up with so many players ‘breaking down’. ‘What’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time, so you have to look to the reasons why,’ said Phelan, who is now first-team coach at Norwich City. Manager Louis van Gaal has overseen a chronic amount of injuries since taking charge in the summer . ‘I think Manchester United changed their thoughts on the fitness regime. They looked at it a little bit differently. ‘Tony Strudwick, who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first-team. He understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit, how to keep them ready for competition. ‘Then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different. That may have had an effect. That one area has changed. ‘They’ve brought in new people with a different way of doing things. The intensity of training may be one thing – it may be too intense, or not intense enough – but obviously slight changes have been made with the present way of doing things. ‘I would have thought the squad is big enough at Manchester United, because they can go out and get players in, but obviously they keep breaking down and they don’t seem to be getting any better. They seem to get one back and lose another two.’","Chris Smalling picked up a groin injury at Southampton on Monday .

"Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor will play no part in Thursday's Europa League match against Besiktas. The Togolese forward has been given the go-ahead to leave Istanbul and fly home to deal with a personal issue. Tottenham announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning: 'We can confirm that Emmanuel Adebayor has been given permission to return home for personal reasons. This is a private matter and so we will not be providing any further comment.' Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been allowed to fly home from Istanbul by the club . Adebayor celebrates after scoring the opening goal for Tottenham against Newcastle in October . The Premier League club are certain to qualify from Group C alongside their Turkish opponents, and avoiding defeat would ensure they finish top. Adebayor has made 12 appearances for Spurs this season and has scored twice. The former Arsenal frontman has not played for Spurs since the November international break when Togo failed to qualify for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. While Adebayor has endured struggles on the field; he has also had problems off it. The 30-year-old Togolese forward has struggled for form in a Spurs shirt this season . The former Arsenal striker shows his frustration during Tottenham's loss to Stoke in November . Adebayor reacts after a near miss against Aston Villa as the forward continues to struggle for form . In November, Adebayor's older brother Kola claimed the striker had been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch. Kola, 42, a truck driver based in Bremen, Germany, told the Sun on Sunday: '[Emmanuel] has been brainwashed by these Muslim alfas - spiritual men - who prophesise when he scores goals and why he is not playing well. 'They have convinced him his sister and mother put juju curses on him. My mother is very sad. Every day she is crying. I just talked to her on the phone and she was crying again.' Juju is a word used in West Africa to refer to spells used as part of witchcraft. Juju is said to have started during the days of slavery but is still part of African tradition. Adebayor was then moved to deny accusations from his sister Maggie that he had kicked their mum Alice out of his house in Africa because he thought she had performed curses on him. Maggie claimed on radio station Peace FM in Ghana that the Premier League striker was refusing to give his mother money and has not seen her in over a year. She said their mum was selling 'polythene bags, padlocks and other things' to provide for her family however Emmanuel says his mother left the house of her own accord. Adebayor, in action for Togo, takes on Algeria defender Essaid Belkalem during the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations . Adebayor, speaking to Peace FM, said: 'I never sacked my mum from the house. She decided to leave the house. 'How am I going to be in touch with my mum if my mum is the one telling everyone that my work will not go forward, so I will just be on my side and do my thing. 'They should stop talking, they should stop doing Juju on me, they should leave me alone. 'I bought a $1.2m house in East Legon for the one talking and calling herself my sister. Can you imagine that sister went to rent the house without my knowledge?'","Emmanuel Adebayor will leave Istanbul to fly home .

"A diet consultant who stopped taking her own advice was so shocked by pictures of her 18st 7lb frame that she shed a third of her weight. Slimming World diet coach Liz McGuinness from Wallasey, Wirral, was so mortified by the snaps taken at a weight loss awards ceremony she embarked on a two-year health and fitness plan. Now the 44-year-old has lost 6st 7lb and inspired her father Richard Owens, 68, to lose 5st in the process. Scroll down for video . Liz's new diet and exercise regime has seen her go from 18st 7lb and a size 24 to 12st and a size 12 . 'I look back at pictures of myself from two years ago and think ""that's not me!""' says Liz, who has been a Slimming World consultant at her local Wallasey club for nearly 11 years. 'I wasn't following my own advice. But then I woke up one day and thought ""this is my life, it's not a game"". 'I used to always wonder what people were thinking about me, I never felt comfortable and I had no energy.' Describing her fluctuating weight as a 'constant yo-yo' Liz - who is the slimmest she has been since she was 18 - used to gorge on toast with lashings of butter for breakfast, a huge sandwich filled with meat, coleslaw and mayonnaise for lunch and pizza and garlic bread for her evening meal. In between, the trainer for the Department of Work and Pensions used to snack on chocolate, crisps, sweets, cake and ice cream. But transforming her body relied on changing her diet. 'It's about cutting out all the junk food and cooking from fresh,' Liz said. 'I still eat plenty and don't go hungry.' Liz, who is still aiming to lose up to two more stone, now eats a diet of healthy fresh food and exercises . She also attends a high-intensity Zumba class twice a week. 'It is filled with twentysomethings but I can keep up,' she said. The diet and exercise regime has seen her slim from a dress size 24 to a size 12 and a svelte 12st - making her eligible for the Consultant Of The Year prize at the upcoming national Slimming World awards - but she still wants to lost another two stone. Fortunately, her biggest motivation is close to home. Liz's father Richard Owens, 68, finally addressed his weight after undergoing a heart bypass two years ago. Liz's father Richard Owens has also shed 5st- meaning the father-and-daughter slimming team have lost a staggering 12st between them . He went to his daughter for help and managed to shed 5st thanks to attending her diet group, giving the father-daughter duo a combined weight loss of 12st between them. 'He's always been in my Slimming World class so we have inspired and motivated each other,' she said. 'We have got one of the biggest classes in Wirral and people look at us for motivation. 'People specifically come to my class and say to me and my dad, ""we're here because we've seen your pictures and you're both such an inspiration"".' Since losing the weight, Richard has won the Wallasey Slimming World group's Man of the Year and Mr Sleek of the Year awards. 'He learned he needed to help himself,' says Liz. 'I am so proud of him.' She added: 'With Slimming World it's all about taking the guilt away from eating and the freedom to eat certain foods freely. And everything is allowed in moderation.' Today Liz keeps her weight in check by eating fruit with yogurt for breakfast, dishes like homemade chicken fried rice for lunch and a wrap or stew for dinner. She also cut out wheat and gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye, which she says has made a big difference. Now if Liz and her boyfriend Paul Partridge, 52, go out to eat, she sticks to rice or salads. 'We still like to go out a lot but it's all about making wise choices,' she said. 'It's all about choice. You can't make excuses. 'There's long-term pleasure and then there's short-term pleasure and the most satisfying thing for me is the short-term pleasure of people saying ""who's that girl?"" and not the short-term pleasure of eating fatty foods. 'People keep calling me petite but I just can't get my head around it. My head needs to catch up with what other people are seeing.'","Size 24 Slimming World consultant's weight was a 'constant yo-yo'

Kelly, who has three children with her husband of 18 years Mark Consuelos, is famously petite at just 5ft 3in, and her athletic physique seems only to get better with age. And while she does try to break a sweat every day, the former All My Children star says her rock-hard abs come naturally. 'So much of it is genetic,' she said in the interview. 'I work out a lot, but the place I find I don't really focus on is my stomach because I've always sort of had a very strong core.'

Instead, she focuses on working out her arms and legs, which do require regular exercise to stay toned.

She added that she was born with a muscular physique, and that some people might find it 'objectionable'. 'There are people that like a curvy physique. I've never had a curvy physique and I will never have one. If I gained weight, I would just look like a larger more muscular version of myself... That’s just the way I'm built.'

'For the most part... I eat a very clean diet,' she says. 'I have lots of vegetables, I eat protein, but I really don't put a ton of thought into it.' To maintain a balanced diet, she stays active and avoids junk food - except for the occasional treat. The star revealed that she has a drawer in her home filled with candy for when Bravo host Andy Cohen visits, since he apparently has a sweet tooth.

Kate encourages other shoppers to adopt her way of thinking through her blog 'Domestic Goddessing on a Shoestring'. ROAST CHICKEN WITH GARLIC, GINGER, CHILLI, LIME AND CORIANDER . Serves four, at a cost of £4 for all ingredients . 1) Preheat oven to 190 degrees. 2) Finely chop a small piece of ginger, a few cloves of garlic, and two fresh chillis. 3) Zest and juice a lime. 4) Throw all the ingredients into a food processor with a small bunch of coriander, a glug of olive oil and blitz into a paste. 5) Using your hands, push the paste underneath the skin of the chicken and spread evenly over the breast of the chicken. 6) Rub the rest of the chicken with the remaining paste. 7) Roast the chicken for the correct time according to the weight of the chicken. 8) Baste with the juices from time to time. 9) Leave to stand before serving. Kate suggests popping some lime wedges into the oven just before serving - warming the wedges makes the limes even juicier and easy to squeeze. LAMB SHISH MEATBALLS WITH CHICKPEAS, COURGETTES, BANTAM'S AND QUAILS' EGGS . Serves two, at a total cost of £1.50, as the lamb was reduced to just 25p . 1) Fry the following in a shallow pan in hot oil: two cloves of finely chopped garlic, a teaspoon each of ground coriander, ground cumin, chilli flakes, ground chilli and shish seasoning, and a pinch of salt and pepper. 2) After two or three minutes add a finely chopped onion, a courgette diced into 1cm cubes and soften. 3) After a few minutes add a tin of chopped tomatoes, stir well and add a glug of white wine. 4) Remove the shish kebab meat from the skewers and combine with a beaten egg, chopped mint, and a dash of ground cumin and shish seasoning. Mix well and shape into meatballs. 5) Add the meatballs to the pan and space out evenly (I would have browned the meatballs before adding them to the pan but Mr Kate didn't bother and I didn't even notice!). 6) Add half a tin of chick peas and squeeze in the juice of half a lemon. 7) Simmer for 20 minutes over a low to medium heat. 8) Crack some eggs into the gaps between the meatballs, scatter over some fresh coriander and cover the pan with a lid or plate for about five minutes or until the eggs are cooked. 9) Finish with more chopped fresh coriander and mint leaves and a drizzle of olive oil. 10) Serve with warm bread. LEMON AND GARLIC SAMPHIRE . The samphire was 21p, the fishcakes 99p and the eggs were free from a friend, so this cost just £1.20 for two portions . Here's how she prepared the samphire: . 1) Rinse the samphire and leave to dry. 2) Very finely chop a clove of garlic. 3) Fry the garlic in a little olive oil over a high heat just until it starts to colour. 4) Add the samphire and stir continuously. 5) Squeeze over some fresh lemon juice to taste. 6) Add some freshly cracked black pepper. 7) Serve with fish cakes and a poached egg. VEGETABLE EGG FRIED RICE WITH CHORIZO . This rice dish came to just £1 for four portions . 1) Boil some rice according to the instructions - I like to use Thai Jasmine rice and buy in big 5kg bags to keep the cost down. 2) 2-3 minutes before the rice is cooked add in a handful of frozen peas or sweetcorn. 3) Drain the rice and peas/sweetcorn and leave to one side. 4) Chop into cubes whatever veg you need to use up. 5) Heat some oil in a wok or large frying pan and stir fry the chopped veg for a few minutes. 6) Once the veg is ready create a well in the bottom of the pan by pushing the veg to the sides. 7) Beat 1-3 eggs (depending on how much rice and veg you're cooking) and then pour the egg into the well. 8) Stir the egg quickly until it's turned into a scrambled egg consistency and then fold into the veg. 9) Add the rice and peas/sweetcorn to the pan and give it all a good mix. 10) Serve with some chopped fresh coriander or other herbs on top if you have some and sprinkle soy sauce to taste.

"A heroic cat could win an award after rescuing his five-year-old owner from bullies who pushed him to the ground as he played with his younger brother. The moggy named Smudge pounced on the chest of one of the boys after he saw frightened Ethan Fenton being pushed to the ground outside his home in Doncaster. The boy and his friends were so shocked by the tabby cat’s actions that they ran away crying leaving Ethan and his two-year-old brother Ashton alone. Scroll down for video . Ethan Fenton, five, with pet cat Smudge, who rescued him from bullies trying to pick a fight outside his home . Mother Sharon Fenton, 26, who witnessed the attack said: ‘I was keeping an eye on the boys who were playing football in the front garden. ‘I saw three boys who were much taller and older than Ethan walk over to our front gate. ‘I heard them shout Ethan’s name twice but he ignored them and just put his head back down and kept playing with Ashton. ‘But then they shouted him again and then one of the boys got in Ethan’s face and said “Oi! Why are you ignoring me?” and pushed him over. Sharon Fenton, 26, (pictured with heroic cat Smudge and son Ethan) said she heard bullies shout 'Oi! Why are you ignoring me?' and then push him over . ‘That’s when I rushed outside and saw Smudge fly out from under our car and jump on the boy’s chest. ‘I think it was shock more than anything but the boy stumbled backwards, burst into tears and then ran off.' Miss Fenton, who is a part time hairdresser, bought Smudge after being left heartbroken when the cat they had for just 18 months died. The cat they had originally picked out was sold before they were able to pick it up and so found ginger and white moggy Smudge when he was 10-weeks-old. ‘When they showed us Smudge it was just love at first sight,' she said. ‘He was so small and cute and I knew we just had to have him.’ The family, who are from Doncaster, have had Smudge for three years but had never before seen his heroic alter ego.

"The explosive Senate Committee torture report could open the floodgates for costly lawsuits against the U.S., Britain and any other countries complicit with the CIA's so-called 'enhanced interrogation' programme, top lawyers have warned. Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres said yesterday's report did not contain any surprises, but suggested that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have far more evidence to back any legal action. Human rights lawyers are currently working their way through the 525-page report, which confirmed the existence of secret CIA prisons around the world, in the hope of finding material that could provide the breakthrough needed to revive dormant and failed lawsuits launched by detainees. Scroll down for video . Implications: Experts who have spent years working at American detention centres such as Guantanamo Bay (pictured) say that now detainees' torture allegations are supported by an official government report, claimants have a huge amount of new official material can be used to back their legal claims . Previously, private claimants and international non-governmental organizations have found it incredibly difficult to win legal challenges alleging illegal interrogation by the CIA and its allies. This is largely because, until now, the U.S. government has insisted that all details of the detentions and related extraordinary rendition hearings were state secrets, and therefore not valid evidence. But now that many of the individuals' allegations have been confirmed as true by the Senate Committee report, a huge amount of new and official material can be used to back future claims. 'One of the tragedies about this is the attempt to find redress,' Andrea Prasow, a senior official at Human Rights Watch told Bloomberg. 'Judges have accepted the state secrets claim. Now it will be much harder to do that when we all have access to a 500-page public report that details a lot of this,' she added. Chained and kneeling: Al Qaeda and Taliban detainees captured in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks were transferred to the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba . The chances of an American court reopening civil or criminal charges against senior CIA officials remains slim, as the Justice Department has already carried out its own investigations into the agency, which only led to the prosecution of low-level employees and contractors. However a far more realistic prospect it that former detainees could launch legal action against Bush administration officials in European courts under the rules of universal jurisdiction. Universal jurisdiction allows states or international organizations to claim criminal jurisdiction over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of residence, or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. 'After reviewing this report, we will give consideration to reopening petitions or filing new petitions in European courts under the principles of universal jurisdiction,' said Baher Azmy - the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, which has previously represented Guantanamo detainees. 'The comprehensiveness and detail of this declassified report is thorough evidence of a criminal conspiracy of U.S. officials to torture dozens of human beings,' he added. Global: At its height, the CIA program included secret prisons in countries including Afghanistan, Thailand, Romania, Lithuania and Poland — locations that are referred to only by color-themed codes in the report . Britain is expected to be among the countries where former detainees launch legal action over the government's alleged complicity in the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation techniques'. One example would be in the case of Libyan Islamist politician Abdel-Hakim Belhaj who, in a joint MI6-CIA operation in 2003, was snatched along with his wife from their home in Bangkok, Thailand. Belhaj was flown back to Libya where he faced years of torture in one of then-leader Muammar Gaddafi's notorious prisons as punishment for his conservative views. Cori Crider, who represents several people who were rendered to CIA-run prisons in the early 2000s, told Time: 'The British government has always said those cases cannot go to trial because 'it will damage our relations with the U.S.' 'But if the Senate is involved in a very detailed examination of torture, that excuse by the British government is exposed for the kabuki that it is,' he added. Threat: Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Mamdouh Habi is the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the torture report . Earlier an Australian man who was held at Guantanamo Bay without charge for three years has become the first person to threaten to sue over his detention since the release of the report. Mamdouh Habib was arrested in Pakistan in October 2001 and deported  to Egypt, where he says he was tortured for five months before being transported to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Mr Habib said he was happy that yesterday's U.S. Senate Committee report concluded that the CIA's use of 'enhanced interrogation' techniques on suspected terrorists amounted to torture and had failed to produce any information that could be used to prevent imminent terror attacks. He also warned that he intends to reopen his legal cases against the U.S. and Australian governments - the latter of which Mr Habib claims was effectively complicit in torture when it failed to prevent his extraordinary rendition from Pakistan to Egypt. Mr Habib has been attempting to sue the Egyptian government over his rendition, detention and alleged torture, but his case collapsed just two weeks ago when the Australian government refused to verify that the documents he was using to present his case to the Cairo court were official. His lawyers had been given five days to present the verification, but a lawyer for the Australian government told the court that they have invoked their right to diplomatic immunity and refused to take part in the hearing. The documents Mr Habib had wanted to present in the Cairo court had already been accepted in Australian investigations and legal proceedings to prove that both the Australian and Egyptian governments were aware  of where he had been taken after the CIA transported him from Pakistan. A 2011 investigation carried out by Australia's Inspector-General of Intelligence Services concluded that officials in both Australia and Egypt were aware of his detention there, and resulted in Mr Habib been paid an undisclosed amount of money to drop his case against them. Comment: Moazzam Begg told Sky News this morning that CIA 'torture' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of Islamic State and that releasing details of it wouldn't help . Mr Habib believes that the release of the CIA torture report gives him enough grounds to reopen his case against both the Egyptian and Australian governments, and also to pursue new claims against the United States itself. The 59-year-old was arrested by the CIA in Pakistan just one month after the September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attacks in New York. He was held and interrogated in Egypt for a year before being transported to Guantanamo Bay, where he was detained for three years without charge before eventually being released. The Australian government were subsequently forced to charter a A$500,000 plane to return Mr Habib to home soil as the U.S banned him leaving the country on a commercial flight, despite the fact he has never been charged with terrorism offences. Horror: Moazzam Begg was then held for nearly three years at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba (pictured), where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation . This morning a former British inmate of Guantanamo Bay said CIA 'torture' of terrorism suspects had fuelled violence and the rise of Islamic State and that cataloguing it wouldn't help. Moazzam Begg also said the release of the report, which included graphic details of 'enhanced interrogation' techniques used by the CIA, would do nothing to assuage anger about such actions across the Muslim world. 'I don't think it will be teaching us anything we didn't already know,' Begg said. 'It doesn't make anything better.' He said examples cited in the report of brutality by CIA interrogators at secret prisons around the world 'can only produce one result - false evidence, more hatred'. Begg was then held for nearly three years at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where he said psychological tortures included execution threats and light deprivation. He also claimed to have been kept in solitary confinement for almost two years. During his detention, Begg said he was subjected to the sound of a woman screaming in a nearby cell whom he believed to be his wife under torture. He said he was told he'd be sent to Syria if he didn't cooperate, and that he saw two people being punched and kicked to death by U.S. soldiers. A UN envoy and human rights groups have demanded that senior officials in the administration of George W Bush are prosecuted over the 'brutal' interrogation of Al Qaeda suspects. UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism Ben Emmerson said it was clear that criminal techniques revealed yesterday in the Senate Committee so-called 'torture report', had been a 'clear policy orchestrated at a high level'. Mr Emmerson said senior officials from the Bush administration who had been involved in planning and sanctioning the crimes must face legal action. He added that CIA and US government officials responsible for torture such as waterboarding should also be prosecuted. 'As a matter of international law, the U.S. is legally obliged to bring those responsible to justice,' he said in a statement made from Geneva. 'The US attorney general is under a legal duty to bring criminal charges against those responsible,' Mr Emmerson added. Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth said that the CIA's actions were criminal 'and can never be justified', adding: Unless this important truth-telling process leads to prosecution of officials, torture will remain a 'policy option' for future presidents.'","Experts say yesterday's Senate torture report provides wealth of new and official material to support fresh legal claims by CIA detainees .

"Peugeot has revealed plans to begin selling the first air powered car next year. Based on a Peugeot 208, it will combine a normal engine with a radical new system that runs on compressed air. The firm says the car could reduce petrol bills by 80% when driven in cities. Saving the planet: The Hybrid Air technology could allow a car the size of a Citroën C3 or Peugeot 208 to emit as little as 69g/km of CO2 . The system combines a gasoline engine with an air engine which is used at speeds under 70mph . The system works by using a normal internal combustion engine, special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy. This enables it to run on petrol or air, or a combination of the two. Air power would be used solely for city use, automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving’. The system works by using a normal internal combustion engine, special hydraulics and an adapted gearbox along with compressed air cylinders that store and release energy. This enables it to run on petrol or air, or a combination of the two. Air power would be used solely for city use, automatically activated below 43mph and available for ‘60 to 80 per cent of the time in city driving’. By 2020, the cars could be achieving an average of 117 miles a gallon, the company predicts. The air compression system can re-use all the energy normally lost when slowing down and braking. The motor and a pump are in the engine bay, fed by a compressed air tank underneath the car, running parallel to the exhaust. The revolutionary new ‘Hybrid Air’ engine system – the first to combine petrol with compressed air – is a breakthrough for hybrid cars because expensive batteries will no longer be needed. Lift-off: The air power will be automatically activated below 43mph and can be used for up to 80 per cent of driving time in urban areas . Spacious interior: Allows for full-sized passenger compartment without surrendering boot volume. Driving comfort and road handling: Hybrid Air promises to deliver nimble response with the boost effect as well as first-class road handling thanks to its automatic transmission. Worldwide potential: The technology is viable in all markets, making it possible for energy efficient cards in all types of climate and regardless of the state of the roads. Boot: No space for a spare tyre once the Hybrid Air motor is installed. Cars fitted with Hybrid Air will be about £1,000 cheaper to buy than current hybrid models. For more than two years, 100 elite scientists and engineers have been working on the air-powered car in top-secret conditions at Peugeot’s research and development centre at Velizy, just south of Paris. Hybrid Air is the centrepiece of Peugeot chief executive Philippe Varin’s efforts to restore the fortunes of the historic car maker. The revolutionary system will be able to be installed on any normal family car without altering its external shape or size or reducing the boot size, provided the spare wheel is not stored there. From the outside, an air-powered car will look identical to a conventional vehicle. A spokesman said: ‘We are not talking about weird and wacky machines. These are going to be in everyday cars.’ Peugeot, which unveiled its prototype yesterday, envisages introducing it in smaller models such as the 208 at first. Running on air: The Peugeot 208 is one model that may use the air engine technology in future . The company said that as well as being greener and cheaper to run, the air system created no extra dangers in a collision. Motorists never run the risk of running out of compressed air late at night on a deserted country road because the car will be fitted with a sophisticated artificial brain that ensures it replenishes itself automatically. The air compresses and decompresses of its own accord as the car speeds up and slows down. The Peugeot company was founded in 1810 and the family still has a controlling stake. Thierry Peugeot drafted in Varin - widely hailed in the UK for rescuing Corus, the former British Steel, from the brink of ruin - in 2009. Varin’s attempts to revive the marque have been hit by the euro meltdown and militant French unions. a compressed air cylinder next to the exhaust of the new car . Worldwide sales for 2012 were down 8.8per cent to 2.82m. The company has been hindered in efforts to improve its performance by France’s rigid labour laws. It has also been plagued by violent industrial action at its Aulnay plant near Paris which is due to close next year with the loss of thousands of jobs. It is embroiled in controversy with rival European car makers over a French state guarantee given to its financing arm last year.","Peugeot Citroen invents technology for air car ready for the market by 2016 .

"It may look like a heart-stopping commute but for villagers living in Yushan in China this cable car is their umbilical chord to the outside world. The one kilometre line carries supplies and people daily, saving the mountaintop community from making a grueling one day journey down into the valley and then up the other side over a narrow and dangerous pathway. The cables are strung between two high cliff faces with a steel cage suspended below to carry visitors, locals and tools in and out of the village. Terrifying: Villagers from mountain top settlement travel along 1km cable car suspended 1,575ft above valley . Cable allows those living in the village of Yushan in Hefeng county in China's Hubei province to go to school . The village is in a staggeringly beautiful location but it gets  few visitors as most people do not want to risk the precarious zip line stretching for a dizzying 1,575ft above the valley floor. People have been living in the village of Yushan in Hefeng county, in China's Hubei province, for hundreds of years, keen to exploit the fertile soil and the safety provided from their mountaintop location. Risky business: Lubricating the cables once a week is the most dangerous part of the maintenance job . Until recently, villagers rarely needed to access the outside world for anything other than buying tools . Lifeline: Since it has been built it has been operated and maintained by local man Zhang Xinjian, 35 . Until  recently, inhabitants rarely needed to access the outside world for anything other than buying tools and kept themselves to themselves. But with the arrival of the modern world, televisions, mobile phones and computers became a prerequisite and people simply wanted to work in jobs outside the village, and that changed. The cable car itself is homemade and the cable was bought second hand from a European ski resort . While it could have spelled disaster for the remote community, a local, inspired by Alpine cable cars, came up with the idea of building their own. They bought a second-hand cable from a ski resort in Europe and connected it to a homemade cable car. The journey takes just a few minutes, as opposed to a day, meaning the children can get to school and adults to work. Coming in to land: People have been living in the village of Yushan  for hundreds of years . Village elder Xiong Sun, 79, said: 'Our lift, of which we are enormously proud and which has been running without problems for almost two decades, means that life can go on as it would in any normal village despite the fact that Yushan is located where normally only eagles would be prepared to make their homes.' A few people can travel in the  cabin at a time and it gives passengers an astonishing view of the mountains . Village elder Xiong Sun, 79, said the community was 'enormously proud' of the transport link . Xiong Sun added that in the two decades the lift has been running there have been no operational problems . Since it was built it has been operated and maintained by local man Zhang Xinjian, 35, who said  even when he was sick he was expected to turn up for work because otherwise everybody would be stranded. He said: 'I started to work at this spot since the rope was set up. No one else would take the job. As my father was the village head he had to assign me to do it and I've been doing it for 15 years.' Lubricating the cables once a week is the most dangerous part of the job. Zhang has to take the cart and apply oil onto the cables along the way.","Yushan village in China's Hefeng county built cable car two decades ago .

"Nero the dog is not only man’s best friend – he is his best travel companion as well. Adventurous Joshua Sivarajah, 34, took his pet dog along for the ride as he cycled around Britain on a bike that was modified to include a seat for his four-legged travel mate. The four-month adventure saw the pair explore the most beautiful places in the country – from Cornwall to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. Joshua Sivarajah, 34, cycled around the UK with his pet dog, Nero, perched on a seat attached to the back of the bicycle . The four-month adventure saw the pair explore the most beautiful places in the country – from Cornwall to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland . The original plan called for Nero to run alongside his master but the dog injured his paws on the very first day of their journey. Instead of leaving his pet behind, Joshua found a welder who added a shelf to the back of the bike for Nero to sit on. Joshua said he gave up everything to go on the adventure and he couldn’t think of anyone better to bring along for the epic ride. He said: ‘I grew up reading books like CS Lewis and Tolkien. I wanted an adventure of my own. I gave up my job, my house and my possessions. Following the success of his UK trip, Joshua Sivarajah now plans to take Nero around Europe on the modified bicycle . ‘All I have to my name is Nero, a tent, cooking stove, some clothes and some trainers. ‘Nero is my best friend. When I went to see the litter he was the only puppy that ignored me. I was determined at that point to make him love me. ‘He is my best friend and with me all day, every day. Nero is my dog, friend, companion and soul mate. This has been one great adventure.’ The original plan called for Nero to run alongside his master but the dog injured his paws on the very first day of their journey . Joshua, who used to run his own sales company, decide to pack his bags and leave his life in Southampton behind in July. The pair travelled 2,500 miles in four months, covering the length and breadth of the UK, including Cornwall, Bristol and the Pembrokeshire coast. They also made it to Ireland, thanks to the help of a fisherman, before exploring the Outer Hebrides in Scotland. 'Best friend': Nero catches some rest during the pair's journey, which covered 2,500 miles in a little over four months . But the trip took an unexpected twist early on when Nero burned his paws on the hot ground amid hot weather on the first day of their adventure. Joshua then took the decision to make alterations to the bike to enable Nero, who he has had since he was eight weeks old, to continue the mammoth trip. He said: ‘We met an ironmonger in Whitby who saw Nero on the bike. ‘When I explained what we were doing, he made and welded a shelf to the back of the bike for Nero to sit in. Joshua Sivarajah says Nero attracted a lot of attention as they met strangers who invited them into their homes for an overnight stay or meal . ‘He’s not strapped in, for him it’s like being a passenger on a motorbike. He’s only fallen off once, and that was when he went to sleep.’ Joshua and his four-legged friend ‘free camped’ out most nights, setting up their tent in parks, on farmland and by rivers. Their journey so far, including his food costs, have been funded via a Go Fund account - with money coming from people who heard of his story online about his travels. He has also secured sponsorship for his phone and gadgets, so he can post updates on a series of blogs.

Many people have invited me into their homes to stay or for a meal. ‘Having Nero with me is a great conversation starter and the people we meet always want to find out more about him and what we are doing. ‘Nero and I, have many more wonderful and exciting adventures planned.

"The former head of the CIA has offered an unflinching defense of the horrific treatment of terror suspects outlined in a US Senate report - saying intelligence officers were carrying out 'nation's will' and had developed a 'social contract with the America people.' Michael Hayden also blasted the Senate torture report, which detailed horrific abuse of detainees at the hands of CIA operatives, as a one-sided 'prosecutor screed' and said it was the result of a partisan investigation that began with a 'predetermined outcome.' 'Let me be very candid. We thought we were doing the nation's will. And in fact, having lived through the period and even looking back on it now. I think this was indeed about the nation's will,' Hayden, who served as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency under George W Bush from 2006 until 2009, said on MSNBC on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Former CIA Director Michael Hayden is vigorously defending the agency's torture of terror suspects and has said the dirty work was the will of the American people . 'And what you've got here is a small group trying to say, ""Oh it was never about us. It's them. They did it."" Frankly, that really is hypocritical.' When asked how he knew it was the desire of the American people top carry out torture he said: 'We've got a system. We get to elect a president, we get to elect a Congress. We have an attorney general. 'These activities, the President authorized them. The Congress was briefed, without objection, and we carried them out. 'How else are we supposed to know the nation's will? You want a plebiscite on convert activities?' He also hit back against claims from the Senate report that torture wasn't effective in extracting meaningful intelligence. He told Fox News: 'These interrogations … gave us kind of a Home Depot-like storage of information on Al Qaeda on which we relied. We are still relying on it today.' In an interview with Politico he said that before his 2007 Congressional testimony, he demanded the truth about the efficacy of torture from his underlings at the CIA. He said he told his deputy director: ‘Don’t f*** with me. If this story isn’t airtight then I’m not saying it to Congress.’ 'They came back and said our version of the story is correct. Because of this program (Abu) Zubaydah begat KSM, who begat others. We learned a great deal from the detainees.' Zubaydah, a Suadi national who was water boarded 83 times, ran a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan and has been described as one of Osama bin Laden's top aides. KSM, or Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was the principle architect of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the US. Hayden, who has been accused of lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation program,' also criticized Tuesday's Senate report. 'I don't know that the report that was released yesterday is that historically accurate. It reads like a prosecutorial screed rather than a historical document,' he told NBC's Today show. He said on MSNBC: 'They opted for the 6 million document fish in order to pull out of things, perhaps out of context, in order to make what appears to be a predetermined point.' Hayden, a retired US Air Force general, has been accused to lying to Congress during his 2007 testimony about the enhanced interrogation program. He says he never lied . The 6,000 page Senate report was written entirely by Democratic staffers after nearly every Senate Republican refused to be involved in the investigation. Republicans issued a rebuttal to the report, calling it sloppy and partisan. Hayden still maintains that what CIA officers carried out was not torture - and that it was legal and approved by the White House, the Attorney General and select members of Congress who were briefed on the matter. Former Deputy Director of the CIA Mike Morrall told CBS News: 'One of the reasons I react so strongly, as does George Tenet, to people calling it torture, was that the Department of Justice told us at time, this is legal, this is not torture. So when people call it torture, I react strongly because it says my officers tortured people -- they did not torture anybody.' Nearly all of the horrific behavior detailed in the Senate torture report happened before Hayden was CIA Director - though he served as head of the National Security Agency from 1999 until 2005 and then Deputy Director of National Intelligence from 2005 until his 2006 appointment as the head of the CIA. He also denies that he lied to Congress during his 2007 testimony and offered a counter-punch - saying that Senator Dianne Feinstein, who released the torture report - was briefed about all the details of the CIA torture program as early as 2006 - and that little of the information in the report is new. 'I didn't lie and I didn't mislead Congress,' he said. '... I actually argued within the (Bush) Administration that we needed to tell all the members of the (Senate Intelligence) committee going forward. 'And we needed to devise a plan that was not just based on raw presidential authority, but had political support from the other political branch so that going forward this would no longer be George Bush's program, but would be America's program.' Finally, Hayden warned that the damning torture report could put America at risk for another major terrorist attack by cowing the CIA. 'We're going to end up a Central Intelligence Agency that is timid. The very charge that was made against us - the very charge that was made against us before 9/11.'

Mr Boles, who is gay, has said his own civil partner has ‘somewhat insistently’ pushed for their right to convert to a marriage. The coalition government passed laws enabling same sex marriage in civil venues in England and Wales last year, angering some traditional Conservative supporters. However, some gay couples who had entered into the civil partnerships legalised by the last Labour government protested that they were discriminated against because they could not become married couples. Mrs Morgan and Mr Boles, writing for the PinkNews website, said the law is being changed from today to allow such couples to convert to a marriage. ‘We are absolutely delighted to be delivering on our promise to allow these conversions by Christmas and we are especially proud to be able to say, as of today, there is no reason in law why anyone cannot marry the person they love just because of their gender,’ they said. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed the change in the law which means from today gay couples can convert their civil partnerships into marriages . Mrs Morgan originally voted against a bill to legalise same sex unions last year. But announcing her view had changed on the issue in October, she told critics in the Commons: ‘If you are not going to recognise that people actually change their minds then what is the point of this place and this House of democracy and debate?’ Recent polls show that a majority of Conservative and Ukip supporters are in favour of gay marriage. A study by Ipsos MORI found that 61 per cent of would-be Tory voters and 54 per cent who intend to vote for the UK Independence Party support same-sex unions. Overall, almost seven in 10 Britons – 69 per cent – believe that homosexual couples should be able to marry while just over a quarter – 28 per cent – disagree. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan hailed the change in the law - despite originally voting against gay marriage . When the same question was asked in 1975, support for gay marriage stood at just 16 per cent, with 53 per cent against. Ten same-sex couples also made history in Brighton and Hove as they simultaneously converted their civil unions. Ten registrars took the couples through the administrative process simultaneously in separate offices at Brighton Town Hall at 10am and all the couples were given a commemorative certificate to mark their involvement in the day's celebration. Ian Scott, 70, and Ron Williams, 82, from Hove, whose civil partnership took place in January 2006, were among the couples taking part today. When they met and fell in love in 1962 homosexuality was still illegal and the couple said they never thought they would see the day when they could be legally married. Mr Williams said: ‘It's a very good feeling and we are very happy that we have been able to do this. We have waited 52 years.’ John Azzopardi, 39, and Aaron Burns, 38, from Hove, also took part in the conversion at 10am. Mr Azzopardi said: ‘It's a really important step for same-sex couples as it is about our marriage being equal under the law. It is important for all same-sex couples to have the same equality if they want it.’ Linda Holm, superintendent registrar, said about 150 couples had already booked to convert their civil partnerships into marriages and that following this morning's conversions, another six or seven would be taking place at the town hall today. She said: ‘The atmosphere has been great, really positive and exciting. For those couples that have been through the process this morning it has been life-changing. It's a great privilege to be part of that and to help them through the legal process.’ The Marriage Act came into effect on March 29 but there was no legal way for couples in civil partnerships to be married until Parliament moved to amend the law. Couples wishing to convert their civil partnerships will have the choice of a simple process at a register office or a two-stage process, where a registrar can complete the conversion at another venue meaning the couple's family and friends can attend. The conversion can take place at premises which have been registered for the marriage of same-sex couples - such as hotels, stately homes and religious premises. For the first year, all couples who formed their civil partnership before March 29 (when same-sex marriage was introduced) will be able to receive a £45 fee reduction.

"Sir Alex Ferguson did his best to stop David Beckham inheriting the iconic No 7 shirt at Manchester United after Eric Cantona retired, according to Roy Keane. Cantona shocked Manchester United when he quit the club and football altogether in 1997 and had worn the famous No 7 shirt since his arrival back in 1992. Keane inherited the United captaincy from the Frenchman, and the former midfielder reveals in his new autobiography The Second Half, that United boss Ferguson wanted him to take the No 7 shirt as well to stop Beckham getting it. Roy Keane kept the No 16 shirt allowing David Beckham to wear the famous No 7 jersey . Beckham and Keane were midfield partners during their years together at Old Trafford . Sir Alex Ferguson wanted Keane to wear the No 7 shirt instead of Beckham . Keane refused and Beckham, who had worn the No 10 shirt the season before, did take over the No 7 shirt which had previously been worn by George Best, Steve Coppell and Bryan Robson. Keane wrote: 'The captaincy is important, but squad numbers can have an importance. At United, ‘7’ was the iconic number. ‘When Eric Cantona left there was a debate about who was going to be the next captain. I was quite relaxed about it. Cristiano Ronaldo also wore the No 7 shirt during his spell at Old Trafford . Keane celebrates with Eric Cantona, another United legend to wear the No 7 shirt . ‘But there was his number, too - '7'. Bryan Robson had had it before Cantona and, of course, it went back to Georgie Best. ‘The manager pulled me into his office and said that he wanted me to wear the '7'. 'I said, ‘No, I’m not that bothered.' 'And he said, ""I know Becks will f****** want it and I don’t want him to have it."" Both Bryan Robson and George Best helped make  No 7 shirt iconic at Manchester United . Record £60m signing Angel di Maria is the current holder of the No 7 shirt . ‘The little power battles. ‘I’d had ‘16’ since I’d signed for the club. I was comfortable with ‘16’. I think it might have kept me on my toes, being outside the ‘1’ to ‘11’. I didn’t think that I was a number ‘7’. ‘I said, ‘Give it to Becks.’ ‘Becks got it, and it suited him - and Cantona.

"At this time of year festive ice rinks are popping up in cities across the world. But Paris takes first prize for their effort - a skating rink halfway up the Eiffel Tower. Offering magnificent views over the iconic city, for those who can stay on their feet, the rink is elevated 187ft off the ground on the tower's first floor and features a bar selling mulled wine and hot chocolate. The ice rink, located on the first level of the Eiffel Tower, is open to the public as part of the festive season . A video clip of the attraction reveals that it is already a hit with tourists visiting the French capital. 'Skating on top of the Eiffel Tower is amazing, a lifetime experience. Yeah, really cool,' enthuses an Australian tourist named, Naomi. Access to the skating rink, which covers an area of 2,000 square feet, is free for everyone who has paid €9 (around £7) to go up in the tower, said its director of development and communication, Isabelle Esnous.

"A family of five says its four-star holiday to Turkey was ruined by illness and one of them tested positive for salmonella following their return to England. Cheryll Jordan, 45, and her husband Ian, 46 have hired solicitors  to investigate the cause of the illness and seek compensation from tour operator Thomas Cook if the hotel is found to be culpable. The couple travelled with their three children to Hotel Marmaris Palace resort in Dalaman in June this year, expecting 10 days of sun, sea and relaxation. Distressed: Cheryll and Ian Jordan fell ill during their stay at Marmaris Palace in Dalaman in Turkey last June . Marmaris Palace: Earlier this year as many as 25 other children allegedly fell ill while staying at the  resort . But the couple say they are angry and upset after they and their seven-year-old son Lewis fell ill with sickness, diarrhoea and abdominal pains a few days into the trip. It left them confined to their hotel room and still suffering symptoms four months on. Bailey, 13, and the couple's other son Luckas, 5 were the only family members to escape illness. On returning home to Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, the family saw their GP and Ian was 'appalled' to be told he had tested positive for salmonella. As a result, Ian had to take one week off work and the Council's Environmental Health Department said it would be investigating the illness. Nightmare holiday: The family has instructed expert illness lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause . Earlier this year it was claimed that as many as 25 children had been struck down by severe sickness while on a summer holiday at the same Turkish resort. Following the incident six families reportedly launched legal action against Marmaris Palace and tour operator Thomas Cook after their children were among those allegedly suffering vomiting and diarrhoea, although Thomas Cook declined to comment on what stage these proceedings were now at. The Jordan family have now instructed travel law experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of their illness. Bailey, 13, Lewis, 7, and Luckas, 5 were looking forward to the 10-day trip but Lewis fell ill . Jennifer Downing, an international personal injury specialist at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are concerned by the Jordan family's reports of the illness they suffered while staying at the Marmaris Palace resort in Dalaman. 'Their holiday was ruined by gastric symptoms and we are particularly concerned by Ian's salmonella diagnosis. 'We have seen on numerous occasions the severe impact salmonella can have on victims in the short and longer-term, as it can often lead to the development of long-standing health conditions, from which they may never fully recover. 'We are now investigating the cause of the illness and hope that tour operator Thomas Cook will work with us as we seek the answers to our clients' concerns.' Playing in the pool: Cheryll said the holiday was a 'horrendous experience' and they fell sick a few days in . Cheryll recalls: 'This was our first all-inclusive holiday abroad as a family but it was just a massive disappointment. 'Myself, my husband and my seven-year-old son all suffered diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains. It was a horrendous experience and we all felt so drained by our illness that we couldn't enjoy our holiday. 'As the break went on, we noticed that some of the food was being served undercooked and some of the utensils and crockery were dirty. Some of the fresh food appeared to be added to trays with existing food and on some occasions it seemed like the same food was reused and served later in the day. Ian adds: 'I am appalled that I contracted Salmonella while on holiday and I continued to suffer with symptoms of the illness months after returning to the UK. 'Falling ill when you go on holiday to a four-star hotel is not something you expect or are prepared for. We have now instructed Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of our illness and to help us get the answers we want about what caused us to be so ill.' Marmaris Palace: A Thomas Cook spokesperson says its investigation into the illness continues . A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority. We confirm that the Jordan family reported falling ill while on holiday in June 2014 at the Hotel Marmaris Palace in Dalaman, Turkey. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, and Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.' 'While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings.' 'We are confident that those due to stay at the Hotel Marmaris Palace will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.'

"Scroll down to read more extracts from Roy Keane's explosive autobiography . Roy Keane says Brian Clough was a better manager than Sir Alex Ferguson. Keane was signed by Clough for Nottingham Forest in 1990 and spent three years at the club before Ferguson broke the then British transfer record to bring him to Old Trafford for £3.75million. Keane would go on to become Manchester United captain and win seven Premier League titles, four FA Cups and one Champions League under Ferguson.

But, in his new autobiography The Second Half, Keane says he still rates Clough as the better of the two, claiming Ferguson was 'pure business' and lacked warmth. 'I worked under two great managers and I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson for a simple reason. What was the most important thing in my football career? Brian Clough signing me. That kick started everything,' he writes. 'Different managers, both brilliant. I think Clough’s warmth was genuine. I think with Sir Alex Ferguson it was pure business – everything is business. If he was being nice I would think: ‘This is business, this’. 'He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength. United was a much bigger club than Forest but his coldness made him successful. 'His message was the same. I was never once confused by one of his team talks or his tactics or his training. The message was always fresh. I must have heard him talk 500 times and I always thought: ‘Yeah, that was good’. 'I think that’s amazing. As a manager I would take Clough’s warmth and Ferguson’s ruthlessness and put them in the mix – but also add my own traits.'

Roy Keane (left) and Sir Alex Ferguson (right) celebrate as United win the FA Cup in 1999 . Roy Keane was a firm fans' favourite when he controversially departed Manchester United in 2005 . Keane, now assistant manager at Aston Villa, left United in 2005 after he criticised his team-mates to MUTV after a 4-1 defeat to Middlesborough. That explosive interview - which Keane describes as 'not too bad' in his new book - led to a furious training ground bust up with Ferguson, assistant boss Carlos Queiroz and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. Queiroz accused Keane of showing a lack of loyalty to his team-mates and when Ferguson stepped in to diffuse the situation, Keane said: 'You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We're slipping behind other teams.' A few weeks later, Keane was left out of a reserve game and when he questioned Ferguson about it he was told he could leave the club. The pair's relationship has never recovered and Keane described it as 'non existent' in an ITV documentary last year - in which he also said 'Brian Clough, without a doubt' was the best manager he played for.

'There were no surprises (in Ferguson's new book, which came out in 2013). He accused me of managing United behind his back, but I managed the dressing room.' On the pair's relationship Keane said: 'Non existent. Nothing surprises me these days with that man. 'Control and power, that's how he works. He is still striving for it now even though he isn't the manager. There is a massive ego involved.' In contrast, Keane has always spoken fondly of Clough. While he has accused Ferguson of not ‘knowing the meaning of loyalty’, he says Clough always treated him with respect. He said: ‘A brilliant, brilliant manager. The man was a genius, he was good to me, good to my family, he never lied to me, he treated me with respect and gave me time off when I was homesick. “You look what Brian Clough achieved and it’s scary.

"The UK's first specialty cereal cafe has just opened its doors in London's Brick Lane and it's already causing quite the stir. The Cereal Killer Cafe is the brainchild of identical twins, Alan and Gary Keely, from Belfast and boasts an impressive offering of the breakfast staple. Along with 120 varieties of cereal, the restaurant - set up in the hipster epicentre of the captial -   also offers 20 toppings and 12 different milk options. The Cereal Killer Cafe is the brainchild of identical Irish twins, Alan and Gary Keely from Belfast . The restaurant is heavy on 90s nostalgia, as evidenced by the throwback decor and retro furniture . 'We thought 'Why isn't there anywhere that you can just go and sit down and have a bowl of cereal?' Gary Keely explains in the video. 'So we went and did some research into it – would it work as a business? How would it look? Where would we get the cereal from? And everything was just ticking all the boxes for us. So, here we are, nearly a year and a half later.' Plenty of limited edition breakfast offerings line the shelves, like these royal varieties . Research into opening such an establishment began nearly a year and a half ago . The establishment is heavy on the nostalgia, with limited-edition boxes and collectibles proudly displayed on furniture reminiscent of yesteryear. The eighties and nineties vibe continues with the music choices and vintage magazines. 'We just want people to walk in and think: 'God, do you remember this?' and just to feel like a kid again,' he adds. 'We want people to walk in and think: ""God, do you remember this?'' Gary says of the cafe's nostalgic vibe . When asked to point out his favourites, Gary migrated towards popping candy-infused Poppin' Pebbles . 'We just wanted to play on the nostalgia, so we've got a lot of vintage cereal boxes. 'We've got a lot of the toys that you used to get. 'The music that we're playing is a lot of 80s and 90s music. 'The magazines are all 80s and 90s.' 'We've got a lot of vintage cereal boxes and a lot of the toys that you used to get,' he adds . Aside from the 120 varieties of cereal, there are also 20 toppings to choose from and 12 different types of milk . The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner - meaning cereal aficionados can get their fix pretty much anytime of day. Behind the counter, brightly-coloured boxes line the walls and offerings are as diverse as Golden Grahams and Reese's Puffs to Cap'n Crunch and Apple Jacks. 'There's so many weird ones, like, a lot of these ones are from America,' the co-owner says. Get your fix at any time! The cafe is open from 7am until 10pm and serves breakfast, lunch and dinner . Gary is also a fan of the limited-edition Halloween cereals that line the shelves, such as Count Chocula . 'We've got Poppin' Pebbles, which is berry-flavoured cereal with pieces of popping candy in it, which is really strange. It's got that little pop, but it's still quite nice. 'I really love the Boo-berry, Count Chocula and Franken-berry – these are limited-edition Halloween cereals that are only available one month of the year in America. 'We've got these, but really limited-edition, so we've only got about 20 boxes of them.' Employee Jules Prentice explains the cereal 'cocktail' idea: mixing several varieties to create a custom bowl . He demonstrates by creating one of the restaurant's signature concoctions: Choco-potamus . And it's affordable! Small bowls will cost £2.50, while large bowls are priced at just £3.50 . A male employee, Jules Prentice, offers a tour of the 'mixology' station, where customers can create a custom 'cocktail' of several types of cereal mixed together. 'Just to mix things up a little bit, Alan and Gary have created a range of cocktails, just taking different cereals and combining them together,' the cereal mixologist adds. 'I think a lot of kids when they're younger used to do that themselves, so they basically designed a whole range of cocktails including the toppings that we have, as well.' The staff then demonstrated their skills by creating the restaurant's signature Choco-potamus concoction. Small bowls of cereal will cost £2.50, medium bowls will set customers back £3.00 and large bowls are priced at £3.50.","Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe is brainchild of twins Alan and Gary Keely .

Here, Sportsmail have compiled the top 10 goals scored in UEFA competitions over the past 60 years. MARCO VAN BASTEN - USSR 0-2 Netherlands - Euro 1998 . It may be the oldest goal to make the top 10, but Van Basten's sensational right-footed volley would still take some beating today. The Dutch maestro received what looked to be an overhit cross from Arnold Muhren before letting to ball drop on the far side of the USSR penalty area and unleashing an unstoppable angled volley with his right foot to give his side a 2-0 lead to seal their European Championship victory. MAURO BRESSAN - Fiorentina 3-3 Barcelona - 1999-00 Champions League . Any goal against Barcelona would be something to write home about, but Bressan's 30-yard overhead kick during a thrilling 3-3 group stage clash was truly something worth shouting about. The diminutive Italian capitalised on some poor Barca defending by pouncing underneath a bouncing ball to loop the ball up and into the Barca net. ZINEDINE ZIDANE - Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Real Madrid - 2002 Champions League final . Not only did Zidane's wondrous volley send shockwaves around Europe while writing his name into competition folklore, the strike helped Madrid to their ninth Champions League title. Zidane looked on as a Roberto Carlos cross took an age to come down before smashing home one of the greatest goals ever scored on the European stage. Zinedine Zidane (left) scores a goal worthy to win any Champions League final during the match against Bayer Leverkusen . RUI COSTA - Portugal 2-2 England - Euro 2004 . Costa broke English hearts back in 2004 with this unstoppable strike against the Three Lions in Lisbon. Costa ran from the halfway line, virtually unopposed to begin with, before jinking his way to the edge of England's box. David James didn't stand a chance as Costa fired a right-footed strike into the top corner. PETER CROUCH - Liverpool 3-2 Galatasaray - 2006-07 Champions League . England's only top 10 entry into UEFA's greatest goal hall of fame. In a week that has seen Crouch being spotted crowd-surfing during a music concert, the 6ft 7in striker can now look back on his Liverpool overhead kick as one of the best goals ever scored in a UEFA competition. Reds right back Steve Finnan whipped in a cross which looked to be sailing behind the big frontman, but in one majestic movement, crouch pulled his right fight back and plucked the cross out of the Anfield sky. Peter Crouch connects perfectly with Steve Finnan's cross to score a stunning overhead kick against Galatasaray in 2006 . CRISTIANO RONALDO - Porto 0-1 Manchester United - 2008-09 Champions League quarter-final . It wouldn't be a top 10 list without some input from former United forward Ronaldo. The Portuguese star has been a career of scoring stunning goals at a spectacular rate and this Champions League quarter-final piledriver deserves its place in the final selection. Ronaldo controlled a pass from Anderson, turned, and hit a 40-yard striker straight into the Porto net. Even Ronaldo, not known for his modesty, claimed the goal was the best of his career. Cristiano Ronaldo prepares to unleash a stunning 40-yard strike for Manchester United against Porto in 2009 . DEJAN STANKOVIC - Inter Milan 2-5 Schalke - 2010-11 Champions League quarter-final . Stankovic pounced on a rare mistake from then Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer to volley home from just inside the away side's half. The German stopper flew out of his penalty area and sent a diving header towards a first-time strike to be proud of - even if Stankovic's side  crashed out. RADAMEL FALCAO - Atletico Madrid 3-0 Athletic - 2011-12 Europa League final . How Manchester United fans will wish Falcao can return to form with a goal similar to his curling effort. Top scorer in that season's Europa League, Falcao topped of his efforts by collecting a pass from midfielder Diego, evading Fernando Amorebieta and bending a left-footed finish into the back of the net. SAMUEL UMTITI - Tottenham 2-1 Lyon - 2012-13 Europa League . The only defender to feature in the top 10 list, but Umtiti deserves his place. The full back whizzed onto a poor clearance from Spurs defender William Gallas to hammer his side level at White Hart Lane. Gareth Bale may have bagged the winner, but Umtiti's strike was surely the talk of north London. ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC - Anderlecht 0-5 PSG - 2013-14 Champions League group stage . The big Swede showed everybody inside the Constant Vanden Stock Stadium just how to Zlatan with one of his most memorable goals to date. With a sight at goal, the forward didn't even need to take a touch before rifling in a perfect half-volley. Aaron Ramsey scored a stunning 30-yard half-volley for Arsenal in their 4-1 win over Galatasaray on Tuesday night. The strike was so good it had former Gunners legend Paul Merson purring: 'I've never seen anything like it in all my years. It was phenomenal.' So do UEFA now need to revise their list of all-time top goals?","UEFA unveil top 10 best goals from list of 60 strikes scored in European competitions .

"An enormous snail was discovered trying to slide past border control at Auckland airport. Biosecurity officials intercepted the mollusc, which was carrying around six eggs, and prevented it from entering New Zealand. Giant African land snails, which can weigh over 35lb and grow to eight inches in length, are known as a ravenous species, and can damage crop and forestry industries and even eat paint off the walls of buildings. The snail was  intercepted at Auckland airport after travelling with a couple returning from Madagascar .

Ministry for Primary Industries clearance manager Craig Hughes said: 'At nearly 15cm long, it was the largest giant African snail many of our staff had ever seen.' 'When our inspector tapped the shell, a number of eggs fell out. We could have had a whole family take residence in Auckland if there hadn't been border controls in place.' Biosecurity officials at Auckland airport intercepted the mollusc, which was carrying around six eggs . Hughes said the couple had found the snail in a forest. 'The good thing is they declared the snail on their arrival card, thereby alerting our inspector of the biosecurity risk,' he added. 'They don't realise that the snail will often hibernate unseen at the tip of the shell and only emerge when conditions are favourable.'

"Consider this photograph of federal agents celebrating after an astounding Christmas Eve cocaine seizure if you've ever wondered what more than $1 million of the drug looks likes when accumulated in a single place. The Coast Guard - along with other federal agencies - discovered the 86-pound cache divided into 31 packages and stowed within the bowels of the Godavari Spirit, a 900-foot crude-oil tanker - on Christmas Eve. A sizable seizure: Federal agents pose with 86 pounds of cocaine they discovered aboard an oil tanker 70 miles off the coast of Texas . The siezure followed a tip from the tanker's crew, which alerted the feds to a suspicious package aboard their ship that hadn't been recorded on the vessel's manifest. The boat was motoring 70 miles off the Texas coast in the Gulf of Mexico, when the crew notified authorities. A joint boarding team consisting of the Coast Guard Investigative Service, Customs and Border Protection Office of Air and Marine, Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration reportedly - and quickly - followed up. The packages are worth at an estimated $1,139,000, although The Bay Area Citizen reports the exact value of the cache depends on the quality of the drug. An alert crew: Federal agents learned of the cocaine cache after the crew of the Godavari Spirit, a 900-foot oil tanker, found a suspicious package aboard their boat . Despite the seizure's size, it's not even close to the largest such one in history. That honor belongs to agents who siezed a staggering 21.4 tons of cocaine from a Los Angeles warehouse in 1989. At the time, the DEA placed the value of the haul at $6 billion, and said it represented about 5 per cent of the world's total, annual cocaine production according to drugbustsworldwide.com. Other notable seizures reportedly include the famous - and incredibly brazen - 2007 Coast Guard seizure of 42,000 pounds of cocaine aboard the Panamanian ship, Gatun, which the website pegs as the largest maritime cocaine bust in U.S. history. In that instance, Coast Guard officials who spotted the ship in 2007 were shocked to find cocaine-filled packages piled on the deck with no attempt to hide the illicit booty.","The Coast Guard made the seizure after getting a tip from oil tanker's crew .

"Pinterest, the picture-sharing social media platform typically used to swap recipes and decorating ideas, is being used to share images of child pornography, claims the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) task force. The ICAC in Utah has revealed that it has launched 12 different investigations into people posting child porn on Pinterest this year. Charges are pending in all cases. Investigators said they were initially surprised to find child pornography on the site, as Pinterest doesn’t have advanced privacy settings and it is easy to see exactly who posts which images. The ICAC task force in Utah has revealed that it has launched 12 different investigations into people posting child porn on Pinterest this year . It's just so incredibly brazen,’ Ken Wallentine, who heads the ICAC task force in Utah, told the Desert News. ‘There are people willing to take what I think are crazy risks. My sense is you have to be fairly addicted, fairly controlled by your compulsion, to engage in child pornography behaviors,’ he said. Federal law requires Pinterest to police itself and all of the cases currently being investigated by Utah authorities were brought to their attention by the social media company. A Pinterest spokesperson told . MailOnline: 'We have no tolerance for child exploitation. We actively . search the site for offending content, report it law enforcement, and . help prosecute those responsible.' Utah's ICAC chief Ken Wallentine has described the posting of child porn on Pinterest as 'brazen' Each state has an ICAC task force, which . seeks to catch distributors of child pornography on the internet and to . catch sexual predators who solicit victims on the internet through chat . rooms, forums and other methods. Pinterest, which has 48.7 million users in the U.S., is one of the most popular social media sites behind the likes of Facebook and Twitter. It has proven especially popular with women and its most popular categories are food & drink, DIY & crafts, women's apparel, home decor and travel. Until now, Pinterest's pinning etiquette, as its content policy is called, has asked users to report images that contain ‘nudity, partial nudity or pornography’. But on Thursday it announced that it is to start allowing users to publish more nude images, even as other social networks such as Facebook are clamping down on potentially offensive content. Pinterest said that it was responding to complaints from artists and photographers against its strict no nudity policy. ‘Pinterest is about expressing your passions and people are passionate about art and that may include nudes,’ the company told the Financial Times. ‘So we're going to try to accommodate that.’","The Internet Crimes Against Children task force in Utah has launched 12 investigations into people posting child porn on the social media site .

"As London continues to be the UK's focal point for international tourism, Yorkshire is hoping it can provide a viable alternative to what the capital can offer. MPs on the Culture Media and Sport select committee are discussing how, and by what means, UK tourism can be shifted so as regions and the north in particular can benefit from increased footfall. Since the Tour de France came to Yorkshire, feelings are growing in the county that it can be a realistic competitor to London tourism. The Royal Household of Harewood House, Yorkshire's answer to Buckingham Palace . The Tour de France trekking through Yorkshire brought a worldwide focus on the county . 'I think it's fair to say that following our historic hosting of the Tour de France, Yorkshire's global profile is at an all-time high,' Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome to Yorkshire told MailOnline Travel. 'The Tour gave us the chance to showcase the county on TV screens in 190 countries and it looked magnificent. It's all about getting Yorkshire front of mind, and it's working. The Deep, Hull – world’s only submarium . Flamingo Land, Malton – in top three most visited paid-for attractions . Xscape Yorkshire – attracts more than 3.5m people per year . York Minster – largest gothic cathedral in northern Europe . Whitby Abbey – one of Europe’s most famous and synonymous with Dracula . The Hepworth Wakefield – biggest new art space outside of London . Harewood House, Leeds – royal household where William, Kate and Harry officially started the Tour de France . Yorkshire Wildlife Park, Doncaster – one of fastest growing attractions in England . Five national museums – Media Museum, Railway Museum, Royal Armouries, Coal Mining Museum, Eureka! Three national parks – Yorkshire Dales, North York Moors, Peak District . Home of Bronte Country, Haworth – huge draw for international visitors . Hull – won the City of Culture 2017 title . Bradford – world’s first ever UNESCO City of Film . York – just this month been named a UNESCO City of Media Arts . 'Our county is now a real alternative for international visitors compared to staples such as London and Scotland. Yorkshire is fast becoming that third dot on the UK tourism map, roughly halfway between the capital and Scotland. 'Visit Britain's International Passenger Survey 2014 stats show Yorkshire enjoyed its best first half of year for international tourism since 2008. And 2013 was also a brilliant year for us, with a record 35 per cent rise in spend. 'AOL, Lonely Planet and several other leading guides all included our county in the top 10 places to visit globally for 2014. Perhaps widely known for the Yorkshire Dales, Yorkshire Tea and Yorkshire puddings, you probably didn't know that the county has four UNESCO sites; Fountains Abbey & Studley Royal in Ripon, Saltaire in Bradford as well as York being named the UNESCO City of Media Arts, and Bradford credited with the title of UNESCO of City of Film. And for London having the Royal Family and Buckingham Palace, Yorkshire has Harewood House, the Royal Household where William, Kate and Harry officially started the Tour de France. For St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, there's the York Minster, the largest gothic cathedral in northern Europe. And for the London Aquarium how about upgrading to The Deep in Hull, the world's only 'submarium' Mr Verity added: 'International visitors like our real seasons and changing scenery all year round, which makes Yorkshire an appealing proposition 365 days a year. 'We have more listed buildings than there are chateaux in France, five national museums, three national parks, a stunning coastline and four UNESCO sites – and that's just a taste of what Yorkshire has to offer. It's a compelling mix, in easy reach of the capital and by international standards everything is close together. The York Minster is a popular tourist destination and is the largest gothic cathedral in northern Europe . St Paul's Cathedral, London; but can the York Minster be the northern equivalent? Officials in Yorkshire believe they are in pole position to attract global tourists to the county . 'We've always said tourism is a powerhouse sector and Welcome to Yorkshire will continue to build on these solid foundations and also lobby Government for support to promote the county around the world to help grow the economy and create jobs for years to come.' But with almost 90 per cent of tourism outside of London restricted to persons from within the UK, the fear remains that any moves to facilitate worldwide tourism could impact domestically. This led to leading tourist organisations in the UK, British Destinations, to voice their concerns with exactly how the government propose to implement a spread of tourism. The Deep in Hull is the world's biggest 'submarium' attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors every year . Whitby Abbey at the North York Moors National Park has been preserved to incredible lengths . The Yorkshire Dales' beauty stretches for miles and gives a unique look into Yorkshire life . Peter Hampson, CEO of British Destinations told MailOnline Travel: 'While we are obviously all for international tourism spreading throughout the UK, it was important to question the value of distributing tourists where there is limited resource. 'You've got to ask, why wouldn't tourists go to London? There's everything there and it is an established destination that has the resources to cater for increasing demands of tourism. 'It isn't simply a question of inviting people to travel to other areas of the UK, we've got to see what attracts them to London in the first place, and then see how other places can provide for their needs.'","MPs are looking into how international tourism can be dispersed in UK .

"This spectacular video of hikers walking across a frozen lake - where the surface is like a crystal clear sheet of glass - has gone viral and sparked a heated debate over whether it is a hoax. Slovakian hiker Tomas Nunuk, 38, from the capital Bratislava, made the short video of him and his friends walking on the see-through ice after hiking up Slovakia's High Tatras mountain range. The video, titled 'Walking on beautiful clean ice in Slovakian Mountains', was published on YouTube on December 8 and quickly generated over half a million views in the first few days. Tomas Nunuk, from Bratislava, made the short video of him and his friends walking on the crystal clear ice . Some viewers were amazed at the 38-second video that shows three hikers walking across the clear frozen lake, while others doubted that the video was real. YouTube user Shawn G wrote: 'I've never seen ice that clear in my life. And I'm Canadian, so I've seen quite a bit of ice.' And another who agreed with him was Narwhal Bacon, a video analyser and Redditor who commented on the video, saying: 'Last time I tried this with such clear ice, it just collapsed from under my feet. I'm calling fake on this one guys.' Some viewers doubted the validity of the video as they had never seen ice so clear before . The ripples of the waters can be seen here, but could be viewed if the ice was around 2cm in thickness . But others were  convinced it was genuine, including a user named John Callaghan, who sarcastically wrote: 'Yep, the guy who was filmed was wearing airboots, than they photoshopped those away, a few hundred thousand square metres of cardboard mountains in the background were then added, and of course the one who was filming was suspended from a helicopter, but they photoshopped the ripples in the water away, and there you have it... fake (lol).' [sic] . Slovak YouTube user Jakub Kutny wrote: 'I would advise you to visit this place instead of arguing about the originality of the video.' Experienced tourist Igor Ludma, from Slovakia, was able to give a scientific explanation for the fact that the ice look like glass, saying: 'It is only possible when the temperatures fall from being relatively mild to very cold very quickly, and at the same time it's important that there has not been any snow which tends to make the ice very cloudy. And we have had those conditions lately which would explain this very clear ice.' Several commentators believe the video to be genuine as the cracking of the ice can be heard . 'It looks like it was about 2cm thick and it is therefore able to carry a man.' And he also backed up the point noted by several other users that it is possible to hear the cracking of the ice as the hikers walk over it. The creator of the video has not added details about exact place where the video was filmed. But Slovak tourists who know their homeland's highest mountains very well say it is a lake called Velke Hincovo Pleso. Velke Hincovo Pleso is located 6,300ft above sea level in Mengusovska dolina, under the Koprovsky stit mountain. The lake is 176ft at its deepest point, making it the biggest and the deepest in Slovakia.","Tomas Nunuk made the short video at the High Tatras mountain range .

"Rare gene mutations that increase the risk of a premature heart attack in middle age have been discovered by scientists. Men under 50 and women under 60 are twice as likely to have a heart attack if they have a faulty gene called APOA5. It causes levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides, which can cause clots, to rise. Men under 50 and women under 60 are twice as likely to have a heart attack (illustrated with a stock image) if they have a faulty gene called APOA5. It causes levels of cholesterol and blood fats called triglycerides, which can cause clots, to rise . Heart attacks are responsible for millions of deaths around the world and are triggered by both genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy lifestyles. Scientists from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and other institutions analysed the genomes of 10,000 people, half of whom suffered a heart attack early in life. Those that had the heart attacks were found to have mutations in the LDL receptor gene, confirming what has been known for decades – that high levels of LDL, or ‘bad cholesterol,' raises the risk of heart attack. The key finding, however, was that people carrying mutations in the APOA5 (apolipoprotein A-V) gene, have higher levels of blood triglycerides – or blood lipids - and a roughly two-fold increased risk of a heart attack. While the gene has been previously implicated in the condition, it has only now been confirmed using large-scale DNA sequencing to ‘definitively’ make the connection between APOA5 and heart attack risk. Scientists from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and other institutions analysed the genomes of 10,000 people, half of whom suffered a heart attack early in life. A stock image of a DNA sequence is pictured . ‘We simply wouldn't have made this critical connection without our careful and disciplined approach to whole exome sequencing [sequencing of the protein-coding portion of the genome] and subsequent data analysis,’ said Stacey Gabriel, a co-author of the Nature study and director of the Broad Institute's Genomics Platform. Researchers hope the findings could lead to new drugs to help reduce the number of heart attacks in middle age. Dr Sekar Kathiresan, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said: ‘Our APOA5 result tells us beyond LDL levels - which are well known to contribute to heart attack risk - abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism also play an important role. ‘This gives us an important window into the biology of the disease and also suggests potential new avenues for therapeutic development.’ The study follows other recent genetic discoveries including the identification of protective mutations in the APOC3 gene, that lower ‘bad fat’ levels and the risk of heart attack. There are some striking parallels between this new study and similar work conducted over 40 years ago, which was led by Nobel Prize winner Professor Joseph Goldstein. His study examined several hundred people from Seattle who had suffered a heart attack before the age of 60. Looking at the levels of fats in the blood, his researchers identified high cholesterol levels as the major link. The study has bolstered previous studies that found that LDL - the major carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream - causes atherosclerosis (illustrated using computer artwork), where fats accumulate in blood vessels and lead to a heart attack . That work spurred decades of research trying to unravel the role of LDL - the major carrier of cholesterol in the bloodstream - in causing atherosclerosis, where fats accumulate in blood vessels and lead to a heart attack. Interestingly the second most common abnormality observed by Professor Goldstein and his colleagues was elevated blood triglycerides, but he was unable to explain this comprehensively at the time. Dr Kathiresan and his colleagues also found harmful LDL receptor mutations are roughly twice as common than had been estimated in the Goldstein study. He said: ‘In 1973 Goldstein’s work taught us what types of lipids in the blood are most important for early heart attack risk. Now after sequencing all of the genes in the genome we can directly point to the specific genes that are most important. There is remarkable consistency between the observations from 40 years ago and today.’ Only about five per cent of people who suffer a heart attack do so at a relatively young age. But tragically the first sign of illness in this minority is often a devastating heart attack inflicting significant damage to the heart and resulting in severe disability or even death. There are 230,000 heart attacks in the UK every year - with about one-in-ten proving fatal.","Scientists from the Broad Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital have pinpointed rare mutations in a gene called APOA5 .
Mutations increase a person's risk of having a heart attack early in life .
They disable the gene, while raising the levels of a type of fat in the blood .
While only five per cent of people who suffer a heart attack do so before 50, the first sign of illness is often the devastating attack itself ."
"Teaching is one of the few professions where women vastly outnumber men, but it appears that does not protect them from suffering sexism. A new study has found that students tend to rate male teachers more highly than their female counterparts during an online course, even if the lessons were actually given by a woman. The students gave the male teachers better ratings for professionalism, fairness and respectfulness. Male teachers appear to be more highly thought of by students, which can hamper the careers of female teachers even though they tend to dominate the profession. In Britain 60%-80% of teachers are female . They also thought the male teachers gave more praise, were more enthusiastic and were more prompt. The findings starkly illustrated the extent to which sexism exists even in educated people, the researchers said. Ladies should behave like men if they want to work in male-dominated industries, according to a controversial study. Research by Professor Ann Marie Ryan, a psychologist at Michigan State University, suggests recruiters prefer more masculine traits to those commonly associated with women. She asked women to apply for leadership roles in male-dominated industries such as engineering in front of a panel of volunteers asked to evaluate the candidates' suitability. Some of the women were asked to emphasise 'masculine-like' traits such as assertiveness, independence and raw ambition. Others were asked to display more 'feminine traits' - warmth, supportiveness and a nurturing nature. The panel, irrespective of the gender of those sitting on it, decided that leadership required more dominant and assertive traits to be shown during the interview process. Lillian MacNell, lead author and a sociologist at North Carolina State University, said: 'We found that the instructor whom students thought was male received higher ratings on all 12 traits, regardless of whether the instructor was actually male or female. 'If the results of these evaluations are inherently biased against women, we need to find ways to address that problem.' The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Innovative Higher Education, asked 43 college-aged students to complete an online course, dividing them into four groups of eight to 12 people. The sex of the students is not known. A female instructor led two of the groups, while a male instructor led the other two. However, the female instructor told one of her groups that she was male, while the male instructor told one of his groups that he was female. The students, however, were not told about this while they completed the online course. They were then asked to rate the teachers in online feedback forms. The results showed that when the students thought their teacher was a man they gave them an average rating of 4.35 rating out of 5. Students taking an online course gave teachers they were told were male higher ratings than those they thought were female, even when the lessons by the 'male' teachers were given by a female. This chart shows the mean student ratings by actual and perceived instructor gender. The difference between the two columns on the right hand side of the graph is deemed to be significant by the researchers . Male teachers were rated as being more respectful, more professional and giving more praise than women . But if they thought they were female they rated them at just 3.55. Miss MacNell added: 'Students rated the male identity significantly higher than the female identity, regardless of the instructor’s actual gender, demonstrating gender bias. 'Given the vital role that student ratings play in academic career trajectories, this finding warrants considerable attention.'","Sociologists at North Carolina State University asked 43 students to complete an online course and then rate the quality of their teachers .

"Think of a deadly predator and you may imagine a powerful shark or ferocious lion. But dragonflies are nature’s most successful predator when it comes to catching prey, scientists have revealed. The winged insect catches more than 95 per cent of the prey it targets - making it twice as successful as a great white shark, and four times as effective as the king of the jungle. Dangerous: Dragonflies are nature’s most successful predator when it comes to catching prey, scientists claim. They affixed tiny reflective markers to insects bodies and filmed them in slow motion to measure their head and body orientation during flight . Dragonflies eat mosquitoes and other small insects such as flies, bees, ants and wasps, as well as the occasional butterfly, which they hunt around marshes, lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands. The reason the dragonfly is such as effective hunter is that when targeting its prey, the insect keeps it in sight while adjusting its flight, and can predict how it will move before catching it. Scientists at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Virginia likened the insect’s calculations - about its own movements and those of its target - to those used by a ballet dancer to catch his partner. It’s the first example of such skill in invertebrates. Its huge eyes provide an almost spherical view of the world while the insect perches on a leaf waiting for prey to fly overhead. Agile: The dragonfly's body and head move independently, with the latter locking on to the target while its body manoeuvres to the best position for capture prey . The best: The winged insect catches more than 95 per cent of the prey it targets - making it twice as successful as a great white shark (pictured left) and four times as effective as the lion (right), based on calculations made by the researchers . There are 5,900 different species of dragonflies, which are characterised by their large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong wings and an elongated bodies. They are among the largest flying insects in the world and can fly backwards, hover and change direction in mid-air. They can fly at nearly 60mph (97km/h). Dragonflies catch more than 95 per cent of the prey they target - making them the most accurate and deadly hunter. They eat mosquitoes and other small insects such as flies, bees, ants, wasps as well as the occasional butterfly, which they hunt around marshes, lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands. While predators themselves, they are food for lizards, birds, amphibians and fish. When the time is right, it shoots off in pursuit, scooping up victims with its hairy legs in a fraction of a second. Its visual sharpness and lightning-quick reflexes - thanks to specialised neurons that detect the motion of a target and instruct its wings to react = make it a formidable hunter. High-speed measurements show how the dragonfly tracks the position of a fly and steers itself quickly towards it, relying on both prediction and reaction. Scientists fitted insects with tiny reflective markers and used motion-capture technology to record the insects in action at 1,000 frames-per-second, replaying the film 20 times slower to analyse tiny movements. The footage demonstrated that dragonfly manoeuvres are generated by predictions of prey movement combined with visual reactions. This allows the insect to estimate the position of a fly, for example, and determine the wing and head movements required to catch it. To avoid detection, a dragonfly approaches from below and aligns its body to the prey’s direction of motion. Keeping an eye out: The dragonfly's huge eyes provide an almost spherical view of the world while the insect perches on a leaf waiting for prey to fly overhead (pictured). When the time is right, it shoots off in pursuit of prey, scooping up victims with its hairy legs in a fraction of a second . Its body and head move independently, with the latter locking on to the target while its body manoeuvres to the best position for capture. The study, published in Nature, indicates steering behaviour in dragonflies is more sophisticated than previously thought - but whether this is the case for other invertebrates remains to be seen. ‘The study highlights the role internal models play in letting these creatures construct such a complex behaviour. It starts to reshape our view of the neural underpinnings of this behaviour,’ Dr Anthony Leonardo said. The researchers filmed dragonflies as they chased after either a fruit fly or a bead on a pulley system - artificial prey - which the scientists could precisely control. It was clear from the videos that the dragonflies were not simply responding to the movements of the prey. Instead they made structured turns that adjusted the orientation of their bodies, even when their prey’s trajectory did not change. Dr Leonardo said: ‘Those turns were driven by the dragonfly’s internal representation of its body and the knowledge it has to rotate its body and line it up to the prey’s flight path in a particular way. ‘At the end of the chase the dragonfly makes a basket out its legs and the prey drops into it.’","Winged insect catches more than 95 per cent of the prey it targets .

"The Navy has revealed  a radical new laser weapon it says can shoot down missiles, boats and even drones from a warship is already is active service. The prototype Laser Weapon System was being tested on the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf, and was so successfully commanders gave the weapon the go-ahead to use it to defend the ship. Experts say they also found a surprising second use for the system - as a surveillance tool. Scroll down for video . The laser weapon aboard the USS Ponce, where is was able to shoot boats and drone in exercises . The laser was accurate enough to blow up a test missile being carried on an unmanned platform  during tests of the new weapon aboard the USS Ponce in the Persian Gulf. The  prototype 30 kW-class solid-state laser (SSL) weapon system developed under the leadership of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), the LaWS integrates six commercial 5.4 kW fibre lasers with a beam combiner originated by the Naval Research Laboratory. A surface warfare weapons officer aboard USS Ponce who can operate all functions of the laser-and if commanded, fire the laser weapon. Using a video game-like controller (pictured), that sailor will be able to manage the laser's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat, from disabling to complete destruction. Rear Adm. Matthew L. Klunder, chief of naval research, said that during the test sailors began using the system in ways its developers didn't fully anticipate, such as for long-range surveillance. Sailors were able to identify approaching vessels at ranges 'they have never dreamed of'. The range of surveillance capabilities is a closely guarded secret. 'We were calling it a Hubble telescope on the water,' Adm. Klunder said. The prototype, an improved version of the Laser Weapon System (LaWS), was installed on USS Ponce for at-sea testing in the Persian Gulf. The prototype 30 kW-class solid-state laser (SSL) weapon system was developed under the leadership of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). It integrates six commercial 5.4 kW fibre lasers with a beam combiner originated by the Naval Research Laboratory. Using a video game-like controller, that sailor will be able to manage the laser's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat, from disabling to complete destruction. 'This is a revolutionary capability,' said Chief of Naval Research Rear Adm. Matthew Klunder said when the tests began. 'It's absolutely critical that we get this out to sea with our Sailors for these trials, because this very affordable technology is going to change the way we fight and save lives.' Navy leaders have made directed-energy weapons a top priority to counter what they call asymmetric threats, including unmanned and light aircraft and small attack boats that could be used to deny U.S. forces access to certain areas. High-energy lasers offer an affordable and safe way to target these threats at the speed of light with extreme precision and an unlimited magazine, experts say. Perfect shot! The moment the laser weapon blows up an unmanned boat during tests in the Persian Gulf . The weapons was also shown downing a drone with a single blast from its laser . 'Our nation's adversaries are pursuing a variety of ways to try and restrict our freedom to operate,' Klunder said. 'Spending about $1 per shot of a directed-energy source that never runs out gives us an alternative to firing costly munitions at inexpensive threats.' As a result of the test, Navy officials said they planned to deploy the weapon into the Middle East for a year aboard the Ponce, allowing sailors to use the system to track potential threats and defend the ship. 'We have the authorities right now to use it in self-defense,' Klunder said. 'If someone was coming to harm the USS Ponce, we could use this laser system on that threat and we would intend to do so.' The Navy already has demonstrated the effectiveness of lasers in a variety of maritime settings. In a 2011 demonstration, a laser was used to defeat multiple small boat threats from a destroyer. In 2012, LaWS downed several unmanned aircraft in tests. A surface warfare weapons officer aboard USS Ponce who can operate all functions of the laser-and if commanded, fire the laser weapon. Using a video game-like controller, that sailor will be able to manage the laser's power to accomplish a range of effects against a threat, from disabling to complete destruction. Just one controller is need, who uses a game controller to direct and fire the laser weapon . To show its accuracy, researchers put a test missile on an unmanned craft - and the laser was able to hit it perfectly . The deployment on Ponce will prove crucial as the Navy continues its push to provide laser weapons to the fleet at large. The Navy will decide next year which, if any, of the three industry prototypes are suitable to move forward and begin initial ship installation for further testing. 'We are in the midst of a pivotal transition with a technology that will keep our Sailors and Marines safe and well-defended for years to come,' said Peter Morrison, ONR program manager for SSL-TM. 'We believe the deployment on Ponce and SSL-TM will pave the way for a future acquisition program of record so we can provide this capability across the fleet.' The U.S. Navy is has declared an experimental laser weapon on its Afloat Forward Staging Base (AFSB) in the Persian Gulf an operational asset and U.S. Central Command has given permission for the commander of the ship to defend itself with the weapon.

"The torture of Al-Qaeda suspects by the CIA shows that the US government is a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity,' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said. His was the first official reaction in Iran to a U.S. Senate report yesterday that torture of suspects in the years following the 9/11 attacks on America was far more brutal than acknowledged and failed to produce useful intelligence. But his sentiments were echoed by leaders in China and North Korea who also condemned America's treatment of detainees. The torture of Al-Qaeda suspects by the CIA shows that the US government is a 'symbol of tyranny against humanity,' Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seen middle, has said . Khamenei said: 'Today, US government is symbol of tyranny against humanity; even American people are faced with cruelty,' wrote on Twitter, referring to a speech he had made in 2007. Tehran is regularly criticised from abroad over its own human rights record, especially regarding the high number of people it executes, and over restrictions on press and religious freedoms. But it invariably retorts that these accusations are politically motivated, in turn criticising Western nations for trying to impose on the Islamic republic their concept of human rights. In a further tweet, from a 2010 speech, Khamenei said the U.S. 'claim human rights and trample its basics in their prisons'. He went on to say they even breached the rights of other nations and even those of their own people. Khamenei's tweets drew extensive comments. A detainee from Afghanistan is carried on a stretcher after being interrogated by military officials at Camp X-Ray at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in 2002 . China foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called on America to address its practices, saying: 'We believe that the U.S. side should reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions'; above a detainee is escorted to interrogation by U.S. military guards at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo Bay . Some recalled the numerous cases of people who have died in detention in Iran in recent years, and the case of a woman hanged in October for stabbing to death a man she said had tried to sexually assault her. The Senate Intelligence Committee's five-year review of 6.3 million pages of CIA documents concluded that the agency failed to disrupt a single plot despite torturing al Qaeda and other captives in secret facilities between 2002 and 2006. George W. Bush was the president at that time. Meanwhile, China urged the U.S. to 'correct its ways', while defending its own human rights practices were have been frequently questioned. China foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei called on America to address its practices, saying: 'We believe that the U.S. side should reflect on this, correct its ways and earnestly respect and follow the rules of related international conventions.' She said China had 'consistently opposed' torture. The government has vowed to stamp out torture, following a series of cases of wrongful convictions which came about after confessions were extracted under torture. China and the U.S often spar about each other's human rights records. China has even begun issuing its own annual report on the U.S. rights record, criticising it for issues ranging from racism to gun crime and homelessness. Protesters hold signs as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry arrives to testifiy before a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on 'Authorisation for the Use of Military Force Against ISIL' yesterday . North Korea, which has been criticised by the UN over its own human rights record, also took pot shots at the U.S. Pyongyang urged the Security Council to censcure the country over its 'inhuman torture' methods and said the revelations posed a major test for the council's credibility. Discussing North Korea's rights record while 'shutting its eyes' to rights violations by one of its permanent members, would confirm the council's 'miserable position' as a 'tool for US arbitrary practices,' a foreign ministry spokesman said. As well as the 'inhuman torture practised by the CIA,' the spokesman cited the recent killings of black suspects by white police officers as another 'despicable' strike against America's human rights record. He said: 'If (the Security Council) wants to discuss the human rights issue, it should ... call into question the human rights abuses rampant in the US.' The Senate Intelligence Committee's five-year review of 6.3 million pages of CIA documents concluded that the agency failed to disrupt a single plot despite torturing al Qaeda and other captives in secret facilities between 2002 and 2006. George W. Bush was the president at that time . The remarks, carried by the North's official KCNA news agency, are part of a concerted effort by North Korea to ward off further censure at the United Nations. The Security Council is expected to meet this month on North Korea's rights record, following a proposal to refer Pyongyang to the International Criminal Court on possible charges of crimes against humanity. The proposal was included in a landmark resolution adopted in a UN General Assembly committee last month. Drafted by Japan and the European Union, the resolution drew heavily on the work of a UN inquiry which concluded in February that the North was committing rights abuses 'without parallel in the contemporary world'. Pyongyang has rejected the inquiry and condemned the resolution, saying both were initiated and controlled by the U.S. in a politically motivated effort to humiliate the regime of leader Kim Jong-Un. Although China and Russia would block any Security Council move to refer Pyongyang to the criminal court, North Korea was rattled by the adoption of the strongly-worded UN resolution and has threatened 'catastrophic consequences' for its supporters. In his remarks on Wednesday, the foreign ministry spokesman said the inquiry's report was 'full of prejudice and lies' whipped up the U.S. to justify an eventual military invasion of North Korea.","Iran's supreme leader said the U.S 'trample' on human rights in their jails .

Jerry Reinhardt claims that on January 17, 2013, he was seated and waiting to depart Portland for Las Vegas when he was struck by the bag. The suit, filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Oregon, alleges a passenger was trying push a suitcase into an overhead locker before a flight attendant attempted to help. The case, however, fell and hit Mr Reinhardt. Jerry Reinhardt is suing Southwest Airlines after a suitcase fell from an overhead locker and hit him . Mr Reinhardt is seeking $10,000 (£6,662) in medical bills due to a compressed disc, $5,000 (£3,331) for lost income and $34,000 (£22,651) for pain and suffering. The Oregonian reports Mr Reinhardt isn't taking action against the fellow passenger with the bag, but the airline for letting the passenger on the plane with carry-on too big to fit in the storage area, . The suit also claims Southwest didn't train the attendant appropriately to handle such luggage in overhead areas. Attorney Mark Potter, on behalf of Mr Reinhardt, adds his client has suffered nausea, headaches and dizziness as a result of back and neck muscle injuries. A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told MailOnline the company could not comment on the impending litigation. Southwest's carry-on baggage policy allows one bag not exceeding 10 x 16 x 24 inches and one small, personal item, such as a purse, briefcase, laptop or camera. Mr Reinhardt claims Southwest shouldn't have let the passenger on the plane with such a large bag . The Association of Flight Attendants campaigned in 2010 against increased allowances for passengers with carry-on luggage. A survey of members found 80 per cent of them had been injured in some way in incidents involving overhead compartments. The survey, over two months, also found half of the member flight attendants had seen items fall from a overhead locker.","Jerry Reinhardt suing Southwest over alleged January 2013 incident .

"A controversial study claims to have found a link between wearing make-up during pregnancy and lower IQ scores in children. Exposure to the highest levels of two phthalate chemicals led to a lowering of IQ scores at age seven by more than six points, US scientists found. The scientists claim the link remained after taking account of known factors that can influence child IQ, such as the mother's intelligence and the quality of the home environment. Scroll down for video . Exposure to the highest levels of two phthalate chemicals, which can be found in lipstick and other cosmetics, led to a lowering of IQ scores at age seven by more than six points, US scientists found . Phthalates are man-made chemicals thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are crucial to overall health. They are found in everything from PVC flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food. Tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating. Researchers in the New York investigated four phthalates and demonstrated an association with two, known as DnBP and DiBP. Both are found in a wide range of consumer products including dryer sheets, vinyl fabrics, lipstick, hairspray, nail polish and some soaps. Children of mothers whose exposure to DnBP and DiBP was in the top 25 per cent had IQ scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower, respectively, than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations . 'The magnitude of these IQ differences is troubling,' said Professor Robin Whyatt, from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who took part in the study. 'A six or seven-point decline in IQ may have substantial consequences for academic achievement and occupational potential.' Phthalates are man-made chemicals thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are crucial to overall health. They are found in everything from PVC flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food. Tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating. In make-up, they are used by manufacturers to help dissolve other ingredients into a consistent solution, such as making nail polish less brittle. Previous studies have linked them to diabetes and asthma. They have also been blamed for feminising the brains of baby boys and last year the World Health Organisation warned they have 'serious implications for health. The scientists assessed the pthalate exposure of 328 New York City women and their children, all of whom were from low-income communities. Break down chemicals from the compounds left after they had been processed in the body were measured in urine samples during the last three months of pregnancy. Children of mothers whose exposure to DnBP and DiBP was in the top 25 per cent had IQ scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower, respectively, than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations. Associations were also seen for specific aspects of IQ, such as perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed. None of the women had been exposed to unusual levels of the chemicals, the researchers said, whose findings were reported in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. Lead author Dr Pam Factor-Litvak, also from Columbia University, said: 'Pregnant women across the United States are exposed to phthalates almost daily, many at levels similar to those that we found were associated with substantial reductions in the IQ of children. 'While there has been some regulation to ban phthalates from toys of young children, there is no legislation governing exposure during pregnancy, which is likely the most sensitive period for brain development. 'Indeed, phthalates are not required to be on product labelling.' The scientists urged pregnant women not to microwave food in plastic containers, to avoid scented products as much as possible, and not to use certain recyclable plastics. In an earlier study, the same researchers found negative associations between exposure to DnBP and DiBP in the womb and children's mental and motor development and behaviour at age three. Earlier this year, the same group found that babies exposed to high levels of phthalates while in the womb are up to 78 per cent more at risk of getting asthma. Dr Whyatt, said: 'These chemicals are very widely used in very high volume and they are not generally listed on labels. 'There are some simple steps families can take. Avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge.' She also suggested women check their make-up on the internet for phthalates. Phthalates are thought to be ‘endocrine-disrupting chemicals’, or EDCs, capable of interfering with the way our glands produce hormones. The cosmetics industry is particularly sensitive to suggestions that some ingredients might be EDCs. In 2012, the Danish Consumer Council asked manufacturers to stop using 17 EDCs. The makers of 58 brands agreed, but companies behind some of the world’s biggest brands did not, and found their products named and shamed by the council. Last year a World Health Organisation study concluded, to do nothing now was to ignore a vital lesson from the past. We should ‘ban chemicals in order to reduce exposure early, even when there are significant but incomplete data but before there is significant and long-lasting harm’. Not all experts agree — in September, 18 editors of pharmacology and toxicology journals signed a letter saying the EU’s proposals were driven by ‘scientifically unfounded precaution’, defying ‘common sense, well-established science and risk assessment principles’. It has since been revealed that 17 of the 18 editors had worked with the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, tobacco, pesticide or biotechnology industries. A recent study linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home . Chemicals found in PVC flooring, plastic shower curtains, processed food and other trappings of modern life may be sapping women's interest in sex. A study in Otober linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home. Women with the highest levels of phthalates in their bodies were more than twice as likely to say 'not tonight dear' as those with the lowest amounts. The research, presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's annual conference in Honolulu, suggests phthalates are doing psychological, as well as physical, damage. In the first study of its kind, Dr Emily Barrett, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine in the US, measured levels of phthalates in the urine of 360 pregnant women in their 20s and 30s. She also asked them how often they lost interest in sex in the months leading up to their pregnancy. Those with the most phthalates in their bodies were two and a half times as likely to say they had frequently lacked interest in sex as those with the least. She said: 'It is interesting because these are chemicals that we are all exposed to every day. They are throughout our environment and every person studied showed measurable levels.' However relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said many factors can influence a woman's libido, including smoking, medication, having a baby or changing jobs. A spokesman for the Chemical Industries Association, which represents manufacturers, said: 'We are not aware of any globally accepted tests which can yet measure the effect chemical exposure may have on libido.'","Controversial study focuses on phthalate chemicals found in make-up .

"Snubbed: Angelina Jolie's Unbroken only received a single SAG nomination - in the stunt category . She has described her latest directing project Unbroken as 'the hardest thing I've ever done', but Angelina Jolie's efforts were snubbed at the SAG Awards nominations on Wednesday. Unbroken received a single nomination in the less showy category of Outstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble, but the film's leading man Jack O'Connell missed out on an acting nod. Jolie's snub came as Jennifer Aniston celebrated a nomination in the Outstanding Actress category for her performance as a woman racked with chronic pain in indie drama Cake. Other big movies not considered in any of the acting categories - including the prestigious Outstanding Ensemble award - include Christopher Nolan's space fantasy movie Interstellar and Martin Luther King film Selma, although the latter's omission is possibly due to a late send out of screeners to Academy members. Matthew McConaughey movie Interstellar's poor performance could be partially due to its mixed reviews and  less than stellar performance at the U.S box office. Meanwhile, star-studded Rob Marshall-directed musical Into The Woods landed Meryl Streep yet another nomination for her role as The Witch but the movie - set to be released this Christmas- missed out in the Ensemble category. And despite Rosamund Pike being nominated as Outstanding Lead Actress, Gone Girl  didn't win any acclaim for its star-studded cast which included Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. Among the actors, Jessica Chastain's lack of nomination for A Most Violent Year as the wife of a shady oil salesman in 1981 New York City, was surprising to many commentators, while Hilary Swank missed out for Western The Homesman and Amy Adams was omitted for Tim Burton's Big Eyes.

The same goes for Bradley Cooper, who despite beefing up for the role of Navy SEAL Chris Kyle in American Sniper, didn't get a nod for the Clint Eastwood-directed drama about Kyle, who was involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda. No nod for Jessica: Chastain missed out on a nomination for A Most Violent Year . Missing out: Bradley Cooper missed out on an acting nomination for American Sniper . But will he get an Oscar nod? Selma star David Oyelowo missed out on a SAG nomination, reportedly because not enough screeners of the Martin Luther King film get sent out in time . British actor David Oyelowo was also widely anticipated to make the cut in the Outstanding Lead Actor category for playing Martin Luther King in Ava DuVernay’s drama Selma about 1965 civil rights marches. According to Variety, Selma will almost certainly be one of the frontrunners come Oscar time, alongside war time codebreaker drama The Imitation Game and Richard Linklater's groundbreaking drama Boyhood, famously shot over an 11 year period and starring Ethan Hawke and Patricia Arquette. Less than stellar: Christopher Nolan film Interstellar starring Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway was not recognised by SAG . Scoop for Meryl: Streep received yet another nomination but musical Into The Woods missed out . Over on the Vv side, Jon Hamm and Mad Men were snubbed for the second year running, with nominations in the Lead TV Actor category instead going to Boardwalk Empire's Steve Buscemi, Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, Kevin Spacey for House Of Cards and True Detective's Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey. It is also the first time in four years that Jessica Lange has not received a nod in the Outstanding Leading Drama Actress category for American Horror Story. And perhaps in an indication that SAG members very much dance to their own tune, Martin Freeman, who scooped an Emmy for playing Dr Watson in Sherlock, missed out on a nomination for the BBC drama at the SAGs. No SAG love: Jessica Lange missed out on a nomination for American  Horror Story while Jon Hamm was overlooked for Mad Men . One Emmy, no SAG: Despite co-star Benedict Cumberbatch's triple nod, Martin Freeman was not among the  nominees on Wednesday for Sherlock . New dramas were also snubbed, with Amazon's Transparent, Showtime's The Affair and HBO drama The Leftovers getting short shrift. SAG nominees are voted by their peers with 4,200 members of the guild randomly selected each year to nominate their favourites. The voters are split in half, with 2,100 weighing in on television performances and the other 2,100 deciding who will be honoured for outstanding performances in film. Following the polling process the full body of both SAG and AFTRA (Hollywood's acting unions) then decides upon the winners in each category. The SAG Award winners will be announced on January 25 2015. FILM . Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture . Leading: Homeland, starring Claire Danes, has three nominations . Birdman .

"British scientists have unveiled detailed plans for a proposed mission to the moon, which could take place within the next decade. The aim of the mission is to analyse the lunar South Pole and assess its potential for a possible human base to be developed in the future. A probe will also drill 330ft (100 metres) below the surface to look at whether it will be possible to someday have observatories on the moon. Scroll down for video . British scientists have unveiled detailed plans for a proposed UK-led mission to the moon which they hope will take place in the next decade. Called Lunar Mission One the crowd-funded spacecraft will fly to the lunar South Pole where there is constant sunlight (illustration shown) Up until now, there have been no missions to the moon's South Pole, which is of particular interest because its home to the largest impact crater on the Moon, the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. The SPA has a diameter of 1,550 miles (2,500km) and covers almost a quarter of the moon. Scientists believe remnants from the SPA impact may still be present in this area, and analysis of the material may be used to date the basin. The Lunar Mission One vehicle will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket, such as SpaceX's Falcon 9, before embarking on its journey to the moon. Once on the moon, the spacecraft will drill 100 metres (330 feet) down to collect samples for scientific analysis (illustrated). It will collect samples every six inches (15cm), which will be scooped up and placed in the spacecraft for scientific analysis to answer questions about the moon . Once there, it will carry out a descent sequence to the lunar surface, with four engines ensuring it lands gently  within a pre-determined landing site the size of a football stadium. On the surface it will drill to depths of up to 330 feet (100 metres), collecting samples every six inches (15cm) for analysis on board the spacecraft. It's thought that the top 33ft (10 metres) of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles. Further down, though, the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago. The deepest samples that have been obtained are from three metres below the surface, by Apollo 17 Astronauts Gene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt in 1972. The company plans to send a robot lander to the South Pole of the moon - an unexplored area. They will drill to a depth of at least 66ft (20 metres) - 10 times deeper than has been drilled before - and potentially up to 330ft (100 metres). The hole will be two inches (5cm) in diameter, and it will take the lander one hour to drill each six inches (15cm). Core samples will taken from each six inches. It will then study lunar rock from this depth that is 4.5 billion years old, and has remain untouched underground. It's thought the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles. Further down, though, the moon is thought to be made of rocks that fused together by pressure and heat from asteroid impacts long ago. Among the scientific questions hoping to be answered, Lunar Mission One wants to discover the true origins of the moon. The spacecraft will be delivered into space by a medium-lift rocket such as SpaceX's Falcon 9. It will carry out a staged descent sequent to the lunar surface. Four main engines will ensure it lands gently on the surface and keep it within a landing site the size of a football stadium. The spacecraft will be equipped not only with a drill, but also a jointed robotic arm to extract segments from its core, and other instruments to analyse core samples and monitor seismic activity.External solar cells will power the lander. The samples of varying depths will be analysed on board the spacecraft inside special capsules (illustrated). It's thought that the top 33 feet (10 metres) or so of rock will be a fine-grained deposit from constant bombardment of meteorites and smaller particles, while further down will be rock fused by heat . Inside the hole (illustrated) will be placed archived data from the public on Earth. People can buy a space on the memory discs for £64 ($100). The team are seeking funding now and hope to launch in 2024 . Among the scientific questions hoping to be answered, Lunar Mission One wants to discover the true origins of the moon. Backers for the mission, dubbed Lunar Mission One, hope to raise money from the public by inviting people to buy space on memory discs for less than £64 ($100) each. These discs will act like time capsules for photos, videos and other files, and will be buried in a bore hole drilled into the lunar surface. British engineer and city financier David Iron, who came up with the plan said: 'People can put any information they like in the memory disc; it will be like a personal time capsule, a private archive. It could be a small message saying ""hi, I'm Joe"" or a whole family history.' Professor Ian Crawford, who is one of Lunar Mission One's scientific advisers, said that despite more than 50 expeditions to the moon, far more needs to be done to understand our satellite. 'Until recently the European Space Agency had plans for a lunar lander (which has since been scrapped) and the science case for Lunar Mission One is quite similar,' he told BBC News. 'In addition, we propose to have a drill so there will be new science too'. Professor Ian Crawford, who is one of Lunar Mission One's scientific advisers, said that despite more than 50 expeditions to the moon, far more needs to be done to understand our satellite.

"Over 300 million people use Instagram every month - making it more popular than Twitter. Just nine months after hitting 200 million users, Instagram today overtook Twitter, which said six week ago it had 284 million users. The site, owned by Facebook, also revealed more than 70 million photos and videos are shared by its members every day. Scroll down for video . CEO Kevin System today said: 'We’re proud to announce that there are now more than 300 million Instagrammers,' as the firm overtook Twitter. Mark Zuckerberg posted this picture to the site to celebrate the news. Facebook finalised the purchase of Instagram in September 2012. The social networking site bid $1bn (£628m) for Instagram in April, and was given the green light for the deal from US regulators at the end of August. But, after the sharp fall in Facebook shares since the firm went public in May, the cash plus share offer ended up being worth nearer $700m. 'We’re proud to announce that there are now more than 300 million Instagrammers,' CEO Kevin Systrom said. 'Over the past four years, what began as two friends with a dream has grown into a global community that shares more than 70 million photos and videos each day. 'Instagram is home to creativity in all of its forms, a place where you can find everything from images of the Nile River to the newest look from Herschel Supply or a peek inside the mind of Taylor Swift.' Systrom told the Wall Street Journal the firm was key to Facebook, which bought it in 2012. 'Instagram can engage generations of people that may not be on Facebook yet. 'I think that’s true with WhatsApp and I think that will be true with things like Oculus rift, the virtual reality headset firm).' 'Mark [Zuckerberg] is very good at understanding that you have to have multiple offerings. Systrom also said the firm was planning to expand dramatically in the advertising space. 'But our real value in the long run is going to be in the advertising space. 'We’re doing advertising in a fairly unique way'. The rise of Instagram: The firm launched in October 2010, and reached a million users by December 2010, before its growth exploded - adding 100m users since March of 2014. The firm last week revealed its top snaps -  with a picture taken during Kim Kardashian's nuptials with Kanye West has made history as the most liked of all time on Instagram. The image of the couple kissing, posted by the reality TV star bride after her Florence ceremony, has been given the thumbs up by 2.4 million users. Now, it says it will focus on helping users find more people to follow - and begin authenticating users and cutting back on spam. 'As Instagram gets bigger, we’re focused on helping you discover photos and videos from people who you care about, whether it’s a friend or your favorite musician. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg also joined the celebration, posting this picture . According to Instagram, the most liked image during 2014 was Kim Kardashian’s wedding post in May (pictured) that received more than 2.4 million likes. It is also the most liked image ever posted on the four-year-old app. 'Today, we’re excited to announce verified badges for celebrities, athletes and brands, making it easier for you to connect with the authentic accounts you’re looking for. 'These badges will start rolling out over the coming days.' The firm also pledged to cut down on spam. 'Keeping Instagram authentic is critical—it’s a place where real people share real moments. 'We’re committed to doing everything possible to keep Instagram free from the fake and spammy accounts that plague much of the web, and that’s why we’re finishing up some important work that began earlier this year. The second most liked Instagram post of the year was a selfie posted by Justin Bieber and on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez (left). It received 1.9 million in the three months since it was uploaded. 'We’ve been deactivating spammy accounts from Instagram on an ongoing basis to improve your experience. As part of this effort, we will be deleting these accounts forever, so they will no longer be included in follower counts.' Instagram earlier revealed the image of their Kim Kardashian and Kanye West embrace attracted the most likes this year and also the most since the picture-sharing app was launched more than four years ago. The second most liked Instagram post of the year was a selfie posted by Justin Bieber with on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez. It received 1.9 million in the three months since it was uploaded.

"Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel feels sorry for Mario Balotelli as the striker's struggles continue. Balotelli has still not scored in the Barclays Premier League since joining the Reds in a £16million deal in August. His luckless run continued as Hull frustrated the Merseysiders to claim a goalless draw in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Mario Balotelli (above) has scored only once since signing for Liverpool from AC Milan in August . Balotelli's team-mate Martin Skrtel (above) supports the striker as his goal struggles continue . Balotelli was far from the worst player on the pitch, producing a committed display which offered encouragement after some of his heavily criticised efforts of recent weeks. But coming after the controversy of midweek, when he was seen swapping shirts at half-time of the 3-0 loss to Real Madrid, the spotlight was on him. That meant his lack of goals was again highlighted and the spurned stoppage-time chance, when Eldin Jakupovic denied him at point-blank range, commanded a lot of headlines. A bookmaker also ridiculed Balotelli's lack of output, offering fans outside the ground the chance to trade in shirts bearing his names for different ones in a publicity stunt. But Skrtel came to the Italian's defence, saying: 'He is working hard and showed some good moments. I feel sorry for him. He is working hard in training, he is working hard in the game. He just hasn't got the goals. Liverpool were held to a 0-0 draw at home to Hull on Saturday as their faltering start to the season continued . 'We just believe in him. We will be supporting him and just hope he will start scoring goals.' Liverpool's performance was patchy but they had some good spells, notably in the first and last 15 minutes, and Balotelli was at the fore. He brought a good early save from Hull's third-choice goalkeeper Jakupovic, took up good positions, worked hard off the ball and had a penalty appeal turned down. He almost settled the game in dramatic circumstances in the fourth minute of injury time when he got on the end of a Philippe Coutinho cross but Jakupovic blocked. Coutinho had himself been denied by Jakupovic moments earlier and Raheem Sterling shot narrowly wide. Steven Gerrard and Dejan Lovren also had good chances for Brendan Rodgers' men. Hull's best spell came in the latter stages of the first half when Jake Livermore, Mohamed Diame and Tom Huddlestone had chances. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (above) will be frustrated his side are unable to find last season's form . Rodgers talks through tactics with Raheem Sterling (right) during the goalless draw with Hull at Anfield . It was another frustrating result for Liverpool, who have won just four of their nine games and Skrtel took little satisfaction from an improved defensive showing. The Slovakia international said: 'It is normal when you are conceding goals that the back four and the keeper will always be the first to be blamed. 'We fixed it, we got a clean sheet, but we couldn't get the three points, so that's not good enough. We played for the points. We could have won and it's disappointing. 'I would have preferred to win 5-4 and get three points than draw 0-0 and get a point. 'I think we played well and just couldn't score the goal.' Ahmed Elmohamady, the Hull midfielder, felt that it was an encouraging point for the team against Liverpool . For Hull, who have had to deal with a clutch of injuries, the result was another encouraging one after last week's point at Arsenal. Midfielder Ahmed Elmohamady felt it was further proof of the club's continuing development, with the squad's greater depth now allowing the Tigers to compete with the top sides on a regular basis. The Egypt international said: 'Everyone in the squad is absolutely fantastic. We missed (Michael) Dawson, Jela (Nikica Jelavic), (Steve) Harper, Allan McGregor - but all the players came and did fantastic. 'Everyone is working hard to get their chance in the team and we worked very hard. Steve Bruce's Hull side were missing players such as Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic for the Anfield trip . 'We are looking forward to every game to get a result, home or away, even against the tough teams. 'That's two games in a row against top-four teams and we are looking forward to the next game at home now, against another tough team in Southampton. We are looking forward to getting the three points. 'We should have scored in the first half here and we had two or three chances but we will take a point. The performance was absolutely fantastic.'","Martin Skrtel sympathises with Mario Balotelli after tough Liverpool start .

"Fired: Deborah O'Conner was fired from Florida State University after going on a racist, homophic, anti-muslim tirade in public Facebook posts . A Florida university is down one outspoken racist this week after business communications lecturer Deborah O'Conner resigned following a Facebook tirade that name-checked blacks, gays and 'filthy rodent Muslims.' O'Conner, who holds a Ph.D. from Florida State University and has taught there for 18 years, made the career ending series of remarks on a stranger's Facebook page. That stranger, New York-based stylist Colin Lively, became the subject of the teacher's ire when he--a friend of a friend of O'Conner's--wrote a post about Eric Holder's finding that Celevand police engage in excessive force. 'YOU elected POTUS, Holder et al. And they are supposed to represent all Americans, not just blacks,' O'Conner wrote in a tirade first reported  by Folioweekly.com. 'Why don't these ass clowns insert themselves into their stories?' Things escalated from there. 'Take your Northern fagoot [sic] elitism and shove it up your a**,' she wrote. 'I teach at a University, you asshole. What do you do? 'You are an intellectual fraud, just like your Messiah. Obama has single-handedly turned our once great society into a Ghetto Culture, rivaling that of Europe. 'France is almost at war because of his filthy rodent Muslims who are attacking Native Frenchmen and women,' O'Conner wrote. Lively told the Tallahassee Democrat that he found the stranger's comments on his Facebook post amusing at first but was eventually taken aback by how far she went with her hate speech. 'I'm surprised her employers weren't aware of her and hadn't done something about it,' he said. 'I feel very bad for any woman who carries that kind of rage inside her heart.' O'Conner closed her rant with a personal jab at Lively, one that appeared to reference his job and sexual preference. 'I just looked at your picture and what you do for a living,' she wrote. 'I'm signing off now. I don't talk to you people.' A friend of Lively's saw the rant and screen-capped it before O'Conner soon deleted her account. Then the comments were passed to the local chapter of the National Justice Network. Fiery debate: O'Conner's rant showed up on the Facebook page of New York City stylist Chris Lively (pictured left and right) in response to his post applauding a Justice Department finding that Cleveland police use excessive forceracist . The group reached out to alert FSU with a strongly worded letter of condemnation. O'Conner soon offered her resignation. She did not, however, offer any apologies. 'I must emphasize that I do NOT believe the punishment fits the ""crime,""' she wrote. 'As a supporter of FSU since 1975, I feel cheated and betrayed.' O'Conner even asked business school dean Caryn Beck-Dudley for a favor: 'Is there any chance the story can be suppressed to minimize further injury to my reputation?' Beck-Dudley's response does not acknowledge the request and as she accepts the resignation the dean is careful not to condone the way it was given. 'I am not agreeing with or admitting to any statements that you have made in your emails which contain several untrue statements and misrepresentations,' the dean wrote. Asked a favor: O'Conner submitted her resignation from Florida State University, where she'd taught for 18 years, on Saturday. She also asked for help keeping her reputation clean, a request her dean did not address .","Business communications teacher Deborah O'Conner, Ph.D. resigned Saturday after the social media tirade .

"The White House suggested on Wednesday that even if the information CIA operatives extracted from terrorism detainees through the use of torture tactics had led to the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the brutal interrogation techniques should never have been used. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest would not concede that the measures taken by the CIA during the Bush administration did in fact produce actionable information, citing the divisions within the intelligence community and Congress on the issue. However, he told reporters that the president believes 'regardless of which side of that debate that you're on, that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount when it comes to this question.' Scroll down for video . The president believes 'that the need to strengthen and enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount,' the White House's chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, said today when asked by a reporter if the president thinks torture was acceptable if it led to the execution of Osama bin Laden . A Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Tuesday concluded that waterboarding and other questionable measures employed by the CIA in its questioning of an al Qaeda commander did not lead the detainee to offer up information crucial to tracking and taking down bin Laden on May 2, 2011. 'A review of CIA records found that the initial intelligence obtained, as well as the information the CIA identified as the most critical — or the most valuable — on [bin Laden courier] Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, was not related to the use of the CIA’s enhanced interrogation techniques,' the report states. According to the Senate Democrats who authored the study, the CIA waterboarded 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed 183 times in one month as part of what a medical officer described as a 'series of near drownings' and subjected him to sleep deprivation, rectal rehydration and stress positions. Yet, the Senate report states that he repeatedly gave them 'fabricated' or 'unfounded' information. One al Qaeda affiliate that Mohammad named, Hassan Ghul, did play a central role in the slaying of bin Laden, the paper says, but Mohammad volunteered that information before he was worked over by the CIA. Ghul also gave the CIA intelligence pivotal to the hunt for bin Laden, according to the report. But that, too, came  before he was mistreated. 'He sang like a tweetie bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset,' a CIA officer is quoted as saying. It was after his initial confessions that he was deprived of sleep, the Senate review said. And when it was determined that he had told the truth, the CIA lied and said he gave up the information only after he was put through physical and mental discomfort. In its response to the Senate report, the CIA said it is 'impossible to know in hindsight' if the information that led the U.S. to bin Laden could have been secured through traditional methods. 'However, the information we did obtain from these detainees played a role — in combination with other important streams of intelligence — in finding the al-Qaeda leader,' the agency said. The president's spokesman also refused to engaged in a counterfactual with reporters today on whether or not bin Laden would have been taken out had the CIA acted less aggressively, telling them at his daily briefing that 'it is impossible for us to go back in time and determine whether or not some of the information' that backers of the techniques believe 'yielded information that was critical to the success of the mission could have also been obtained through other measures. 'It's impossible and unknowable, actually, whether or not that information that they say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used,' he further clarified. Earnest said that the president did receive an intelligence briefing before the raid that resulted in bin Laden's death, but it 'doesn't necessarially provide a detailed account of how that intelligence was obtained.' 'The point is,' he said, the president has 'spoken unequivocally about his view of this matter. 'It is his view that the use of these enhanced interrogation techniques does not serve our national interest, it does not make us safer, because it undermines our moral authority, and our moral authority around the globe is critically important to protecting and even advancing American interests,' he concluded. This undated file photo shows now-deceased al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. After U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin laden in Pakistan in May 2011, top CIA officials secretly told lawmakers that information gleaned from brutal interrogations played a key role in what was one of the spy agency's greatest successes . In this May 3, 2011 photo, local residents gather outside a house, where bin Laden was caught and killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The White House said today it's 'impossible and unknowable' whether or not the information that backers of enhanced interrogation 'say was critical to the mission and was obtained because of these techniques could also have been obtained if a more conventional interrogation technique had been used' At another point in the briefing he told reporters that 'there are other things that we can't know, but there is one thing that the president knows...that continuing to employ the techniques that are described in that report would only undermine one of the most powerful weapons on our arsenal to protect American national security. 'And that is the moral authority around the globe of the United States of America,' he said. President Obama believes 'that tool is worth protecting and strengthening,' Earnest explained, 'and that's why he outlawed these techniques' during his first few days in office and directed the Department of Justice and his national security team to conduct a 'broad review of the guidelines and procedures for interrogating and detaining individuals in custody.' It's also why he 'strongly advocated' for the Senate to publish its review, he said. Ahead of Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein's release of the study revealing the depth and breadth of the post-9/11 program that subjected terrorism suspects to treatment that Obama has said 'constituted torture,' former President George W. Bush, Republicans on Capitol Hill, and even Secretary of State John Kerry urged the California lawmaker not make the 600-page report public, at least not at this time. Feinstein refused to back down, however, as her time as the committee's head dwindled down. 'Is there ever a good time to admit our country tortured people?' she said in an op-ed released Tuesday in the Los Angeles Times simultaneously with the Senate's finished CIA review. 'The bottom line is, torture occurred, and we must own up to our actions and move forward.' 'We're not perfect and there are some dark patches in our past, but what makes us special is that we recognize these evils, we come to grips with them and we fix them,' she said. Noting Obama's support for the release of the redacted documents and his executive action in 2009 to disband the program, Feinstein said the 'report is the next step toward enacting major reforms to ensure something like this never happens again.'","White House  would not concede that the measures taken by the CIA during the Bush administration did in fact produce actionable information .
'It's impossible and unknowable' whether or not that information could have been obtained through a 'more conventional interrogation technique .
'Regardless of which side of that debate that you're on,' Obama believes the need to 'enhance our moral authority around the world is paramount'

"Seoul has created special women-only parking spots to make the South Korea capital more female-friendly - not, apparently, as a statement on the gender's driving ability. The city is spending around $100 million on initiatives including the new parking spaces that are dubbed 'she-spots' and come marked with bright pink outlines and a skirted woman logo. The move has already sparked accusations of sexism, like officials in the German town of Tribeg were met with in 2012 when they introduced a similar program. Lady parking: Seoul has created special women-only parking spots, pictured, to make the South Korean capital more female-friendly - not, apparently, as a statement on the gender's driving ability . Triberg Mayor, Gallus Strobel, said he was accused of 'male pig-headedness' because the female spots were better lit and wider while the male versions were flanked by concrete pillars and could only be reversed into. Of the Korean parking plan, one Twitter user wrote: 'Really? What century is it in ?' However, others welcomed the news. Motoring.com.au reported the pink parking spots come as part of a charm offensive that includes 7000 new female-only toilets around the city and the resurfacing of pedestrian walkways with a spongy material, which makes it easier to walk in heels. As in Tribeg, Seoul's special parking spots are wider and longer than regular ones and also better lit and closer to shopping center infrastructure, such as elevators and escalators.

It's not clear whether male drivers who park in the spots will incur a fine. The Assistant Mayor for Women and Family Affairs Cho Eun-hee told the Korea Times newspaper: 'It is like adding a female touch to a universal design and make things more comfortable for women.' China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Indonesia, Austria and Italy also have women-only parking spots. Australia doesn't have spots reserved for women but they do have 'family' car parking spots in shopping malls for parents with infants.","Seoul is spending around $100 million on female-friendly initiatives including the new parking spaces .

"A Swedish Instagram user has recreated newlywed Solange Knowles' now-iconic bridal party portrait using six Barbie dolls. Ronny Larsson, a magazine editor from Stockholm, even designed and fitted a doll-sized replica of the bride's Humberto Leon for Kenzo wedding dress, as well as the stylish ensembles worn by her sister Beyonce, mother Tina Knowles and three of her closest friends. The image is part of an online advent calendar project which sees Ronny recreate a different iconic image from 2014 every day and has already caught the attention of 28-year-old Solange who wasted no time in thanking him for taking the time to create the doll-sized tribute to her special day. Scroll down for video . The (Barbie) bride wore white: Ronny Larsson's recreation of Solange Knowles' wedding photo became an overnight social media sensation . So chic: The original version, which was published by Vogue, features Solange's sister Beyonce, her mother Tina and a group of her best friends . 'Solange not only put a wonderful post on my Instagram, she also tweeted a personal thank you and how moved she was by this,' Ronny told MailOnline. 'That was such a nice gesture of her.' Following Solange's interest in the image, Ronny's Instagram account became an overnight social media sensation and now boasts 1,200 followers - a number which is continuing to grow by the minute. 'The response has been amazing. I never thought that a picture I took on my hallway floor would be something that people talked about all over the world,' he added. 'It sure puts some pressure on the following posts on [my account].' Luckily, Ronny is not short of ideas when it comes to his future posts - and is already busy working on his upcoming creations. Turnip for what? First Lady Michelle Obama's vegetable-focused parody video is also featured on the site . Getting her groove on: Ronny believes that the video of the First Lady dancing with a turnip is one of 2014's most memorable moments . 'I have some plans,' he confessed. 'It has been a great year for female popstars so I have to do something with that. The Chandelier-video with Sia, or should I say without, is quite iconic. 'And after the Solange wedding I must try to do something with that big Kanye and Kim Kardashian wedding. 'Also, I would have to do something British. Maybe Downton Abbey, which I love.' As for his inspiration, Ronny admits that he always wanted to ask for a Barbie doll for Christmas as a child - but was too embarrassed to list the popular toy on his list. Now, as an adult, this project gives him total freedom to work and play with the dolls as much as he likes. 'I just had this thought about an advent calendar that day for day would count down to Christmas Eve,' he said. 'Every day I would arrange a pop cultural phenomenon, or something that has had us buzzing on social media during 2014.

First Lady Michelle Obama's hilarious 'turnip for what' parody video was given the Barbie treatment on December 8, while Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Lisa Vanderpump and her beloved canine companion Jiggy are also featured. When it came to picking his first subject however, Ronny opted for singer Taylor Swift, choosing to position her on a Miley Cyrus-style wrecking ball which bears the logo for music sharing site Spotify. 'Taylor Swift on a wrecking ball sits when she from Spotify removes her hits,' the accompanying comment reads, referring to the 24-year-old's decision to prevent the site from using any of her music.","Swedish magazine editor Ronny Larsson is making an Instagram advent calendar of iconic images from 2014, all of which are made using dolls .

"A pair of Buddhist monks have been arrested for smoking crystal meth with two women in their sacred pagoda in Siem Reap, Cambodia.

Buddhist monks are forbidden from taking drugs, drinking and having sex. Cambodian Buddhist monks sit at Bayon temple during the Visak Bochea in Siem Reap province . Chan Bunna, a 19-year-old monk, was also arrested, along with two male residents of the pagoda and two female market vendors, all for drug use, while the supplier was also arrested.

"The damning Senate Intelligence Committee report on post-9/11 interrogation techniques has cast a new pall over the 2012 film 'Zero Dark Thirty.' Kathryn Bigelow's docudrama about the hunt for Osama bin Laden ignited controversy for, some said, implying that the 'enhanced' interrogation techniques of the detainee program helped lead to finding bin Laden. Bigelow claimed that torture was a part of the story that couldn't be ignored. The Senate report released Tuesday found that the coercive techniques led to no unique intelligence. After US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin laden in Pakistan in May 2011, top CIA officials secretly told lawmakers that information gleaned from brutal interrogations played a key role in finding him. A US Senate report now says that was not true . The director and producer of 'Zero Dark Thirty' Kathryn Bigelow has been criticized for including a scene in the film that claimed waterboarding was necessary to finding bin Laden . California Senator Diane Feinstein, the Democratic chair of the Intelligence Committee that released the report, had been one of the most vocal critics of 'Zero Dark Thirty.' In a 2012 letter to Sony Pictures co-signed by Republican Senator John McCain, Feinstein called the film 'factually inaccurate' and wrote that filmmakers had an obligation not to 'shape American public opinion in a disturbing and misleading manner.' Bigelow was asked about the report on 'The Daily Show' on Tuesday while promoting a short film about elephant poaching and the ivory trade. 'We made the movie based on the reporting that we did,' said Bigelow. 'I applaud transparency in government, so I think it's good that it's out there. It's complicated. It's very, very, very complicated.' The Associated Press was not immediately successful in its attempts to reach Bigelow on Wednesday. Despite this 'Zero Dark Thirty' waterboarding scene, investigators revealed that there was no evidence enhanced interrogation the CIA to bin Laden . 'Zero Dark Thirty' was made with a rare blend of traditional filmmaking and journalism. Bigelow collaborated with Mark Boal, a journalist and screenwriter who also penned their Oscar-winning 'The Hurt Locker.' ''Zero Dark Thirty,' made just a year after bin Laden's killing, was labeled as 'based on first-hand accounts of actual events.' At the time of the film's release, then Homeland Security Committee Chairman Peter King, R-N.Y., claimed that Bigelow and Boal were given too much cooperation by the Pentagon. The Defense Department insisted that the filmmakers were only given a routine meeting and that no assistance was ever provided. But 'Zero Dark Thirty' was hotly debated for its representation of the role of torture in pursuing bin Laden. In the film, a detainee identifies bin Laden's courier. When Obama shuts down the detainee program in the film, CIA officers complain about intelligence drying up. Bigelow at the time insisted 'depiction is not endorsement' in a Los Angeles Times op-ed. 'I do wonder if some of the sentiments alternately expressed about the film might be more appropriately directed at those who instituted and ordered these U.S. policies, as opposed to a motion picture that brings the story to the screen,' wrote Bigelow.","Film by Kathryn Bigelow claimed has been blasted as inaccurate .

"Maybe it was all too easy. Perhaps when he saw the teamsheet, he thought it would be a formality that the record he has been closing in on would be sent tumbling. This should have been the night Cristiano Ronaldo moved out on his own. A capacity crowd in the Bernabeu Stadium, the eyes of the world watching and a date against one of the biggest names in football. The stage could not have been more perfect for Ronaldo to usurp Raul, as the Champions League's all-time scorer. The coronation, however, must wait. Worse still, if Lionel Messi engages overdrive in Amsterdam on Wednesday, when Barcelona duel with Ajax, Ronaldo could find himself in third place on the list when Real return to Champions League combat at the end of the month in Switzerland. Cristiano Ronaldo failed to overtake Raul as the Champions League's all-time top scorer on Tuesday night . Ronaldo takes on Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno but merely flirted around the edges against Liverpool . Ronaldo reacts to missed chances as two goals would have seen him write his name into the record books . It's not very often Ronaldo disappoints – can you use such a word about one of the greatest players of this, and any other generation? – but here was one such occasion. Given a standing ovation at Anfield when he faced Liverpool last month, this time Ronaldo could only flirt around the edges. Few would have expected this. At Real's Valdebebas training retreat in the days leading up to this contest, the Spanish press were asking questions of Carlo Ancelotti that suggested the two goals Ronaldo needed were a formality. Would he go it alone to get to the magical figure of 72? 'I have to speak about Cristiano Ronaldo a lot,' Ancelotti replied, a little wearily. 'The last time I said it's hard to find a new word to describe him. He' s a fantastic player and professional and that's it. He works hard for his team.' Ronaldo congratulates goalscorer Karim Benzema during Real Madrid's victory against Liverpool on Tuesday . SEVEN - Ajax . SIX -  Galatasaray . FOUR - Schalke, Bayern Munich, Marseille, Lyon . THREE - Juventus, Copenhagen, Borussia Dortmund, CSKA Moscow, Dinamo Kiev, Roma . TWO - Man United, Apoel Nicosia, Tottenham, FC Zurich, Arsenal, Sporting Lisbon, Milan . ONE - Liverpool, Ludogorets, Basel, Atletico Madrid, Man City, Auxerre, Inter Milan, Chelsea . He does more than that, of course. Having scored in each of his last 12 games, Ronaldo gives this supreme Real Madrid side a devastating cutting edge, frequently adding the stardust that makes them what Brendan Rodgers, and many others, describe as 'the best team in the world'. Yet here it was missing. Ronaldo was first off the pitch at the final whistle, shaking hands with nobody other than Ancelotti, as the Bernabeu celebrated a routine 1-0 win. The cricket score and the slaying of Liverpool's reserves never materialised. Truth be told, he didn't appear to be in the mood. When the teams lined up before kick-off, Ronaldo had his back to the fence that kept Liverpool and Madrid apart. There was no dead-eyed intensity, just the feel that he was going out for a training exercise. A sense that his night would not go the way he hoped arrived after just five. Looking to take a pass just outside the centre circle, Joe Allen charged into him, spiriting the ball away and sending Ronaldo to the turf. He jumped, gesticulated and expressed his displeasure but there was no foul. The Real Madrid star evades the challenge of Martin Skrtel but was unable to find the back of the net . Ronaldo is halted by Lucas Leiva's arm as Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen watches on and races for the ball . Ronaldo goes to ground under the challenge of Liverpool's German international midfielder Emre Can . Had he not seen Simon Mignolet beat away a precise effort in the 10th minute, perhaps he would have ended up with the match ball. An early goal would have invigorated him and inflicted a blow into Liverpool's midriff from which they would have struggled to recover. But that was as good as it got. He got no change from Kolo Toure – a combination of words few would have expected to be put together – and was restricted to long range free-kicks, which he fizzed at Mignolet. One such effort in the 34th minute created the greatest theatre of the night.30 yards from goal, the beat of a drum and clapping of hands started slowly and got faster and faster as Ronaldo began his run up. They expected to scream goal, as they always do, but it wasn't to be. Not this time.","Cristiano Ronaldo had chance to become the Champions League's all-time top scorer against Liverpool .

"Arsenal named six academy products on their bench with an average age of just 18 for their Champions League victory at Galatasaray. Three of them - Gedion Zelalem, Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Stefan O'Connor - got on to the field for the Gunners. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at how the youngsters performed during Tuesday night's 4-1 victory... Aaron Ramsey watches on as his half-volley flies towards the Galatasaray goal during the first half . Gedion Zelalem (17, midfielder, German) - Played 45 minutes . Minutes played: 45 . Total passes: 44 (40 completed) Pass completion rate: 90.9 per cent . Accurate forward-half passes: 15 . Forward-half pass completion: 83.3 per cent . Recoveries: 4 . Fouls: 1 . The young German's introduction to this match came somewhat under the radar after he replaced Mathieu Flamini just before the half-time interval. However, he showed some promising glimpses during the second half. He looked composed on the ball, tidy in possession, as well as strong and physical. It appears he could slot into the team seamlessly in defensive midfield - having completed 90.9 per cent of his 44 passes during the second half. On saying that, the 17-year-old could not have asked for a better game to be introduced into with it already done and dusted at 3-0 by the time he arrived on to the field. Gedion Zelalem (right) holds off the challenge of Galatasaray's Wesley Sneijder on Tuesday night . This was Zelalem's second appearance for the Gunners, although his first in the Champions League, having come on as a substitute during the FA Cup tie with Coventry City in January. He is a German Under 17 international, as well as being a regular in the Arsenal Under 21 and Under 19 sides. Zelalem could well find himself as a consistent replacement for Arsenal in a position they are severely lacking in. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (left) talks to Zelalem in training ahead of the match . Ainsley Maitland-Niles (17, winger, English) - Played 45 minutes . Minutes played: 45 . Total passes: 29 (27 completed) Pass completion rate: 93.1 per cent . Accurate forward-half passes: 8 . Forward-half pass completion: 80 per cent . Tackles: 3 . Fouls: 1 . Maitland-Niles came on at half-time for Aaron Ramsey to make his full professional debut having been an unused substitute in the defeat at Stoke City - and in the process he became their second-youngest ever representative in the Champions League. Aged 17 years and 102 days, only Jack Wilshere (aged 16 years and 239 days when he made his debut) has appeared at a younger age in Europe for the Gunners. Unfortunately for the youngster, Arsenal's fluidity and intensity slacked off in the second half as they eased off the gas. Ainsley Maitland-Niles, also 17, came on for his competitive debut for Arsenal on Tuesday night . That said, he still looked extremely confident for one so young and did not look over-awed by the occasion. He completed a remarkable 93.1 per cent of his 29 attempted passes - including playing a couple of nice through-balls to release Joel Campbell as the game became stretched late on. Unorthodox for a winger, but Maitland-Niles also provided an important clearance from a dangerous Galatasaray attack. He is renowned for his pace and crossing ability, but unfortunately had little-to-no opportunity to show it on Tuesday night. The winger (right) and Hector Bellerin (left) both challenge Bruma of Galatasaray for the ball . Stefan O'Connor (17, defender, English) - Played 13 minutes . Minutes played: 13 . Total passes: 7 (6 completed) Pass completion rate: 85.7 per cent . Accurate forward-half passes: 2 . Forward-half pass completion: 100 per cent . Clearances: 3 . Fouls: 0 . The commanding centre back barely had an opportunity to prove how invaluable he could be to an Arsenal first team severely lacking in power and leadership. However, for the 13 minutes he was on the field after replacing Mathieu Debuchy, O'Connor did not put a single foot wrong. In fact, the 17-year-old made three clearances - including a vital one just before Wesley Sneijder was about to unleash a shot from the edge of the area - and contributed a few nice passes too. He is already a regular in Arsenal's Under 21 team and has excelled in the UEFA Youth League. O'Connor has also been capped for England at Under 17 level and is seen by Arsenal as a real defensive prospect for the future.

"The U.S. Senate Committee's torture report has claimed Poland initially objected to the CIA's secret prison on its soil but became 'flexible' after being bought off with a large sum of money. After denying the fact for years, former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski today admitted that Poland had granted the CIA permission to run the secret prison, but insisted his officials had not authorized illegal treatment or torture of its inmates. Human rights groups believe at least eight terror suspects were held at a Polish prison codenamed 'Blue', including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed - the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. Admission: Former Polish president Aleksander Kwasniewski (pictured right, alongside former Afghan leader Hamid Karzai) today confirmed that Poland granted  permission for a secret CIA prison in the country . U.S. President Barack Obama last night discussed the CIA torture report's . publication during a telephone call with current Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz. The heavily redacted report did not mention Poland by name, but documents relating to the site match other reports that identify them as originating in the Eastern European nation. Among these documents is European Court of Human Rights ruling relating to a CIA-run 'black site' in Poland. This morning former Polish president Kwasniewski admitted that the prison existed, but insisted that the secret operation was halted amid pressure from the country's leaders. 'Poland took steps to end the activity at this site and the activity was stopped at some point,' he told Warsaw based  Radio TOK FM this morning. The  prison is thought to have operated from December 2002 until autumn 2003. Kwasniewski was in power from 1995 until 2005, but has always denied the site's existence until now. Detainee: Human rights groups believe at least eight terror suspects were held at a Polish prison codenamed 'Blue', including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (pictured) - the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks . Global: At its height, the CIA program included secret prisons in countries including Poland, Afghanistan, Thailand, Romania and Lithuania - locations that are referred to only by color-themed codes in the report . According to a ruling by the Strasbourg-based European . Court of Human Rights  the CIA operated a facility near . the  village of Stare Kiejkuty in north east Poland. It is one of a network . of sites around the world where Al Qaeda suspects were held and . subjected to interrogation techniques that human rights groups say . amounted to torture. Was the CIA justified in using methods of torture on suspected terrorists? Was the CIA justified in using methods of torture on suspected terrorists? Now share your opinion . The CIA torture report, which was published yesterday by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, described how seriously the rendition programme strained relations with Poland - a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member and one of Washington's staunchest European allies. People close to the Polish authorities at the time say Poland felt an obligation to protect its relationship with Washington, even as it knew hosting the facility was open to legal challenge. 'The agreement to host a CIA detention facility in Country . created multiple, ongoing difficulties between Country and . the CIA,' the report said. All direct mentions of the name of the . country were blacked out, but other details matched those already known to relate to the East European country. Divisions: Polish officials were also said to be disappointed not to have been given more warning of the 2006 acknowledgement of the detention programme by then U.S. President George W Bush (left) The CIA torture report said the Poland proposed drawing up a written memorandum . of understanding defining the CIA's roles and responsibilities . at the facility, but the agency refused. Poland's government allegedly then refused to accept the planned transfer of new detainees, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The torture report claims that decision was only reversed after the U.S. ambassador to Poland intervened  on the . CIA's behalf. The following month, the CIA allegedly provided several million dollars to the country. The exact figure was deliberately blacked out on the document. The report did not name the representative who intervened, although the American ambassador . to Poland at the time was Christopher Hill. A woman who answered . the telephone in his office at the University of Denver, where . he now works, said he was not immediately reachable. After the money changed hands, officials speaking for the country's political leadership indicated Poland 'was now flexible with regard to the number of CIA detainees at the facility and when the facility would eventually be closed,'according to the report. Years later, Polish officials became 'extremely upset' when details of the detention programme began to emerge from U.S. government sources, the report claimed.

"Passed away: Evelyn Dahab died on Wednesday morning when a fire began in her basement apartment in New York City . A New York City writer, bar owner and one-time actress who appeared in long running soap opera Guiding Light died in a fire in her Manhattan basement on Wednesday,  the NYPD confirmed. Evelyn Dahab, 33, was found in her bed after firefighters arrived to tackle a blaze in her basement apartment in the East Village neighborhood. Dahab, who had been involved in a lengthy and costly $18,000 legal battle with her landlord, had planned to vacate her home at the end of the year and was pronounced dead at the scene around 3.15am. 'She was bigger than life and too young to die,' said her father, Richard Dahab to DNAinfo. It took 60 firefighters 30 minutes to bring the blaze under control and neighbors said that they thought everyone had exited the building before they saw flames and smoke coming from the basement apartment. 'The fire department came and broke open the door and smoke just came billowing out. It was a very dark gray. The smell was powerful. It just smelled like burnt charcoal,' said resident Chase Chemero. Tragedy: Dahab published a novel in 2011 which charted her adventures around the world with a rich boyfriend and also studied at Columbia University for her undergraduate degree . Police guard: Officers outside the building where Evelyn Dahab lived in this basement apartment  in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan . According to Dahab's parents the fire was caused by faulty wiring, but the FDNY or NYPD has not confirmed that. Originally from Long Island, Dahab attended Columbia's Barnard College and had a novel, Incapitated published in 2011. The novel, a memoir, recounted her travels across the world with a rich bachelor. A resident of Manhattan for the past 11 years, Dahab also owned a part share in Brooklyn bar, Lucey's Lounge, in the trendy area of Gowanus. During her twenties, Dahab also appeared in a few episodes of Guiding Light, which according to the Guinness Book of Records was the world's longest running drama show. In addition, the multi talented Dahb had also worked sometimes as a fitness model and also spent time working in finance. 'She was beautiful. She was a bright girl. She'd written a book. She went to Barnard,' said her mother, Carolyn Dahab to DNAinfo. She added that she had last spoken to her daughter on Sunday. Multi-talented: Evelyn Dahab was a part owner in Lucey's Lounge in Brooklyn and penned her own novel in 2011 . Angry Facebook post: Evelyn Dahab took to Facebook on October 15 after signing an agreement with her landlord to move out by the end of the year . Dahab was due to leave the apartment on December 31 after a long-running dispute with her landlord who owns 31 E. 1st St. She claimed they were refusing to return her $18,000 deposit. In a Facebook post from October, at around 5pm, Dahab wrote, 'After a painful legal dispute, Big Apple Management has refused to refund my $18,000 deposit. Even the property manager looked like she was close to tears as the landlord's lawyer bullied her (let alone bullying me and my attorney) when she protested moneys owed in my favor.' Going on, Dahab explained the resolution to her dispute, writing, 'Bottomline, the settlement is that I'll pay one more rent installment (why? they already have 3 months security and the last 3 months prepaid, right? -- but the voice of logic falls on the deaf ears of criminals)... And I'll move out before the new year... Speaking to the MailOnline, an attorney representing 31 E. 1st St refuted Dahab's claims entirely. Todd Nahins, of Borah, Goldstein, Alphschuler, Nahins and Goidel said that Dahab had signed an agreement to vacate the apartment on October 15, the same day she posted her angry Facebook post. He said that Dahab did not owe any outstanding rent nor did her landlord owe her anything in return in security deposits or prepaid rent. Nahins said that Dahab was represented by her attorney when the agreement for her to move out was signed on October 15 and that she was to vacate by December 31. He said that any confusion from Dahab about money being withheld was just that and she understood that her landlord did not owe her anything. He also passed on his condolences to her family and said that when he met her in court on October 15 she seemed 'a very bright and nice girl.'","Evelyn Dahab, 33, found dead early Wednesday morning in East Village .

"President Obama has announced a spend of more than $1 billion in early childhood education through public-private partnerships. He described it as 'one of the best investments we can make' during a daylong summit at the White House on Wednesday. To highlight the importance of educating children in their first five years, Jennifer Garner, Julianne Moore, John Legend and Shakira have been picked to narrate a series of new 60-second public service announcements. These adverts, which end with the tagline 'when we invest in them, we invest in us', were played during the conference. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: President Obama (pictured Wednesday at the Toys for Tots Campaign) has announced a spend of more than $1 billion in early childhood education through public-private partnerships . Obama noted that only 28per cent of four-year-olds were enrolled in state-funded preschools nationwide last year, blaming high costs for such low numbers. He said studies repeatedly show that children who are educated early in life are more likely to finish their educations, avoid the criminal justice system, hold good jobs and have stable families. All those factors are good for the U.S. and its economy overall, Obama said. Referencing his own teenage daughters, he continued: 'We've got kids in this country who are every bit as talented as Malia and Sasha but they're starting out the race a step behind.' Down with the kids: Obama gives a high-five to nine-year-old Alajah Lane of Washington, after she introduced him in the South Court Auditorium on the White House complex in Washington . He said the investments will help level the playing field. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said during a morning panel discussion on how to pump more investment into early learning that a lot needs to be done. The panelists, including a local sheriff from Ohio, agreed that spending more money on early education can have significant lifetime effects such as reducing crime and teen pregnancy and increasing future earnings for those who went to preschool. At the summit, 18 states are being awarded a total of $250 million in Education Department grants to create or expand high-quality preschool programs. Those states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. In all, 36 states had applied for the grant money. Another $500 million from the Health and Human Services Department is being sent to more than 40 states to expand Early Head Start and child care programs for youngsters from birth to three years old. The White House said about 63,000 children would benefit from the federal dollars, which officials said already have been appropriated by Congress. Words of wisdom: Obama described early childhood education as 'one of the best investments we can make' during a daylong White House summit on Wednesday . Grounded: He said studies repeatedly show that children who are educated early in life are more likely to finish their educations, avoid the criminal justice system, hold good jobs and have stable families . On top of the federal money is another $330 million from dozens of corporations, foundations and individuals. That money is part of a new campaign called Invest in US. The effort being led by the First Five Years Fund will challenge the private and public sectors to spend more on early childhood education. Among those supporting the campaign are The Walt Disney Co. with $55 million, the LEGO Foundation with $5 million and the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation with $25 million. 'That's real money,' Obama said. 'Even in Washington, that's real money.' Obama pushed for an expansion of early education opportunities in his State of the Union address in 2013, and again in 2014 after his call got little traction in Congress. At the summit, he called on the new Republican-controlled Congress that will be seated next year to 'work with me to make pre-K available for all of our kids.' During the summit, the First Five Years Fund also previewed the new celebrity-narrated public service announcements. The Associated Press previewed the announcements before their release. They are available for viewing online at www.investinus.org.","Donations will come through public-private partnerships .

"A man who miraculously survived a vicious attack by 12 pit bulls two months ago has revealed that he still suffers nightmares about that terrifying night. Steve Constantine, 50, was left clinging to life after he went to feed a friend's dogs in Detroit, Michigan on the night of October 2 and the animals turned on him, shredding his limbs. Speaking to the Detroit Free Press from hospital, he recounted what few details he can remember and said described the images that still haunt him. Among them, he has a recurring dream of a black dog he fears will bite him, so he grabs the dog's jaw 'and I keep saying ""Come on, quit it, quit it"",' he said. Survivor: Steve Constantine, 50, lost his left arm and most of his left leg after a friend's dogs mauled him in an horrific attack outside his Detroit home in October. Constantine was feeding the dogs at the time . Life changing: He has undergone scores of procedures including an amputation and skin grafts . He recalled how he had been hanging out with a friend earlier that day but, after struggling to sleep, returned because he remembered someone had left a bag of dog food outside and he wanted to feed the dogs. But as he tried to open the bag, the dogs pounced. 'There was no streetlight, and it was a dark street and nobody around so I'm screwed,' he told the Free Press. 'I'm like, ""Somebody help me"", but who's going to hear me? I didn't see a soul. 'I just kept saying, ""Please stop."" I didn't know they were going to stop.' Although he can remember very little, he said he has one vivid memory of one of the dogs  'calmly' licking his ankle as others attacked. While he can't remember anyone helping him, he said that his rescuers later told him that they had to shoot one of the dogs but were worried about shooting any others in case they hit him too. Fighting on: Constantine, who hopes to get prosthetic limbs ones day, also lost his left ear in the attack . Staying upbeat: Constantine, one of six siblings, had been missing for about a year before the incident but after his sister read about his plight in the paper, she called the hospital and identified him . One 911 caller described the dogs as 'all over him'. The 12 dogs were seized by police and destroyed. Constantine was rushed to hospital, where he underwent multiple skin grafts to cover the bones in his right arm and leg. He has lost most of his leg below the knee, his arm and one of his ears. Investigation: Derrick Felton,61, who owned the dogs, may still face charges in the case . Despite his horrifying ordeal, Constantine told the newspaper that he believes the attack happened for a reason: to reunite him with his family. Before the attack, he had been missing for a year. He had previously lived in Warren, Michigan but was homeless so stayed with a friend - but when that friend lost his home, he had to move on. He had been in Detroit for a year, and his family did not know where he was. After one of his sisters read about the story, she realized it was her brother and contacted the hospital. Until then, he was a 'John Doe'. He has now been reunited with his siblings. 'It's a good feeling being alive,' he said. 'There's moments when I'm barely myself. There's moments when I can barely function. And I'm insecure… but I do seem to make it back to this place where I am myself.' He is uncertain what will happen to him but he said he hopes he can be independent. He hopes he will also be fitted with prosthetic limbs. His sister, Cathy Hawley, previously told the Free Press that he had struggled with mental illness after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his mid-20s and he had also been homeless. Derrick Felton, the dogs' owner and a friend of Constantine's, received five misdemeanor citations, and the case remains under investigation. Felton has claimed the number of dogs is a lie. Constantine previously said that he believes Felton ran away while he was being attacked.","Steve Constantine was feeding a friend's dogs on the night of October 2 when the animals turned on him and ripped off his limbs .

"Hold the pickles, onions and special sauce. The Big Mac is becoming a victim of finicky tastes. As sales continue to slide in the U.S., McDonald's plans to expand a test that lets people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread, cheese and toppings they want. The company says it will bring the option to 2,000 of its more than 14,000 U.S. locations next year. The 'Create Your Taste' program is a departure for McDonald's, which was built to deliver food consistently, quickly and affordably. That model has come under pressure as people gravitate toward places like Chipotle, which lets people pick what goes on their bowls and burritos as they walk down a line. Scroll down for video . The 'Create Your Taste' program, due to be introduced in 2,000 McDonald's stores next year, will allow customers to customize their burgers . Using the new 'create-your-own' program, McDonald's customers will be able to build burgers exactly to their tastes . Under the new customized menu, diners choose from 20 ingredients from grilled mushrooms, tortilla strips, guacamole and applewood smoked bacon to sit on top of their patty. The average 'build-your-own' burger costs about $5.79 - around a dollar more expensive than a Big Mac. Bacon or another burger is a dollar more. The burger is created in front of the customer to order and takes around six minutes. McDonald's is also planning to trim its menu and maybe even get rid of some of the ingredients it uses to change perceptions that it serves junk food. CEO Don Thompson sought to reassure investors on Wednesday that changes will help strengthen the chain's appeal as the company fights to hold onto customers. The discussion in Oak Brook, Illinois, came after the company earlier this week reported yet another monthly decline in U.S. sales at established locations. In November, the company said the figure fell 4.6 per cent. Thompson has conceded McDonald's Corp. has failed to keep up with changing tastes, with people increasingly moving toward foods they feel are fresh or wholesome. Among the changes he and Mike Andres, president of U.S. operations, touched on were ingredients and how people get their food. Here's a look at what's in store: . SHRINKING MENU . In just the past decade, McDonald's has added 100 items to its menu, Andres said. While that has driven up sales, it also complicated the menu and made it harder for people to quickly decide what they want. So starting next month, McDonald's will cut eight items from the menu and reduce the number of Extra Value Meals from 16 to 11. Thompson and Andres didn't detail exactly what will get the axe, but favorites like the Big Mac likely won't disappear anytime soon. Instead, Andres suggested McDonald's is looking at reducing the variations on particular items, such as the three chicken McWraps the company rolled out last year as a fresher alternative. The thinking is that people who order a McWrap that is taken off the menu would be willing to switch to one of the others. And McDonald's could reduce the number of toppings or sauces it keeps stocked in its kitchen. Earlier, McDonald's has also said the Bacon Clubhouse burger - a premium offering introduced just this year - could be taken off the national menu. READING THE INGREDIENTS . McDonald's is trying to change perceptions that it serves junk food, especially as people examine labels for artificial ingredients they're not familiar with, and therefore find unappealing. Andres said McDonald's is looking at different cooking and holding procedures to enhance the appeal of its food. He also noted the company is looking at shrinking its ingredient lists. He noted McDonald's restaurants go through supplies quickly, meaning it may be a relatively easy task. 'Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?' he asked. 'We probably don't.' HAVING IT YOUR WAY . The company is also making a big push behind a 'Create Your Taste' program that lets people pick the buns, cheeses and topping for their burgers. McDonald's says that will be in 2,000 of its more than 14,000 U.S. locations next year. The rollout is seen as a response to the growing popularity of places like Chipotle, which lets people customize their orders by walking down a line and saying what they want on their bowls and burritos. At McDonald's, offering such customization may not be that easy; the company has noted that 'complicated' orders for 'Create Your Taste' could take five to seven minutes, compared with just a couple minutes for regular items. Still, Thompson noted Wednesday that people who come for made-to-order burgers have a little more time on their hands and are willing to wait longer. He also noted the 'Create Your Taste' program is not just a test, but a program that's in the process of bein implemented. In just the past decade, McDonald's has added 100 items to their menu (pictured) - which they are planning to cut back to boost sales, the CEO said on Wednesday .","McDonald's will let people build their own burgers by tapping on a touchscreen to pick the bread, cheese and toppings they want .

"The mystery of where Earth's water came from has got murkier. Results from the Rosetta space probe has proved that water did not come from a comet, as had been previously thought. The  Rosetta mission, which made history by landing on Comet 67P in November, shows the water on the icy mass is unlike that on our planet. Scroll down for video . ESA's Rosetta spacecraft has found the water vapour from its target comet to be significantly different to that found on Earth, fuelling the debate on the origin of our planet's oceans. Experts now believe asteroids are the most likely carrier of water. Over the past few months, the European Space Agency's Rosetta space probe closely examined the type of comet that some scientists theorized could have brought water to our planet 4 billion years ago. It found water, but the wrong kind - it was too heavy. One of the first scientific studies from the Rosetta mission found that the comet's water contains more of a hydrogen isotope called deuterium than water on Earth does. 'The question is who brought this water: Was it comets or was it something else?' said Kathrin Altwegg of the University of Bern in Switzerland, lead author of a study published in the journal Science. Something else, probably asteroids, Altwegg concluded. But others disagree. Many scientists have long believed that Earth had water when it first formed, but that it boiled off, so that the water on the planet now had to have come from an outside source. The findings from Rosetta's mission to the duck-shaped comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko complicate not just the question of the origin of Earth's water but our understanding of comets. Until now, scientists sorted comets into two types: near and far. The near ones, sometimes called the Jupiter family, originally come from the Kuiper Belt outside Neptune and Pluto. The far ones hail from the Oort Cloud, which is much farther out. But thanks to the dynamics of the early Solar System, this is not a straightforward process. Long-period comets that hail from the distant Oort cloud originally formed in Uranus–Neptune region, far enough from the Sun that water ice could survive. They were later scattered to the Solar System's far outer reaches as a result of gravitational interactions with the gas giant planets as they settled in their orbits. Conversely, Jupiter-family comets like Rosetta's comet were thought to have formed further out, in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune. Occasionally these bodies are disrupted from this location and sent towards the inner Solar System, where their orbits become controlled by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. Until now, scientists sorted comets into two types: near and far. The near ones, sometimes called the Jupiter family, originally come from the Kuiper Belt outside Neptune and Pluto. The far ones hail from the Oort Cloud, which is much farther out. In 1986, a spacecraft came within about 400 miles of Halley's comet, an Oort Cloud comet, and analyzed its water. It proved to be heavier than Earth's water. But three years ago, scientists examined the water in a Kuiper Belt comet, Hartley 2, and it was a perfect match for Earth's water, so the comet theory was back, stronger than ever, Altwegg said. The comet visited by Rosetta is a Kuiper Belt comet, but its water was even heavier than Halley's, Altwegg said. That shows that Kuiper Belt comets aren't as uniform as thought, and it once again complicates the issue of Earth's water. 'That probably rules out Kuiper Belt comets from bringing water to Earth,' she said. The image comprised of four images taken with the navigation camera on Rosetta and released by the European Space Agency ESA on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2014 shows comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Nov. 17, 2014 from a distance of 42 km (26 miles) from the center of the comet. University of Maryland astronomer Michael A'Hearn, who wasn't part of the research, called the results startling but said they don't eliminate comets altogether. The water could have come from other types of Kuiper Belt comets, he said. NASA Near Earth Object program manager Donald Yeomans, however, thinks it does pretty much rule out comets. While asteroids are a good suspect — they probably had more water on them 4 billion years ago than they do now — another possibility is that Earth kept some of its original water in its crust or in ice at the poles, Altwegg said. 'This surprising finding could indicate a diverse origin for the Jupiter-family comets – perhaps they formed over a wider range of distances in the young Solar System than we previously thought,' says Kathrin Altwegg, principal investigator for ROSINA and lead author of the paper reporting the results in the journal Science this week. 'Our finding also rules out the idea that Jupiter-family comets contain solely Earth ocean-like water, and adds weight to models that place more emphasis on asteroids as the main delivery mechanism for Earth's oceans.' 'We knew that Rosetta's in situ analysis of this comet was always going to throw up surprises for the bigger picture of Solar System science, and this outstanding observation certainly adds fuel to the debate about the origin of Earth's water,' says Matt Taylor, ESA's Rosetta project scientist. 'As Rosetta continues to follow the comet on its orbit around the Sun throughout next year, we'll be keeping a close watch on how it evolves and behaves, which will give us unique insight into the mysterious world of comets and their contribution to our understanding of the evolution of the Solar System.'","Experts had though a comet collision brought water to Earth, seeding the oceans and providing ingredient for life .

"A Scandinavian men's underwear brand named Comfyballs simply will not fly in America, says the U.S. Patent and Trade Office.

A Norwegian brand of men's underwear called Comfyballs was denied a U.S. trademark for its name when the U.S. patent office called it 'vulgar' According to the agency's response to the application, the trademark could have gone through had it been slightly funnier. 'The mark does not create a double entendre or other idiomatic expression,' they wrote. 'When used in this way, the word, ‘balls’ has an offensive meaning.' As the Telegraph notes, another trademark--this one from an American company--had previously been denied by the agency for a similar reason. Undaunted: The company's founder says he'll petition for a review of the decision and cites other similar trademarks such as 'Nice Balls' and I Love My Balls' that have been allowed through the process . Ben & Jerry's ice cream flavor Schweddy Balls--so named after a well-known Saturday Night Live sketch--saw only a short-lived release in 2011 after the agency blocked a trademark for its name.

"There is new drama between Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell and her mother June 'Mama June' Shannon. In an appearance on Dr. Phil that will air Thursday, Anna claims that her mother has robbed her of money from her trust fund and lied about her knowledge of her daughter's sexual abuse at the hands of her former lover, Mark McDaniel. June claims that she did not know that Anna had been sexually abused by McDaniel, a convicted sex offender, until almost three years ago, over eight years after the incident first took place in 2002. Scroll down for video . Lies: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell (above) says in a new interview that her mother, June 'Mama June Shannon, is a liar who has robbed her trust fund . Fighting words: 'She's lied my entire life,' says Anna of June (above), 'She doesn’t have the ability to tell the truth' Looking out: Anna says she is nervous about her younger sister Alana (above) now that she believes her mother is back with Mark McDaniel, the man who sexually abused her as a child . Anna tells Dr. Phil a much different story however, saying her mother knew just weeks after the incident occurred. 'She's lied my entire life,' Anna says, according to US Weekly. 'She doesn’t have the ability to tell the truth.' As for her trust fund, Anna claims that she has not seen the $15,400 she had put away as compensation for appearing on the reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, money her mother said she had sent her in a cashier's check. 'I gave her $400 a month,' said June in a previously taped interview. 'I didn't have to give her that till she turned 21. And then, I've got a cashier's check that I can show you that I sent her, which was the rest of the money in her account.' Anna says she has never seen that check. 'You say your mother robbed your trust fund?' asks Dr. Phil. 'So I call the bank in Milledgeville, and I ask him, I say, ""Hey, is there any account underneath my name,""' Anna responds. 'They said, 'Yeah, there is a savings account with 17 dollars and 89 cents in it.'' She then adds that because she was a minor when the show began, all accounts are controlled by her mother. Coming clean: Anna revealed this all during an appearance on Dr. Phil set to air Thursday . Anna will be appearing on the show alongside her grandmother Thursday, with the two getting a surprise visit from Lee Thompson, better known as Uncle Poodle. Anna and Lee have not spoken in over a year, though the reason for this is not made clear in the preview. The young girl says she is concerned about protecting her youngest sister, Alana, from McDaniel, especially after photos suggested that he and June were together again. Anna, 20, had previously claimed she was sexually abused for months by McDaniel back in 2002 while her mother was working at McDonald's. She said the abuse occurred in her mother's bed and, at times, while her little sister Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon was in the room . McDaniel, 53, served 10 years behind bars beginning in 2004 for child molestation. New episodes of Honey Boo Boo, along with repeats, were shelved by TLC once photos of June and McDaniel together showed up on TMZ.","Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell will appear on Dr. Phil Thursday, and claims her mother has 'robbed her trust fund'

Accused: Titans defensive linesman, Sammie Lee Hill, has found himself at the center of a sexual abuse allegation . In her police report, which has been handed to Atlanta police and seen by TMZ, the woman said that after she resisted Hill a number of times, he apologized and gave her $300 in cash. The woman claims to have been left with bruises on her neck by Hill after the alleged assault. While police in Houston took the initial report, Atlanta police have said that no charges have been pressed and no one has been arrested. 'The Atlanta Police Dept. has been contacted by a female who advised she was sexually assaulted by Sammie Hill, who is a NFL player,' the police department said in a release on Monday. 'We are working with the female to obtain information about this incident. At this time, the report is not available.' Aware: The Titans have issued a statement saying they know of the report and are letting the police investigate . On Monday, a spokesman for the Houston Police Department, John Cannon, said that they took a 'courtesy report' from the 37-year-old woman after she came to then claiming she had been raped. Houston police have claimed they have never identified Hill as the player involved and said that they handed the report over to their colleagues in Atlanta. Atlanta Police Department spokesman John Chaffee wrote in an email that a woman told police she had been sexually assaulted by Hill and they are working with the woman for more information. The Titans have issued a statement to say: ""We will let the police investigate the allegation and we will provide any assistance they need. We have discussed the matter with Sammie and we will continue to gather facts."" Hill is in the middle of a three-year, $11.4 million deal with the Titans. Hill, who played at Stillman and a West Blocton, Alabama, native, is a six-year veteran in the second year of a three-year deal with Tennessee. The 6-foot-4, 328-pound Hill has started 12 games this season.","Houston dancer says she woke in Atlanta hotel room to sexual assault .

"Already qualified Bayern Munich beat CSKA Moscow 3-0 with another dominant performance on Wednesday to complete their fifth win in six Champions League Group E games and leave the Russians bottom of the table and out of Europe. A new-look Bayern side featured teenagers Gianluca Gaudino and Pierre Hojbjerg alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, making his first start of the season after a lengthy injury absence. With Xabi Alonso and Arjen Robben on the bench, Bayern, who had secured top spot in Group E with two games to spare, never hit top form.

Thomas Muller scored his 24th in the competition from the spot in the 18th minute to become Bayern's record Champions League goalscorer ahead of Mario Gomez. Sebastian Rode headed in his first Champions League goal following a fine move in the 84th before Mario Gotze added another in the 90th. The result leaves Bayern top with 15 points, a club record, and CSKA Moscow, who had keeper Igor Akinfeev to thank for keeping the score respectable, bottom on five. Manchester City snatched second spot with a 2-0 victory at Roma. 'I am proud of the team,' said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, who made five changes to the side that beat Bayer Leverkusen four days ago and started with striker Robert Lewandowski and Rafinha on the bench. 'We were outstanding and in every game played better than each of our group opponents.' The Russians were up against it going into the match, needing a win to have any chance of qualifying, and Seydou Doumbia almost put them ahead after six minutes with a header that went narrowly wide. Bayern immediately stepped on the gas and Franck Ribery made their dominance count when he was brought down after a swift turn in the box, with Muller firing home from the spot. Doumbia should have levelled with a sensational solo run that saw him dribble past six Bayern players only for keeper Manuel Neuer to deny the Ivorian. Schweinsteiger, making his first start in a competitive game since the World Cup final in July, almost got a second for Bayern but Akinfeev, who has failed to keep a clean sheet in 27 consecutive Champions League games since 2006, tipped his shot over the bar.

"A Mexican national living illegally in the US for decades was arrested Tuesday in connection to a massive identity theft case spanning 30 years in which he allegedly used the name of an American citizen to defraud the government. Prosecutors say Ramon Perez-Rivera's scheme was so ingenious that a judge unwittingly changed the name of the person whose identity he had stolen to his own real name. The 33-count indictment outlining one of the most unusual identity theft cases in the country accuses the 81-year-old Perez-Rivera of assuming a false identity to obtain food stamps and Medicaid, register to vote and obtain a US passport and a driver's license. Unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Wichita, Kansas, the indictment against Perez-Rivera and his 82-year-old wife, Antonia Vargas-Ortega, outlines a history of unlawful entry into the United States that dates as far back as the 1950s. Stolen life: Ramon Perez-Rivera, 81, a Mexico native living illegally in Kansas, has been indicted on 33 counts of identity theft and fraud for allegedly stealing the identity of an American citizen 30 years ago . The couple were married in their hometown of Romita, Buanajuato, Mexico, in 1961. One of their adult children, Antonia Vargas-Perez, 47, also has been charged with immigration-related offenses, said US Attorney Barry Grissom. The indictment offers a glimpse at an immigrant family's life in the shadows that spanned decades — and left in tatters the identity of the 86-year-old Arizona man whose identity was hijacked. The government contends Perez-Rivera succeeded in fooling scores of state and federal agencies — with the exception of the times he tried to get Supplemental Social Security Income benefits from the Social Security Administration, where the scam finally unraveled. Perez-Rivera faces a court appearance Wednesday on charges of aggravated identity theft as well as counts related to making false statements in order to obtain a passport, food stamps and Medicaid benefits as well as register to vote; lying to a federal agent; misusing a Social Security number to obtain a Kansas driver's license; and fraudulently attempting to get Social Security income benefits. His wife, now a naturalized US citizen, also faces charges that include aggravated identity theft, making a false statement to the Social Security Administration and harboring a person unlawfully in the United States. Travel documents: The 81-year-old suspect allegedly used the false identity to obtain a US passport in 1996 . Assistant US Attorney Brent Anderson, who has prosecuted hundreds of immigration-related cases, said he has never seen one in which a defendant allegedly changed the identity theft victim's name to his own name. The couple settled in California around 1980. Immigration officials arrested Perez-Rivera in 1981 for being in the country unlawfully, but did not take his wife into custody because of three adolescent children in the home, according to the indictment. Instead of surrendering herself to immigration officials the next day as promised, she fled. Court documents not indicate the outcome of his arrest. Federal prosecutors said the identity theft victim was born in California. He is identified in the indictment only as T.A.P. The government contends that the suspect has been using T.A.P.'s identity since 1979, and in 1996 Perez-Rivera filed a name change petition in Ventura County, California, Superior Court in which he falsely represented himself to be T.A.P. The court granted the petition and entered an order changing the name of T.A.P. to Ramon Perez-Rivera. Voter fraud: The indictment says Perez-Rivera unlawfully registered to vote in 1999 and voted at least once, in the 2000 general election . Perez-Rivera assumed the victim's Social Security number, date and place of birth, and at times even the names of T.A.P.'s parents, prosecutors say. He then used the court order to amend T.A.P.'s California birth record to reflect the change of name, according to the indictment. He was able to get the Social Security Administration to change the name on T.A.P.'s account and issue Perez-Rivera a Social Security card. By 1997, he had obtained a U.S. passport. The family moved to Kansas in 1998, and the following year he began receiving Medicaid benefits and food stamps. He also registered to vote in Sedgwick County in 1999, and an online check by The Associated Press of voting records indicates he voted at least once, in the 2000 general election. In June 2011, an investigator from the Social Security Administration interviewed Perez-Rivera and seized all his identity documents. 'Two years ago, we decided not to pursue charges in this case due the age and circumstances of the defendants,' Grissom said, 'but they allegedly continued to engage in the same conduct that brought them to the attention of law enforcement officers in the first place. 'At some point, people have to take responsibility for their actions, whether they are 18 or 80. The scope of the allegations in this case is such that the interests of justice simply required action on our part.' The government says Perez-Rivera got a new Kansas driver's license less than a month later by claiming he had lost his old one. Prosecutors say he tried in 2012 to replace the seized U.S. passport, falsely declaring again he was US citizen. That time, his application was denied. Perez-Rivera faces maximum sentences of 10 years on the passport fraud and document fraud counts. He also faces the two-year mandatory sentences on five aggravated identity theft counts. His wife and alleged partner in crime could be looking at up to five years in prison on the false statement charges and a mandatory sentence of two years on two aggravated identity theft counts.","Ramon Perez-Rivera, 81, indicted on 33 counts of identity theft and fraud .

"A mobster was killed by being fed alive to pigs by rival gangsters, Italian police said yesterday. Francesco Raccosta was beaten with iron bars before being thrown screaming into a sty where he was swiftly eaten by the hungry animals. His horrifying death was the latest bloody instalment in a 60-year feud between warring members of an Italian crime syndicate, detectives say. The murder was carried out by Simone Pepe, a member of the ’Ndrangheta crime family which holds a fierce grip on the southern Italian region of Calabria. Gangster: Simone Pepe, pictured left, allegedly killed Francesco Raccosta by feeding him alive to pigs . Yesterday police released tapes of intercepted phone calls in which Pepe is heard saying of Raccosta: ‘It was so satisfying hearing him scream... mamma mia, he could scream. ‘I didn’t see a ******* thing left. People say sometimes they [pigs] leave something... in the end there was nothing left... those pigs could certainly eat.’ The killing has echoes of the film Snatch, made in 2000 by British director Guy Ritchie, in which a gang lord called Brick Top is seen describing how 16 pigs can get through a body weighing 200lb in only eight minutes, hence the expression ‘greedy as a pig’. Police said that Raccosta had begged Pepe for his life but he was ignored. Crime patch: The murder was carried out by Simone Pepe, a member of the 'Ndrangheta crime family which holds a fierce grip on the southern Italian region of Calabria, pictured . Officers also believe Pepe was responsible for at least three other murders within the same 24-hour period. The ’Ndrangheta crime family is said to be more powerful, more ruthless and wealthier than the Mafia on the neighbouring island of Sicily. According to the tapped phone calls, Pepe was boss of the Mazzagatti clan in Oppido Mamertina, near Reggio Calabria. He was one of 20 people arrested this week in an operation which also resulted in police confiscating millions of euros and property in the area and in Rome. Raccosta disappeared in March 2012 along with fellow mobster Carmine Putrino, who police believe was murdered at the same time and possibly also fed to pigs because no body has ever been discovered. Pepe has confessed to police his involvement in the murders, which he said were carried out in revenge for the killing of his mafia boss, or godfather, Domenico Bonarrigo. Detectives codenamed the operation Erinni, who in Greek mythology were the goddesses of vengeance. A police spokesman said: ‘This feud has been going on since the 1950s and has claimed numerous lives, among them a nine-year-old girl shot as she sat in her grandfather’s car. ‘Pepe was particularly brutal and by feeding his victim to pigs he thought he would earn the respect of other rivals as well as crime figures within his own clan.’","Francesco Raccosta was 'beaten with iron bars before being fed to animals'

Four days after their first defeat in eight months and Chelsea delivered a nerveless return to form. They have completed the group phase with 17 goals - more than any other team - and Jose Mourinho declared the Champions League starts here, with the ‘sharks in the ocean’. It was just the response he hoped for after losing at Newcastle United on Saturday. His team were in control early thanks to a Cesc Fabregas penalty and Andre Schurrle’s first goal since September.

There was no discernible apprehension that the first serious set-back of the campaign might develop into the type of stumbling sequence which Carlo Ancelotti liked to call ‘a bad moment’. The outcome was barely in doubt. Even when they threatened to nod off and allowed Sporting Lisbon to shorten the deficit, five minutes into the second half, Chelsea struck again, through John Mikel Obi. The sight of a Mikel goal always signifies a special occasion for Chelsea supporters. This was only his fifth in more than eight years at the club, and his first ever in the Champions League. Another treat for fans at the Bridge was a hotly anticipated debut for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, an 18-year-old midfielder, who has advanced through the club’s youth ranks to great acclaim. He is the flag-bearer of what they hope will be the ‘Made in Chelsea’ generation but it will take more than this brief cameo to establish that. There was also a favour for former favourite Roberto Di Matteo. Defeat for Sporting allowed his Schalke team to progress at their expense with a win in Maribor, but most important for Mourinho was a professional reaction to Saturday’s defeat. ‘We were focused and serious,’ said the Chelsea boss, satisfied his squad have the mental application to launch another long unbeaten run. ‘We showed a good attitude and did what we had to do. We played seriously and deserved to win.’ That said, Sporting did not provide the most formidable opposition and seemed strangely uninterested in acquiring the point which would have been enough for them to qualify for the last 16. This has not the most testing of Champions League groups for Chelsea. But, not only were they prolific, with 17 goals, they conceded only three in six games. Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus leap out as those to avoid in Monday’s draw for the last 16 but Mourinho said: ‘We have five possible opponents and each one is hard. Paris would be good because it’s easy for travel and easy for our fans. You think Basle is easy? We lost twice against them last year. They beat Liverpool. Leverkusen is not easy, or Shakhtar. It is not easy. ‘I don’t think any of the big teams is out. Maybe Liverpool, but all the teams who want to win it are in it. There are a few sharks in the ocean, but I like it this way.’ Mourinho swam with sharks on holiday in French Polynesia. ‘I didn’t want to go, but my wife and kids pushed me,’ he grinned. This time, he goes happily into the knockout phase of a competition he has twice won. ‘The real Champions League starts now,’ said Mourinho. ‘What can we do? I don’t know. Last season, we were not one of the top four for sure and we played in the semi-finals. Let’s see what we can do this time step by step.’ This win was achieved while resting players like John Terry, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Willian and those who stepped in proved they are ready and able. There was the reassuring presence of Petr Cech in goal and it was an important night for Mohamed Salah and Filipe Luis, who were in tandem on the left and quickly capitalised on the inexperience of right-back Ricardo Esgaio.

The result leaves United 10 points behind Chelsea, who visit Old Trafford on Sunday and are seen by many as champions-elect. But Shaw insists the title is not a foregone conclusion.

It’s a long season so we’ll have to see what happens,’ he said. ‘We’re going to work hard this week and be ready for the challenge on Sunday. It’s a massive test. They’re flying at the moment.’ On his own form Shaw provided a commendably honest appraisal, having received some criticism over his defensive credentials. He was partly at fault for Stephane Sessegnon’s opening goal at The Hawthorns by getting drawn too central trying to win the ball. Shaw, 19, said: ‘I know I haven’t been up to my full potential and I think maybe people can see that at the moment. They haven’t seen the best of me yet. ‘I am trying hard and it’s about getting used to everything. When you come to a club like this it’s never easy for a young player like me. But I’ll get myself starting soon and put in good performances. ‘I wouldn’t say I’ve been horrendous but I know I can do much better. And I need to do better. I’ve come to Manchester United and I know what they need. I’ve been working hard and the performances will come.’ Louis van Gaal will need to dip into the transfer market again if he thinks Manchester United can win the title . Shaw, who broke into the Southampton first team two years ago, was told by Louis van Gaal to improve his fitness during pre-season. Roy Hodgson also voiced his concerns. He had to wait for his debut until West Ham visited Old Trafford last month, and was withdrawn in his next match against Everton as a precaution over a knee complaint. But during the international break he played 180 minutes as England Under 21s beat Croatia over two legs to progress to Euro 2015 and that action provided a psychological and physical boost. ‘It always helps and the main thing for me was it was two 90 minutes for fitness,’ he said. ‘I feel fit but like I said I haven’t played my best recently. That’s football. Hopefully I’ll come out of it now. I think I could still get a bit fitter from working hard in training. But I do feel pretty fit in training.’ At The Hawthorns, Van Gaal set up United in a third different formation of the season, having started with a 5-3-2 system before switching to a midfield diamond. Manchester United players look dejected after West Brom's opening goal at the Hawthorns . Against West Brom it looked more 4-1-4-1 with Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj hugging the wings. Shaw described the formation as 4-3-3 and insisted it relatively straight-forward to adjust tactics. ‘It’s not too difficult, we had a few days to work on it,’ he said. ‘We did a lot of work based on the 4-3-3 formation with wide wingers. ‘We knew what we had to do against West Brom but unfortunately we didn’t get the result. It’s definitely two points lost, we’re Man United, we come to win every game. ‘It’s two points lost because we were positive ahead of the game. They only had two shots on target (but scored twice) and that’s not good enough for us. We’ll focus hard this week and be ready for the game on Sunday.’ VIDEO Van Gaal not happy after two lost points .","Luke Shaw admits he has not quite lived up to his £31million price tag .

"It was certainly due. For Samir Nasri, for Manchester City. Nasri hadn’t scored all season; they had looked a shadow of a team who should be making light work of the Champions League group stage by now. And then, on the hour, in the Stadio Olimpico, a plan came together. For Nasri, a goal at last. For City, a performance that lived up to the hype. They were men down here, and good men, too — Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany, David Silva until midway through the second half. Yet they came through. They won. CSKA Moscow lost, and a place in Monday’s last-16 draw was the prize. By God, they made hard work of it — but this, coupled with the magnificent finale against Bayern Munich, has changed the narrative around City in this tournament.

The next stage will be hard: Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid, Porto, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco are their possible opponents in the second round, but a number of those clubs will be fearing City every bit as much as City are nervous around Spain’s big beasts. It is feasible, after this, that a corner has been turned. City have every right to approach Europe with renewed confidence. They have taken their time, but this team are at last finding ways to win in the continent’s most inhospitable places. Roma have not lost here this season in Serie A and were expecting to progress from Group E, in the slipstream of Bayern Munich. They had outplayed City in the away fixture even if the game ended in a draw. City’s depleted ranks made it a tall order for a team that has struggled even at full strength. Yet, as strange as this may seem of a side with such experience, City came of age here. They scored — and that was essential, because Roma needed only a 0-0 draw if Moscow lost — and then they held on, despite a fierce onslaught. Pablo Zabaleta claimed the second goal with four minutes left, and even the most nervous traveller could breathe easy after that. City ended the game in rare nick, knocking the ball about like Champions League aristocracy. And what a peach of a goal made that possible. Nasri had not scored since the final day of last season. He was precisely the type of player who needed to step up to the plate with Aguero absent, and most certainly he did. Credit James Milner with a fine decoy run which opened the space for the shot, but Nasri’s finish was superb. A right-foot blast from just outside the area, deviating slightly and striking the inside of goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis’s near post, nestling in the net. Cue a frantic finish in front of a riotous Roman assembly. In many ways, this was where City came into their own. True, due to UEFA’s methods of separating tied teams at the group stage, after Nasri’s intervention Roma needed to score twice to progress, but this was City shorn of their inspirational captain Kompany. Martin Demichelis and Eliaquim Mangala are nothing if not accident-prone. Yet, under intense pressure, they stood tall. City celebrate Nasri's goal in front of their travelling fans packed into one corner of the stadium in Rome .

Zabaleta jumps into the arms of Joe Hart in celebration (left) and clenches his fist towards City's travelling support (right) Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini smiles after a job well done for his team at the Stadio Olimpico . As did Joe Hart. Shortly before Nasri’s goal, he had made a fine diving save from Miralem Pjanic and immediately after he kept out Radja Nainggolan in similar fashion. His best, though, came from a header by Kostas Manolas. Hart flung himself to the left and somehow, with his fingertips, prised it on to a post. Demichelis cleared off the line, too, but it was England’s goalkeeper who earned man of the match plaudits in the aftermath. Manuel Pellegrini has not always shown the greatest faith in him, but on occasions like this his quality shines through. He is head and shoulders the best goalkeeper in the country. No pun intended. City, as England’s champions, should be setting standards, but are not. In Europe this season they have on occasions been an embarrassment. The defeat at home by CSKA Moscow was a new low.

Hart receives a hug from unused substitute Frank Lampard after Manchester City's victory at the Stadio Olimpico . Hart was man of the match for City at the Stadio Olimpico as he made a number of important saves . Yet this is a forgiving competition, the group stage offering many second chances, and fair play to City for taking theirs. They should have been long gone. They looked it that night against Moscow, and again as Bayern Munich danced around them in the previous match. Yet Aguero’s hat-trick surprised us all on that occasion, and a collective effort did the trick here. City having been derided as a one-man team, it was perhaps understandable that Nasri seized on that aspect of the victory in his interviews. Stronger together, was his message. On this evidence it was impossible to deny. It definitely helped that City knew Moscow were losing at half-time. Provided that result was maintained, it made the second half a straight shoot-out between the teams here and perhaps the conservative Italians were startled by City’s ambition.

They were disciplined, yet adventurous, as if with nothing to lose. Having been pronounced dead after the Moscow defeat, they were an almost supernatural presence in this competition: impossible to kill twice. Of course, had Jose Holebas scored after five minutes it could have been very different. Picked out by a long pass on the right of the six-yard box, he cut inside, improved his angle and hit a low shot that was met by Hart’s first good save of the night. Moments later, Nainggolan struck a cross from the left that should have caused further problems — but Roma rarely got in behind City after that. Gervinho did his best to put his inconsistency at Arsenal behind him, and he attacked down the right flank after 21 minutes, firing a low effort past Hart that flew just wide of the far post — but not until City were ahead did Roma threaten consistently again. Dzeko and Roma defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa, who is on loan from Newcastle, are involved in a heated exchange . Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart picks up an object that is thrown in his direction from the crowd . Edin Dzeko had a few early chances, mostly set up by Jesus Navas, and should have done more with a glancing header and a close- range shot that he skied over the crossbar. Yet as Roma went in search of a way back, it was a defender, Zabaleta, who made sure of victory. He pounced on a pass from Nasri and finished low past De Sanctis. It was a welcome sight — much like the return of Silva, introduced for Navas after 67 minutes — and it was a happy blue contingent who spilled out into the mild night. This is a team on the up, despite its handicaps. This may be as good as it has been for City in Europe; but it might not be as good as it gets.

"A new reality series follows the life of a 380lb dancer as she tries to debunk common misconceptions about obesity. Whitney Thore, 30, launched into fame earlier this year when a YouTube video of her called A Fat Girl Dancing went viral, amassing more than 5.7million views to date. TLC's new show My Big Fat Fabulous Life will chronicle the life of the Greensboro, North Carolina native as she tries to dance her way to physical fitness, all while empowering women who feel guilty or ashamed of their bodies. Scroll down for video . Fat and fabulous! A new reality series called My Big Fat Fabulous Life follows the life of 380lb YouTube dancing star Whitney Thore, 30, as she tries to debunk common misconceptions about obesity . Transformation: An endocrine disorder called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) caused Whitney to gain more than 100lbs within four years in her teens . 'There's P.C. terms for everything these days, but fat people are fair game,' Whitney says in a preview for the series. 'Someone has to fight for us!' In the clip, Whitney explains that she was slender in her teens, weighing a healthy 114lbs when she began high school. But due to an endocrine disorder called Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS), which she was only diagnosed with later in life, she began gaining weight rapidly over the years and struggled to lose it. Flashback: Whitney (left, with a friend, and right) explains that she was a slender dancer in her teens, weighing a healthy 114lbs when she began high school . Quick judgments: These days, due to the PCOS, she weighs 380lbs - even with all the exercise and dance she does. 'I hate people thinking that I'm lazy,' she says . 'When I started college I started gaining weight so fast that I didn't know what was wrong with me,' she remembers, explaining that two-thirds of women with her condition are overweight or obese. 'By the end of my freshman year I'd gained 100lbs, and my entire life changed.' Too ashamed to look at herself in the mirror, Whitney gave up dancing and 'fell into a deep depression' that lasted several years. New start: Recently, Whitney decided to move back home with her parents (pictured), where she has launched a movement, #nobodyshamecampaign, in a bid to promote self-love and acceptance . Stay positive: 'Living with PCOS isn't easy,' she says. 'But I still have a choice in how I let it affect my attitude. I may be fat, but I am still fabulous. I have one life to live, and it damn sure better count' Ambition: She has also taken up dancing again and started teaching a dance class for other bigger women . She struggled with eating disorders and obsessive exercise, even dropping 100lbs in eight months - only to put it back on again almost as quickly. 'Looking back to when I was thin, I can't believe how much I took it for granted,' she admits, adding: 'I hate people thinking that I'm lazy.' Recently, Whitney decided to move back home with her parents, where she has taken up dancing again and launched a movement, #nobodyshamecampaign, in a bid to promote self-love and acceptance. And she has even begun teaching a dance class for other bigger women. Sensation: Whitney  launched into fame earlier this year when a YouTube video of her called A Fat Girl Dancing (pictured) went viral, amassing more than 5.7million views to date . 'I love all of the positive things that came out of the videos, but it doesn't change that right now, I'm the heaviest that I've ever been in my whole life,' says Whitney. PCOS is a condition in which a woman's hormones are out of balance. Thought to be genetic, it affects about one in ten women. PCOS may lead to menstrual cycle changes, cysts in the ovaries, trouble getting pregnant and other health changes. One of the most common symptoms is weight gain and trouble losing weight. 'So I need to lose some weight so that I can do everything in life I want to do, and hopefully I can do that through dance.' The series, which premieres in January, will follow Whitney as she lives life to the full, from wearing a bikini on the beach for the first time in a decade to going on dates and confronting online bullies who body-shame her. 'Living with PCOS isn't easy,' she says. 'But I still have a choice in how I let it affect my attitude. 'I may be fat, but I am still fabulous. I have one life to live, and it damn sure better count.' My Big Fat Fabulous Life premieres at 10/9c on Tuesday, January 13 on TLC.","Whitney was a slender 114lbs when she began high school .

"Ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have had his most successful financial year since leaving office . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to have had his most successful year financially since leaving office. Mr Blair is thought to have more than £13 million in the bank after a 'bumper' year for his business interests. Companies House figures for the year to April 2013 show that one of the companies he owns made a £2 million profit during the period. A City of London accountant told The Sunday Telegraph the 'bumper' figures showed Mr Blair had had his 'best year yet'. The analysis is based on the accounts of two companies, Windrush Ventures Limited and Firerush Ventures Limited, which were set up after he left Downing Street. Both fall under Tony Blair Associates. Windrush, which is thought to channel money for his Government Advisory Practice, had a turnover of £14.9 million, with an after-tax profit of £2 million. Firerush, a smaller company which administers funding for the former Prime Minister's work advising sovereign wealth funds and companies, had cash at the bank and in hand up from £1.2 million in the previous financial year to £4.6 million. The companies together had cash of £13.4 million and shareholder funds worth £7 million. Mr Blair, who has an estimated wealth of £70 million, advises JP Morgan and Zurich International as well as countries including Kazakhstan and Mongolia. He also runs two global charities.

It looked as though Suarez would be best supporting actor once again assisting Messi for Barca's first of the night but after Neymar had scored his 14th goal of the season – leaving him just one behind his tally for all of the last campaign – he took the lead role making it three and putting the result beyond doubt.

Of Barça's scoring front three, defender Jeremy Matheiu added: 'We know in the forward line we have three players who can win games on their own. We have to make sure we do our job at the other end.' Barcelona needed the win to top the group and it showed in Luis Enrique's team selection. There were no full-backs on the pitch as the home side started with three at the back, three in midfield and Pedro, Messi, Suarez and Neymar stretched ominously for PSG across the width of the Camp Nou pitch. It was a forward line with goals in and with the game only 15 minutes old Barcelona needed two. Ibrahimovic found himself all alone in the six-yard box.

"Tony Blair signed a 'secret contract' with a Saudi Arabian oil firm - which promised him £41,000 a month and a cut in successful negotiations . Tony Blair has amassed a personal fortune since standing down as prime minister – often acting as an adviser to controversial businesses and regimes. But yesterday the hefty fees he charges to act as a go-between were revealed. A previously secret contract with a Saudi oil company headed by a member of the country’s royal family has been leaked showing Mr Blair charging £41,000 a month and 2 per cent commission on any of the multi-million-pound deals he helped broker. The emergence of the Saudi deal led to new criticism of Mr Blair’s role as a Middle East envoy, but he strongly denied there is a conflict of interest. The contract between Tony Blair Associates (TBA) and PetroSaudi signed in November 2010, said Mr Blair would personally arrange introductions to his contacts in China, such as senior politicians. He had already attracted scathing criticism after it emerged that he had given Kazakhstan’s autocratic president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, advice on how to manage his image after the slaughter of 14 unarmed civilians. Mr Blair has said claims that he is worth £100million are ‘greatly exaggerated’. But the Saudi contract shows how much he has been able to charge for his services. Since leaving Downing Street in 2007, he has amassed a fortune including a property portfolio of 31 homes worth at least £25million. He is one of the world’s best paid speakers – earning up to £150,000 a speech – and has secured advisory roles with US investment bank JP Morgan and Swiss insurer Zurich International. The Saudi contract stated that TBA would help find potential sources of new investment and added that Mr Blair would make ‘introductions to the senior political leadership, industrial policymakers, corporate entities and other persons in China identified and deemed by us and you to be relevant to PetroSaudi’s international strategy’. The firm agreed it would not divulge his role without permission. Deal: Tony Blair in 2010 with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, right. Mr Blair signed a contract with PetroSaudi, a firm founded by his son .

The former Labour Party leader (centre) stands shoulder to shoulder with George Osborne, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and John Major at the service amid claims he 'signed a secret contract' with the oil firm . The former Labour Party leader signed the deal with PetroSaudi, which was co-founded by the son of the King  of Saudi Arabia - Prince Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud (pictured centre, shaking hands) The contract read: ‘Each party will ensure that no announcements, statements or documentation containing any reference to either party or to Tony Blair will be published or made without the prior express written consent of the other party.’ The oil firm was founded by Saudi businessman Tarek Obaid and Prince Turki bin Abdullah Al Saud, a son of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, and has projects in Ghana, Indonesia, Venezuela and Tunisia. Critics have already said Mr Blair is not suitable for his role as a Middle East peace envoy, in which he is a representative of the quartet of the UN, the EU, the US and Russia, because of his business interests in the region. Oliver Miles, a former ambassador to Libya, who signed a letter in June that argued Mr Blair’s responsibility for the Iraq crisis and lack of transparency of his interests, said this was the latest example of why he was wrong for the unpaid role. PetroSaudi (pictured is one of its ships) asked that Blair personally introduce them to his Chinese contacts . ‘The fact this was kept a secret, or was intended to be kept secret, was a mistake,’ he told the Sunday Times. But a spokesman for Mr Blair stressed the consultancy work was related to China not the Middle East. He said: ‘Tony Blair Associates worked for PetroSaudi for a period of months over four years ago. ‘This was in connection with an issue in the Far East and nothing whatsoever to do with the Middle East or the unpaid ex-officio role of Tony Blair for the quartet in Palestine.’ PetroSaudi said Mr Blair was engaged on a confidential basis to help develop business in China and the work lasted ‘about four or five months maximum’. Saudi Arabia has come under fire over its human rights record. Amnesty International has said that more than 2,000 people were executed there between 1985 and 2013. Mr Blair was criticised over his decision in 2006 to halt a Serious Fraud Office investigation into alleged corruption over a multi-billion-pound arms deal between BAE Systems and Saudi Arabia.","Tony Blair signed contract with PetroSaudi to promote it to Chinese leaders .

"A former vice cop who now works as a full-time pastor will star in a new reality show that aims at getting women off the street. 8 Minutes will center around Pastor Kevin Brown and his work trying to get prostitutes and escorts in the Los Angeles area to give up their work and go straight. And though the show is not set to air until next year, Brown has been doing this work for years now. Scroll down for video . Saved: Pastor Kevin Brown will star in the new reality show 8 Minutes in which he will have eight minutes to try and convince a prostitute to give up the lifestyle and go straight . Changed man: Brown, who has spent years trying to save and help women, used to be a vice cop . 'This is one of those great shows that was actually happening whether anybody was shooting it or not,' executive producer Tom Forman told EW. 'Brown told his congregation that for 20 years he’s had to arrest these women when what he’s really wanted to do is help them. It launched a drive within his church to run these undercover operations. We read that and thought somebody should put a camera on this.' Brown works to target woman he feels have been forced into the business, something he is good at after all his years working in vice. He then meets them in a room pretending to be a client, and offers them the chance to quit, providing the assistance they would need to leave the lifestyle. The show will follow these interactions, as well as life after for women that have chosen to leave. 'Women have burst into tears and said, “I’ve been waiting for someone to offer me a path out,”' said Forman. 'And you have women who say, “I’m doing what I’m doing and I’m not doing anything else,” and they decline.' Way out: Even the women who refuse his help get a number to call should they change their mind . As for the eight minutes, that is a safety protocol for the girls, this way if they decline they can go back to their pimps, should they have one, and just claim Brown was a cop without causing any problems. If they do not accept his help, Brown does still leave the women with a phone number to contact him later. In addition to Brown, the show will also have safety lookouts to make sure nothing turns violent and former prostitutes who the Pastor previously saved from the lifestyle to talk to the girls. 8 Minutes will air on A&E.","The new reality show 8 Minutes will feature a man trying to convince prostitutes and escorts to give up their line of work in eight minutes .

"This incredible photograph shows the moment a one-year-old girl who lost her arms and legs to meningitis learns to crawl. Harmonie-Rose Allen became a quadruple amputee shortly after taking her first ever steps. Doctors told her parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen their only daughter had one of the worst cases of the virus they had ever seen. Harmonie was given a one in ten chance of survival and spent her first birthday in intensive care as her limbs were removed in a series of operations. Doctors were also forced to remove the tip of her nose and warned her parents she could suffer long-term vision and learning problems. Harmonie-Rose Allen, aged one, is learning to crawl again, after losing both her arms and legs to meningitis . The youngster's plight touched the hearts of thousands of people who have already raised £100,000 to help her cope with life without arms or legs. Her family say she is facing the challenge with remarkable good nature - as these first photos show. Last week Harmonie opened the first door of her advent calendar, with the help of her mother, and has even been painting her own Christmas card with the help of a special attachment. Her mother Miss Hall, 20, said: 'She has such a strong character and it is beginning to come back now - she knows what she wants. She has got her smile back. 'Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie. She has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us. 'We will make her life as amazing and fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect. 'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought. 'I don't know what I would do without her.' Brave Harmonie-Rose Allen opens the first door of her advent calendar, with the help of mother Freya Hall . She is now beaming again after the killer bug struck 10 days after she walked for the first time in September. Her parents feared she wouldn't survive to enjoy Christmas with them . Despite the ordeal she has faced, the toddler is finally smiling again. Medics warned her parents she had a 10 per cent chance of surviving when she fell victim to the killer bug in September - just 10 days after taking her first steps. Three months on and the family are preparing to spend Christmas in hospital. Miss Hall, 20, said: 'She has such a strong character and its beginning to come back now, she knows what she wants. 'She has got her smile back. Ross and I are extremely proud of Harmonie. She has come so far and fought so hard to be here with us. 'We will make her life as amazing, and fulfilling as we can. She's our perfect little princess and she will always be perfect. 'To be told that she had 10 per cent chance of survival and to be here now is incredible and means so much to us how hard she's fought. 'I don't know what I would do without her.' Harmonie-Rose's parents Freya Hall and Ross Allen first noticed something was wrong when she woke in the night coughing and soon developed a tell-tale rash. Doctors told the couple their daughter had a 10 per cent chance of surviving, preparing them for the worst . Meningitis Research Foundation estimates that there are around 3,400 cases of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia every year in the UK and Ireland. This means that every day nine people become ill with the diseases. With one in ten people dying, a death will occur almost every day. A further two people will be left with life-altering after effects as severe as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations. Meningitis vaccines offer excellent protection, but they are not yet available for all forms. So it's vital to know meningitis symptoms and what to do if you suspect someone has meningitis or septicemia. Symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia: . Other signs in babies: . Septicaemia can occur with or without meningitis. Not everyone gets all the symptoms and they can appear in any order. Source: Meningitis Research Foundation . The couple first noticed something was wrong with Harmonie-Rose in September, when she woke in the night coughing and unable to breathe. They took her to the Royal United Hospital in Bath but doctors could not find anything seriously wrong and she was sent home. But the next morning Harmonie-Rose turned blue and they took her back to the same hospital. Following an assessment they were told it was just a virus and were again sent home. But hours later Harmonie-Rose became floppy and lethargic and they rushed back to the hospital, where a rash was spotted. Within four hours, the toddler's body was covered with the purple rash, leaving her parents lost for words. Miss Hall, a full-time mother, said: 'She had a cold for about a week before we took her to the hospital but she was also teething. 'She was still happy and playing right up until we took her to the hospital the second time. 'We saw the spot on her nose and it did not go away, the nurse acted very fast and within seconds her room was filled with doctors and nurses. 'Every time we looked at Harmonie she was becoming covered with more purple like bruises. 'Harmonie was then taken to adult intensive care and we did not hear from them until about four hours later. 'When we walked in to see Harmonie I could have fainted. 'She was asleep and was more covered in the rash than before, this was when we realised it was really severe. 'The doctors told us she would lose the tip of her nose and that was only if she survived. 'He told us he was very worried about our little girl and that she may not survive, my whole life was turned upside down within a second I was so angry and upset. 'The rash was literally covering her from head to toe, it was purple and a dark purple. 'Gradually the whole of her arms and legs were purple; they weren't just dots anymore, they had changed the colour of Harmonie's skin.' The brave toddler, pictured with her mother, fought the bug, but doctors were forced to amputate her arms and legs, as well as the tip of her nose. She has undergone 10 operations but is now out of immediate danger . Friends and family have helped raise more than £100,000 for the Help4Harmonie appeal to help pay for the one-year-old's future rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and adaptations to her home . Harmonie-Rose has undergone more than 10 operations and is now out of immediate danger, but her mother says she still faces a number of challenges on her road to recovery. Since the youngster's diagnosis, friends, family and members of the public have been raising funds to help Harmonie. To date the Help4Harmonie appeal has raised more than £100,000, which will be used for rehabilitation, hydrotherapy and home adaptations. Her mother added: 'The support has really helped and it's overwhelming. People from all over the world are supporting Hope4Harmonie. 'Life will never be easy for Harmonie but knowing we have this kind of support fills me with warmth that Harmonie will lead as normal life as possible.'

"UK doping officials are to contact the IAAF to obtain more information following serious allegations surrounding one of the biggest stars in British athletics. London lawyers representing the athlete moved into overdrive yesterday to make sure their client is not named, with threats of legal action if the star’s unblemished reputation was damaged in any way by being linked with known drugs cheats. The star British athlete is named on a list — seen by Sportsmail — that details 150 athletes with alleged highly suspicious blood samples from 2006-08 that were not followed up with target testing by the IAAF. Three London 2012 champions are reportedly on the list as well. One of Britain’s best known track and field stars is reportedly named on a list of 150 athletes from around the world who had suspicious blood values that were covered up . The existence of the document — but not the identities — was revealed in an explosive series of three documentaries by German TV network ARD who were greatly helped by a senior whistleblower from within the IAAF medical and anti-doping commission. Two other Britons are listed but were fringe track-and-field performers, though one was tested before a major competition because of suspicions brought on by ill-advised comments pre-race. The well known British star was contacted by Sportsmail and given the opportunity to explain circumstances behind the high blood values that led to their inclusion on a list containing many athletes with doping records. A number of them were found out after their blood samples showed suspiciously high concentrations of haemoglobin — a possible sign they were using blood-boosting endurance drug EPO. But although there are no suggestions that the result of the famous Briton’s blood sample — on the highest red tier of suspicious activity on the whistleblower’s document — was the result of doping, the only response to Sportsmail’s questions  came from the lawyers. However, UK Anti-Doping recognise the allegations as being in the public interest and their intelligence and operation team will seek talks with the IAAF. The UK doping officials want to ascertain if blood samples, which are frozen and can be retested, fall within the current eight-year limit for retrospective testing. Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping . The IAAF have not disputed the authenticity of the documents but did issue a six-point rebuttal on Tuesday. Juan Manuel Alonso, chairman of their medical commission, said on Twitter: ‘Blood samples taken before 2009 were thoroughly examined.’ The latest doping scandal will add weight to Lord Coe’s campaign for the IAAF’s anti-doping system to be completely independent in terms of testing and sanctions. Coe, who is standing for election to succeed Lamine Diack as IAAF president next August, said: ‘This is the time to really push for a wholly independent arm to our testing procedures.’ Lord Coe is calling for the IAAF’s anti-doping system to be independent in terms of testing and sanctions .

"Controversial social media star Dan Blizerian was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport Tuesday night for allegedly trying to manufacture a bomb. Blizerian, 34, who has been dubbed the 'King of Instagram,' was taken into custody at around 8pm on an out-of-state warrant and charged with felony possessing or manufacturing explosive or incendiary devices. The hard-partying poker player was booked at 10.15pm at the LAPD's Pacific Division and was ordered held without bail. Scroll down for video . More trouble: Instagram celebrity Dan Blizerian has been arrested at Los Angeles International Airport Tuesday night for allegedly trying to manufacture a bomb . Grounded: The jet-setting Playboy millionaire, pictured here crowd-surfing with a naked woman in an inflatable boat at club Hakkasan in Las Vegas, is being held in Los Angeles without bail . Playing with fire: Court documents state that Blizerian, pictured second right in white shorts, was in possession of chemicals that, when combined, create pure TNT . According to the criminal complaint, a sealed warrant was issued for Blizerian's arrest in Clark County, Nevada, on November 13, but it took law enforcement officials nearly a month to apprehend him after his flight from Miami landed in LA Tuesday night, reported TMZ. Court documents contend that the jet-setting, gun-obsessed multimillionaire was in possession of chemicals that, when combined, create pure TNT. The incident comes just days after a model accused Blizerian of kicking her in the face at a Miami Beach nightclub. The owner of the club LIV told TMZ Tuesday that Blizerian has been banned from the establishment. But that may be just the beginning of Blizerian's legal troubles, as the woman at the center of the incident, Vanessa Castano, filed a lawsuit against him Wednesday, calling the burly Internet bad boy a 'menacing trust fund recipient,' according to the gossip site. Blizerian has drawn 5.7million followers to his Instagram account, which features countless photos of scantily clad beauties, over-the-top boozy parties, yachts, luxury cars and privates jets. Accessories: Blizerian is known for sharing photos of his many guns and piles of cash . Explosive temperament: On Thanksgiving Day, Blizerian shared this video of him blowing targets to smithereens with a large-caliber gun . Heavy artillery: He recently bragged on Twitter about shooting this 20mm cannon . The poker champ and one-time aspiring Navy SEAL also has been known to share with his fans pictures of his large weapons collection, which he lovingly refers to as his ‘accessories.’ As recently as last month, Blizerian bragged on Twitter about shooting a 20mm cannon. In a profile published in the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, Blizerian estimated earning about $50miillion in poker winnings in just over a year. On Saturday night, Bilzerian was reportedly filmed kicking Vanessa Castano in the face while celebrating his birthday at LIV Nightclub in Miami. Dim footage shows a figure standing on a podium, dressed in a tight T-shirt moving to music. The muscular man then leans casually forward and kicks out, after which a crowd of people throng round. Bevvy of beauties: In nearly every photo, the 34-year-old Internet celebrity is surrounded by scantily clad young women . Bragging rights: Blizerian, who is worth millions of dollars, travels in style wherever he goes . 'Attack': Video purporting to be Bilzerian has been published, allegedly showing him kicking a woman in the face at the LIV Nightclub in Miami, Florida, Saturday night . Lashing out: The dim footage shows the muscular figure's foot connecting with somebody in the crowd. The woman has said she was left with a bleeding eye - and plans legal action . Legal action: Model Vanessa Castano has filed a lawsuit against Blizerian accusing him of kicking her in the face . Celebrity gossip site The Dirty reported that the video showed Bilzerian, who allegedly left the woman battered and bloody. The alleged victim later claimed she 'did nothing to deserve' being kicked and was left bleeding from her eye. Miss Castano also said she would take legal action, and she has since made good on her promise. The self-described venture capitalist and poker player, who inherited his enormous wealth, daily uploads images of guns, naked women, wild parties cars and jets on a daily basis. Earlier this year, a video emerged of Bilzerian holding a naked teenage porn star above his head on a rooftop, then throwing her off the building into a swimming pool below, breaking her foot. Janice Griffith, then 18, later threatened to sue Bilzerian because she was left unable to work because of her injuries. Before: Earlier this year Bilzerian was filmed hurling a teenage porn star off of a roof into a swiming pool below. She says the impact broke her foot and she couldn't work . Lavish: Bilzerian owns fleets of cars and makes a show of his high-flying lifestyle online . Typical: Bilzerian's Instagram feed is full of images like these, showing himself surrounded by hardly-dressed women . Blizerian's latest alleged victim, Vanessa Castano, explained that initially she didn't feel seriously hurt, but having watched the grainy footage from the club, she wanted to take action. She said: 'There were two girls standing next to me at the table that were fighting. People started getting shoved and I tried to separate them. 'Then Dan pushed me both off the banquette and once I fell he kicked me in the face. I wanted to file a police report and EMT checked my face I was bleeding from my eye but I felt fine and at that point I just wanted to go home. 'I really didn’t see how serious it was until I watched the video for myself. I’m lucky that the injuries weren’t worse. I did nothing to deserve that kick to head, I am gonna go ahead pursue legal action against him.' Women and weapons: Bilzerian's social media log also features firearms and private jets .

"For all that they may exist at different levels, work with different budgets and different players, the challenge facing just about every single football manager is broadly the same. It is to be seen to be making progress or - at the very least - maintaining the status quo. As he tries to negotiate a way through his second season in English football, this is most certainly the challenge facing Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. That is why what happened in the Olympic Stadium on Wednesday night may transpire to be so significant. During a season that has seen City struggle at times, Pellegrini and his players have needed something to build on, something tangible. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Roma 0-2 Manchester City . Samir Nasri leads the celebrations after scoring one of his most important goals in a City shirt . City players mob their French goalscorer after his strike helped to fire the club into the last 16 . Pablo Zabaleta added a second with the clock ticking down to secure City's place in the Euro elite . When Samir Nasri’s thunderous shot - perhaps the most ferocious of his career - found the back of the net after an hour here, it was tempting to wonder if that moment had arrived. It is best to disregard the line credited to City chief executive Ferran Soriano in the days before Pellegrini was appointed in the summer of 2013. ‘Five trophies in five seasons’ was a handy soundbite but it was never meant to be taken seriously. Football, at whatever level, is usually more nuanced than that. It is about results, of course, but it’s also about progress made by individual players, about baby steps taken in different competitions. When the ever-admirable Pablo Zabaleta sealed City’s remarkable victory in the closing moments here, his team had secured something that had appeared beyond them for so long this season. City travelled to a hostile environment and saw off Roma, who have been impressive at home this season . Joe Hart punches clear as his defence held firm with City showing impressive savvy on the continent . Hart picks up and displays an object hurled onto the pitch with the Roma fans showing partisan support . City’s manager has never admitted it publicly but a sense of stagnation has seemed to characterise the English champions at times this season. That may have worried him a little ahead of this game in Italy. Other managers in the Barclays Premier League will feel this, too. Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool, certainly, and also Roberto Martinez at Everton. Pellegrini, however, may have sensed something turn his way on Wednesday night. City are Premier League champions and still very much in touch with Chelsea at the top end of the table. Now they are in the knockout stage of the Champions League, too, and the restorative power of that achievement may be measured in full over the weeks to come. Are City currently the team they were this time last year? The answer to that question has to be no, both in the manner of their football and their results. Although they were almost overhauled by a charging Liverpool towards the end of last season’s domestic campaign, there were times when Pellegrini’s team played with an authority and a momentum that has so far eluded them this time around. Francesco Totti was substituted during the game as the Italian side were outwitted by Manuel Pellegrini . Vincent Kompany watches from the bench, with Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure also missing from the team . Fernando gets stuck in during a gutsy outing for the Premier League Champions . However, City have a result behind them now which is perhaps as important as anything they have managed during Pellegrini’s time at the club. Some may look back at Sergio Aguero’s late goals that brought City unlikely victory at home to 10-man Bayern Munich last month and talk of greater significance. Certainly the European cause would already have been lost without them. On Wednesday night, however, City won as a team and they also won without four of their best players. So perhaps this means more. Take international footballers such as Aguero, David Silva, Yaya Toure and Vincent Kompany out of any starting line-up and the capacity to win big games will perhaps drop by as much as thirty per cent. That only serves to make this result even more impressive. City’s issues this season have not centred around player injuries but more elusive factors of form and confidence, both individual and collective. Some of Pellegrini’s best players have not been consistently at their best and that has damaged City. On Wednesday night it was a little different. City rode some good fortune at times - particularly early on - but who is to say they didn’t deserve it? Gervinho was a menace early on with the Ivorian proving a thorn in City's defence . James Milner was stout in defence and promising in attack, with Morgan De Sanctis thwarting this cross . In Sergio Aguero's absence, Edin Dzeko led the line  as City played a blinder in the Italian capital . VIDEO Roma needed to be more clinical - Garcia . The statistics released after the game showed Roma had more shots, made more passes and won more corners. But they also showed that City’s players had run further. As such, this was an away win founded on old-fashioned principles. The size of the task facing Pellegrini’s team was huge. Despite their 7-1 humbling here by Bayern, Roma’s home record this season is actually very good and if City were to take the win they needed they knew they would have to find something rather special. Early on, they struggled a little. Roma left back Jose Holebas almost scored and Gervinho troubled City in a fashion alien to those who watched him labour as an Arsenal player. City did improve, though, and were reasonably robust in central areas while, in the attacking third, James Milner and Jesus Navas looked dangerous on occasion. Ultimately, City produced something that has eluded them for so long, namely a ‘proper’ European performance. They defended stoutly and broke to steal the lead with a stunning goal. After that, there were scares. There were always going to be. Joe Hart made some saves that he will remember for a while just as Roma’s forwards missed some chances they perhaps shouldn’t have. Over in Munich, things went City’s way, too, but we shouldn’t dwell on that. Instead, we should dwell on what was a huge performance and a huge result for Pellegrini and City. This is what grown-up European teams do. It has been a while coming and it will be interesting to see if it proves to be a catalyst for change or something less meaningful.","Manchester City beat Roma 2-0 on Wednesday night at Stadio Olimpico .

Alway was dismissed of more than a dozen other counts under a plea agreement. Some of those counts were resisting an officer, possession of a controlled substance, and receiving stolen property. The Desert Sun reports that Alway has been in custody since last year at the Larry D. Smith Correctional Facility on $150,000 bail. The ANTM finalist was arrested on June 28 in 2013 for investigation of burglary, fraud, narcotics possession, committing a felony while on bail and other charges, the Palm Springs Police Department said in a statement at the time of the arrest. Officers responding to a report of a suspicious woman walking around a neighborhood spotted a condominium with an open back door, police said. Neighbors told officers the residents were out of the country and Alway was found hiding in the garage allegedly armed with a gun, police said. Authorities believed an armed man also was in the condo and the SWAT team was called in for the ensuing six-hour standoff. When Alway appeared before a judge last year she shaved her head for her court appearance in Palm Springs where she was given a drug evaluation. Her sister told TMZ after the 2013 court appearance that her sister wanted to 'start over' and that's why she chose to shave her head.

"Scotland Yard was last night under intense pressure to look closer at the mysterious circumstances surrounding the horrific death plunge of a tycoon. Scot Young, 52, a one-time fixer to the super rich – including Russian oligarchs – was impaled on railings after falling four storeys from a window on Monday. He had been at the centre of one of Britain’s most notorious divorce cases which had led to his imprisonment for refusing to reveal how much money he was worth to his ex-wife, Michelle. Questions unanswered: Scotland Yard is under pressure to re-examine the death of tycoon Scot Young (left). The 52-year-old, who plunged to his death  on Monday, was in a divorce battle with ex-wife Michelle (right) Scene: Mr Young died in Marylebone, central London, where police are not saying whether he left a note . Mrs Young, 49, has continued to doggedly pursue her ex husband for money and yesterday recently employed Nevyan Intelligence Services as part of her determined attempts to track down Mr Young’s funds. Police originally said within hours of his body’s discovery there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death. But last night detectives were under pressure re-investigate the fall amid fears they discounted foul play too soon. Officers have refused to say if he left a note. Some friends of Mr Young were also sceptical about whether he would have taken his own life. One of them, who visited the scene of his death yesterday, said: ‘He was a great man and a good father who has been let down by the British legal system. We don’t know if it was suicide yet.’ Notorious: Scot Young, who fell to his death onto railings on Monday, was at the centre of one of Britain's best-known divorce battles with his wife Michelle. The pair are pictured together on the wedding day in 1995 . Tragedy: The tycoon (left with fiancee Noelle Reno) was at the centre of one of Britain's most acrimonious divorce cases involving Michelle Young (right), 49 - who said she and their daughters were 'devastated' Fall: Mr Young, pictured this year, went bankrupt after he made his fortune 'fixing' deals for the super-rich . One associate of Mr Young’s said: ‘I hope this [Mr Young’s death] makes people realise now that there was no money, he didn’t have any money. It is very unpleasant.’ Mr Young’s body was found by residents in upmarket Marylebone, central London, at 5pm Monday afternoon. He had fallen 60ft on to the iron railings and firefighters had to cut through the metal with an angle grinder before the body could be removed. Neighbours said they believed Mr Young was alone in the £3million duplex flat when he fell, though they said his fiancé, American model Noelle Reno, 30, had been at the property earlier in the day. In a statement yesterday, Miss Reno said she was ‘distraught by the sudden loss of my best friend’. The couple, who met in 2008, became engaged after Mr Young proposed while they were filming an episode of an American reality television programme, called Ladies of London. Couple: Mr Young was engaged to Ladies Of London star Noelle Reno, pictured together on holiday this year . Last picture: Scot Young attended a Christmas party with Noelle, together left, in London on November 27 . But their relationship remained overshadowed by the divorce battle which sparked a six-year court fight and ended in a £20million settlement for Mrs Young and the jailing of Mr Young last year for contempt of court for refusing to reveal his wealth. She said she was too distressed to comment yesterday and was instead focusing on comforting their two daughters, Sasha, 21, and Scarlet, 19, at the central London flat they share. ‘We are just in shock, we don’t know what to say,’ she said. Earlier she said she and her daughters had been ‘to hell and back’. Another friend of Mr Young suggested he was financially struggling and had borrowed tens of thousands of pounds before he went to jail for contempt of court, saying: ‘Scot was completely broke and needed cash to tide himself over. 'There was a date set when Scot promised to pay the money back, but it came and went and then he went to prison. Mr Young's body was found by horrified residents in Marylebone on Monday afternoon. He had fallen 60ft onto the iron railings below his flat and police moved quickly to hide the distressing scene from onlookers . ‘When Scot was released he promised he would pay him back but he repeatedly failed to do so.’ A female friend of Mr and Mrs Young pointed to his one-time friendship with the late Russian tycoon Boris Beresovsky as something that should be investigated by police. She said: ‘The police need to look at this and the death of Boris Berezovsky again.’ In November last year a judge ordered Mr Young was ordered him to pay her £20million after ruling he had ‘hidden’ his wealth from the court. During the divorce battle, Mr Young, had claimed he was ‘penniless’ with debts of £28million after his business empire imploded. He claimed to have lost millions in a mysterious property deal in Russia called Project Moscow. Mr Berezovsky, who died in mysterious circumstances last year, was known to be an investor in the scheme.","One-time fixer to the super-rich impaled on railings after four-storey fall .

"Swansea expect star striker Wilfried Bony to extend his contract until 2018 - and manager Garry Monk hopes it could even be done before the visit of Arsenal on Sunday. Bony revealed on Thursday that he is close to signing a one-year extension on his current deal at the Liberty Stadium and that would be a huge boost for a Swansea side who have started the season well and lie sixth in the Barclays Premier League. The Ivorian scored 25 goals in all competitions last season following his club record £12million move from Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem and after a slow start this term has scored four times in as many league appearances. Wilfried Bony is closing in on a new deal which will see him stay at Swansea City until 2018 . Ivory Coast international Bony was linked with summer movea to Premier League duo Arsenal and Liverpool . Swansea 2-2 Newcastle (1 goal) Stoke 2-1 Swansea (1 goal) Swansea 2-0 Leicester (2 goals) Everton 0-0 Swansea . 'Hopefully it will be agreed before the weekend and done before the game,' Monk said of Bony's contract extension at his press conference ahead of the Arsenal match. 'That would be nice, but you've got to go through the legal procedures to check everything's in place. 'I've had a great relationship with Wilfried and spoke to him a lot in the summer, I know how committed he is as a person and as a professional. 'He enjoys his time at Swansea and this contract is a symbol of how much he enjoys being here and how committed he is to the club. 'It's a big signing for the club and the player himself but also for his team-mates, and hopefully it will be a big boost to everyone.' Bony has been strongly linked with some of the Premier League's biggest clubs since settling so well into English football and scoring twice at the World Cup for the Ivory Coast. Bony, pictured with Everton's Antolin Alcaraz, has scored four goals in his last four Premier League games . Liverpool and Sunday's Liberty visitors Arsenal were reported to have considered bids for the 25-year-old powerhouse last summer but Bony was still at Swansea when the new season got under way. 'You're always going to see a lot of speculation about a player like that,' Monk said. 'But it's nice to see such a good player and a big character in the changing rooms commit to the club. 'I think he deserves it, it's something he wanted himself and through negotiations we've come to an agreement with the player. 'He's been very good for us as he's scored a lot of goals but more than that he contributes to the group. 'He's a strong character and leader within the group and the more people you have like that in your squad the better for everyone. 'I'm sure Wilfried will be linked again in the transfer window - but my focus is on keeping the best players at the club.' Swansea boss Garry Monk believes Bony could put pen to paper on a new deal before his side's next game . Monk, though, is unsure whether another striker, Michu, will be returning to Swansea as early as January following reports in Italy that the Napoli loan signing was surplus to requirements at the Serie A club. Michu, who scored 22 goals in his first campaign at Swansea before suffering an injury-hit season last term, has managed only three starts and five appearances for Napoli and failed to either complete 90 minutes or score for Rafael Benitez's side. The 28-year-old has now been ruled out for the next fortnight with a recurrence of the ankle problem that plagued him at Swansea but Monk says the player's position is unclear. 'I'm not sure contractually whether we could bring him back and we'd have to check fine lines before dealing with something like that,' Monk said. 'I've not spoken to him recently but we'll see what the situation is and assess it from there.'","Swansea ace Wilfried Bony is close to putting pen to paper on a new deal .

"High-profile Muslim scholars have taken to YouTube to warn terrorists holding British aid worker Alan Henning that their actions are 'totally prohibited' under Sharia law. The latest plea to free the former taxi driver from Manchester who travelled to the region as an aid worker last year is made by a judge on the Sharia council in London, a director of Prophetic Guidance and an Imam. It comes after more than a hundred representatives from Britain's Muslim community signed a letter urging Isis to release the 47-year-old who appeared at the end of a video last Saturday in which fellow captive David Haines was killed. Scroll down for video . Muslim scholars have taken to YouTube to warn terrorists holding British aid worker Alan Henning that their actions are 'totally prohibited' under Sharia law . Judge Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad (pictured), a judge on the Sharia council in London, said executing Alan Henning would be 'prohibited according to Sharia' Ustadh Abu Eesa (pictured), a director of Prophetic Guidance, is based in Manchester and said on the YouTube video that he would 'personally vouch for' Alan Henning . In a YouTube video Judge Shaykh Haitham Al Haddad said: 'This is to confirm that executing this man is ... impermissible, prohibited according to Sharia.' Ustadh Abu Eesa, a director of Prophetic Guidance, is based in Manchester and said he would 'personally vouch for' Mr Henning, adding that his would-be killers are defacing the religion of Islam. Imam Shakeel Begg, of Lewisham Islamic Centre quotes from the Koran, explained that there is 'no justification in our religion that allows you to continue to hold him let alone harm him'. Footage earlier this week showed Mr Henning with other aid workers on the Greece-Turkey border in December last year saying the dangerous journey to Syria is 'worthwhile' to help those in need. Imam Shakeel Begg (pictured), of Lewisham Islamic Centre quotes from the Koran, explained that there is 'no justification in our religion that allows you to continue to hold him let alone harm' Alan Henning . The latest plea to free Alan Henning (pictured left and right, in the Isis video) who travelled to the region as an aid worker last year is made by a judge on the Sharia council in London . On Thursday a video of British photojournalist John Cantlie was released, showing the hostage reading from a prepared script, saying he would talk about the self-proclaimed IS movement. Unlike previous Isis videos there was no threat made on camera to Mr Cantlie's life. Meanwhile, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said today that 49 hostages who were seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey. The announcement brings to an end Turkey's most serious hostage crisis. The hostages were kidnapped from the Turkish Consulate in Mosul, Iraq on June 11, when the Islamic State group overran the city in its surge to seize large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Their release contrasts with the recent beheadings of two U.S. journalists and a British aid worker by the Islamic State group. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu gets into his plane with hostages today at the airport of the southern Turkish city of Sanliurfa near the Syrian border . But it wasn't immediately clear what Turkey had done to secure the safe release of the hostages or where the release took place. Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said the hostages are 49 Turkish consulate employees - 46 Turks and three local Iraqis - including Consul General Ozturk Yilmaz, other diplomats, children and special forces police. The hostages were released early on Saturday and had arrived in Turkey, Davutoglu told Turkish reporters during a visit to Baku, Azerbaijan. Davutoglu said the release was the result of the intelligence agency's 'own methods,' and not a 'point operation' involving special forces, but didn't elaborate. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (pictured) said 49 hostages seized by Islamic militants in Iraq have been freed and safely returned to Turkey . 'After intense efforts that lasted days and weeks, in the early hours, our citizens were handed over to us and we brought them back to our country,' Davutoglu said. Meanwhile, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the Turks were freed through 'a successful operation.' 'I thank the prime minister and his colleagues for this operation which was pre-planned, whose every detail was calculated, which lasted through the night in total secrecy and ended successfully this morning,' Erdogan said in a statement. Thirty-two Turkish truck drivers who were also seized in Mosul on June 6 were released a month later. Turkey did not provide information surrounding their release.","Muslim scholars call for release of kidnapped Alan Henning in YouTube plea .

"Ruben Loftus-Cheek lent down and listened to the last words of wisdom from Jose Mourinho before the 18-year-old made his Chelsea debut. 'I gave you this, you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine.' Mourinho said. 'No problem,' the youngster replied. Finally, with seven minutes of the 90 to play,  Loftus-Cheek got his chance. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Chelsea 3-1 Sporting Lisbon . Despite only playing 11 minutes for Chelsea on Wednesday, Ruben Loftus-Cheek impressed on debut . Loftus-Cheek, passing to a team-mate at Stamford Bridge, slotted into the Chelsea midfield with ease . He had been warming up for long enough and after all the talk ahead of the dead-rubber against Sporting Lisbon about how strong Chelsea's youth players are, one of them eventually made it on to the pitch. Despite all Mourinho's pre-match posturing – putting Loftus-Cheek alongside him to face the media in their press conference and arguing that they may as well shut their academy if no players came through – he only named one youth product in the entire squad to face Sporting. The 18-year-old received a bad tackle from Paulo Oliveira but was helped up by his team-mates . And even then, Loftus-Cheek had to make do with a place on the bench. They were 2-0 ahead by half-time. Still he did not get the chance to play after the break. He finally begun warming up just after the hour mark, with Chelsea holding a comfortable 3-1 lead, with Ramires and Loic Remy. Still his wait went on when Mourinho made his first substitution in the 71st minute and Remy came on for Mohamed Salah. Then three minutes later, Ramires was called over by the Chelsea bench and he was thrown on. The teenager was left all alone, patiently jogging up and down, stretching his already well-stretched muscles. 18 year-old Loftus-Cheek came on as a late substitute to make his senior Chelsea debut . Loftus-Cheek looks to the sky after making his first-team off the bench against Sporting Lisbon . Eventually, after 20 minutes of warming up, he was whistled over and the wait was over. Mourinho put an arm on his shoulder as he crouched down to listen to the words of wisdom and instructions. 'Very good personality, very positive. Not afraid of playing, not afraid to have the ball. He wanted to participate. 10 minutes, but he wanted to do it. Obviously low levels of resposibility. We are qualified, the result is 3-1 and the game is over, but he showed immediately the quality he has,' Mourinho said after the match. Jose Mourinho kept Loftus-Cheek warming up for 20 minutes before handing out instructions to the midfielder . 'Everyone in the stadium had the feeling we have a kid with talent. So keep going, keep working hard, and hopefully people around him don't disturb the work we are doing with him. I said to him: 'I gave you this, you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine.' He said immediately: 'No problem.'"" The 83rd minute came up on the clock and he came on for Cesc Fabregas. Quite the act to follow. 'Please welcome the Stamford Bridge: Ruben Loftus-Cheek,' came the announcement on the PA system. There was a loud applause around the stadium. The first touch was shaky, giving the ball away. But he did not look out of place, standing at 6ft 2ins tall, amongst the others. The Chelsea academy product started the match on the bench during his first call-up to the senior squad . He was a straight replacement for Fabregas, playing in the hole behind Diego Costa. A couple of minutes after coming on, he showed what he can do with two swift passes at either end of a Chelsea move from their own half to inside Sporting's box. In 11 minutes on the pitch he stamped his mark on the match and showed he has the potential to become a first-team player. By the time he burst through and rounded Sporting goalkeeper Rui Patricio in stoppage time, only to be flagged for offside, the supporters were cheering his name. In only September he was playing in Chelsea's Under 19 UEFA Youth League group stage match against Sporting at their academy in Lisbon. The match was played at the tiny Aurelio Pereira stadium with a capacity of 3,000 which was only a third full. Chelsea thumped their opponents 5-0. Loftus-Cheek tries out a trick in the warm-up at Stamford Bridge before making his debut on Wednesday . He is still included in the Under 21 squad profiles on the club's website where they describe him as 'a talented box-to-box midfielder capable of controlling games.' Mourinho said on Tuesday: 'One month ago he played in Lisbon with the Champions League new generation, so you can imagine the difference between playing against Sporting academy, with 1,000 spectators, and then to play against Sporting in the real Champions League, at Stamford Bridge with 45,000 and all the lights on you.' All the lights could be on him for many years to come.","18-year-old made first-team bow having joined the club at the age of eight .

"Support for a huge, $1.1 trillion spending bill funding every corner of government, faded Wednesday as liberal lawmakers erupted over a provision that weakens the regulation of risky financial instruments and another that allows more money to flood into political parties. At the same time, conservatives remain unhappy that the bill fails to bar President Barack Obama's immigration actions, and a key conservative grassroots organization lobbied its allies on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to vote against the legislation. The measure also took a blow when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement demanding that the changes to 2010 Dodd-Frank regulation of complex financial instruments known as derivatives and a provision sharply hiking limits on donations to political parties be taken out of the bill. Her support, and the votes of her Democratic colleagues, is crucial to passing the measure, as are the votes of Tea Party Republicans who feel their being shafted by GOP leadership in the House. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . House Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday following a House GOP caucus meeting that Republicans and Democrats had agreed on a $1.1 trillion spending bill to avoid a government shutdown and delay a politically-charged struggle over President Barack Obama's new immigration policy until the new year . A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said the provisions were part of bipartisan trade-offs and said they would remain in the bill. The 1,603-page measure was unveiled late Tuesday and its provisions will be scrutinized in advance of a House vote Thursday. The House plans to vote first on a three-day extension of the current continuing resolution the government is operating on to give the Senate and the president time to act on the broader legislation. The government will otherwise shut down tomorrow at the stroke of Midnight, less than 24 hours before Congress plans to recess until next year. The White House said on Wednesday morning that it hadn't read the entire omnibus bill, but it was generally 'pleased' with the provisions it had reviewed. Still, the spokesman for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would not commit the president to approving the legislation if it arrives on his desk. 'I'm confident there are gonna be some things in here...that we're not gonna like, and we'll have to sort of consider the whole package before we make a decision about whether or not to sign it,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. It's unclear how shaky the bipartisan coalition backing the omnibus bill is, but the alternative is to keep the government running on autopilot until Republicans seize full control of Congress next year or allow it to undergo it second shutdown in 14 months. Nonetheless, top Democrats were lining up to vote against the measure on Wednesday. 'I'm not going to support it. I've already found lots of provisions that are against the public interest,' Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen said. 'I find it surprising that some people are threatening to shut down the government in order to extract big benefits for big banks at the expense of consumers and taxpayers,' he said. Conservatives were angry, too, and Heritage Action, the grassroots arm of leading conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, came out against the measure today. 'Why in the world would we want to lock in federal spending through next September that reflects the priorities of the Democratic Senate that voters just thoroughly repudiated last month?' California Rep. Tom McClintock said. 'Why in the world would we want to so greatly weaken our position to insist on the complete defunding of the president's unconstitutional act [on immigration] in the next session of Congress?' Democrats, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, pictured above at a press conference on Capitol Hill today, and conservatives defected on voting for the spending bill today, putting a  government shutdown back in play if Congress doesn't at least pass an extension to the current continuing resolution the government is operating off of by the stroke of Midnight tomorrow . The compromise spending bill would permit virtually the entire government to operate normally through the Sept. 30, 2015, the end of the fiscal year, with the exception of the Department of Homeland Security. Funds for that one agency will run out again on Feb. 27, when Republicans are expected to try to use the expiration as leverage to force Obama to roll back a decision suspending the threat of deportation for an estimated 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally, while providing work permits and eventually making them eligible for benefit programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Boehner told fellow Republicans at a Wednesday morning party meeting that the immigration 'fight will be done at the end of February when the troops, when the cavalry comes,' a reference to the upcoming GOP takeover of the Senate. The White House said today that even then it doesn't believe that GOP leaders will follow through on their promise to conservatives to stick it to Obama by adding language to a DHS funding bill that would block Obama's actions. 'I would be surprised if Republicans take the position that they are going to withhold funding from border security, from people conducting criminal background checks, from other elements of our federal government that are critical to Homeland Security just in protest over the president taking an executive action,' Obama's spokesman told reporters today. A GOP staffer familiar with the conservative strategy told MailOnline last month, however, that border patrol and other critical  enforcement agencies in DHS would be deemed essential if it underwent a partial shutdown and would therefore remain open. That understanding has fueled conservatives lawmakers' willingness to hold funds for the department hostage until Obama relents and signs legislation barring his own executive actions on immigration. They would prefer, however, if the entire federal government were funded for only the first two months of the new year so that Congress has more leverage over the president when it comes time to renegotiate an appropriations package. Their irritation with the current package was further exacerbated when they learned that it contained  $948 million for the Unaccompanied Alien Children program - an $80 million increase from the fiscal year before. That money will go toward making sure the Health and Human Services Department has enough money in the upcoming year to feed and house illegal immigrant children who travel to the U.S. from Central America, as they are required do by law, until they are turned over to the proper authorities. Conservatives are unhappy about the increased allocation for HHS because a bill the House passed over the summer hinged additional resources on the inclusion of language tying Obama's' hands on immigration. Now, they say, the Obama administration will get the money it requested and it will have no incentive to act in ways that decrease the stream of unaccompanied minors showing up at the U.S. border with Mexico seeking amnesty. The omnibus bill directs significantly less money to HHS overall than the earlier legislation, House leadership has pointed out, and substantially fewer dollars were allotted to the effort than the the president asked for. The compromise legislation adheres to tight budget caps negotiated previously between the White House and Republicans, freezing agency budgets, on average. It also includes several provisions to fulfill Republican policy objectives, including significantly weakening new regulations that require banks to set up separate affiliates to deal in the more exotic and riskier forms of complex financial instruments called swaps. But some top Democrats, including Appropriations Committee member Nita Lowey of New York, supported the provision, and party leaders didn't appear to try too hard to knock it out. The measure is laced with trade-offs. Democrats won budget increases for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Republicans won a big cut to the Internal Revenue Service budget and a smaller cut to the Environmental Protection Agency. Democrats blocked the most ambitious attempts by Republicans to thwart Obama administration regulations on greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming, and on clean water; Republicans won a new concession exempting many agricultural projects from clean water rules and an old one boosting exports of coal mine equipment. GOP leaders distributed a lengthy roster claiming wins on spending cuts and policy and claimed significant support among the rank and file. 'I think we won on policy, the budget numbers are lower than I ever thought it would be,' Rep. Richard Hudson said. The overall spending measure touches every part of government, from a provision to ease standards on school meals that were supposed to go into effect in 2017 to funds to restore the iconic Capitol Dome. Proponents of campaign finance reforms decried a provision slipped in at the last minute that would sharply increase limits on the amount that an individual may contribute to various national political party accounts each year. Those limits would rise from $32,400 to $324,000 for donations to finance parties' national conventions, election recounts and headquarters buildings. That means individuals could give $648,000 in a two-year campaign cycle, with a married couple capped at almost $1.3 million for an election cycle. 'It is only millionaires and billionaires who can give these huge, corrupting contributions,' said campaign finance activist Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21. Another provision drawing fire would allow pensions to be cut for current retirees covered by some economically-distressed multiemployer plans, part of a package agreed to unexpectedly Tuesday after secretive talks.","Liberals erupted over provisions that weaken the regulation of financial instruments and raise the cap on donations to political parties .

"Somewhere, surely, there must be a cigar-strewn cave where misogynistic men sit and concoct evil plans to get women out of the workplace and back into the kitchen. How else to explain the schemes that, on the face of it, look terribly sympathetic and female friendly, but are actually designed to ensure no rational person ever employs a woman again? Take, for example, the plotting that resulted in a woman's right not to tell her employer if or when she was coming back from her year-long maternity leave, making it impossible for firms to plan for either absence or return. Opposing views: Catherine Ostler condemns the idea of menstrual leave as suggested by Gedis Grudzinskas . As a former boss myself — I've been the editor of two magazines, including Tatler — I can tell you it's extremely difficult when you take on a person for maternity cover who doesn't know for a year if they'll get the job permanently. Or be asked on day 364 of a woman's maternity leave if she can please come back on just two days a week. To cap all that, last week a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology called Gedis Grudzinskas, formerly of St Bartholemew's Hospital but now based in Harley Street, suggested that we poor pathetic women should receive 'menstrual leave'. He argued we should be entitled to up to three days' paid holiday — sorry, 'rest leave' — a month because of the bodily upheaval caused by period pains and menstrual tension. Grudzinskas added that on no account should it interfere with our right to career progression. Yep. An extra 36 days — more than seven working weeks — off each year, just for women. In the real world that's unlikely to sour anyone's 'career progression', isn't it? The male members of staff would never notice. That time again: Imagine the embarrassment of explaining yourself to a male - or female - boss every month . Of course, I'm being sarcastic. Demanding extra days off every month — presumably at short notice because period pains can vary in intensity from cycle to cycle — doesn't sound like a fast track to the top for any woman. Or any business that has to deal with the ensuing staffing crises, for that matter. Factor in 'syncing' — the theory that groups of females who spend a lot of time together start synchronising the timing of their menstruation — and you could have half the office absent at the same time. Hardly a recipe for productivity or boosting the motivation of the poor saps left behind to pick up the slack. Rather the perfect ingredients for chaos. Not to mention the embarrassment of explaining yourself to a male — or female — boss every month. (Of course such things shouldn't be shameful, but many still find the subject excruciating to discuss). I'm sure Grudzinskas probably means well. Being a doctor, he is likely to encounter those who suffer most from pain and mood swings, hence his drastic solution. And he's not the first person to have suggested it. Japan and Taiwan actually have menstruation leave already, though originally it had a practical purpose, as it was taken up by bus drivers and factory workers unable to easily leave their posts, not anyone who felt they'd rather spend a day in bed reading magazines and eating biscuits. In South Korea, however, the right to take days off around your period was removed from female university students because the scheme was so open to abuse. Work to be done: Hormonal changes can have a Jekyll and Hyde effect on some women's behaviour but that doesn't mean they should stay at home . Which is not to say that there aren't women who really do suffer — of course there are — or that some women don't behave extremely oddly at this time of the month. When I was a magazine editor — both times in offices dominated by women — there were some who would organise their own informal 'menstrual leave'. Rather than battle through on cups of tea and a double dose of Nurofen like the rest of us, they'd insist they had to go home 'sick'. While it felt more than a little cheeky to me, once an employee starts explaining she needs time off because of period pains, the natural reticence to engage in conversation about this topic ensures few bosses — male or female — will argue with her about it. But more interesting than straightforward bunking off were the hormonal changes that have a Jekyll and Hyde effect on some women's behaviour. I once worked with a writer who experienced such bad PMT she behaved like another person for a week a month. She would sulk if anyone dared disagree with her, interrupt every point, bang her fist on the table and say things like 'that is without doubt the worst idea I have ever heard' without any thought for the poor colleague who might have suggested it. To her credit, she was completely aware of what a nightmare she became. In fact, she even gave her alter ego a name — 'Bruce' — and she would warn everyone in the office when Bruce was coming so they could batten down the hatches in anticipation of his raging personality. Deal with it: In the workplace goodwill quickly evaporates - unfairly or not - if you have too many days off because of period pains . 'Bruce is here,' the staff would whisper in trepidation as they tiptoed round her, fearful of setting off an explosion. To be fair to 'Bruce' she never stayed in bed moping, but always came in for work, inflicting misery on the rest of us. Would I have preferred it if Bruce had been able to take menstrual leave? No, because despite all the stroppiness she still made good points and did good work. In any case, once her wild moods had a name it was all quite funny. In retrospect it's interesting that my colleague's PMT was given a male name because, to be frank, a woman experiencing PMT often behaves very much like a grumpy middle-aged man. Meanwhile, once a month other female members of the team would get uncharacteristically weepy when they were struggling to write something and there were times when normally good-natured colleagues were suddenly on a very short fuse. But a woman's time of the month was far from being the most distracting and demanding behaviour I had to deal with. Over the years I've worked with people of both sexes who were off kilter because of drugs or alcohol and that can be far more destructive than PMT. One woman regularly had Mondays off. It turned out she took ecstasy all weekend and would wake up at the start of the week unable to remember anything. Then there was the man who used to arrive for work red-faced, shirt undone, and talking gibberish. Another stank of whisky at 9am. Equally, a failed romance can be just as damaging to work behaviour. I once saw someone driven mad after being dumped by the man she was hoping to marry. She drove people to distraction by stalking him on social media all day in case she got a clue as to why he'd broken everything off, and talking constantly about the grand house that would no longer be hers. Unemployable: Taking time off every month would hinder a woman's career progression . In the workplace goodwill quickly evaporates — unfairly or not — if you have too many days off or don't knuckle down, no matter your excuse. No one wants to sit next to someone with raging flu. Equally, no one respects anyone with the slightest hint about them of not pulling their weight. And when it comes to women's issues, it's not just PMT either. I knew a woman who managed an office while five — five! — women were having IVF treatment, which can drive some near-crazy, particularly if it doesn't work. Added to the disturbed moods caused by injecting yourself with hormones to ovulate, you have the extreme personal stress. And if you're going to go down the route of giving women time off for gynaecological issues, why stop at menstrual leave? Periods tend to be heavier, more painful, and last longer than usual in the autumn and winter . What about the menopause? Women often complain of unbearable hot flushes, crippling insomnia, mood swings and the rest. How about officially sanctioned days off for that, too? The fact is none of these things are an illness. I don't want women medicalised for three days every month and have our daughters believe they're only capable of malingering on the sofa during this time — precisely what all those annoying-but- have-a-point, take-on-the-world adverts for sanitary protection campaign against. Dr Grudzinskas admits that he is an eccentric. Perhaps that explains why he went on to suggest companies should pay for the termination of accidental pregnancies, like some sick Margaret Atwood novel where women must be barren at the behest of some nameless Firm. But those who would welcome his proposition for menstrual leave might consider the wider implications of suggesting that women are biologically incapable of working a full month, even out of the best of intentions. Surely this move is nothing but yet another way to render the 'weaker' sex unemployable.","Gedis Grudzinskas suggested women should receive 'menstrual leave'

"Jenson Button will be handed a remarkable reprieve when he is named on Thursday as a McLaren race driver for 2015. The 34-year-old Briton had given up all hope of taking his Formula One career into a 16th season as McLaren bosses wanted to plump for their Danish rookie Kevin Magnussen to partner the incoming Fernando Alonso. But that decision was never rubber-stamped, and weeks of uncertainty began. 2009 world champion Jenson Button has been retained by McLaren for the 2015 season . Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will re-join McLaren from Ferrari having left in 2007 . Kevin Magnussen faces uncertain future after missing out on McLaren seat in 2015 . Now Sportsmail has learned from an impeccably-placed source within McLaren that Button has been offered a new contract and will be unveiled, along with Alonso, at McLaren’s base in Woking. Button’s good news means that McLaren’s new partnership with Honda will start in dazzling style: with two drivers who have three world titles between them. Whether Magnussen will be kept on, in one form or another, remains to be seen. It seems likely that the move to keep Button came about after McLaren chairman Ron Dennis took into account the wishes of his shareholders and Honda, who established a good relationship with Button when he drove for them from 2003 to 2008. Button took to Twitter to reveal his happiness at staying on with McLaren for the 2015 season . The 34-year-old also welcomed new team-mate Fernando Alonso to McLaren following his switch from Ferrari . In a succession of tweets Button showed his support for Magnussen - stating he'll be back racing in the sport . For a long time Dennis had shown no inclination to re-sign Button. Indeed, both he and racing director Eric Boullier privately indicated that they favoured the blend of experience and youth offered by Magnussen, 22, and Alonso, 33. That Button outscored Magnussen 126 points to 55 last season seemed not to be enough. Button grew so frustrated with his treatment that before the penultimate race in Brazil he wondered aloud if he would even accept a new contract if one was forthcoming. ‘That’s a good question,’ he said. He also drew up plans to take part in the World Endurance Championship. But the pendulum gradually swung his way as a series of deadlines were missed. First, McLaren said their driver line-up would be announced before the season-closing Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. They then deferred it until no earlier than December 1. Button won the world title with Brawn back in 2009 and has been at McLaren since 2010 . Dennis’s slow deliberations frustrated a number of his staff, as well as fans who complained on the internet. Even when he discussed the team’s driver line-up at a board meeting last week, there was still no decision. A power struggle at the top between Dennis and his fellow shareholder Mansour Ojjeh, the Saudi Arabian entrepreneur, may have been one reason for the impasse. Button said all along that he did not want to stay for the sake of money. He is already ranked Britain’s second-richest sportsman behind Lewis Hamilton in the Sunday Times Rich List with £63m. Sportsmail has been told he settled for a heavily reduced salary to accommodate the £25m a year that Alonso will be paid on his return from Ferrari to the team where he spent a turbulent season in 2007 .","McLaren to announce their 2015 line-up in press conference on Thursday .

"Gareth Southgate has urged England’s Under-21s to accept their toughest challenge and show they can win on the biggest stage. England were pitted against Italy, Portugal and Sweden in Group B when the draw was made for next summer’s European Championships in the Czech Republic; the other group comprises the hosts, Germany, Denmark and Serbia. Southgate’s confidence, though, has not been dented, particularly as they qualified for the finals in style with a 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia last month. He will get an early idea how England may fare when they play Portugal next Thursday in a friendly at Burnley. Gareth Southgate (right) was in attendance for the UEFA Under-21 European Championships draw in Prague . Saido Berahino scores from the penalty spot during the England U21s 2-1 victory over Croatia in October . The main objective, however, is next June and given that England were knocked out of the group stages in the last two tournaments in Israel (2013) and Denmark (2011) without winning a game, Southgate appreciates England have to change perceptions. ‘It is a cracking group, a group to get excited about,’ Southgate told Sportsmail. ‘They are really good fixtures, they are fixtures that will capture the imagination. Yes, they are difficult teams but they are bound to be if you get to this stage. It is on to the next challenge. ‘We are effectively in the quarter-finals of this competition and I have never heard of anyone having any easy time at this stage. That is the mentality that we have got to have. If we want to win the tournament, which we do, then we cannot complain about who we have got to play. West Brom forward Berahino has earned his first call-up to the senior squad after his fine form this season . ‘You have to deal with whatever is thrown in front of you. If we want to be a winning team, that is how it must be. We’ve been very good at qualifying for tournaments but we have got to take that to the next stage. Now we have got to prove that we can be very good at tournaments.’ A delegation, headed by Southgate, will begin their search today for a suitable base next summer and with the group only having a restricted amount of time between now and next June, the head coach appreciates that every second counts. ‘What is important now is that we do not waste a single minute when we get together,’ said Southgate, whose squad will also face France in Brest this month. ‘Preparation, for the group as a whole, is limited and we have got to take advantage of the time we have together. ‘I am not quite sure how the (Portugal) team we play next week will compare to the one we play next summer. They have had a few players moved up to the senior team, as have we. But it will still be interesting. It will be a good test for us.’ Czech Republic legend Pavel Nedved (left) chats to UEFA President Michel Platini during Thursday's draw .","Gareth Southgate's England’s Under-21s will face Italy, Portugal and Sweden in Group B .

"A mother has told of her heartbreaking victory in a landmark court case which allowed her to end the life of her severely disabled daughter. Twelve-year-old Nancy Fitzmaurice was born blind and unable to walk, talk, eat or drink unaided. She suffered from meningitis, septicaemia and fluid on the brain. Before the right-to-die ruling – a first for a child without a terminal illness and not on life support – her mother Charlotte wrote in a statement to the court: ‘My daughter is no longer my daughter. Scroll down for video . Nancy Fitzmaurice's mother, Charlotte (right) , has spoken of the heartbreak of letting her disabled daughter die . Ms Fitzmaurice, 36, gave up her job as an NHS nurse so she could stay by her severely disabled daughter's side . Nancy was born blind and suffering from fluid on the brain, meningitis and septicaemia, which left her unable to talk, walk, eat or drink . ‘She is now merely just a shell. The light from her eyes is now gone and is replaced with fear and a longing to be at peace.’ Miss Fitzmaurice, 36, added: ‘Today I am appealing to you for Nancy as I truly believe she has endured enough. For me to say that breaks my heart. But I have to say it.’ The judge granted the request in August and Nancy died 14 days later. Her case saw London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital – which had provided her with round-the-clock care – fight on behalf of the girl’s parents to give them the right to end her life. The ruling sets a precedent as it is the first time a child breathing on their own and not suffering from a terminal illness has been allowed to die. Miss Fitzmaurice, who had given up work as a nurse to be her daughter’s carer, said: ‘Nancy was screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day and it broke my heart to see her like that. ‘Not being able to help her or ease her suffering was too much to bear. ‘She wasn’t my angelic child any more, she was just a shell. I wanted to have beautiful memories of Nancy, not soul-crushing ones.' Doctors only discovered that Ms Fitzmaurice was carrying Group B Streptococcus two days before Nancy was born. If they had known earlier, they could have easily treated the baby while she was in her mother's womb . After a routine operation went wrong, leaving her daughter in agonising pain, Ms Fitzmaurice and Nancy's father, David Wise (right), took the decision to let her die . Nancy's quality of life was so poor that she depended on round-the-clock hospital care and was fed and watered through a tube . She added: ‘Sitting at her bedside and holding her hand, it killed me that there was nothing I could do to help her. All of the nurses were in tears as they witnessed her screaming and doubling over in pain. ‘All I wanted was for my daughter to die with dignity with me by her side, holding her hand.’ Two days before giving birth in July 2002, Miss Fitzmaurice, from Ilford, Essex, was told her daughter was likely to be severely ill as she carried Group B Streptococcus. If caught early the condition is easily treatable in the womb with antibiotics, but the mother-to-be was told that as it had gone untreated, it would harm her unborn child. At ten days old, Nancy had to have a shunt – a small tube with a valve – fitted to drain fluid in her brain. A High Court judge ruled that Nancy, pictured being held by her grandmother Elaine Hewitt, should have her fluids withdrawn . The operation for kidney stones had left Nancy 'screaming and writhing in agony for 24 hours a day', Ms Fitzmaurice said . Her illness was so severe doctors warned she would die before her fourth birthday. Despite that outlook, Nancy survived far beyond the age of four. But a routine operation in May 2012 to remove kidney stones left her with an infection and specialists told her parents there was nothing more they could do. She became immune to the strong pain relief cocktail of morphine and ketamine, leaving her in agony. It was then that her mother and father David Wise met the ethics board at Great Ormond Street Hospital to beg them to put an end to Nancy’s suffering. While doctors agreed to stop feeding her, they were not able to withdraw all fluids and said it could take months for her to die. After her fluids were withdrawn by doctors, it took two weeks for 12-year-old Nancy to die . Ms Fitzmaurice misses her daughter every day, but says she knows it was 'the right thing to do' Heartbroken: Ms Fitzmaurice said the 'absolutely horrifying' day her daughter died was the hardest of her life . The hospital agreed to take Nancy’s case to the High Court, to argue that she deserved the right to a quicker, less painful death. On August 7 this year, Mrs Justice Eleanor King read Miss Fitzmaurice’s plea and declared it was in the mother and daughter’s best interests to withdraw fluids. ‘The love, devotion and competence of her mother are apparent,’ the judge said. ‘In her own closed world [Nancy] has had some quality of life. ‘Sadly that is not the case now. Please can you tell Nancy’s mother that I have great admiration for her, and please express my deep condolences to her.’ Nancy died two weeks later, on August 21, with her family at her side. Her mother said: ‘The last day was the hardest of my life. It was absolutely horrifying. ‘I miss my beautiful girl every day and although I know it was the right thing to do, I will never forgive myself. ‘It shouldn’t have to be a mother’s decision to end their child’s life.’ Mr Wise, a 47-year-old businessman, added: ‘It was heartbreaking to see my daughter like that. Nancy never spoke so we never knew how she felt. She couldn’t tell us what she was going through and it was the hardest decision we’ve ever made.’","Nancy Fitzmaurice was born blind, with meningitis and other complications .

"Earlier this year, during the Australian tour, a wisp of doubt crept in. Then there was a growing suspicion when they trotted through King’s Cross station in baseball caps, before the awful truth emerged on their whistle-stop tour to New York this week. Which is that however you look at it, be you republican or royalist, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have become a terrible, terrible disappointment to us all. I’m sorry, but they have. Nearly four years after they married at Westminster Abbey, in a fairytale ceremony that was gasping in its gorgeousness, the gilt is off the gingerbread, the bloom has gone from the rose. Scroll down for video . Waving to the crowd: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured at a basketball game on Monday . But Jan Moir says that the Cambridges have become 'a terrible, terrible disappointment to us all' In the beginning, after their fairytale wedding, hopes were high for the launch of the new Team Cambridge . From the tips of her favourite nude shoes to the top of his Homer Simpson forehead, Kate and Wills have proved themselves to be as dull, dull, dull as Windsor moat water. They are High Street, not high class. There isn’t an occasion they can’t live down to and they almost always fail to exhibit the sense of grandeur and dignity that the monarchy demands. Quite frankly, they are a bit of a bore. In the beginning, hopes were high for the launch of the new Team Cambridge; two potentially alluring and exciting members of a fascinating family, one whose history is stitched through the tapestry of British life like a shimmering, golden thread. They would be our new symbols of modern Britain, they would single-handedly invigorate the House of Windsor, they would go out in the world as shining representatives of our country. We would be proud of them, as they were proud of us. But that is not what has happened. But even at black-tie galas, including at the St Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner in New York this week, Kate and William somehow manage to look as if they are attending a golf club dinner in the Home Counties . While in the Big Apple, the pair turned up at their hotel like any old pair of out-of-towners, to be met by the schmoozing manager and a barrage of paparazzi . Instead, what we got are a couple of dreary suburbanites, a Mr and Mrs Bland who trundle around the world in mumsy dresses and dad-trousers, saying not very much at all. So terrified are the low-impact Cambridges of causing even a hint of controversy, they make a point of never uttering anything within ten miles of that town called Mildly Interesting. This fear of disputation, matched with a craving for the public approval that ensures their survival, has turned them into a pair of weird, international geisha-people. Mouthing only platitudes, they smile and nod at everything as they cut ribbons and accept posies like royal robots. They have none of the beguilement that strange, little Queen Victoria aroused, none of the deep respect the current Queen commands, not a drop of the molten glamour that Diana, Princess of Wales oozed. Even at black-tie galas in palaces or embassies, Kate and William somehow manage to look as if they are attending a golf club dinner in the Home Counties, just after they have finished the weekend shop at Waitrose. In speeches and in the spotlight, they come across as a couple from Cheam who just cannot believe their luck. Kate and Wills, pictured sharing popcorn while watching the Brooklyn Nets against the Cleveland Cavaliers in New York, make a point of never uttering anything within ten miles of that town called Mildly Interesting . Instead, the couple dazzled the U.S. like a pair of damp squibs submerged in a bucket of cringe . When the Cambridges met Jay Z and Beyoncé at the basketball match, it was clear to see who was the most regal and important — and it wasn’t the duke and duchess . Look at their trip to New York this week. What was that all about? From Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Empire State Building, they dazzled the U.S. like a pair of damp squibs submerged in a bucket of cringe. Kate wore 50 shades of gloom while William fussed with his blazer buttons and made appeals on behalf of the very important cause to which he is devoted; saving elephants and stopping the ivory trade. It might be very noble of him, but I do wish he would instead highlight causes that really mean something to British people, things that affect their daily lives. And it does seem rather hypocritical to try to save one species of animal, while the royals gaily blast game birds and stags at every opportunity. Meanwhile, back in Manhattan, I winced when they turned up at their hotel like any old pair of out-of-towners, to be met by the schmoozing manager and a barrage of paparazzi. They smile and nod as they cut ribbons and accept posies like royal robots. Pictured: Kate chats with members from the arts and business community before lunch at the residence of the British Consul General . The pair have been trundling around America on their tour in mumsy dresses and dad-trousers, saying not very much at all. Pictured: Kate speaking to Jenna Lyons at the Creativity is GREAT event on Tuesday . Later, they were photographed under an umbrella prominently displaying the name of the hotel; a lovely bit of global advertising right there, thank you very much. Can you imagine the Queen ever allowing herself to be duped into such a tacky situation? No, me neither. The Cambridges were introduced to pop royalty Jay Z and Beyoncé at a basketball match, where it was clear to see who was the most regal and important — and it wasn’t the duke and duchess. Other VIPs they met included film mogul Harvey Weinstein, editrix Anna Wintour and former reality show star Mary-Kate Olsen, a list that tells you everything you need to know about the trip. The main reason for going to New York in the first place was to raise money for St Andrews, the Scottish university where Kate and William met and studied. Does this privileged university really qualify as a noble cause? And what has it even got to do with Americans, especially those very rich ones who disparagingly call royal fund-raising trips like this ‘Viking raids’ The Cambridges visited many different sites around the Big Apple, including One World Trade Center . They both have excellent qualities - but there is no pizazz, no drama, no sprinkling of magic dust about them . Royalty needs a bit of mystique to keep interest piqued - it needs star power. Pictured: The pair visit the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum during their visit to New York . The Cambridges trotted around the Big Apple, marble begging bowls at the ready, in a thoroughly demeaning way. Isn’t it all rather embarrassing, particularly when one considers how rich William is? The duke roused himself to make a typically dull, three-paragraph ‘speech’ at a wildlife reception, which he ended with: ‘I’m off to shoot some hoops now, or whatever it is you Americans say.’ That’s about as funny as a tusk-poaching expedition. Not to mention patronising. It is not that they are not nice people; they clearly are. Indeed, they have many excellent qualities. He is built of solid Windsor timber, a prince we can rely on always to do the right thing. She makes an absolutely tremendous duchess, in every way. She is polite and charming, and always looks thrilled to be meeting whoever it is she is meeting. That is a very big plus. However, the problem is that there is no pizazz, no drama, no sprinkling of magic dust about them. The only exciting, spontaneous thing that happened this year was when Prince George threw away his stuffed bilby toy at Sydney Zoo during the Australian tour. There is increasingly a very fine and indeterminable line between royalty and celebrity - and the Cambridges, pictured here in Australia earlier this year, may have crossed it . There were those moments when Kate insisted on wearing the kind of ill-advised gossamer skirts that float upwards when a cricket coughs, but they are becoming rarer .

She and William even allowed themselves to be mocked and joked about by a bunch of third-rate comics on the Royal Variety show, which was screened this week. The pair even allowed themselves to be mocked and joked by a bunch of third-rate comics on the Royal Variety show (pictured) In a break from the usual protocol, the Royal Box at the London Palladium was bathed in lights, and cameras captured their reactions throughout the evening. Host Michael McIntyre even introduced them, as if they were just another act appearing between the ‘utterly sensational Bette Midler’ and the legendary Shirley Bassey. ‘Making their debut tonight, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, How exciting, thank you for coming,’ roared McIntyre, as the couple grinned like goons. He also congratulated them on having an addition to the family and asked: ‘Who’s the daddy?’ Comedian Jack Whitehall made much of the fact that he attended the same school as Kate. ‘I don’t know if it is appropriate, but you were my first ever crush,’ he told her, adding that his ‘posh’ mother is ‘absolutely obsessed with you’. How delightful. I do hope our own dear Queen wasn’t watching. There is increasingly a very fine and indeterminable line between royalty and celebrity. And as they capered around New York and giggled at the Royal Variety show, it seemed that the Cambridges have crossed it. I blame Prince William and his insistence on an approach that is as informal as protocol will allow. He wants to get down with the kids, to be seen as just another bloke. Yet I wonder if he has not made a terrible mistake. Royalty needs a bit of mystique to keep interest piqued. It needs star power. The days of the Royal Family being able to stand apart from society, to be remote but still respected by their adoring subjects, have gone. Yet if our future King and Queen want to be a relevant force in the future, they have to realise that they can’t just be one of the boys and girls. They really will have to do better than this.","After their fairytale wedding, hopes were high for the new Team Cambridge .

"Three years since he passed away, Steve Jobs' spirit still lives on in the offices and corridors of Apple headquarters in Cupertino. The late entrepreneur's office on the fourth floor even has his name on the door and the interior is just as he left it, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. 'He stood for innovation, for the simple, not the complex. All of these things are still deep in our company,' said Cook in an interview for PBS. Scroll down for video . Steve Job's office on the fourth floor of Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California, still has his name on the door and the interior is just as he left it, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook (pictured) Cook added he was shocked when the Apple co-founder offered him the position of chief executive in 2011. He said he doesn't want to deviate from Jobs' strategy to 'only enter areas where we can control the primary technology.' 'I have wanted desperately to continue his legacy and the Apple I deeply love,' he said. Cook added 'I literally think about him every day...[he] is in my heart. His spirit will always be at the foundation of the company.' Tim Cook (left) said 'I literally think about him every day...[Steve Jobs (right)] is in my heart. His spirit will always be at the foundation of the company' Steve Jobs died in 2011, but his spirit lives on in the corridors of Apple headquarters (pictured) in Cupertino . The comments were made during an interview on 'The Charlie Rose Show' which will be aired in the US on Friday night and again on Monday on PBS. Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs worked for more than a year on the products that he believed would safeguard the company's future. He also fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style company headquarters in California. Jobs had a part-time job working for Hewlett Packard at the site when he was 13 and he ensured Apple bought the land when it became available. He also oversaw the development of the delayed iCloud project, which allowed Apple users to store their music, photos and other documents remotely and masterminding updated versions of the iPod, iPad, iPhone and MacBooks. The co-founder ensured that at least four years’ worth of products are in the pipeline, according to Apple sources. Reports also suggest Jobs wanted to design an Apple car before he died. Jobs reportedly told the Times' John Markoff, during a meeting prior to his death, that he wanted to 'take on Detroit.' During the interview, Cook also spoke about claims the firm is able to access user's content in the wake of the iCloud hacking scandal. He said reports of the NSA had backdoors into Apple servers were untrue - telling Charlie Rose 'We would never allow that to happen, they would have to cart us out in a box before we did that.' He said: 'We're not reading your email, we're not reading your iMessages.' The chief executive also took aim at Google in the interview, although refused to name them. 'If they are making money by collecting gobs of personal data, you should be worried,' he said. The first part of Cook's interview covered Apple TV. Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011 - but another launch event has passed without it making an appearance. Cook revealed that TV is an area the firm continues to have great interest in, but admitted 'if we're really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies.' 'The hardest decisions we make are all the things not to work on,' Cook told the chat show host. 'There's lots of things we have interest in, but we know we can't do everything great.' Despite knowing he was dying, Steve Jobs worked for more than a year on the products that he believed would safeguard the company's future. He also fought hard to get plans approved for a spaceship-style headquarters . Earlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year. Apple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to carry out deals with the technology giant .","Steve Jobs' untouched office still has his name on the door, Tim Cook said .

"When I saw the photo of Madonna in bondage gear and a cardigan, baring her breasts for a magazine, I felt an overwhelming urge: to do up her buttons. I’m no prude — how could I be, when I first modelled topless myself at 16? — but it made me uncomfortable. To me, these shots are less daring than they are desperate. Madonna is a gutsy, smart woman who I admire, but she doesn’t need these kind of pictures. We’ve seen her promote this look before — about 20 years ago. It’s time she moved on. At 61, I’m five years older than her and I’m certainly not saying an older woman can’t have sexy photos taken. But I feel I should let her in on a secret — it’s no longer as simple as taking your clothes off. At our age, it often has more to do with what you keep on. When Jilly Johnson saw the photo of Madonna in bondage gear and a cardigan, baring her breasts for a magazine, she felt an overwhelming urge: to do up her buttons . So Madonna, in the interests of sisterhood, here are my tips for stripping off in style . . . TAME YOUR TUM . Bra, £27.50, and knickers, £12.50, Rosie for Autograph, marksandspencer.com . The first rule about stripping off over 50 is to keep movement to a minimum. Mature flesh doesn’t travel well: if you turn round too fast your bottom arrives a few seconds after the rest of you — the antithesis of sexiness. Fortunately, well-chosen lingerie that is sturdy, yet sexy, can work age-defying miracles, hold in wobbly bits and counteract the effects of gravity. This bra, for instance, boosts my bust, but doesn’t show too much flesh, so it solves the problem of crepey cleavage. The wide strap at the back gives good support and flattens back fat. The pants have a tummy-slimming panel at the front and come up high enough to hide some of my jelly belly, which is the bit of myself I feel least confident about. DON'T PINE FOR THE PAST . Mimi Holliday body, £71, Fenwick: 020 7629 9161 . Madonna has always been the Queen of Reinvention, but now she seems to be stuck in the past. The trouble with harking back to your heyday is that it simply invites unflattering comparisons between your appearance now and what you looked like before. You need to move on and create a new image for yourself. I experienced this first-hand, modelling for Janet Reger in the Seventies and then again aged 58. The first time round, it didn’t occur to me to be self-conscious, even though the underwear left little to the imagination and I was in the window of their Bond Street store. Three decades later, I needed all the structure and cover I could get, yet still felt insecure about the results. In this shot, I’m wearing a lacy body but, instead of revealing what’s underneath, it’s just suggested by the nude material. Even so, I can’t say I like this photograph. I am at least a stone heavier than in my heyday, and it just reminds me of what I’ve lost. However, it’s important that I try to remind myself of everything I’ve gained in life. That was then and this is now — live in the present. 'TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY . I like this pose a lot. It looks daring — but, actually, you don’t see a thing. And, most importantly, it puts a smile on your face. If you’re posing for a slightly risqué shot, it’s much better to have fun with it than to look as if you’re taking yourself too seriously. If you can laugh at yourself when you’re in this slightly vulnerable situation, it will come across as innocent fun, not sleazy or attention-grabbing. Much better to position yourself as one of the Calendar Girls, your modesty hidden by a strategically-placed plate of buns (or Christmas wreath in my case), than as underdressed mutton hoping to pass as spring lamb. Yes, people will laugh — but with you, rather than at you. A couple of years ago, rather stuck for a Christmas present for my husband, I simply wrapped myself from head to foot in yards of satin ribbon. However, unable to hold the pose, I fell flat on my gift-wrapped derriere. After he stopped laughing, he said it was the best present he’d ever had.","At 61, Jilly Johnson is five years older than Madonna .

"John Terry had some words of comfort for disgruntled Chelsea fans after Jose Mourinho slammed the Stamford Bridge atmosphere. Blues fan Joe Davies sent a lengthy message to the captain’s Instagram account expressing his disappointment at the manager, highlighting a number of his problems with the club’s attitude towards supporters. Terry replied by requesting 18-year-old Davies’ phone number to give his side of the story. Davies said the skipper then rang him on Monday morning. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jose Mourinho criticise the Chelsea fans after QPR win . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho said Stamford Bridge was so quiet it was like playing at an empty stadium . Fans have hit back at the Chelsea boss, saying he had crossed the line and his comments were out of order . 'I was so shocked and excited when he replied to me,' Davies told Sportsmail. 'I couldn’t believe I would be talking to my hero, I never thought in a million years he would actually ring. 'He told me that fans shouldn't take any of Mourinho's comments to heart. Jose only said it to get a reaction, he does the same to the players all the time. Terry called Mourinho the ""main man"". 'I can't believe how much of a legend Terry is to call me.' Mourinho has risked tarnishing his hero status by criticising the lack of vocal backing during the win against QPR on Saturday, with some of the club’s most loyal fans claiming he has overstepped the mark. Mourinho said Stamford Bridge was like ‘an empty stadium,’ a comment that hit a nerve with those who fear they are being priced out of games and discouraged from properly getting behind the team by the club’s aggressive no-standing policy. ‘Jose shouldn’t have done that, he is out of order,’ said David Johnstone, spokesman for the fanzine cfcuk. ‘I love him to bits but he has made us look like mugs. We’ve already met twice with the club to talk about finding ways to improve the atmosphere.’ Chelsea beat QPR in their last home game, but Mourinho said he didn't know the crowd was there . Chelsea captain John Terry (right) has personally stepped in to try and help the situation . Last season, Johnstone was among those who organised a collection to pay Mourinho’s £8,000 FA fine for stepping onto the pitch at Aston Villa, but they have been offended by this episode. Another point of contention concerns warning letters received by some fans, who have threatened to withdraw season tickets because they have been identified as persistent standers during games by stewards and security officials using CCTV. Terry spoke with 18-year-old fan Davies, who made contact via social media to tell the Chelsea captain Mourinho had been ‘bang out of order’ and urge him to back the supporters. Davies said Terry promised to help when he called him. ‘I understand Jose’s point,’ added Johnstone. ‘Chelsea are top of the league and fans should sing for 100 minutes, let alone 90. But the culture in English football has changed and some fans who come into the ground now are more interested in taking selfies than getting behind the team. ‘If we were winning four or five-nil he wouldn’t have said anything, but when he sees us struggling against a team second from bottom, he lets himself down. I know what he can be like.’ It was a full house at Stamford Bridge for the visit of west London rivals QPR .","Jose Mourinho criticised the atmosphere at Chelsea's home games .

"Serious Champions League business begins for Chelsea in February after Jose Mourinho's men completed their unbeaten Group G campaign with a 3-1 win over Sporting Lisbon. Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rated the players' performances at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Petr Cech 6 . Not much he could do about it about Sporting's opener, buried in the bottom left corner, but pulled off a smart save to keep out Islam Slimani's back-post header with Chelsea 3-1 up. Cesar Azpilicueta 6 . Becoming Chelsea's ever-present, if he's not on the left-hand side in the league then he is deputising for Branislav Ivanovic on the right. Solid performance. Kurt Zouma 6 .

Egyptian forward Mohamed Salah was involved in much of Chelsea's attacking play . Nemanja Matic 6.5 . Almost scored a peach, side-footing a first-time effort narrowly over the top left corner from the edge of the box. Andre Schurrle 7.5 . Scored a wonderful effort, finishing off a move which started on Chelsea's left hand side by taking a touch before burying the ball into the bottom left corner from the edge of the box. Bright throughout. Cesc Fabregas 7 . Scored the penalty to put Chelsea in front and sent in a great ball in from a free kick to set up Mikel for a tap-in. Playing the No 10 role behind Diego Costa he was not in his usual deeper central midfield role, but played just as well. Cesar Azpilicueta (left) is Chelsea's Mr Dependable and turned in another assured display . Mohamed Salah 6.5 . Energetic on the left-hand side of the three attacking midfielders and much of Chelsea's forward play came down that side. Diego Costa 6 .

"Wembley will host NFL games on back-to-back Sundays as well as being the venue for an inter-divisional clash next year after 2015's three regular-season fixtures were announced. The Miami Dolphins, Jacksonville Jaguars and Detroit Lions are all returning to these shores for a second straight campaign while the New York Jets, Buffalo Bills and Kansas City Chiefs will each play in London for the first time. Miami, who broke new ground in 2007 when hosting the New York Giants in the maiden International Series fixture, are sacrificing a home divisional showdown with their long-time rivals the Jets on October 4 in what will be the Dolphins' third trip to the capital following September's 38-14 win over the Oakland Raiders.

October 25, 2015 - Buffalo Bills vs Jacksonville Jaguars . November 1, 2015 - Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs . The Jaguars have agreed to a slate of games at Wembley from 2013 to 2016 and on October 25 next year their opponents will be the Bills, who staged annual matches in Canada between 2008 and 2013. Just seven days on from that contest Kansas City make their first voyage to Britain as the home team against a Detroit Lions side which came from behind to beat the Atlanta Falcons 22-21 in a thrilling Wembley clash last month. 'We are very appreciative of the outstanding support from our fans in the UK, not only for the games at Wembley, but for all of the related NFL events we have hosted throughout the city,' NFL executive vice president of international Mark Waller said in a statement. 'We believe we have a great 2015 schedule that will continue to attract new fans to our sport and strengthen the bonds with our existing fans. 'To provide UK fans the opportunity to see games on consecutive weekends, to see new teams, and to attend a division game, which feature some of the most passionate rivalries in our sport, are signs of the growth and depth of our UK fan base.' Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo prepares to throw a ball during a practice session in London . The Detroit Lions are also making a return to London when they take on the Kansas City Chiefs in November . All three contests held at Wembley this year sold out several months in advance and that run of fixtures will end on Sunday with Jacksonville versus the Dallas Cowboys. Gridiron's increasing popularity on this side of the Atlantic has led to suggestions that there could be as many as five games in 2015, a possibility which was quickly quashed, while talk of a future British-based franchise continues to linger. The NFL have typically struggled to find teams willing to forfeit home fixtures in order to be a Wembley host but Miami's decision to take a potentially pivotal clash with the Jets across the pond represents another significant step forward.","The Miami Dolpins will play at Wembley for a third time in October 2015 .

"Mohamed Amin has been charged with four counts of preparing to enter a foreign state to engage in hostile activities . A New Zealand man accused of preparing to fight in Syria's civil war told authorities he was travelling to meet his fiancee, whose name he didn't know. Mohamed Amin, 24, obtained a new passport and also got a phone in the 'unbeliever' name of Chris Wright as part of attempting to join the effort to remove president Bashar al-Assad, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told on Thursday. Amin booked a flight to Turkey and made plans to travel from there to Syria in September 2013, prosecutor Mark Gibson told the contested committal hearing. But Amin was unable to leave Australia after authorities cancelled his passport. In a text message Amin sent to someone after he was intercepted by federal police at Brisbane Airport, he wrote: 'She's not happy. She reckons I'm going to end up blowing myself up.' Amin, who is being detained at Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre, is charged with four counts of preparing to enter a foreign state to engage in hostile activities. Police monitored calls between Amin and Sydney man Hamdi Alqudsi, who allegedly sent Australians to Syria to fight in the civil war. He is charged but yet to face committal hearing. Alqudsi told Amin there was a big operation coming up involving '1500 brothers', Mr Gibson said. Police allege the 24-year-old, who appeared at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday, was on his way to Syria via Turkey . Alqudsi also told Amin of the urgent need to get to the front line and spoke of obtaining martyrdom, Mr Gibson said. Amin said he and other 'doctors' were 'definitely' mentally ready for 'surgery', which prosecutors allege is code for individuals preparing to go to Syria. Alqudsi also speaks of the 'boys' who've gone to fight in the battlefield. 'They will never come back until victory or martyrdom,' he said. During the monitored conversations, Alqudsi tells Amin the most important thing is secrecy and no one was allowed to know anything. Amin's passport has been cancelled and he is being detained at Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre (pictured) until his next hearing on December 18 . On September 13, 2013, Amin tells Alqudsi everything is ready before he flew to Sydney, then Brisbane where he was bound for Turkey via Singapore. But he was refused processing at customs in Brisbane as his New Zealand passport was cancelled. He told the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service he recently got engaged to a girl in Denmark and was flying overseas to meet her, via Turkey, but he was unsure of her name. Amin, a courier company worker formerly of Villawood, was living in Australia on a temporary visa. The hearing resumes on December 18.

"Probe: Fraud investigator Simon Sutton, pictured, is said to have been hired by Michelle Young to pursue he ex-husband Scot for money . Michelle Young hired a controversial private detective to pursue her former husband for money just weeks before he died, it emerged last night. The divorcee employed fraud investigator Simon Sutton, even though her former husband Scot - who plunged to his death from a London flat on Monday - had claimed he was being hounded to the point of madness. During Britain’s most high-profile divorce case it was alleged that Mrs Young, now 49, had used eight private detectives to try to prove her husband, 52, had hidden his immense fortune from her. Mr Young said at the time that being followed persistently made him ‘paranoid’ and eventually led to him being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Yesterday, it emerged Mrs Young employed Nevyan Intelligence Services in recent weeks to renew attempts to track down funds she believed her former husband had hidden from her. The company is run by Mr Sutton, 43, an Oxford graduate who claims to have more than 20 years’ experience in fraud and corruption investigations across Europe, Asia, Western Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean. Mr Sutton, who lives with his wife and children in a £250,000 home in Hungerford, Berkshire, has had a series of failed companies and Nevyan is rated as ‘high risk’, having faced two county court judgements over debts amounting to £4,665. Its official ‘registered office’ is an empty shop in a Berkshire village, which yesterday had a ‘To Let’ sign in the window. Scroll down for video . Pursued: It was claimed horror plunge tycoon Scot Young (pictured left outside the High Court) was followed by at least eight private detectives hired by his ex-wife Michelle (right) as she tried to track down his fortune . It emerged Mrs Young (above) employed Nevyan Intelligence Services in recent weeks to renew her attempts . Mrs Young will have had to have paid in advance for Mr Sutton’s firm’s services, according to the policy laid out on the company’s website. An online review of Mr Sutton’s service from August 2012 states: ‘He takes hugely inflated fees 100 per cent in advance then delivers nothing. He is supposed to be a fraud investigator but uses that as a cover to rip customers off.’ Mr Sutton’s LinkedIn profile claims he has ‘15 years’ experience in global fraud investigations, including corporate fraud, money laundering embezzlement, insurance fraud, corruption, missing persons, asset investigation, due diligence, kidnap and financial crime investigation’. Last night, he told the Mail: ‘I am not in a position to talk about the case, unfortunately. I am sorry, I can’t discuss it.’ Scene: Mr Young died in Marylebone, central London, on Monday night when he was impaled on railings . Notorious: Scot Young, who fell to his death onto railings on Monday, was at the centre of one of Britain's best-known divorce battles with ex-wife Michelle. The pair are pictured together on the wedding day in 1995 . Mrs Young declined to comment on Mr Sutton’s involvement in the case. It has since emerged that one detective used by Mrs Young – former MI6 spy Mark Hill-Wood – has been investigated by police for defrauding her after she had paid £14,000 to his private detective agency, Full-Proof Intelligence.

"It didn’t take long for Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett to address his team’s biggest question mark heading into Sunday’s showdown at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Will Tony Romo play? Garrett didn’t answer that question specifically, but as a Magic 8-Ball might suggest: the signs point to yes. ‘We anticipate Tony being able to practice today. Hopefully he’ll be able to have a full practice,’ Garrett said on Thursday at Allianz Park. Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo winds up a pass during training at Allianz Park in London . Romo (left) has a chat with fellow Cowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden during the session in north London . ‘We’ll see. Hopefully he’s able to do what we want him to do during a Thursday practice and as the week goes on he’ll feel good with the work he’s gotten and be able to play in the ball game.’ The 34-year-old missed last week’s game against the Arizona Cardinals because of a back injury he sustained in Week 8 against the Washington Redskins. Backup Brandon Weeden was abysmal filling in against the Cardinals in Week 9 with two interceptions and only 18 completions for 183 yards. Garrett and the rest of the Cowboys are eager to see how Romo’s back holds up on Thursday. Dallas Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett is hoping Romo will fit for Sunday's game at Wembley . ‘You want to have constant communication with all of your players, especially players who are dealing with injuries,’ said the 48-year-old coach. ‘Not to the point where it’s distracting, but you want honest feedback from guys who are coming back from injury so you can handle them the right way.’ ‘We would never put a player in harm’s way. Obviously it’s a very physical sport we play and these guys are always putting themselves on the line, but the medical staff will clear the player regardless of who the player is. 'We’ll make the right decision as a coaching staff on if that player is ready to play. He has to be functional and able to protect himself. We’d never put anybody in a bad situation.’ The Cowboys have spent the week training at the home of Saracens rugby club . The Cowboys have lost two straight games and could badly use Romo back calling plays to help them secure a win heading into their bye week. However before Romo is put to the test at Wembley, Garrett said he must first get passing marks at Allianz Park. ‘Every day is a test, every day we come out here it’s a competition, it’s a test,’ Garrett, a former quarterback himself, said. The Cowboys squad go through their paces ahead of their clash with Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley . ‘We’re finding out who’s ready, who’s getting themselves prepared. And certainly that applies to everybody on our team; that applies to the guys who are coming back from injury. We want to see Tony practice, if he’s not able to practice, we’ll put Brandon in. But hopefully he’ll get himself warmed up, ready to go and have a good day today for our team.’ Whether Romo is able to play on Sunday or not, Dallas’s game plan will remain relatively unchanged, although Garrett acknowledged that things would open up with his No. 1 quarterback back in the lineup. ‘Whoever is playing, they’re gonna have a responsibility to play the way we want to play,’ Garrett said. Romo (centre) has not featured for the Cowboys since injuring his back in week eight against the Redskins . ‘We’ll tailor things to certain guys, but for the most part the game plan will be full regardless of who the quarterback is. There’s a responsibility for everyone to do their job and play well. When you do that, regardless of who’s playing next to you, that gives you the best chance to have success.’ No matter if it’s Romo or Weeden under centre, the Dallas offensive line will have their collective hands full making sure Jacksonville’s pass rush, which has already collected 27 sacks this season, is stymied. ‘Independent of what the quarterback’s health is, the Jacksonville pass rush is really good. They have guys that can rush and there’s a mentality to rush the passer. They’re very good as individual rushers,’ Garrett, who has a 35-30 record with the Cowboys, said. ‘They do a good job getting up the field and affecting the passing game. Regardless of what the health status is of your quarterback, you have to make sure you protect against these guys. It’s the offensive line’s job to make sure the quarterback isn’t affected and to keep the pocket clean.’ If all goes to plan, the line will be keeping the pocket clean for Romo, not Weeden.","Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo hasn’t trained since injuring his back in week eight of the NFL series .

"George W. Bush fully authorized the torture of terror suspects, CIA officials have claimed, furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency's so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' took place without the knowledge of the then-U.S. President.

The CIA fight came as Bush's former Vice President Dick Cheney branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed', adding his voice to the claim that not only was Bush 'fully informed' of the programme, he authorized it. 'The report's full of cr**,' Cheney told Fox News host Bret Baier on Wednesday evening. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dismissal: The CIA fight came as Bush's former Vice President Dick Cheney branded the Senate report a 'terrible piece of work' that is 'deeply flawed' Dick Cheney said it is 'not true' that President Bush didn't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program. Furthermore, the CIA never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word, as asserted by Department of Justice lawyers at the time, he said. The retired politician, who said it was his job in the administration to oversee programs like the one used by the CIA, said the government agency's actions were 'justified' and he 'do it again in a minute' in order to save American lives. According to an anonymous CIA official, Bush was fully informed of the intelligence agency's torture programme, and had in fact authorized its use. Speaking to the Times, the spokesman also identified a number of other senior Bush administration officials he claims ordered and approved the 'enhanced interrogation' programme that led to 119 Al Qaeda suspects being tortured with techniques such as waterboarding. The official said those in the know included: Cheney, Bush's legal adviser Alberto Gonzales; National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice; Stephen Hadley, her deputy; Attorney General John Ashcroft; and several attorneys in the Justice Department. He said that neither Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld nor Secretary of State Colin Powell were officially informed of the CIA torture programme. Claims that Bush was aware of the programme were reinforced by Cheney in an interview with Fox News Wednesday evening. Accused: George Bush pictured alongside then Vice President Dick Cheney. The former U.S. President fully authorized the brutal torture of terror suspects, CIA officials said today, furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency's so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' took place without the knowledge . The former U.S. Vice President said it is 'not true' that Bush didn't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program. 'Read his book,' Cheney told Baier. 'He talks about it extensively in his memoirs. He was in fact an integral party of the program. He had to approve it before we went forward with it.' According to a CIA spokesperson, a number of high-ranking members of the Bush administration were informed of the CIA's 'enhanced interrogation' programme. These include: . George Bush - President of the United States . Dick Cheney - Vice President of the United States . Alberto Gonzales - Bush's legal advisor . Condoleezza Rice - National Security Adviser . Stephen Hadley - Deputy National Security Adviser . John Ashcroft - United States Attorney General . Several attorneys in the United States Justice Department. Cheney said Bush was focused on a number of other issues at the time, but 'I think that he knew everything he needed to know and wanted to know about the program,' including the fact that prisoners were being waterboarded. 'There no effort on our part to keep him from that' information Cheney said, contrary to the claims made in the Senate report. 'So the notion that the committee's trying to peddle that somehow the agency was operating on a rogue basis and we weren't being told or the president wasn't being told, is just a flat out lie,' he stated. What really happened, Cheney said, is 'we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the ba****** who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11, and to make sure it didn't happen again, and that's actually what they did.' The former second in command said that the CIA operatives who ran the detention and interrogation program 'deserve a lot of credit,' not the 'condemnation' they are receiving from Senate Democrats who authorized yesterday's controversial report. Cheney admitted that 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times but he said that did not constitute torture. 'What are we supposed to do? Kiss him on both cheeks and say, please, please tell us what you know?' Cheney said. 'Of course not. We did exactly what needed to be done in order to catch those who were guilty on 9/11 and to prevent a further attack, and we were successful on both parts.' The Bush era vice presidents said that the CIA only used techniques on terrorism suspects that it used on its own operatives as part of their training and that includes waterboarding. He admitted that rectal feeding, a process the CIA files revealed by the Senate say detainees were submitted to, was not one of the 12 techniques approved by the White House. But he then said: 'What are you prepared to do to get information about future attacks on the United States?' 'In terms of there being some problems in the program, there may have well have been...but I don't think the Senate report represents the truth of what actually happened,' he said. Controversy: Chained detainees are seen arriving at Camp X-Ray on Guantanamo Bay ahead of interrogation about their suspected involvement with terrorist groups including Al Qaeda or the Taliban . Cheney said he hadn't read the entire 6,000-page document that the Senate's redacted paper was based on nor had he read the full 500-page declassified summary released by the Intelligence Committee yesterday. Upon learning that one of the interrogation subjects died, Cheney said, 'I have no sympathy for them,' again reminding Baier that al Qaeda killed 3,000 Americans on 9/11. He later told the Fox News that Americans have to remember that al Qaeda was reportedly trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons after the assault on American soil and there were anthrax attacks occurring at the time. 'There was every reason to expect' that there was going to be a follow-up terrorist attack, as well, he said. The CIA 'did one hell of a job, and they deserve our gratitude,' an unapologetic Cheney said.","CIA official says former U.S. President George Bush was fully in formed of the intelligence agency's torture programme .

"If the Jacksonville Jaguars are going to be victorious against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday at Wembley, the key to victory will likely be shutting down Big D – big DeMarco Murray that is. After battling through a number of injury-plagued seasons, the 26-year-old is putting together one of the best years a running back not named Adrian Peterson has had in recent memory. With 1,133 rushing yards on only 225 carries through the first nine weeks of the season, Murray has an outside shot at breaking Eric Dickerson’s single-season rushing record of 2,105 yards. DeMarco Murray (centre), Dez Bryant (left) and Tony Romo enjoy a community event at Wembley . Murray is the midst of a stellar season, posting 1,133 rushing yards in nine games . Last Sunday in Dallas the Arizona Cardinals held Murray under 100 rushing yards for the first time this season, an accomplishment the Jaguars hope to emulate this Sunday. The Cardinals may have supplied the blueprint, but Jacksonville head coach Gus Bradley knows stopping Murray won’t be easy. ‘He’s got a unique style, a style all of his own because he has power and he can make people miss. That combination, you can see why he’s the leading rusher. Just really good patience, good poise.’ Sen'Derrick Marks, who has 21 tackles and four sacks this year, called Murray ‘tough to bring down’. ‘The majority of the time DeMarco has great vision, great feet. He can make all the cuts, he can make all the moves to get back to the outside so they work well together and they get a pretty good push,’ the defensive tackle added. ‘He’s a phenomenal back,' safety Johnathan Cyprien said. 'He’s leading the NFL right now. We definitely have a challenge. We’re gonna have to come up to the challenge and make sure that we do much better than we did last week.’ Rookie running back Jeremy Hill tormented the Jags, rushing for a career-high 154 yards and two touchdowns . Jaguars defensive tackle Sen'Derrick Marks is all-too aware of the problems Murray will pose . The Jaguars surrendered 191 yards to the Cincinnati Bengals on only 34 rushing attempts last week, a mark Cyprien is aware they will have to improve upon. ‘We definitely have to clean it up. The longer runs that we gave up and some fundamental things like when the running back would cut back and get open. We don’t want to allow any open-field or explosive runs. We could have played a better game in the last one,’ the 24-year-old said. Murray has been stellar thus far, but the Cowboys offensive line is undoubtedly one of the reasons he’s had so much success. Bradley acknowledged that if Dallas’ line isn’t the best Jacksonville has faced, it’s ‘up there’. He said: . ‘The offensive line is a real factor in this game. I think when you watch them, the athleticism they have at both tackle spots really jumps out at you. Just the whole offensive line, that combination along with his skill set is a good match for him.’ Marks concurred, saying: ‘It’s going to be tough. They’ve got a real good offensive line. They gel together well, they run the ball well.’ ‘We have to make sure that we continue to stay in our gaps and get hats on them, get people to the ball and get them to the ground. I think it’s going to be difficult for us but we should be able to handle it.’ Rookie quarterback Blake Bortles stretches as the Jags take part in a training session in England . Head coach Gus Bradley has seen his team win one game this season as the Jags head to Wembley again . According to former Jacksonville and New England Patriot running back Fred Taylor Murray is ‘gonna get his runs’ no matter what the Jaguars do. Taylor would know. The 38-year-old scored 74 touchdowns and accounted for more than 14,000 combined yards during his 13 years in the NFL. He said: . ‘He has a great offensive line, big guys. They’re going to run it, especially with Tony Romo possibly being out. The way to defend him is not let him get outside. You have to keep him contained in the interior and hit his legs. You don’t want him high too much because he gets stronger as the game goes on.’ Whether Romo plays or not, Jacksonville will have to bottle Murray up early and shut him down late if they want to emerge with a big W against Big D.","Jacksonville coach says DeMarco Murray has a 'style all of his own'

"Bringing her daughter home from her latest treatment for breast cancer, Gloria Hunniford dared to hope that she was on the road to recovery at last. With a whole summer stretching out before them in Cornwall, the TV presenter was excited as she prepared a bedroom and bought her daughter’s favourite foods. But just eight hours later, Caron Keating was dead. And nine years on from that day, the grief is still overwhelming. Heartache: Gloria Hunniford (pictured) broke down during a candid interview with Piers Morgan after opening up about the death of her daughter, TV presenter Caron Keating . Breaking down in tears as she told Piers Morgan about the moment Miss Keating arrived home for what would be the last time, the 73-year-old said: ‘It seems really odd now for me to look back and think that she was going to make it. Because she made us believe that. Even when she was being driven home, I can remember being so excited. Nervous and excited at the same time. ‘Getting the bed ready and trying to get food that might appeal to her, but thinking to myself, “She’s coming home. And she’s going to be home. She’s going to be in Cornwall, where her house was, and we’ll have her for the whole summer”.’ Miss Keating’s husband Russell Lindsay helped her to change and get into bed and after that Miss Hunniford went in to see her – for what would be the last time. Blue Peter presenter Caron (pictured) was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997. She lost her battle with the disease at her mother's home in Kent in 2004 . In the interview to be shown tonight on ITV, Morgan asked Miss Hunniford how long was it after her daughter got home, that she died? The former Songs Of Praise host replied: ‘Eight hours. You can’t believe that, can you? They got into bed and… the only person that Caron would let near her in terms of undressing, was Russell, her husband. And eventually Russ said: “You can come in.” And so I got to kiss her goodnight at that point. And sadly she lost that battle at a quarter past six that evening.’ Miss Keating died in her mother’s arms on April 13, 2004, bringing to an end her seven-year battle. Miss Keating, who followed her mother into broadcasting and hosted Blue Peter, was only 41 when she died and her sons Charlie and Gabriel were ten and seven respectively. So heartbroken was Miss Hunniford that her son Michael Keating had to remind her that she also had two sons who still needed her. Real Life Stories: Gloria Hunniford spoke about her life, career and loss on Piers Morgan's show, which will be shown on ITV tonight . Mr Keating, who also appears on the ITV show tonight, said: ‘Mum was just in the depths of despair for so long. I remember talking with her one day and she said, “I will never ever laugh or smile again.” I said to her, “You do have two other children, and we need you.”’ Much has been reported over the years about Mr Lindsay’s decision to marry weather girl Sally Meen two years after Miss Keating’s death, and the fact that Miss Hunniford didn’t attend the ceremony. However, Miss Hunniford told Morgan: ‘Russ and I agreed that it would be very difficult for both of us, after all that we had been through. We’re very close, he’s like a son to me. It wasn’t… that I refused to go to the wedding, it was never on the cards. We had our own private family wedding dinner with Russ, Sally and the children.’ Gloria admitted it was hard to see her son-in-law Russell Lindsay and weather girl Sally Meen (pictured right) marry two years after Caron's death . Meanwhile, Miss Hunniford recalled how she was put on a ‘death list’ by terrorists after making a programme about the Army. The Co. Armagh native, who worked for the BBC Northern Ireland and the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), told Morgan: ‘We used to do a programme for BFBS in Germany, Sean Rafferty and myself. We used to go to meet the Rear Party in Germany. But we were called to the Brigadier’s Home and he said, “By the way, I have to tell you both of you have been placed on a death list”. ‘And we looked at each other and said, “Do you know what, we’ve been doing this now for 11 years, so we might as well just carry on”. So we carried on.’","Gloria Hunniford wept as she recalled Caron Keating's final days to Piers Morgan .

"Sleeping badly in old age can result in brain changes associated with dementia, say scientists. A new study found those who spent less time in deep ‘slow wave’ sleep were significantly more likely to lose brain cells than those who slept the most deeply. The research also showed that lack of oxygen caused by the snoring condition sleep apnoea increased fourfold the risk of tiny areas of damage in the brain. A new study by the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute found older people who spent less time in deep sleep were significantly more likely to lose brain cells than those who sleep deeply . These abnormalities are linked with the development of conditions such as Alzheimer’s. Experts say it is not yet clear if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of dementia, or if it is the other way round and lack of rest exacerbates the disease process. The study, published in the online edition of the journal Neurology, involved 167 Japanese American men from Hawaii with an average age of 84 who had sleep tests conducted at their homes. After they died an average of six years later, post mortem examinations were conducted on their brains to look for changes such as loss of neurons and ‘micro infarcts’ - areas of dead tissue caused by oxygen starvation. These can be triggered by sleep apnoea when the airway becomes repeatedly blocked, often waking sufferers as they struggle for breath. The men who had the worst oxygen levels during sleep were four times more likely to have brain damage caused by micro infarcts. Of the 37 men who spent the least time in slow wave sleep, 17 had brain cell loss compared with seven of the 38 who spent the most time in slow wave sleep. Experts say it is not  clear if people sleep badly because they are in the early stages of dementia, or if it is the other way round  (file picture of elderly woman with Alzheimer's) The results remained the same after taking account of factors such as smoking and bodyweight, and excluding those who died early in the follow-up period. However, the study found no association between poor sleep and the brain plaques and tangles that are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. Lead scientist Dr Rebecca Gelber, from the Pacific Health Research and Education Institute in Honolulu, Hawaii, said ‘These findings suggest that low blood oxygen levels and reduced slow wave sleep may contribute to the processes that lead to cognitive decline and dementia. ‘More research is needed to determine how slow wave sleep may play a restorative role in brain function and whether preventing low blood oxygen levels may reduce the risk of dementia.’ A separate study earlier this week showed that brains of healthy people who were sleepy during the day contained higher levels of a toxic protein called beta-amyloid, which is linked to Alzheimer’s. Some of those having scans were as young as 50 and none had memory problems. Dr Laura Phipps, Science Communications Manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said of the latest study: ‘While this suggests that conditions such as sleep apnoea could cause small amounts of damage to the brain, we cannot conclude from these results that these sleep disturbances contribute to dementia risk. ‘A good night’s sleep is important for proper brain function in the short term, but we need larger and longer studies in people before we can determine whether disruptions to particular stages of the sleep cycle could impact on memory and thinking skills in later life. ‘A healthy diet, plenty of exercise and quitting smoking can help to lower dementia risk and anybody concerned about their memory should speak to their GP.’","Found those who don't get enough sleep more likely to lose brain cells .

"Humiliated: Nick Clegg makes the announcement that his plans to reform the House of Lords have been killed off - and that he will now block constituency boundary change proposals . Nick Clegg plunged the Coalition into brutal bloodletting last night after delivering a crushing blow to Tory hopes of a majority at the next election. The Deputy Prime Minister announced he was abandoning his pet plans for House of Lords reform after opposition from Conservative backbenchers. And in a tit-for-tat move branded a ‘treachery’ by senior Tories, Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems would now vote against Tory plans to redraw constituency boundaries which are expected to help the Conservatives gain 20 seats at the next election. Senior Lib Dems admitted that an angry Mr Clegg wanted to deliver a ‘punch’ to his Coalition partners. The Lib Dem leader accused the Tories of breaking the Coalition ‘contract’ after Tory MPs rebelled over the Lords. But Tories pointed out that it was the AV referendum on electoral reform – not a shake-up of the Lords – which was linked to the boundary changes in the Coalition Agreement. On Lords reform it bound them only to set up a committee to suggest changes, which they did. Mr Clegg was branded a ‘child’ and a ‘hypocrite’ by senior Tories who vowed to wreak their revenge on the Lib Dems. One senior minister privately said the Prime Minister should kick Lib Dem ministers out of the Coalition and run a minority Government if they fail to back the boundary changes. A Cabinet minister said: ‘Everyone knows we gave the Lib Dems the AV referendum for boundaries. At the earliest opportunity we must revenge Clegg’s betrayal.’ And another senior Tory said Mr Clegg ‘has effectively called time on the Coalition’ and urged Mr Cameron to ‘walk away’. He said: ‘You simply cannot have a situation where Government ministers don’t vote for Government policy. That’s very different from backbenchers, who can vote how they like.’ Battle: David Cameron looks set to drop House of Lords reforms next week but the Lib Dems look like to retaliate . The senior figure said Mr Cameron should move to a ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement where the Lib Dems would back the Government on Budget measures and votes of confidence but could vote as they wished on other matters. Many Tories fear that without boundary changes they have little prospect of winning a majority in 2015 because the current constituencies are stacked in Labour’s favour. The developments also call into question Mr Cameron’s authority over his own party. Yesterday’s move means that Lib Dem ministers will be in the extraordinary position of voting against their own Government’s policy when the boundary changes come before the Commons next year. If Mr Cameron lets that stand, it could lead to a catastrophic breakdown of Government discipline, fuelling other rebellions. And in another bizarre twist, Mr Clegg made clear that he would continue to stuff the House of Lords with new members even though his main complaint is that there are too many peers. Mr Clegg even came under fire from his own side. Peer Lord Carlile said Mr Clegg’s Lords reforms were ‘ill-thought-out’ and the Lib Dems had to accept the plans did not have enough support in the Commons. At a Westminster briefing, Mr Clegg confirmed he was dropping his House of Lords Reform Bill, after being informed by Mr Cameron that an ‘insufficient number’ of Conservative MPs was prepared to back it. David Cameron, pictured with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev at Downing Street today, is said to have told Mr Clegg that he was flogging a dead horse in trying to get the reform through . Mr Clegg said he was acting ‘reluctantly’ after the Prime Minister made clear he was unable to reverse the revolt by 91 Tory backbenchers last month which forced the Government to abandon the crucial timetable motion limiting Commons debate on the Lords Reform Bill. ‘The Conservative Party is not honouring the commitment to Lords reform and, as a result, part of our contract has now been broken,’ he said. ‘Clearly I cannot permit a situation where Conservative rebels can pick and choose the parts of the contract they like, while Liberal Democrat MPs are bound to the entire agreement. ‘Coalition works on mutual respect; it is a reciprocal arrangement, a two-way street. So I have told the Prime Minister that when, in due course, Parliament votes on boundary changes for the 2015 election I will be instructing my party to oppose them.’ The Deputy Prime Minister dressed up his announcement as principle. But a senior Lib Dem figure made clear that his real motivation was to get his own back for a series of Coalition setbacks, saying: ‘Sometimes you have to deliver a punch. We have taken enough.’ Downing Street said Mr Cameron had known for several weeks what was coming and was calm about the developments when Mr Clegg confirmed he was pulling the plug in a phone call on Monday morning. But No 10 also made clear that the Tories will push the boundary changes to a vote since that will force the Lib Dems to publicly vote against a reduction in the number of MPs which was in their election manifesto. The Government’s now-defunct proposals would have reduced the number of MPs from 650 to 600. As well as cutting the number of constituencies, those remaining would have more equal populations than at present. In Parliament now there are big differences in the number of voters between one constituency and another. This is the result of some city populations declining and rural ones growing. This social shift has not been reflected in the size of constituencies and many are badly imbalanced. For example, Newcastle upon Tyne Central has a population of 61,000 while North West Cambridgeshire has 90,000. Because Labour’s heartlands are in urban areas and the Tories’ safest seats are in the countryside, differences in voter numbers from constituency to constituency have the effect, over time, of favouring Labour. The current position is that it takes more Tory votes to win a General Election than Labour ones. It is for this reason that the Conservatives included a commitment in their 2010 manifesto to reduce the number of MPs and equalise voter numbers. The Lib Dems also wanted to cut the number of MPs. Indeed, proposals from the independent Boundary Commission would have redrawn the majority of existing constituencies. In some cases, this would have had a major impact and altered dramatically the composition of constituencies. For example, several seats would have seen less than 50 per cent of their voters transferred to the proposed new constituency. The constituencies of MPs such as Labour’s Tessa Jowell and David Blunkett as well as the Tories’ Nadine Dorries would have been affected in this way. It is not surprising, therefore, that many MPs whose constituencies were set to be radically redrawn, including a number of Conservatives, will be relieved that Nick Clegg has stopped the reform. Less pleased, though, will be David Cameron and Tory strategists who were expecting the review to improve their chances of winning the next election outright. Expert calculations say 600 constituencies with broadly more equal voter numbers would reduce the number of Labour seats by around 28, the Lib Dems’ total by 11 and the Conservatives by only about seven. Thus, the Tories would be significantly better off in relation to Labour – and more likely to win an election. Clegg’s cynical retaliation will have two effects. First, it makes it likely that the Lib Dems will lose slightly fewer seats at the next election than currently appears inevitable. Second, it makes it less easy for the Conservatives to win an outright victory. The way things now stand, it is significantly more likely that Labour’s Ed Miliband, possibly with Clegg’s support, will win the next election – be it in 2014 or 2015. Tony Travers is a government expert at the London School of Economics . What are the boundary changes? The . Coalition has pledged to cut the number of seats for MPs in the House . of Commons from 650 to 600, arguing this will  save around £12million a . year, and will be fairer. Under . the change, the vast majority of Parliamentary seats would contain the . same number of eligible voters within a margin of 5 per cent. It is . controversial because it currently takes far more votes to elect a Tory . MP in a rural seat than an urban Labour member. The . Lib Dems agreed to support the reforms in return for a referendum on . the introduction of the Alternative Vote system. This was held in 2011 . and was roundly rejected by voters. How will the parties be affected? Labour . is likely to sustain the biggest losses, but proportionately the Lib . Dems would be hit hardest. Some experts believe the reforms will hand . the Tories an extra   20 seats at the next general election and put . several senior Lib Dems at risk. What has this to do with Lords reform? Lib . Dems regard Lords reform and Boundary Commission changes as a package, . although they are not explicitly linked in the Coalition deal. The party . has threatened to vote down the boundary changes if Lords reforms are . dumped. David Laws, a Lib Dem MP, has warned of a ‘chain reaction’ which . would threaten the rest of the Coalition’s programme. What happens next? David . Cameron is pressing ahead with the changes. The blueprint will have to . be approved in a Commons vote as early as the end of 2013 to be in place . for the next General Election in 2015. What will Nick Clegg do? He may use the threat of voting down the package to try to extract policy commitments to shore up his grassroots support. What do the Tories think?Furious . backbenchers say they fulfilled their side of the bargain by agreeing . to the AV poll. They also mutter that any Lib Dem backsliding could . finish the Coalition.

"By ERIC SCHMIDT, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF GOOGLE . Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said the search giant has developed breakthrough technology that will allow illegal videos to be 'tagged' Last week 348 people were arrested in . Canada – and 386 young kids rescued – in one of the largest child sex . investigations ever seen. It defies belief that anyone would sexually . abuse children, especially teachers and doctors entrusted with their . care. But this awful case highlights the depths to which humanity can sink. And . while society will never wholly eliminate such depravity, we should do . everything in our power to protect children from harm. That's . why internet companies like Google and Microsoft have been working with . law enforcement for years to stop paedophiles sharing illegal pictures . on the web. We . actively remove child sexual abuse imagery from our services and . immediately report abuse to the authorities. This evidence is regularly . used to prosecute and convict criminals. But as David Cameron said in a speech this summer, there's always more that can be done. We've . listened, and in the last three months put more than 200 people to work . developing new, state-of-the-art technology to tackle the problem. Cleaning up search: We've fine tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results. While . no algorithm is perfect – and Google cannot prevent paedophiles adding . new images to the web – these changes have cleaned up the results for . over 100,000 queries that might be related to the sexual abuse of kids. As important, we will soon roll out these changes in more than 150 languages, so the impact will be truly global. Deterrence: . We're now showing warnings – from both Google and charities – at the . top of our search results for more than 13,000 queries. These alerts . make clear that child sexual abuse is illegal and offer advice on where . to get help. Detection and removal: There's no quick technical fix when it comes to detecting child sexual abuse imagery. This . is because computers can't reliably distinguish between innocent . pictures of kids at bathtime and genuine abuse. So we always need to . have a person review the images. Once that is done – and we know the pictures are illegal – each image is given a unique digital fingerprint. U-turn: Internet search results linked to child abuse are to be blocked across the world by Google . This . enables our computers to identify those pictures whenever they appear . on our systems. And Microsoft deserves a lot of credit for developing . and sharing its picture detection technology. But . paedophiles are increasingly filming their crimes. So our engineers at . YouTube have created a new technology to identify these videos. We're . already testing it at Google, and in the new year we hope to make it . available to other internet companies and child safety organisations. Technical expertise: . There are many organisations working to fight the sexual exploitation . of kids online – and we want to ensure they have the best technical . support. So Google . plans to second computer engineers to both the Internet Watch Foundation . (IWF) here in Britain and the US National Center for Missing and . Exploited Children (NCMEC). We also plan to fund internships for other . engineers at these organisations. This . will help the IWF and NCMEC stay one step ahead. The sexual abuse of . children is a global challenge, and success depends on everyone working . together – law enforcement, internet companies and charities. We . welcome the lead taken by the British Government, and hope that the . technologies developed (and shared) by our industry will make a real . difference in the fight against this terrible crime.","We should do .

"Dan Carter has missed out on a place in New Zealand's match-day 23 for the clash against England at Twickenham on Saturday. The superstar fly-half made his return from serious injury with a 30-minute appearance during New Zealand's 74-6 victory over the United States in Chicago last weekend. But All Blacks head coach Steve Hansen has decided to take no chances on Carter in a game of such magnitude, with Aaron Cruden wearing the No 10 shirt and Beauden Barrett providing bench cover. Dan Carter, pictured in training, has missed out on a place in New Zealand's 23-man squad to face England . Carter (2nd left) models the kit with (left to right) Kieran Read, Richie McCaw, Israel Dagg and Jerome Kaino . Cruden, full-back Israel Dagg, centre Sonny Bill Williams and No 8 Kieran Read are the only players retained on starting duty from five days ago. Hansen's team and replacements boast a combined total of more than 1,000 caps. Among those who return to the starting XV are prolific try-scoring wing Julian Savea, centre Conrad Smith, lock Sam Whitelock and skipper Richie McCaw. 'This Test match is a great opportunity to once again experience the atmosphere of Twickenham and to lay down a marker of where we are currently at in relation to our opponents, England,' Hansen said. Wing Julian Savea returns to New Zealand's XV for the clash at Twickenham on Saturday . Conrad Smith, pictured playing a pass in training, will start for New Zealand against England . 'We are extremely excited about this challenge and looking forward to it immensely.

"Alistair Darling has effectively been dumped as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK following crisis cross-party talks . Alistair Darling has effectively been dumped as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK following crisis cross-party talks. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has been drafted in to reinvigorate the Better Together campaign run by the former Chancellor amid growing concerns about his ‘lacklustre’ performance. Members of David Cameron’s inner circle are understood to have voiced concern about how Mr Darling is faring against the charismatic Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. One source claimed that following discussions over recent weeks between senior Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat figures, it was secretly agreed that while there would be no formal announcement of a change, Mr Alexander should take charge. Former prime minister Gordon Brown, who fell out so badly with Mr Darling when he ran the Treasury that the two are not thought to be on speaking terms, is now expected to take a more prominent role in the run-up to the September 18 independence referendum. One source said: ‘Darling has effectively been dumped – hence Gordon Brown re-emerges.’ A recent poll found the pro-independence ‘yes’ campaign, which once trailed by a huge margin, is now just three points behind. Mr Darling was initially seen as a safe pair of hands who was well-placed to warn Scottish voters of the economic risks of independence, given his experience at the Treasury. But one Tory source said he had the air of a ‘middlingly competent accountant’ and was not the ‘big figure’ needed to lead the Labour charge against the SNP. Another source denied Mr Darling had been dumped but confirmed he was being ‘sidelined’. In an indication of his newly prominent role, Mr Alexander used a speech in Scotland to highlight his party’s commitment to a ‘new package of powers’ for Holyrood. It is believed there has been concern about how Mr Darling is faring against First Minister Alex Salmond (left). Former prime minister Gordon Brown (right) is now expected to take a more prominent role . He said they would mean ‘more decisions taken here in Scotland, by the people of Scotland, backed up by the strength, stability and security of the United Kingdom’. He added: ‘It will give us, as Scots, the best of both worlds; not division and separation but community and collaboration.’ However, the newly prominent role of the shadow foreign secretary in the pro-Union campaign may itself alarm his critics, who point to a dubious campaigning track record. He ran Mr Brown’s disastrous 2010 election campaign and David Miliband’s unsuccessful bid to replace him as Labour leader. SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament Stuart McMillan said there was ‘growing support for “yes” and falling support for “no”’. He added: ‘It’s time for David Cameron to finally show some leadership and agree to a head-to-head debate with the First Minister.’ A Better Together spokesman said the suggestion Mr Darling was being ‘dumped’ was ‘absolute tripe with no substance or truth whatsoever.’ Another source familiar with the latest discussions confirmed the campaign was being shaken up, but insisted: ‘Reinforcing Darling is not the same as sidelining. 'Alistair is doing an excellent job and Douglas is going to be helping with campaigning and strategy in the final months.’","Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has been drafted in .

"A family which has produced only male offspring since 1913 has welcomed its first female arrival in a century . The all-boy run was finally broken when Jeremy Silverton, 43, and partner Danielle Andrews, 36, welcomed a daughter called Poppy. She is the first Silverton female since her late great aunt Jessie Silverton who was born 101 years ago when King George VI was on the throne, women had no vote and the WWI was still a year away. Scroll down for video . It's a girl! Danielle Andrews, 36, and Jeremy Silverton, 40,  are celebrating the birth of their first baby girl in a century - breaking a streak of 21 boys over four generations . Jessie’s parents, horse and cart driver Edward Silverton, and his wife Emma had five children between 1910 and 1917. Between them, Jessie, older siblings Amy and Edward, and younger brothers Vick and John, went on to have five children themselves - all of them male. Amy had two sons, Ronnie and Vick, Jessie had a boy called Peter, Vick had a baby called Roy and John had a son called David, who is Jeremy’s father. Welcome to the world: Since 1913 the Silverton clan have had nothing but male children, defying odds of 10,000 to one but the spell was finally broken when Jeremy Silverton, 43, and partner Danielle Andrews, 36, finally welcomed a daughter called Poppy. Little Poppy becomes the first Silverton female since her late great aunt Jessie Silverton . It's a man's world: (Back row left-right) Amy, Jessie's sister, Jessie Silverton, Mark Rouse, Amy's husband, Tots, Jessie's aunt, Hilda Silverton David's mother, Emma Silverton, Jessie's mother, John Silverton, David's father, and (front left - right) Jessie's son Peter Kindell, six, . Vic Rouse, David's cousin, 14, David Silverton, 11, and Monica, Tot's daughter-in-law at Lulworth Cove . The all-male generation added seven more children of their own to the family tree - again, all of them boys - leaving Jeremy with a brother, Christopher, and five male cousins. Jeremy, a farmer and agricultural lecturer of Tiverton, Devon, already has two sons, Oscar, four, and Harry, six. They brought the grand total of male births to 16 before the chain was broken by Poppy on September 9.

Danielle’s mother Jo had predicated a girl because of the way her care worker daughter was holding herself but Jeremy dismissed it as superstition. Little Princess: Her parents say Poppy is likely to be very spoiled being the only girl but Harry and Oscar, their two boys, are taking it all in their stride . But he then started to paint his blue nursery pink after doctors took an ultrasound and confirmed a daughter was on the way. Jeremy said: 'It’s always a 50/50 chance, you could flip a coin to guess but it just so happens that up until now our family has only had boys. 'However, Danielle’s mother is the superstitious type and saw signs of it being a girl. 'I just thought it was an old wives' tale but because Danielle wanted a girl so badly we decided to go get a scan to find out the gender. 'We couldn’t believe it when we got the news from the scans. As soon as we got home the previously blue nursery was repainted pink and white - there was no time wasted. 'When I first told my mother over the phone it took about five minutes for the penny to drop that she would be having a granddaughter and not another grandson. 'Poppy is likely to be very spoilt being the only girl but Harry and Oscar, our two boys, are taking it all in their stride. 'As far as children know a baby is just a baby, it’s only when she gets older and stops playing with tractors and cars that they will start to notice a difference - that is, if she stops playing with tractors and cars.'

"Scandinavian kings, queens, princes and princesses have all attended this year's Nobel Prize ceremonies - helping form a guest list that gave the annual event an injection of prestige and glamour not seen in recent years. While the royals traditionally attend the ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo, this year many opted to bring their powerful and wealthy partners in a guest list that threatened to overshadow the work of the award recipients themselves. Among the guests to attend the ceremony in Stockholm were New York banker Christopher O'Neill, who last year married Swedish Princess Madeleine, and her brother Prince Carl Philip - who brought with him his fiance Sofia Hellqvist - a former reality TV star and lad mag pin-up girl.

Seated nearby on stage during the ceremony were their parents, the reigning King and Queen of Sweden, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, as well as their eldest child Crown Princess Victoria and her partner Prince Daniel. After presenting the awards, King Carl, his family and their partners were seated at the 'honor table' for the traditional Nobel banquet. Alongside the award recipients, they were treated to a three-course meal consisting of red king crab, red deer spiced loin, and a wild dewberry sorbet. When the winners of the Nobel Prizes in literature and sciences received their prizes from King Carl  at the Stockholm Concert Hall, they did so against a backdrop of 20,000 flowers, prepared by 12 florists. Following tradition, the flowers were coloured deep red, cerise and pink, and included roses, carnations and hortensias. The floral displays at the laureates' table, where the winners mixed with Swedish Royalty, included roses, carnations and hortensias .

"Jake Ball is rugby’s equivalent of ‘the beard to be feared’ and on Saturday, when the bewhiskered Welsh lock faces Australia, his former home country, he will be hoping to do damage at the Millennium Stadium. It is not just the facial hair that allows 23-year-old Ball to share a nickname with Moeen Ali, the England cricket all-rounder. The Scarlets forward also has an impressive cricketing pedigree. At the age of 18 he was considered to be one of Australia’s brightest prospects and was offered a place at Brisbane’s Centre of Excellence. Jake Balltalks to the assembled media on Wednesday ahead of Wales' autumn opener against Australia . Born in England, Ball emigrated from Berkshire to Perth with his family in 2006. It seemed that any hopes of a rugby career had been forgone to pursue a livelihood in Test cricket. He was mentored by former Test cricketer Geoff Marsh but got cold feet when a professional contract was put on the table. ‘I was a slinger so I was quite an unusual style,’ said Ball. ‘At 17 I clocked around 82mph. I played with the Marsh boys (Mitchell and Shaun) and I do miss the bowling but I hated standing in the field. ‘I was a tail-end batsman so I spent quite a lot of time sitting around. I realised I didn’t want to go down that path in the end. I’d had enough of cricket and missed my rugby so I went back and played some club games. ‘It’s probably the aggressive side of the game (that rugby offers over cricket). I was a bit over the top when playing cricket — I didn’t like getting nicked over the slips and all of that. I tried to keep my cool. Sledge? No, I was more of a quiet angry man.’ England cricket Moeen Ali is another possessor of a famed sporting beard . Ball used to play cricket with Australian international Mitch Marsh (above) and his brother Shaun . Western Force subsequently picked him up but then released him because he did not meet the standards. A second opportunity arose with the Super 15 franchise where Ball eventually played alongside current Australia internationals including Matt Hodgson and Ben McCalman. That opened the door to a return to Europe and, in 2012, the 6ft 6in and 19st 1lb giant agreed a three-year deal with the Scarlets in Wales, where his father grew up in Pwllheli. Ball’s physicality suited the style of play in the northern hemisphere and the abrasive battle between the forwards. ‘I think I preferred it because it’s a lot more close-quarters in Europe,’ said Ball. ‘It’s more pick and go through the breakdown. I love the breakdown side of the game and I think the game suited me massively.’ Ball takes on England lock Joe Launchbury at Twickenham during this year's Six Nations . Wales coach Warren Gatland rewarded Ball’s club performances with an international call-up for the 2014 Six Nations. Ball made his international debut off the bench against Ireland and then broke into the starting XV when Luke Charteris and Bradley Davies were injured. Ball has been named alongside Alun Wyn Jones in Saturday’s line-up, having risen up the pecking order and earned the confidence of the selectors. ‘To be selected without someone going down injured is big for me,’ said Ball. ‘I got my two starts in the Six Nations when Charts and Brad went down so to get picked was a goal of mine.’ Jones and Ball will be the engine room in a physical set of Welsh forwards in Cardiff. They will be tasked with attacking Australia up front to try to force a dangerous Wallaby back-line to play on the back foot. Wales must also raise the pace to keep up with the tempo set by their visitors. Attack coach Rob Howley says GPS tracking systems show a Welsh player in an average club game covers 55 metres per minute. An Australian will cover nearly 50 per cent more ground at 75-80m a minute. Jake Ball rises to collect a high ball against France during the Six Nations . To combat that, Gatland has been turning up the heat in training to ensure his players are at their physical peak. There have been 6.30am wake-up calls and up to three sessions of cryotherapy a day. ‘It’s been a pretty brutal couple of weeks,’ said Ball. ‘We’ll gain the benefits from that in the game. I’d say it’s as tough as anything I’ve done. We’ve been up early and in the altitude chamber, which isn’t my favourite place. ‘I think running fitness has been something I’ve spent a fair bit of work on. When I first came into camp, the running side of things — some of the tests — were very different for me. I’d never really done that before so now I’m starting to get my foothold there.’ It will be fast and frantic this weekend; the days of standing around in the field will seem like a very long time ago.","Jake Ball born in England and moved to Australia in 2006 .

"It took seven years for Martin Castrogiovanni to build his cult-hero status at Welford Road but Richard Cockerill believes the Italian’s six-minute outburst has damaged his legacy and made him look like a ‘fool’. Castrogiovanni, now at Toulon, launched an expletive-laden attack at his former boss after Sunday’s 25-21 defeat by Leicester. It was in response to claims that he left the East Midlands club for a pay rise but Cockerill, who has a history of using explicit language, questioned the underlying reasons behind the tirade . ‘He’s made a little bit of a fool of himself,’ said Leicester’s director of rugby (below). ‘It was a great game of rugby, a titanic battle between two big clubs, unfortunately overshadowed by a premeditated and personal attack on me and the club. I was amazed. Martin Castrogiovanni (right) launched a verbal tirade against his old boss Richard Cockerill on Sunday . Tigers coach Cockerill is dismayed by the comments and claims they have sullied Castrogiovanni's standing . ‘He was a cult hero here and unfortunately he seems to have tarnished that. As a club, we treated him in an honourable and professional manner. I have a good reputation for looking after players. To call the club a bunch of amateurs having done what we’ve done in the last 134 years is incorrect, isn’t it?’ Having spent most of his career in England, Castrogiovanni has some close allegiances with the Premiership side. As well as being a favourite among fans, he previously owned an Italian restaurant with assistant coach Geordan Murphy and is uncle to the children of Tigers forward Logovi’i Mulipola. Former All Blacks lock Brad Thorn scored a crucial 20th minute to set Leicester on course for victory . Toulon came roaring back into the contest, however, with winger Bryan Habana scorching over in the corner . The Toulon pack put the squeeze on Leicester but the Tigers held on for a famous victory . Sunday’s outburst came the day after Castrogiovanni, 33, had lunch with academy coach Brett Deacon, but Cockerill insists all of his squad were privy to the situation surrounding Castrogiovanni’s self-funded move to France. ‘The peer group who played with Castro know the whole scenario about where he was in the pecking order with Dan Cole,’ said Cockerill. ‘I want to remember Castro as the guy marauding around the field in a Tigers shirt. I’ve known Castro for a long time. He was a far better player when he left than when he arrived. Toulon full back Delon Armitage (left) has has been accused of insulting Tigers fans . ‘The exact truth was Martin didn’t want to be rotated. He then said, “if you’re not going to play me I’ll find somewhere else”. I said, “Fine, here is the amount I would like to release you under contract, as this is one of the premier positions in the world”. Toulon were interested but wouldn’t pay that fee. In the end we ended up agreeing a release fee (£100,000) with Martin so he could go and play somewhere else. That was his choice, not mine.’ The Italian is expected to face a lengthy ban for his choice of words, with European authorities investigating the incident alongside Delon Armitage’s alleged abuse towards home supporters. Sportsmail revealed that Armitage was accused of threatening to ‘take the face off’ a Leicester fan. ‘It’s not great if it’s true,’ added Cockerill. ‘Because all that will happen is players and supporters become more segregated and it ends up like football where there is no relationship.’","Toulon were defeated 25-21 by Leicester  in Champions Cup on Sunday .

"Brussels is probing Ireland and other European countries offering tax sweeteners to companies like Apple that could help them keep billions of pounds of profits. Luxembourg and the Netherlands will also be investigated by Eurocrats to see if the rock-bottom corporation tax rates they offer to big brands like Starbucks are illegal.

Complex: Apple uses five companies located in Ireland (pictured) to carry out its tax strategy, which politicians say helps them use the country as a 'tax haven' MPs accused Starbucks of using a similar system in Holland to help them slash their UK tax bill by claiming they had little or no taxable profit in Britain.

'At the moment we are simply gathering information on tax rulings,' the Commission told the Financial Times. Apple uses five companies located in . Ireland to carry out its tax strategy, a 40-page report issued by . the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said earlier this year. The . probe, which saw Apple chief Tim Cook defending the brand before a . Senate panel in May, discovered that Apple employs a group of . affiliate companies outside America to allegedly avoid paying tax. The report said: 'Ireland has essentially functioned as a tax haven for Apple'. ‘Apple wasn't satisfied with shifting its profits to a low-tax offshore tax haven,’ Senator Carl Levin the subcommittee's chairman, said. ‘Apple sought the Holy Grail of tax avoidance. It has created offshore entities holding tens of billions of dollars, while claiming to be tax resident nowhere.’ Apple's five companies are located at the same address in Cork and they share . members of their boards of directors. While all five companies were incorporated in Ireland, only two of them also have tax residency in that country. That . means the other three aren't legally required to pay taxes in Ireland . because they aren't managed or controlled in that country, in Apple's . view. The company can legally shift profits to its different operations, which results in it paying less tax. Apple's . arrangement has allowed it to pay just 1.9 per cent tax on its $37billion in overseas profits in 2012, despite the fact that the average . tax rate for countries in its main markets was 24 per cent last year, the report. The . subcommittee's report estimates that Apple avoided at least $3.5 billion . in US taxes in 2011 and $9 billion in 2012 by using the tactic. Apple says it complies with the law and pays 'an extraordinary amount' of tax. Tax efficient: The Starbucks logo is seen in the window of one of its coffee shops. Huge payments to overseas subsidiaries meant it recorded a loss, helping it to avoid paying tax for a fourth year in a row . Starbucks has reportedly handed over just £8.6 million in corporation tax in 14 years of trading in Britain, although it has since agreed to pay £20 million after the public outcry. And Google reportedly paid just £7.3million in corporation tax on sales of £3billion. Tax experts say the figure should have been at least £200million higher. Vodafone has recently made a multi-million pound settlement with HM Revenue & Customs in the wake of a dispute over the tax it had paid in Britain. Telecoms giant: Despite employing no staff for five years in Dublin, Vodafone took advantage of Ireland's generous corporate tax rate to record a £324million annual turnover last month . The information was revealed after it was reported that the company ran an Irish subsidiary from a satellite office in Dublin for tax purposes. Employing no staff for five years, the telecoms giant took advantage of Ireland’s generous corporate tax rate to record a £324million annual turnover collecting royalty payments for the use of its brand.","European Commission demands answers on countries' tax rules .

"Floyd Mayweather is the blueprint for boxers intent on becoming a world champion. But Amir Khan will soon be the one signposting the path to superstardom, starting with a command performance against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday. So says Khan’s trainer. Amir Khan prepares for his bout with Devon Alexander in Sin City . The British boxer undergoes some stretches during a workout session . Khan underwent an open workout session at the MGM Grand ahead of Saturday night's big fight . Khan is greeted by Oscar De La Hoya as he arrives at the MGM Grand for his workout . Khan stands in front of a billboard for his fight against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas . Khan takes part in a jump rope and shadow boxing session as he finishes preparation for Saturday's fight . Virgil Hunter believes welterweight Khan is on the brink of superseding Mayweather, explaining: ‘Amir is one of our elite boxers. He has just two more levels to ascend. ‘The first is to prove that he is on the way to greatness. I expect him to do that against Alexander. ‘The second is to establish himself as truly great.’ The unspoken conclusion to the equation is that Khan can take that final step by becoming the man who puts an end to Mayweather’s unbeaten record. Yet even if that fight still fails to materialise, Hunter expects Khan to become the planet's No 1 fighting man. Khan takes a well-deserved breather during the grueling training session on Wednesday . Khan listens to trainer Virgil Hunter during his training session on the running track . To begin validating that lofty prediction, he rationalises the three defeats in Khan’s career as simply unfortunate, saying: ‘No-one beats Amir. They just get a little lucky.’ Here’s how: . On Breidis Prescott, Hunter said: 'Amir should never have been thrown into that fight. Too early. He was a boy against a man and ran onto a big punch.' On Lamont Peterson, Hunter insisted: 'That was a fight with it’s own issues (including the question of drugs). Remember the officiating. Even after that odd deduction of two points he should have been given the decision.' And on Danny Garcia, Hunter explained: 'Amir was giving him a shellacking until he got careless and was caught by one huge shot.’ So what about that much derided Khan chin? ‘The problem when he went down was that his positioning was all over the place and he was too carried away with throwing big punches of his own.’ Khan was pictured deep in discussion with his trainer ahead of Saturday's important showdown . Khan is aided by his brother Haroon shortly after completing a training session on the track in Las Vegas . Khan should have fought Alexander a year ago, before the American lost his world title which has ended up in the possession of another Brit, Khan’s would-be rival Kell Brook.‘ . Yet Hunter welcomes the year of ring inactivity during Khan’s vain wait for a Mayweather fight. He says: ‘I don’t believe in ring rustiness as long as the boxer keeps working in the gym. In fact the delay has given us a chance to reconstruct Amir the way he should have been built in the first place.’ Hunter has gone through a similar period with his first outstanding prodigy, Andre Ward, who was rated the third best pound-for-pound fighter in the world before injury and a legal dispute rendered him fight-idle. Hunter expects Ward to return to world title action soon, even greater. ‘If you are going to be the dominant fighter in your division,’ says Hunter, ‘you should win fights which everyone expects to be difficult – easily. ‘Andre did that before and will do so again. Mayweather does it. Amir will do it against Alexander. Both he and Andre have their best years ahead of them. Amir is already a man to be reckoned with. Khan is confident of beating Alexander and hopes to take on unbeaten Floyd Mayweather next year . Khan also trained in the ring at the Roy Jones Jnr gym in preparation for the clash with Alexander . The 28-year-old appeared in good spirits throughout the routine ahead of his fight at the MGM Grand . ‘He has all the physical attributes for greatness. Now, at 28, married and with his first child he has gained in maturity. The mentality for greatness is coming. ‘Mayweather has proved that to be recognised as the best and to be the highest earner you don’t have to go out to entertain the fans.’ And to those back in England who will raise eyebrows at this lavish praise for Khan, Hunter draws upon a football analogy: ‘In soccer you don’t have to be the one who kicks the ball hardest and furthest. People admire the player with the most skill, the one who does things with the ball that others cannot. ‘In boxing, that person now is Mayweather. Soon it can be Khan.' As the burden of expectation builds on Khan’s shoulders, so the bar keeps being raised. Hunter expects him to hurdle that barrier, in style, saying: ‘Amir has found his own identity now. He has established clearly in is mind who he wants to be. The best.’ *Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night .","Amir Khan takes on Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand on Saturday .

"When Timour Wielemans' £400 mountain bike was stolen two days before he went away to university, he thought he'd never see it again. The 18-year-old, who faced a 90-minute walk home after his bike was taken on Wednesday, had just one day left working in Cambridge before starting university in Warwick. But yesterday he was back at work, selling punting tickets just where his locked bike had been stolen from, when he spotted a youth cycling past on his bike. Scroll down for video . Timour Wielemans, pictured running, centre, saw a youth pedal past on his bike a day after it was stolen . While one of Timour's colleagues called the police, left, the Belgian student remonstrated with the man riding it . Timour, pictured to the left of the cyclist, said: 'He didn't look too clever but he did look pretty aggressive' And instead of looking nervous, he was chatting coolly on his mobile as he freewheeled past. Timour said: 'I was on the street selling tickets for the punts when I saw him.  I was shocked, then I realised I had to do something. 'I just dropped everything and ran after him and stopped the bike.  I asked him 'Did you steal my bike?' 'He probably didn't expect me to see him. 'He was about 100metres away from where the bike was stolen from.' Colleagues from the punting company gave chase, too, and helped Timour grab his bike back while one called police. The student, who is from Belgium, said: 'He didn't look too clever but he did look pretty aggressive and quite angry. 'If my colleagues hadn't turned up, he could have hit me.'

"Jamie Carragher says Liverpool must forget about Luis Suarez and get their new strikers firing instead. The Reds have got off to a poor start to campaign without the Uruguayan following his summer switch to Barcelona, while they have also missed the injured Daniel Sturridge.

"Craig Kieswetter is facing a battle to save his career after being ruled out for the whole of next year with the serious eye injury he suffered last season. The Somerset keeper-batsman, only last week named in England’s provisional World Cup squad, will be missing indefinitely after struggling to regain the vision needed to perform at the highest level. It is another harsh reminder of the dangers inherent in cricket, with the sport still reeling from the death of Phillip Hughes after he, like Kieswetter, was struck on the head after mistiming a pull shot while batting in a first-class game. Craig Kieswetter posted this picture on Twitter just after he had been hit by a bouncer at Northants . Kieswetter is hit in the eye by David Willey's delivery after it goes through his grille in July . Kieswetter’s injury came in July when he damaged his eye socket and cheekbone and broke his nose when a ball from Northamptonshire’s David Willey smashed through his helmet grille. He posted horrific pictures of his injuries on Twitter but was fit enough to resume his career towards the end of the season. Problems re-emerged during the recent South African domestic Twenty20 tournament and he will now undergo further specialist rehabilitation. A Somerset statement admitted that it was ‘unlikely’ that Kieswetter, 27, would be fit for the 2015 domestic season while chief executive Guy Lavender confirmed to Sportsmail that ‘we just don’t know’ when the South African-born player would be fit again. The Somerset star charted his original recovery on social media, here giving a thumbs up in hospital . Kieswetter uses hilotherapy to try to aid his recovery after the operation . Matt Maynard, the new Somerset director of cricket, admitted the extent of concern over Kieswetter when he said: ‘This is clearly worrying news for Craig and his health and well-being are paramount in our minds. ‘We will continue to support him during his treatment and rehabilitation and hope to see him return to playing as soon as possible.’ Kieswetter, who has made 46 one-day international appearances for England, said: ‘It’s really disappointing but my eye is not a hundred per cent and this is critical in maintaining the levels of performance that I expect of myself. ‘I need to make every effort to resolve the matter and have the best specialist help in that regard.’ Kieswetter donned the gloves when England won the World Twenty20 in the Caribbean in 2010 . The news will further increase scrutiny on the effectiveness of helmets and add pressure on manufacturers to come up with more improvements as they seek to reduce the risks involved in facing a heavy ball propelled at speed. And it is a huge blow to Somerset, who lost Jos Buttler to Lancashire after plumping for Kieswetter as their No1 keeper in all cricket last year. In the short term Kieswetter, one of the most effective Twenty20 hitters in the game, has been ruled out of Australia’s Big Bash and has seen any remote hopes he had of featuring in England’s final World Cup squad disappear. More importantly, at 27, he faces a fight to see whether he will ever be able to recover sufficiently to take his place back at Taunton again.","Craig Kieswetter suffered eye injury five months ago playing for Somerset .

The Villa boss will wait until the morning of the game to decide whether the 25-year-old can play, although his hand may be forced by the absence of Ashley Westwood and Fabian Delph.

"There is some weight behind the notion that this has been Birmingham City’s best week for almost four years. If hitting Reading for six wasn’t encouraging enough, the resignation of the unpopular director Peter Pannu ought to have made it so. Not since the Carling Cup win at Wembley against Arsenal have such broad smiles been seen on the faces of Blues in the second city. They have been a club whose recent history is entrenched in misery and financial ruin, brought about by Carson Yeung’s disastrous ownership from 2009, and Pannu has always been seen as the chairman’s sidekick. It was he who assumed the acting role when Yeung relinquished himself of duties at the club ahead of being sentenced to a six-year jail term for money laundering in March. Birmingham City director Peter Pannu (right, next to Carson Yeung) resigned from the club last week . Demarai Gray had a game to remember as he bagged a hat-trick against Reading . Young winger Gray celebrates with team-mates after helping Birmingham thrash Reading 6-1 . It is under the watch of this pair that the Blues have seen a trail of destruction follow them, with a transfer embargo issued in 2012 and accounts filed late. The club suffered, a shadow of the one to spend seasons in the Premier League and a ground, St Andrew’s, that home fans didn’t want to visit. Many simply didn’t bother. They have been under the control of Panos Pavlakis, who has operated as the club’s managing director, amid the upheaval in September when Pannu’s five-year contract was up. Birmingham have been sleepwalking into the lower leagues after serial neglect, but there appears to be a chink of light. Pannu’s departure - barely recognised by the club, who issued a statement made up of two paragraphs on Friday - comes in the aftermath of threatening comments he allegedly made to a fans’ website and author of a book about the club, also suggesting financial ruin wasn’t far away. Supporters remain worried that he could come back with a vengeance. Gary Rowett has instilled a brighter environment since taking over from the maligned Lee Clark . Pannu is up for re-election of the club’s parent company, Birmingham International Holdings (BIH), on December 23 and, if successful, could still have a huge role to play when the club eventually changes hands. The Blues Trust have set up a petition in a bid to voice concern to BIH shareholders, claiming: ‘From a lack of communication with supporters to the excessive remuneration package he received while acting chairman of the club, Pannu showed not only a lack of basic leadership, but also a lack of respect for the club’s true custodians – the fans. Yeung - who bought the club in 2009 - was jailed for six years after being found guilty of money laundering . Pannu (third from right) alongside Yeung in 2009 in happier times for supporters of the Blues . ‘We believe that the re-election of Peter Pannu will see the return of these issues. Thus, as supporters, we must act to ensure that this does not happen – for the best interests of BCFC.’ And they’ve far more chance of uniting against the systematic decline of their club while results improve dramatically. That boils down to one man: Gary Rowett. Appointed manager after Lee Clark left in October, the former full back has overseen four wins from his seven games in charge, losing just once. That includes the drubbing dished out to hapless Reading at the weekend, thanks to a hat-trick from 18-year-old local boy Demarai Gray - only the second time they have scored more than four goals in a league fixture since January 2006. For the record, Jiri Jarosik, Matthew Upson, Jermaine Pennant, David Dunn and Mikael Forssell all scored in a 5-0 win against Portsmouth that day. How times change. Paul Caddis scored the opening goal for Birmingham on Saturday as they thumped the hapless Royals . But now Rowett, widely regarded as one of the brightest young prospects in management after impressing at Burton Albion, has Birmingham playing with panache again, and the enjoyment is back. So too are the fans. St Andrew’s is a place people actually want to visit nowadays and the Blues have a boss who is passionate about his job; not embarrassingly storming down the touchline after escaping relegation to League One on the final day kind of passion, the sort which has people hanging on his every word. That coupled with the potentially for fans to get their way and Pannu isn’t re-elected later this month, the situation really looks as if it is for turning. Good week for... YEOVIL . The Glovers warmed up for their FA Cup replay against Accrington Stanley by thumping League One play-off chasers Oldham 4-0 at Boundary Park. It was a family affair as Yeovil boss Gary Johnson got the better of his son Lee's upwardly mobile side. The Glovers had only scored 14 goals in the entire season beforehand and are now a couple of points off safety. Leyton Orient's Adam Legzdins cant prevent Peterborough United's Erhun Oztumer from scoring the winner . Bad week for... LEYTON ORIENT . Another defeat, this time at the hands of Darren Ferguson’s Peterborough United at home, means Orient have lost seven of their last 10 in all competitions. New manager Fabio Liverani has quite the job on his hands, marooned in the bottom four. Talent scout: JORDAN COOK (Walsall) Two goals and an assist isn’t a bad return for the 24-year-old as Walsall beat Barnsley, but watch out for Cook’s first - the striker smashed home a half-volley direct from a corner on the edge of the box.","Birmingham beat Reading 6-1 at the weekend to move clear of trouble .

"Kate Moss looks fantastic in wellies — and so does my 14-year-old niece. So why do I always resemble a flat-footed troll when I pull on my ancient black pair? According to Sarah Longthorn, founder of fashion brand Wedge Welly, my mistake is that my welly wardrobe is woefully out of date. ‘Choosing the right pair of rubber boots is as important as finding that perfect leather pair,’ she says. ‘All of us want wellies that make us feel good, especially in a long winter.’ So wellies, it seems, are no longer just a practical choice for country walks and gardening. They can be fashionable, too. Newly informed, here is my pick of this winter’s selection on the High Street . . . Scroll down for video . Original tall high heel boot, £135, Hunterboots.com . A welly with a high heel. Are they mad? But that’s what Hunter has come up with this autumn. The towering rubber boots, which raise you 4in above the mud, are surprisingly flattering and make feet look tiny and almost cartoon like. That’s something your average welly never does. But I felt self-conscious in them and they’re not very comfortable because my foot slid forward. In fact, they made me totter, so I didn’t risk a dog walk. If you’re planning to stride out in these at Glastonbury next summer, let’s hope the heels don’t get stuck in the mud. 2/5 . Lady Bainbridge quilted wellies, £60, Regatta.com . If, like me, you get chilly feet then this faux fur lined pair are a canny choice. Though cosy, they’re elegant and sturdy enough for a country romp. I love the chestnut brown colour and the quilted upper fits snugly. Looked great with jeans, skirts or dresses. 5/5 . Floral calf wellington boots, £13, Asda.com . Bring a splash of colour to jeans or trousers. They hit mid-calf, which is not flattering with skirts, but are snug on the foot. Good value, though the rubber is quite thin and wrinkles when you walk. 4/5 . Original tall wellingtons, £90, Hunterboots.com . Favoured by the fashion set, they make short legs look elongated.

A welly that looks like a winter boot. A smart choice for trudging to work. Fits the leg well. 4/5 . Longboat wellies, £39.95, seasaltcornwall.co.uk . Flattering length, good fit and the washable red laces are stylish. They look good with a skirt. 5/5 . Heeled welly, £35, Wedgewelly.co.uk .

Red Herring leopard-print rubber wellies, £35, Debenhams.com . The print is bang on trend and looks great with jeans. Go down a size for the best fit or wear thick socks. Wide at the top, but adjustable. 3.5/5 . Biker wellies, £55, Boden.co.uk . Buckles and pink zip detail show potential, but they are not chunky enough to pass as a biker boot.

"It may not lead to Star Trek teleportation, but researchers have revealed a major breakthrough in quantum teleportation. Researchers succeeded in teleporting information about the quantum state of a photon, a particle of light, over 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) of optical fiber to a crystal 'memory bank,' setting a new record of distance traveled in this manner. The research could have implications for cryptography, which involves transmitting information securely, including communications between Earth and spacecraft. This image shows crystals used for storing entangled photons, which behave as though they are part of the same whole. Scientists used these crystals in their process of teleporting the state of a photon across more than 15 miles (25 kilometers) of optical fiber. Nasa has NOT developed Star Trek's 'transporter' 'Our experiment is fundamentally different than Star Trek's transporter. 'The transporter teleports matter by converting matter into a signal for transport, and then converting the signal back to matter at some other location. 'We teleported properties of light, so our experiment cannot lead to the transporter in the future. 'It is not inconceivable that one might teleport the quantum state of macroscopic material objects, but this would require that a clump of matter in the right shape would be waiting to receive the quantum state. 'Our experiment has no implications for travel through spacetime, which would require creating Einstein-Rosen bridges (aka wormholes).' The new research co-authored by Francesco Marsili, microdevices engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, makes use of this phenomenon in a technological advancement published in the journal Nature Photonics. The previous record in optical fiber was 3.7 miles (6 kilometers). This complex phenomenon is called 'quantum teleportation.' The research could have implications for cryptography, which involves transmitting information securely, including communications between Earth and spacecraft. 'We can imprint the state of a system on another system, even when the two are far apart,' Marsili said. 'Using this effect in communications could help in building an intrinsically secure space communication network -- i.e., communication channels that cannot be hacked.' Marsili and colleagues at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder, Colorado, developed devices that can detect single particles of light, called photons. 'It's hard to detect a single photon, so you need to make a sensitive detector,' he said. 'Here at JPL, in collaboration with NIST, we developed the most sensitive detector in the world.' 'In an entangled system, each part is connected to one another in a fundamental way, such that any action performed on a part of the entangled system has an effect on the whole entangled system,' Marsili said. Quantum teleportation doesn't mean someone can pop from New York to San Francisco instantaneously, but it seems like science fiction in the sense that the state of a particle (photon P) is destroyed at one location but imprinted on another remote system (photon B) without the two particles ever interacting. Another crucial piece of this story is that Bob has a specific crystal, which serves as a memory bank, for storing his entangled photon and serving as the recipient of the quantum state. The researchers reached the record distance of 15.5 miles (25 kilometers) between 'Alice' and 'Bob' thanks to the ultrasensitive detectors developed at JPL-NIST. Nasa engineers created this helful guide and cartoon to explain the complex system: . How quantum teleportation works is complicated, but an analogy for the principle behind it may help: Let's say there are two people, Alice and Bob. Alice wants Bob to have a photon that's in the same 'state' as her photon, which we'll call photon P. For the sake of this analogy, we'll pretend that the 'state' is a color, and photon P is yellow. A third person named Charlie sends out two entangled photons, photon A to Alice and photon B to Bob, which behave as if they are part of the same whole. Both of these photons start out as blue. Alice's two photons, P, which is yellow, and A, which is blue, 'collide.' Alice measures the photons as they annihilate one another. Although P and A are destroyed in the crash, P's yellow color is preserved. Because photon A and photon B are entangled, the yellow color is 'teleported' to B. But in order to get photon B to become yellow, as photon P originally was, Alice needs to send Bob two bits of information to B the 'classical' way - for example, by sending pulses of light over an optical fiber. 'When Alice measures the state of her photon, Bob's photon changes state as well, as if flipping a switch,' Marsili said. 'But Bob cannot know how the switch flipped unless Alice sends him the bits of information classically.' Bob does not know that his photon has changed to yellow without that additional information. 'Reaching this distance could not have been possible without the JPL NIST detectors,' said Félix Bussières at the University of Geneva, Switzerland, who is the lead author of the study. Quantum teleportation can be used to make systems, such as bank accounts, more secure over longer distances. This is also important to preventing attacks on communication channels in space. 'If you're communicating with your astronauts on Mars, you don't want to have hackers break the encrypted channel and give them false information,' Marsili said. The California Institute of Technology manages JPL for NASA.","Breakthrough has implications for cryptography .

"A photo series shows the physical transformation and aging of a group of four sisters over four decades. The images, taken by Nicholas Nixon, are currently on display at the Museum of Modern Art in the exhibit 'Nicholas Nixon: Forty Years of the Brown Sisters.' The exhibit runs through January 4. Nixon first photographed the four women - including his own spouse - in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out, a page for the exhibit says. Nixon told The Guardian last month 'The series grew out of boredom. We’d go down to visit [my wife] BeBe’s parents on weekends. Sisters: Nicholas Nixon first photographed Heather, Mimi, Bebe and Laurie in 1974 but did not like the way the photo turned out. The next year, though, he did like a picture he took of the siblings. The 1975 photo is seen here . Standing together: The four sisters are seen posing together in 1978 . 'It was kind of boring, a lot of socializing, we were expected to show up for dinner every day... Out of a friendly desperation, I said: ‘Let’s take a picture.' Nixon liked a 1975 picture he took of the siblings, however. Mimi was 15, Laurie was 21, Heather was 23, and Brown's wife Bebe was 25, the MOMA's exhibit page says. Nixon has two children with Bebe. 'It was after this second successful picture that the group agreed to gather annually for a portrait, and settled on the series’ two constants: the sisters would always appear in the same order—from left to right, Heather, Mimi, Bebe, and Laurie—and they would jointly agree on a single image to represent a given year,' the exhibit page explains. 'We are all aware of time passing and us not being aware of it while it’s passing,' Nixon told The Guardian. 'So seeing the sisters, for a lot of people, gives them a reliable marker that a year has passed.' Passage of time: Heather, Mimi, Bebe and Laurie are seen next to one another in 1988 . Still here: The Brown sisters look into Nicholas Nixon's camera in this 1999 shot . Nixon spoke about the photo series with The Huffington Post last August. He said at the time 'It didn't really get serious until the next year [1975], the year of Laurie—the woman on the right's—college graduation. And that's when I took the second one, and kind of on a whim, said let's do it in the same order. 'So it was having two pictures in my hand, and the year space between them that gave me the idea that it would be really interesting to do it forever. And so I asked them if we could. And they all laughed at me and said sure. 'We joke about it. But everybody knows that certainly my intention would be that we would go on forever no matter what. To just take three, and then two, and then one. The joke question is what happens if I go in the middle. I think we'll figure that out when the time comes. Being an only child, it was really gratifying and lovely to be embraced by this family. There's still a ground water of affection, and support. I look back at these thirty-some pictures and it's like they're of my sisters. I can feel myself getting old with them. And I'm part of them; they're part of my love.' All together: The Brown sisters embrace one another in the 2014 photograph taken by Nicholas Nixon .

"A woman who has accused Bill Cosby of sexually assaulting her in the 1970s filed a defamation lawsuit Wednesday against the comedian, alleging he 'publicly branded' her a liar through statements made by his lawyer and publicist. Tamara Green said in the lawsuit filed in federal court in Springfield that Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was an aspiring model and singer. She said Wednesday that she hoped the lawsuit would help her finally establish the truth about what happened. Green first spoke publicly about the alleged attack in 2005. After she did media interviews, Cosby's lawyer and publicist made statements intended to expose her to public contempt and ridicule, she said in her lawsuit. Scroll down for video . Plaintiff: Tamara Green, seen Wednesday in a video link during a press conference, is alleging Bill Cosby  'publicly branded' her a liar through statements made by his lawyer and publicist . Comedian: Bill Cosby, 77, is the only defendant in the defamation suit filed by Tamara Green. He has never been charged in connection with any sexual assault allegations . The attorney, Walter M. Phillips Jr., declined to comment. He said he represented Cosby in 2005, but no longer does so. Messages left for the publicist, David Brokaw, weren't immediately returned. Cosby, who is 77 and has a home in Shelburne Falls in western Massachusetts, is the lawsuit's only defendant. The comedian has never been charged in connection with any sexual assault allegations. In 2005, he settled a civil case filed by Andrea Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia. Green was one of a dozen women who were prepared to testify in Constand's lawsuit that Cosby sexually assaulted them. Through his representatives, Cosby has denied renewed allegations by women alleging decades-old assaults. Green's attorney, Joseph Cammarata, held a news conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, and Green appeared at it via video. She said it was important for her to prove that she is not lying. 'All of this time, there's always been a slight doubt in everyone's mind as to the veracity of any of the allegations that have been made against Bill Cosby because he's a rich and powerful and famous man,' Green said. 'So this will give me and other women if they take advantage of this opportunity ... this will give us a chance to go to a forum where we will speak our stories and tell our truth. And the most important thing is that Bill Cosby will be required to appear in court and to speak, and he will finally be heard.' Attorney: Joseph Cammarata, Green's attorney, said Wednesday that 'This lawsuit provides an opportunity for Ms. Green and Mr. Cosby to litigate the truth or falsity of the comments' Legal action: The lawsuit against Cosby seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages . Cammarata said the criminal statute of limitations has expired for Green and Cosby's other accusers. He said he has another client who will likely join the lawsuit. 'This lawsuit provides an opportunity for Ms. Green and Mr. Cosby to litigate the truth or falsity of the comments,' Cammarata told The Associated Press. Martin Singer, a Los Angeles attorney who has represented Cosby in the recent round of allegations, said of Green's lawsuit: 'We are very confident that we will prevail in this proceeding and we will pursue claims against the attorneys who filed this action.' The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. Green's lawsuit says that after she met Cosby through a mutual friend in 1969 or 1970, he asked for her to raise money from investors for a new club he wanted to open. She said she called Cosby on an unspecified date in the early 1970s to tell him that she was not feeling well. Cosby then invited Green to meet him for lunch at a Los Angeles restaurant, according to the lawsuit. Alleged assault: Green (seen in 1970) has alleged Cosby gave her pills, causing to her become dizzy. Cosby drugged Green 'into this altered state, in order to facilitate his later sexual assault,' the lawsuit says . Alleged encounter: Green said she repeatedly told Cosby, 'you're going to have to kill me' in an attempt to stop him. Cosby didn't stop until Green upending a table lamp, the lawsuit states . Green said that during lunch, Cosby offered her some red and grey pills, telling her they were over-the-counter cold medicine. Green took the pills and soon began feeling weak and dizzy, according to the lawsuit. Cosby drugged Green 'into this altered state, in order to facilitate his later sexual assault,' the lawsuit states. Green said Cosby drove her home. Once inside her apartment, he undressed both of them, then 'digitally penetrated her,' her lawsuit states. Green said she repeatedly told Cosby, 'you're going to have to kill me' in an attempt to stop him. Cosby didn't stop until Green upending a table lamp, the lawsuit states. Cosby put two $100 bills on a coffee table when he left her apartment, she said. Green's lawsuit alleges that after she appeared on 'Today' and did an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer in 2005, Cosby, through Phillips, responded by saying that Cosby did not know Green, that her allegations were 'absolutely false' and that the alleged attack 'did not happen in any way, shape or form.' 'Thus by innuendo and effect, Defendant Cosby publicly branded Plaintiff Green a liar,'  the lawsuit states. The lawsuit makes similar claims against Brokaw for statements he made in February after Newsweek magazine published an interview with Green.","Tamara Green said in the lawsuit  that Bill Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was an aspiring model and singer .

"A crime  boss and his henchmen have been jailed for 17 years between them after marching to a rival's family home armed with imitation guns and baseball bats. A mother and two children ran upstairs and screamed after they saw 41-year-old Simon Thirlwall Senior and his associates driving in convoy to their house in Guisborough, Teesside. The revenge attack was the climax of a string of spats between Thirwall and  Sidney Kellam Hodgson, which saw Thirwall threaten to kill his rival and 'take his head off', Teesside Crown Court heard. Attack: Simon Thirlwell senior (left) led three men including his son Aaron, 22 (right) to a rival's home armed with guns and baseball bats, where a mother and two children who were inside ran upstairs and screamed . Henchmen: Steven Bremner (left) was jailed for four years and David Richardson (right) was jailed for two years and eight months. Teesside Crown Court heard they were 'recruited' by the crime boss . Thirwall and his son Aaron, 22, were both jailed yesterday alongside two men he recruited for the attack, 23-year-old Steven Bremner and 25-year-old David Richardson. The court heard the Thirlwall family was part of an 'organised crime group' and the four defendants had 167 previous offences between them. They had amassed tens of thousands of pounds without working or claiming benefits. The gang believed the Hodgson family had been 'bad-mouthing' them and there was a string of 'tit-for-tat exchanges' at homes on both sides, said prosecutor Richard Bennett. In one skirmish Thirlwall senior had threatened to kill Mr Hodgson and 'take his head off', while Bremner had brandished an axe and pointed a gun, threatening: 'You’re going in the ground.' The tensions reached their peak on the night of October 7 last year, when the gang drove in convoy in a bid to find Mr Hodgson at his home. Hunt: Armed police raid a house in Guisborough, where the attack happened, while the men were on the run . Smashed: The four men all denied going inside the house (picture) despite admitting violent disorder . Mr Hodgson’s partner ran upstairs to protect her children when she saw about 10 men running to the house, the court was told. Simon Thirlwall and Bremner carried realistic imitation firearms while Aaron Thirlwall had a baseball bat, the court heard. Mr Bennett said the front door was forced open and Simon Thirlwall came in shouting: 'Where is he? I’m going to kill him'. Aaron Thirlwall smashed windows and men searched the house while the children screamed. Terrifying: One of the knives which was recovered after the attack on October 7 last year . Simon Thirlwall then chased Mr Hodgson into the nearby hills in a black Range Rover, the court heard, and rammed his BMW X5. The four then drove home, later dumping a white Transit van, a knife-axe, machete and clothes. Following the attack, the gang members fled Teesside after retrieving £69,000 in cash which they had hidden under a paving slab behind Aaron Thirlwall's home. Officers traced them and discovered imitation shotguns, a Samurai sword and a knuckleduster-handled knife in bins near their houses. Simon Thirlwall was arrested at a Leeds hotel with £49,415 in wet and dirty notes in a bin bag four days later. Police also found £1,015 cash in a caravan where he had been lying low. Aaron Thirlwall, meanwhile, was caught hiding £18,890 in a wardrobe. All four men admitted violent disorder and the Thirlwall two also admitted money-laundering. Michael Bosomworth, defending Simon Thirlwall, said the trouble arose out of a misunderstanding about an overheard insult. His client went 'tooled up' to 'scare the hell' out of Mr Hodgson, but now regretted his crime. All four men still denied going in the house, the court heard, but Mr Bosomworth said: 'There is no place, whatever the motivation, in any society let alone a quiet place like Guisborough for this sort of gang activity.' Nigel Soppitt, for Aaron Thirlwall, said he did not accept the court's version of events that he had a bat and 'didn’t do a great deal'. The dad-of-three was hoping to work offshore and become a good role model to his three children, one of whom was born while he was remanded in custody, the court heard. Dan Cordey, representing Bremner, said he had gained qualifications in prison and was determined to lead a decent, law-abiding life. Rod Hunt, for Richardson, said he had led a 'feckless' life and proved a drunk and 'not very good' henchman, leaving his own blood at the scene and in the van. Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC jailed Simon Thirlwall, from Guisborough, for six years. He told him: 'It was you who recruited the others. 'You are undoubtedly the head of a criminal organisation. You clearly make money from serious crime.' Convicted drug dealer Aaron Thirlwall, also from Guisborough, was jailed for four years and five months. Threatening: Police also found 'realistic' imitation shotguns, pictured, in the wake of the attack . Bremner, a convicted heroin dealer from Grangetown who had been out of prison for just three days, was jailed for four years. Richardson, from nearby Eston, was jailed for two years and eight months. The case could only be reported after the end of a wounding trial involving Mr Hodgson. Judge Bourne-Arton added: 'You four went around to Mr Hodgson’s house mob-handed and with a determination to exact revenge and violence upon him. 'It matters not what the complaint was that you had against him, what manner of man he is or was. 'The court will not tolerate the actions of criminals seeking to bring their grievances out on to the street. 'Either this was all about your criminal activity, as I suspect, or over something of a slight which is of no consequence whatsoever. It matters not.' He added: 'You were completely driven by your own pursuit of revenge.'","Simon Thirlwall, 41, recruited his son and two others for revenge attack .

"Cosmic dust may have ruined an attempt to detect what happened in the first billionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. The discovery was made in March when scientists believed they had glimpsed a very brief moment at the beginning of everything when the universe expanded - a theory called cosmic inflation. But the incredible find was soon dismissed by . other research groups who thought the Harvard Bicep team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy. Scroll down for video . Gravitational waves from cosmic inflation generate a faint but distinctive twisting pattern in the universe. Shown here is the pattern observed with the Bicep2 telescope, providing what was thought at the time to be evidence for cosmic inflation after the Big Bang. The results have now been called into question . Scientists view the the universe as being made up of a 'fabric of space-time'. This corresponds to Einstein's General Theory of Relativity which was published 1916. Objects in the . universe bend this fabric, and more massive objects bend it more. Gravitational waves are considered ripples in this fabric. They can be produced for instance, when black holes orbit each other or by the merging of galaxies. Gravitational waves are also thought to have been produced during the Big Bang. Now, that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by the European Agency’s Planck satellite. Their research suggests the part of the sky observed by the Bicep team had more cosmic dust than had previously been estimated. It builds on two other independent studies that suggest the twisting patterns thought to be something known as 'gravitational waves' from the early universe could just as easily be . accounted for by the dust. While this is another blow to the Bicep team’s findings, it doesn’t mean their work is completely wrong.  Bicep and Planck teams are now working together for a final assessment to be released by next year. Scientists, from left, Clem Pryke, Jamie Bock, Chao-Lin Kuo and John Kovac smile during a news conference at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to announced their groundbreaking results on gravitational waves in March . The incredible find was soon dismissed by other research groups who thought the Harvard Bicep team in may have underestimated the effects of dust in the galaxy. Now, that explanation has been given more credit following a recent study by the European Agency's Planck satellite (pictured) Their research centered on a theory by that Albert Einstein when something very explosive happens it leaves ripples in space-time known as 'gravitational waves'. The very first gravitational waves can tell us about the birth of the universe . and scientists have discovered they leave imprints in cosmic microwave . background radiation - the afterglow of the Big Bang - as they pass . through space. The theory suggests that this initial spurt would have taken the infant universe from something infinitely small to something close to the size of a marble. Earlier this year experts believed they had seen these gravitational waves and hailed the experiment as a massive step forward - but admitted the theory needed more work. 'It's just unbelievable quite honestly,' Professor Peter Ade, who helped build the instrument that detected the waves, told MailOnline at the time. 'This is confirming what is, to me, a wacky idea.' This graphic shows the universe as it evolved from the Big Bang to now. Nasa scientists believe that the universe expanded from subatomic scales to the astronomical in just a fraction of a second after its birth . The finding by the Bicep2 telescope (pictured) in the South Pole could rank with the greatest discoveries about the universe over the last 25 years . For their research, astronomers scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the observations . A telescope at the south pole, called Bicep2 (Background Imaging of cosmic Extragalactic Polarisation) was used to search for evidence of gravitational waves. The instrument examines what is called the cosmic microwave background, the extremely weak radiation that pervades the universe. The background radiation is not precisely uniform. Like light, the relic radiation is polarised as the result of interacting with electrons and atoms in space. Computer models predicted a curl pattern in the radiation that would match what would be expected with the universe's inflation. It did this by detecting a subtle property of the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is radiation that was created in the Big Bang and originally discovered in 1964. Bicep2 measured the large-scale polarisation of this microwave radiation. Only primordial gravitational waves can imprint such a pattern, and only if they have been amplified by inflation. For their research, astronomers . scanned about two per cent of the sky for three years with a telescope . at the South Pole, chosen for its very dry air, to aid in the . observations. These observations have eluded scientists for decades because it’s difficult to separate the characteristic swirl of light created by gravitational waves, and the dust generated today by the Milky Way. The Bicep team hoped to overcome this by looking at cleanest part of the sky, over Antarctica, according to a BBC report by Jonathon Amos. But they failed to use the dust data compiled by Europe's Planck satellite, which had mapped the sky at many more frequencies than other satellites. The Planck team claims there is dust polarisation across areas of sky Bicep took a look at. 'It's possible, but the error in our measurement is quite high,' Planck scientist Dr Cécile Renault told BBC News. 'The conclusion really is that we need to analyse the data together - Bicep and Planck - to get the right cosmological [versus] galactic signal. It's really too early to say.' Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, or CMB for short, is a faint glow of light that fills the universe. Pictured is the microwave radiation from the whole sky, captured by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite . This image shows temperature fluctuations, indicated by variations in colour, of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).  Researchers say since the CMB is a form of light, it exhibits all the properties of light, including polarisation (shown by black lines). The changes in polarisation are thought to be caused by gravitational waves .","Using the Bicep2 telescope, scientists looked at specific patterns in light waves within the faint microwave glow left from the Big Bang .

"A judge who let a man who  held a knife to his wife's throat escape jail has come under fire after the defendant left court and boasted on Facebook: 'The c*** didn't win I'm free'. Anthony Bruce, 34, from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, made the comment on social media after being handed a suspended sentence at Teesside Crown Court by Judge George Moorhouse. Bruce had admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and a charge of witness intimidation at yesterday's hearing and was handed a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for 12 months. Anthony Bruce, 34, (left) from County Durham, boasted on Facebook that he was 'free' after Judge George Moorhouse (right) handed him a suspended sentence for assaulting his wife and intimidating a witness . Judge Moorhouse also ordered him to partake in an alcohol treatment order and made him the subject of a restraining order, but his judgement has been largely criticised by top police chiefs who have deemed the ruling as 'wholly wrong'. According to the Northern Echo, Bruce bit and tried to choke his partner when she spoke about them splitting up at their County Durham home in April last year. He also threatened to shoot her in the eye, before firing a pellet into her foot before she managed to escape. Days after he was arrested, Bruce rang her and said 'drop the charges or I will torch...' but she put the phone down before he could finish the threat, the newspaper report said. Two police crime commissioners and a domestic abuse charity have now criticised the judge for the 'lenient' sentence, with one calling for judges to be given more training. Ron Hogg, Durham's Police Crime Commissioner, said: 'This judgement totally beggars belief. It is astonishing considering what he has done.' Speaking about Bruce's foul-mouthed boasting on Facebook, Mr Hogg added: 'His response to getting off free is just outrageous. 'This is not justice in any way.' Vera Baird, Northumbria Police Crime Commissioner who, like Mr Hogg, has led a major campaign to tackle domestic violence, said the case showed that judges need more training. Judge Moorhouse, who handed Bruce the sentence at Teesside Crown Court (pictured), has come under fire for the 'lenient' sentence with police crime commissioners describing it as 'astonishing' and 'wholly wrong' She highlighted Judge Moorhouse's remarks where he reportedly said the defendant had not been in trouble for seven years. 'Domestic violence is a private crime, it's a secret crime and to say that the guy has behaved himself for seven years is a very poor reason for dealing with him leniently,' she said. 'We have no idea how he was behaving in the house. 'I think the judge has got it wholly wrong and we have to train our judges properly.' Clare Phillipson, director of Wearside Women in Need, said: 'I feel a combination of disbelief and fury.' She was shocked the witness intimidation charge alone did not warrant a jail sentence. 'On every level the judge has failed in his duty,' she said. The Crown Prosecution Service cannot appeal to the Attorney General about the leniency of the sentence. A CPS spokesman said: 'There is limited provision made within law for prosecutors to challenge a sentence which they believe to be an unduly lenient. 'However, there are strict guidelines on the type of cases that prosecutors can refer to the Attorney General's office for consideration. 'Section 47 assault and intimidation are both offences for which a referral would not be possible under existing legislation.'","Anthony Bruce boasted on Facebook after being given suspended sentence .
